The company forces you to pay their dollar per month fee to use such basic features as mass transit, etc. The cities built online cannot be accessed without an internet connection and active Planet Offer account, neither can the features you paid for. I short, you pay for, let&apos;s say, busses. But you are not allowed to keep them! You can only use them as long as you pay the monthly fee. The economic system is flawed, city services unrealistically expensive. Entertainment too expensive and not offset by patronage (like, say, in Tropico, where you can profit from your entertainment venues). Lots come in only two sizes, making your zones look more like something that came from the Borg than a human designer. Graphics are awesome, though riddled with bugs. I enjoy laying out the roads, though you cannot adjust the height and width of them as promised. Roads can curve, though the practice is rendered moot by the strictly rectangular lot shapes. To sum it up...they made much the same errors as Societies - focusing too much on &quot;realistic water&quot; and adding features no one really asked for or wanted. Focus needs to be on city design elements.

Then when they decide to let you have 8 different building types, there will be another charge. Game lacks any kind of mass transit, so your city ends up looking like a mentally challenged spider&apos;s web. The game lacks any depth. If you have a large city, it looks horrible because the same building will be in your skyline about 15 times. There is no rhyme or reason to how people move in.. You just build homes, then build jobs, or vise versa. Only one thing stops them from moving in, and its the other. Overall, its a paper-thin experience for the money. I paid full price for a game, I expect a full game. Its a shame what game companies are doing with this greedy micro-purchase format these days. If you want a shell of a game with minimal content that you&apos;ll breeze through in 15 minutes. By all means go for it. $49.99 for this is a crime.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl/user-reviews?user_review_id=86186">Expand</a></span>

They aren&apos;t quite right. You click &quot;Connection&quot; not &quot;Connect&quot; to connect to the server. It makes the Windows error sound when the connection _works_. Everything&apos;s just... not quite right. At the time I bought it, it&apos;s Meta-Score was high - like 85. Now I see it tumble, and can only add my little push to send it off the cliff.

                                        <span>An awesome citybuilder that, im sure, ill play for years. Its less complicated than SC4, while still being a challenge as opposed to plop-games like City Life. The MMO part is cool and adds a new feeling to the overall game experience, while not having too big of an impact. The only real downside is the monthly fee, but me and my friends are more than willing to pay the 7 bucks a month.</span>

Hello???? This is supposed to be a CITY BUILDING game??? This game has potential. But first - GIVE US THE TRAINS AND LEVEL OUT THE SINGLE PLAYER OR MMO PLAYER. Single play should not be dumbed down. Monte Cristo needs to seduce people into PO with EXTRA CARROTS, not punishing original SOLO user base with starvation STICKS. Passive aggression doesn&apos;t go down well with a niche market. Have long view Monte Cristo.

Cities XL is suppose to be a casual laid back game but micro management is still present, as you need to consider various categories of the population (unskilled, elites...) rather than just wealth levels (3 levels for simcity4). It also requires trading of resources which contradicts the companies aim to casualize the genre. The company also hopes player investment would complete core features in the game by requiring the player to purchase monthly subscriptions for buses, trains and subway features which would be released when complete. As for custom content, the reason how simcity 4 is still relevant in 2009, it is required of the content producer to pass it for Monte Cristo to review and distribute on their paid monthly plan. Graphics is good, however there is no scaffolding for buildings under construction. They pop out of the earth like a crayon being poked through a paper towel. Sounds are limited to UI and background music. There is no city sounds, meaning no aural indication of any life on your city. Over all, this is an unfinished product which completely fails to address the want of the simcity crowd as well as alienate casual gamers with it&apos;s odd design decisions. There&apos;s always been a debate whether or not a city building game can be of mass appeal. I believe with a intuitive interface together with opt-in automation, it can be. Monte Cristo&apos;s approach just straddles the fence, and thus failed to appeal to any informed crowd.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl/user-reviews?user_review_id=85667">Expand</a></span>

SC4 is much more superior in every way (with the exception of graphics). And yet, Monte Cristo hits you with ingame ads/sale pitches to make you go and get a subcription service to gain access to more content that should have been in the game in the first bloody place. To top in all off, it&apos;s buggy. They had more than a freaking year to develop the game. It is a rushed pre-beta in my eyes. It&apos;s a crap game. Don&apos;t even torrent it. It really is not worth it.

They had a strong base, but built poorly on top of it. I myself participated in the Beta, and was surprised at how buggy and un-done it was at that stage. It was slow, full of glitches, took up a lot of disk space, and the lack of additional features (transit, unlockables) made me feel like this is a freeware game, and that the developer not make the deadline of release. But, they pushed it out anyway, knowing the game feels as if its not even out of Beta. I left the Beta in the last month of testing after my cities got &quot;accidentally over written&quot; on the main server, and could not get restored. I never thought twice about buying the game ever after that. The fact the developers knowingly put out a bad product, but still make you pay for a subscription is absolutely lame and stupid. Hopefully the game will get better over time, with new patches and so on, but right now, its not done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl/user-reviews?user_review_id=743053">Expand</a></span>

Single play is possible, although with the trading being such a vital part and the NPC agent charging 4x what he pays you on resources, you can only go so far unless you play on a balanced map. Problems bugging me the most at this point: - No public transport. Yes, there is an icon for it in the menu, but it will have no feature until content update #3, which again you only get when subscribing for the PO - High maintainance leasure buildings which keep higher-class citizens unsatisfied no matter how many you build - Terraforming being level-only. No possiblity to create rivers, seas or mountains, once you&apos;ve leveled an area it&apos;s leveled for good - Often malfuctioning trade window, even offline - No inter-city trading amongst your own cities With time this game could blossom into something great, but I ain&apos;t holding my breath for it, especially not with the current attitude of having to pay extra for missing content. Apart from that the PO only offers chat and inter-player trading, which you practically only need to escape the insane prices of the NPC trader in offline mode.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl/user-reviews?user_review_id=85804">Expand</a></span>

In the SimCity series I always felt like my city was a living breathing organism. The sims were going about their daily lives and it was my job to look after them and give them a nice place to live. I feel absolutely no connection with the city I&apos;m building in Cities XL. There are no advisors, disasters or street level sound effects, and all the buildings seem generic. No graphs, no mass transit, no newspaper headlines, no saving up for a museum and feeling sorry for your citizens when you can&apos;t afford to keep it. It does have a few good ideas for reducing the more tedious micromanagement in SimCity 4 -- like the school bus funding radius -- but the whole thing feels too soulless to be any real fun. If I had just wanted to place 3D buildings and draw angled roads I would have downloaded Google SketchUp and saved myself the 50 bucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl/user-reviews?user_review_id=738663">Expand</a></span>

However, some of the confusing issues are partially down to some bugs which need fixing. Since it&apos;s release it has already had numerous hotfixes which one by one, are starting to improve the game. So, it at least is nice to know that the developers are working away to fix and improve on their game, which was likely a little early to be released. The online features of the game are interesting, and has an &quot;MMO&quot; feel to it with player trading and a chat box where most of the time, players seem very helpful with questions asked. The planet feature is also quite nice too. I am still not sure that the online features are enough to warrant paying a subscription for, but if things improve, I may consider having it. In the UK it costs &#xA3;11.95 for a 3 month sub, which, providing fixes and improvements continue, may be worth it. Overall, and early play aside, Cities XL is something worth looking at if you are interested in the genre, but don&apos;t expect to be blown away just yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl/user-reviews?user_review_id=86171">Expand</a></span>

After a week the response was that I could soon buy another key - although that wasn&apos;t implemented yet of course. No thanks... Looks nice but that&apos;s it. Have since bought SimCity 4 which at 1/4 of the cost is 4 x more fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl/user-reviews?user_review_id=737755">Expand</a></span>

Granted, the game lets you build some very attractive cities, but in terms of gameplay, it fails in a number of ways. My two biggest complaints are that the online multiplayer mode is essentially blackmail. It doesn&apos;t offer anything at all that warrants a subscription fee; being able to trade and visit other people&apos;s cities(without any gameplay value there) does not warrant a monthly fee. There are plenty of interesting ways in which cities could have interacted, but the best they could do was trading resources, which I&apos;m not sure why they couldn&apos;t have simply offered as a standard, no-fee feature. And because they have nothing to offer multiplayer players that&apos;s new or interesting, instead they have handicapped solo players arbitrarily by forcing them to use a totally broken trade system. They force you to deal with &apos;Omnicorp&apos; with whom you buy and sell at a 1/4 loss. One token sold to them is worth 2500, while buying a token from them is 10000, and at a city of 500,000, you are going to end up so deep in the red with resources that your city will be abysmal. Any other game would have allowed you to at least trade between your own solo cities, encouraging building multiple cities with different resources to trade and balance out. But again, because multiplayer doesn&apos;t offer anything but trading, solo play is arbitrarily handicapped. The result is that the only worthwhile maps in solo mode are the ones with the widest variety of resources, as having a large amount of resource A doesn&apos;t make up for having to buy resource B, C, D, and E from Omnicorp. So this renders a number of the maps pointless save for the sake of variety, if you don&apos;t mind kneecapping yourself. The only thing that the Planet Offer gives you is new buildings and new features. This could have(and should have) been done with DLC, like every other sane business plan. I would have happily continued paying reasonable DLC charges for new content, but I will not pay a monthly fee just to avoid having a handicapped solo game. I&apos;m not that much of a sucker. So more than any other game I have ever played, I feel ripped off, taken advantage of, and lied to. This game exists to snub you if you don&apos;t give them a monthly fee, for a game that has absolutely no business being a subscription-based game. Nevermind that the game is unfinished, buggy, and has a building UI that, while capable of creating some pretty cities, can be extraordinarily frustrating when roads are placed just a pixel too close so that you can&apos;t place a structure, and roads that try to snap to positions that don&apos;t make sense, etc, etc, etc, etc. Until they change their entire system and back down from this subscription fee thing, this is not a game worth getting unless you&apos;re fine with paying monthly fees for single player games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cities-xl/user-reviews?user_review_id=740617">Expand</a></span>

The graphics, in my opinion, does not even half graphics of simcity 4 even if it is superbly 3d. There is a lot more things it need befor it should have been released.</span>

If you wanted a sim city... you will be disapointed. This isn&apos;t about micromanaging the sewer system. This is about creating great looking cities.</span>

I got in on the beta, and most people bailed before the release. Monte Cristo was afraid to push back the release date in favor of completing the game. Could have used those few extra months in development.</span>
