If you think this is a fair price for a game please read on to find out why i disagree, but to sum it up: even selling an incomplete product at a discount is bound to make your customers angry. As other reviews mention, it crashes to desktop quite often and it will not let you log into your online account for hours on end sometimes without even give you an error message. Moreover, every patch will retroactively &quot;balance&quot; skills and items in a VERY DRAMATIC way (like cutting your damage or armour in HALF) and the game does not have ANY respec option, therefore it will screw up your build and leave you angry and frustrated, without any prior notice. There are several other signs of a half assed job: skill description of VERY IMPORTANT SKILLS were completely wrong for months and were not even corrected in the first half gig patch. (Example: something like an aura that lets you cast spell much faster is described as letting you cast spells MUCH SLOWER making it less attractive). Another sign: dangerously generic skill descriptions like &quot;WILL drastically INCREASE this or that&quot; without clarifying what &quot;drastically&quot; means, but when you decide to risk and get that skill you find out its really a minor change. Again no respec option so again you are screwed. In ascaron fantasy world, something that increase your skill 10% is a DRAMATIC INCREASE but curiously something that destroys your characted build and items due to retroactive changes is not even worth a word of warning or a respec. The quests are a lot but are either fetch quests or kill tasks, and even those have a bunch of problems including but not limited to: - the map will not update to show you where to go next on your quest leaving you guessing - one online boss could be bugged and become impossible to kill therefore blocking your progress in the story line I could go on and on for hours about all the problems of this game, but i rather cut this short. It is a zero because it is an unfinished buggy product STILL AFTER 2 PATCHES.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=420214">Expand</a></span>

With a better world layout (less dead ends, obstacles to endlessly run around due to the pseudo-freedom), better aggro/zoom ballance, more fluid gameplay and some form of clear path through the game this could be ok. 3/10 - not even worth stealing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=74990">Expand</a></span>

Sacred 2 is probably my favourite hack&apos;n&apos;slash RPG of all time. It has no competition in this genre in terms of open world, it doesn&apos;t hold your hand through a linear map like in other games. You really want to discover the whole world, there&apos;s an easter egg behind every corner. The graphics are great for that year and I feel like the game still looks more detailed than Diablo 3. Colors are much more vibrant which can be annoying at times (especially at the desert). The combat is fun, with many ways to customize your skills. The loot feels rewarding. The only downside that I can think of are the bugs on its release which by now are mostly patched.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=6098871">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a HUGE game with so much to do. I was looking for a top down, Diablo style game with tons of loot, beautiful graphics, interesting locations, skill trees and classes. I&apos;m loving this game and recommend it to anyone who is looking for the same.</span>

The dialogue and voice acting are deliciously absurd.  It&apos;s nice to a see a game that doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously.  Great sense of humor.  Fewer amount of skills and spells than other action RPG games, but really intuitive and it gives you a healthy diversity of play styles for each class.  Most of the fun comes from exploring on your own and doing side quests which can get tedious.  Main quests aren&apos;t bad either.  The camera, however, is atrocious.  The angle is such that you can&apos;t see very far ahead of you, making playing ranged characters especially frustrating.  Thankfully, the minimap is well detailed and easy to read which helps alleviate this problem.  Hugely addicting, pick up the gold edition if you have Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=2920049">Expand</a></span>

Nothing like spawing a demon only to have it chase you as well. Or to cause all monsters on the screen to attack one another.  Overall very nice game.</span>

That is it&apos;s biggest flaw that hurt it initially. The Devs have been hard at work and have fixed hundreds of bugs and already better balanced the game and fixed exploits within 60 days of the products retail release. The latest v2.34 Patch is great. Even so, that patch was delivered initially with problems - so what. The devs fixed the majority of the problems within 72 hours of releasing the patch. Other game companies seem to not give a flying care about things like that - quickly, recently in this industry. While some would rather that criticize this games minor flaws and drone on and on about it&apos;s frustrating initial problems, here&apos;s the bottom line: The Developers genuinely desire to make things right by their fans/customers and so far, in 60 days after release they have done that. If you LOVE Action-RPG&apos;s like the Diablo and Titans Quest series and you can handle a moderately deep, yet simple and powerful character development system you will really enjoy Sacred 2. It plays differently than the above listed ARPGs I mentioned and it does it wonderfully if you take a few extra moments to read and follow the in-game tutorial hints. The tooltip instructions are pretty good in the game too. There is a reason why this game got &quot;Best International Game of the year&quot; in Europe. Try the demo. If you like it, you will like the game. If you want the English version of the game, purchase the International English Collectors edition (UK collectors - Deep Silver) - its not much more than the regular english edition and works in all international english speaking countries like the USA and Canada and the UK. Do you like mounts in ARPG&apos;s? Sacred 2 has them, and unique ones at that. Plus you can fight on your mount in combat. How about humor? Sacred 2 has a lot of that too. Some might even complain that Sacred 2 uses SecuROM - well yes it does. What others don&apos;t investigate is that the version that they use allows you to have it installed and not have the DVD in the drive. They even inform you of this on the box on the European editions. It was the US distro-houses that tend to hide that fact. You can even have it installed on two PC&apos;s with the same installation key and play on your own home network and not have to buy two copies of the game - legally. The exception to that is that if both people on both PCs with the same key want to play multiplayer-online at the same time, they cannot. Multiplayer online only - requires a key for each PC/account. If you uninstall the game, this version of SecuROM releases your key back to the master servers. Not a big deal compared to more aggressive versions. If you have problems with your key or activations its pretty easy to solve via a simple email or telephone call. Ascaron has done a pretty good job of balancing DRM and customer service issues, imo. Try the demo, read the reviews, buy the English UK editions for the best-sourced-distribution if interested. I live in the USA and have both versions, UK and USA. I like the UK distro best (Deep Silver), they gave more to the fans for almost the same price as the US versions and more specifics and better explanations of the game. If you love ARPGs you will love Sacred 2, just do your research before you buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=420720">Expand</a></span>

It crashes when you enter a dungeon. It crashes when you finally find that last piece of armor to complete your set. It crashes when you enter dialogue with an NPC. It crashes before it even loads the splash screen. Sacred 2 could have been a monumental game, but the dorks at Ascaron who released this bug-ridden excuse for entertainment should be flooged. When it does run for an extended period of time, it&apos;s great fun, but those moments are few and far between. It doesn&apos;t help that the save system is archaic; you&apos;re forced to exit to the main menu when you save, and the game doesn&apos;t even bother to auto-save AT ALL. That means that unless you&apos;re saving and exiting every few minutes, the chances of losing all the progress you&apos;ve made are pretty good. I guess we can all be consoled by the fact that Diablo 3 will run properly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=85742">Expand</a></span>

The UI is much improved from it&apos;s earlier iteration, and the graphics are certainly some of the most beautiful I have seen. The skills are expanded and improved upon. The sound design is also a big improvement.
<br>
<br>The one other thing to consider is the speed with which they are patching the game: So far Ascaron and Deep Silver are showing a lot of interest in supporting the game, which will only ensure that the game gets even better.
<br>
<br>Of course, there are a few minor problems with the game. The 3D camera can be annoying on occasion, as it&apos;s exact angle is not controllable. Game options cannot be altered in-game, the player must exit to the menu before making any graphic tweaks. But overall, the minor problems are just that... minor.
<br>
<br>I highly recommend Sacred 2 to any fans of the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=76221">Expand</a></span>

Im not sure what happened when you tried playing but my game hasnt crashed or had any problems AT ALL...And Im running it on a desktop from 2000...LOL with less then 500 RaM and a 20Gig harddrive with a graphics card that is wayy out of date. The game still runs perfect on minimal settings. And still looks as if the settings are at max in most games. The camera view is perfect in the game going around objects and even passing under foliage. The game never froze up once and ive never seen a black screen effect LOL. By the way...The reason your character doesnt respond when you click to attack is because you are suppose to hold down the mouse button to attack not just click once. Id advise you get a new computer, read the manual before playing, dont post nonsense that isnt true, and maybe wait until your above 10 before posting again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=420621">Expand</a></span>

This is really too bad, because the game itself is not that bad in the rare moments you&apos;re not cursing it out for making you slog through the same places you&apos;ve already gone to because your last manual save was 30 minutes ago (for a game this buggy, not having auto-save is doubly damning). When the game is not busy crashing to the desktop, you&apos;ll get a diablo-style hackfest that is not altogether original or inspired, but it will at least satiate your need for the action &apos;RPG&apos; du jour until something better comes along. Unless you&apos;re extremely desperate for a mediocre diablo clone, buy a game that actually works.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=737774">Expand</a></span>

To summarize the numerous issues: The game crashes all the time, even after installing numerous patches and cranking all the detail levels down to the minimum. Attempting to run it at maximum detail on even a modern machine will typically result in a crash to desktop every 10-15 minutes. Framerates chug almost all the time and the game will randomly freeze up for seconds at a time while it does god-knows-what, typically during a fight with a group of monsters or while you&apos;re trying to navigate through a busy city. Load times are abysmally terrible and are made worse by the fact that loading occurs at a black screen with no feedback whatsoever, making it hard to tell whether the game has crashed or is just contemplating the nature of the universe. Terrible, hard-to-discover and buggy user interface. The UI lacks hotkeys for some essential commands, and the other commands that do have hotkeys don&apos;t display them anywhere except in the options menu... which you can&apos;t access without quitting to the main menu. Clicking a target to attack or a button to use a skill will often result in no response whatsoever, either because the game decided to ignore your click, because you&apos;re out of range, because you&apos;re out of line of sight, or any number of other bizarre reasons. The in-game camera is utterly terrible and almost completely without merit, and does everything within its power to prevent you from seeing the things you actually care about in-game. Your choices for camera position are &apos;right behind the player character&apos;s ass&apos; and &apos;staring straight down at the main character&apos;, both of which allow you to see about 3 feet in any direction if your view isn&apos;t currently blocked by your character, your mount, or any of the 50 mindless NPCs following you around. The game&apos;s pathfinding and targeting are both abysmally bad, which makes it hard to effectively control your character. Clicking on an enemy to attack it will often cause your character to randomly run in the enemy&apos;s direction instead, and you will often click on a door or staircase and watch your character inexplicably run off into the middle of nowhere. The quest UI is one of the worst pieces of user interface ever created, and is in many cases actually misleading enough to be worse than if the game had no quest UI at all. Some quests fail to show up in the quest UI, the quests in the UI are listed in random order with random indentation and formatting to make it hard to find them, and they&apos;re grouped into random numbered categories. This is especially unfortunate since you&apos;re forced to use the quest UI to control which quest marker is displayed on the minimap. The game mechanics are, to put it lightly, broken. Many stats and special abilities are effectively useless unless you have particular specially-tailored equipment or are using other abilities, but none of the in-game UI or text informs you of this. Sometimes modifiers on an item just plain won&apos;t work, or will do something other than what they should do - for example, you can equip a sword with +N% poison damage on it, then equip another sword that has +N% magic damage on it, and discover in the character panel that both of your swords are now inexplicably dealing poison damage. Ranged weapons are close to useless due to their short range and the ridiculous speed at which enemies close range to melee you to death. The magic system feels awkward and unintuitive mostly due to the interaction of multiple badly-explained mechanics, and the aforementioned broken UI. It&apos;s very easy to waste attribute points or an entire skill slot on an ability that&apos;s completely useless to you and not realize your mistake until much later. Most of the loot you find is utterly worthless, and sometimes even rewards from quests and bosses will be useless, so you get to plunk that shiny epic ultra-rare unique elite item into the vendor for 50000 gold that you&apos;re never going to spend. Oh, yeah - the economy is busted too. You&apos;ll be drowning in gold within a few hours of play and there really aren&apos;t any interesting or worthwhile things to spend it on. Also, the horse is terrible. It&apos;s barely faster than walking, has a remarkable knack for finding a way to get stuck in walls and other inaccessible locations, and best of all, it&apos;s next to impossible to get onto the damn thing since it has to be surrounded by about 10 feet of empty space in all directions before your player character will even think about climbing on. Mounting or dismounting also has about a 5% chance to get your character stuck, requiring you to exit the game and reload your save. The quests are pretty much universally awful. Bad writing, nonsensical storylines, broken mechanics, utterly horrible follower NPCs with broken AI and tiny health bars that evaporate in a single hit, broken map markers that randomly jump around or point to empty space, and a general lack of anything resembling coherence, quality, polish, or human decency. A class of sixth-graders could do a better job than this game&apos;s writing and design teams did on the content, even if you imagine that most of the failings are a result of a botched translation. Quests, NPCs and monsters will randomly glitch out - randomly despawning, randomly dying, getting stuck in terrain, falling through the floor, respawning after they&apos;re supposed to be dead, instantly popping from 0% health to 100% health, randomly teleporting around, etc. Quest NPCs and objectives will mysteriously appear and disappear in random locations as quests progress, often right in front of you, without any rhyme or reason. Many of the quests are plodding, repetitive fetch quests that take as long as 30 minutes to complete for little to no reward, even if you utilize a mount and the teleportation system. The game&apos;s bosses are few and far between, and not particularly interesting to fight. The game world is huge and filled with stuff, which is actually rather impressive at times - there&apos;s a whole lot of places to explore. Unfortunately, almost none of the stuff in the world is interesting - but it&apos;s there, at least, and that counts for something. Opening the world map and zooming out is pretty impressive. The game&apos;s graphics are pretty good overall, though the character graphics are a particular weak point. While almost all of the textures and models are well done, the character art in particular feels very bland and uninspired, and the art for equipment and items feels like a mishmash of random designs with no coherence or particular style to it. Some of the terrain art is extremely well done, and a few of the large cities in the campaign are very impressive to look at. The UI art, on the other hand, is pretty sub-par and is worsened by the in-game text&apos;s tendency to show up in a blurry 8-pt font. The music is decent, though not particularly memorable, and a little repetitive. Well done, at least, but you&apos;re not likely to leave the music volume up for more than a few hours. The sound effects range from well done to utterly bizarre, with some attacks, spells and items making near-perfect noises and others making utterly bizarre sounds that would fit better in a Star Wars game from the late 90s. The voice acting is pretty much universally terrible, and is played so often as to become repetitive within a few hours of play. The writing for the spoken dialogue isn&apos;t good either, but that wouldn&apos;t matter if the voice actors were better and they replayed the voice clips less. At least there&apos;s a voice volume slider. The multiplayer UI is incoherent, sluggish, and unreliable, which unfortunately prevented me from testing out that part of the game. I suspect it&apos;s probably not much better than the rest of the game, but I&apos;ve been wrong before. On the upside, despite all my complaints about the game... no, it&apos;s pretty much garbage. Definitely not worth fifty bucks. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=420126">Expand</a></span>

Moreover, it introduces new bugs every day. Currently it impossible for the majority of the online population to CREATE A GAME, and they are therefore stuck to play on public ascaron server, also unable to progress their online campaign status. The enemies are also bugged, they will disappear underground, and you will not be able to target them unless using AoE attacks, if your class has one. Amazingly, this happens also with bosses that are 20 times bigger than standard enemies, they will get stuck underground, they will not attack you, and it will take 30 minutes to kill them with AoE attacks. This still happens after the latest patch changing what should be a thrilling fight into a snorefest. Be careful; this game may look pretty at the start, and it takes a good 20 hours of game to realise how many flaws and bugs there are. You will lose items, your stash once filled with precious equipment will inexplicably become empty without nobody touching it, and countless other problems. Currently there is a bug that completely wipes your inventory. This game is, as of today, effectively unplayable online by a large part of its customers, and there has been zero support from the devs. They do not know what is causing the bug and are not doing anything to improve the problem. Save your money for another game, even if you find at 20$ this game is not worth the stress and frustration it will cause you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=420469">Expand</a></span>

Not as &quot;open-world&quot; as I had hoped it to be...does not offer much story-wise and combat gets repetitive rather quickly. Animations are mostly dull and awkward....shame.</span>

<br>
<br>A few days ago I bought the Humble Bundle, and I was quite surprised to see this game again, and after buying it I thought I could give it another try.
<br>
<br>This is horrible. I mean, okay, it was released in 2008, but did the developers re-released it again in 2012 without even adding Big Picture support even if they already had everything set up from the console versions? How lazy is that? And they even have the courage to actually sell a 2008 game that&apos;s not only poorly done but doesn&apos;t even try to bring something new or fun for 20&#x20AC;? I honestly can&apos;t see why they would release the same exact game after 4 years as a &quot;Gold Edition&quot; just to add one DLC.
<br>
<br>Also, no multiplayer on a game meant and advertised to be better in co-op, and since these incompetents didn&apos;t make it Big Picture compatible you can&apos;t play co-op locally with two controllers.
<br>
<br>Bonus: The game has no achievements despite having Trophies and Achievements on both Ps3 and Xbox and also has no picture for the store, and i looks like crap on my profile. (http://puu.sh/3SvH4.png).
<br>
<br>This is so bad I don&apos;t have words to describe it. If you bought this game at full price you should be ashamed of yourself for supporting people that just want to steal money from you. At least I know the money I spent was used for charity.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d give the original Sacred a 6-7 for the time it was released, the gold edition is much, much worse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3392284">Expand</a></span>

Ultra buggy, constant crashes, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE path-finding, non-readable fonts, animations, sync problems (in a bloody single player game!), mouse clicks dont handle properly, occasional double clicks all the time, very small inventory items, TERRIBLE itemization (all items is basically 0-6 random properties, and that&apos;s it. Get ready for some unique rings that gives you... 5% cold damage. And that&apos;s it), bugged quests, bugged skills, game sometimes fails to do requested action (for example instead of leap across the screen it leaps you for one feet), stun animation almost invisible, terrible worthless auto-generated quests seems the only quests you get (I played Sacred 1 so I can easily detect good quest from bad auto generated crap that started to appear after some patches, like go collect (random number) of (random ingredient)! (random text for this ingredient) - this is 99% of sacred 2 quests). Even after add-on (which is also terrible, after release it wasn&apos;t even playable) and two patches (2.64.2) its STILL buggy, crashing, boring, not worth the money and time investment. The reason I gave it 2 points is for present of balance.txt file - from where you can tweak some key stuff like amount of experience you get from mobs and quests, item drops and stats, monsters properties and levels, making the game little bit more playable. Just dont forget to save every 30 seconds or all your progress will be lost. Same as in Sacred 1.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4244136">Expand</a></span>

Music is repetitive, graphics boring, AND THE CAMERA - who in the hell decided to move the cam all the time with your player angle? COMBAT IS BORING..

Items lost, NPC&apos;s falling through the floor, enemies falling through the floor, and un-completeable quests because NPC&apos;s dissappeared. WTF!! This game needs a serious visit to a cosmetic surgeon, even on the highest settings, it looks outdated and lags. I&apos;m running a high end system - Quad Core 2.66Ghz, NVidia GTX 260, 4GB ram, 64bit, Windows Vista Ultimate SP2 Beta with Aero disabled. Hell, no problems with Crysis and it&apos;s 2nd, why problems with this top-down RPG? Maybe they need to look into the game&apos;s engine, i believe that&apos;s where most of the bugs are.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=422789">Expand</a></span>

What makes it even worst is the total lack of support from the devs. While the support forums are many, some with only 7 posts MONTHS OLD, if you dare to complain about a game breaking bug you will be promptly banned. The reason for this is because all the people working at Ascaron are busy developing the 360/ps3 versions, which were delayed several months, and it is now obvious why - the console gamer would have been in uproar for the poor state of the online performance - my ping with Ascaron servers today was between 15 THOUSAND AND 18 THOUSAND - no game is playable with that ping, and there are many complaints from Hardcore difficulty players, who lost their PG forever due to this. You may argue that 1.2 gigs of patches sure look like &quot;support&quot; but you would be wrong in this case. That amount of data served the purpouse to make the game change from &quot;100% broken&quot; to &quot;85% broken&quot;. Most characters cannot finish the main quest, or even start it for that matter; this is particularly hilarious considering that 5 weeks after release the online players got a BIG MESSAGE on screen saying &quot; we found the main quest bug and we are closing server to patch it&quot;. The process was as much fast as it was useless, in that it took 2 minutes but 95% of the players STILL CANNOT START OR COMPLETE THE MAIN QUEST. The graphics are ok, the gameplay is a boring clickfest. You must be particularly careful in not buying this game because, even assuming that you could bring the game back in 24 hours for a refund, it takes at least 3 times that time to realise the problems, but once you start noticing those problem the game becomes a continuous excercise in frustration: why is the quest/sub-quest marker pointing at an empty place? How come there&apos;s an enemy that fell below the game world, but is still hitting me real hard and i cannot see it, or target it? Why my charachter cannot create its own game? (This is another bug that goes on since release and has not been patched) Why does the blacksmith forging my weapon forge completely different attributes and values, not shown anywhere before? This game is not only not worth 50 euros, it is not worth even 10. Rent it so that you may give it back at your leisure, this is the best i can say.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=420607">Expand</a></span>

They game is gorgeous, the races and characters are clever. The gameworld has a real living feel to it. In short, if you like games like this, this is a game to get. I got it on Steam and it runs great!</span>

Now that I have 3 months of playing time, I can honestly say this is the new king of hack &amp; slash. Titan Quest was awesome but Sacred 2 takes the ARPG to a new level. Mounts for fast travel are a welcome hack &amp; slash addition. There are TONS of ways to configure &amp; build the six available player races. Loot is plentiful and the game world is HUGE. Make sure you learn how the skills, attributes &amp; various item modifiers work before you put a final judgement on this game. It has been patched &amp; I have had no crashes whatsoever. My rig: E 6550 dual core, 4 GB ram, HD 3870 runs at highest settings with no lag. Haven&apos;t played open net so I can&apos;t vouch for online performance. If you remove the six written reviews that gave the game a ZERO then the average of the 55 remaining reviews including my 9/10 would be 7.8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=421685">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>My Disappointments.
<br>Closed online play is less responsive due to lag.  Quests are thrown at you like an MMO and seem like they are there to keep you busy and not to tell a story.  The voice acting is just silly.  The game would feel much better if the camera angle could look forward and not just straight down.  Lots of minor bugs.  
<br>Overall. 
<br>I rate this game as good.  It feels like an MMO to me.  That would not be bad except the world is lonely even with the online play.  It grew old on me a bit fast but I did enjoy the first few days quite a bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=76301">Expand</a></span>

This review refers to multiplayer closed net online, which is the main draw for many ppl buying this kind of game. The online is, simply put, broken. Does not work. You may be able to play online for a bit, but once your character passes lvl 61 (out of 200), it will not be able to create an online game anymore, therefore making it impossible to play the questline. Should you however manage to find a game someone else created, rest assured that your problems are not over, since the main quest is broken as well and cannot be completed, for another different bug. Both these problems have been ongoing and have not been solved in more than 1 gig of patches. The thing that keeps ppl playing these games is ITEMS and sacred 2 has lots of them. Unfortunately, a lot of the item bonuses/stats just do not work, or do not work as advertised. This is a problem also in the &quot;skill description&quot; area, which is very generic and does not give an idea of what you are buying with your skill points. Descriptions like &quot;GREATLY INCREASES this or that&quot; are often misleading, but even more often INCORRECT, like a skill that claimed in the description to INCREASE regeneration times of spells (not good) but in reality if was DECREASING that (good). The support of the developers however is the real, basic problem of this unfinished and buggy game: there have been more than 1.1 gigs of patches, and not one of the main problems has been fixed. The game forums are a labirinth of subforums where it is impossible to do anything since the devs just do not read or post there, no matter how big your problem is. More problems you are guaranteed to have: giant end-game bosses disappearing underground, becoming impossible to tarket; your stash with your preciuos saved loot will just become EMPTY for another stupid bug; server crashing many times a day making you lose progress, exp and items you had gathered that far; the list could go on forever. As of this writing ,the game is in development for PS3 also, so you can bet that PC version will not get any support until that one is out. Do not buy this game, unless you love feeling cheated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=420571">Expand</a></span>

The lobby system is this bad: - the server list is bugged so you will click on a server name but you will join the one above or below - there is no way to check pings - the server list keeps going back to the top making it impossible to browse properly If you live in the USA the US server are in Europe! If you manage to enter the right game, you will certainly come across some GAME BREAKING bugs that, while well known from at least 2 weeks if not a month, are still present after 1.2 gigs of patches: - you cannot start or complete the main quest (!!) - you cannot create your own game These 2 bugs are highly irritating and are still unpatched - a server-wide announcement stated that they were restarting the server to patch the main quest bug but that did not solve the problem. How can you announce server-wide then fail so miserably? By itself the game would get a 4 because the map is real big and nice, but the quests are just fetch/kill tasks. What brings it down to ZERO here is the complete and insulting lack of support from the developers and their forums. One of the GMs was complaining on the forums that &quot;they work on sunday and holiday to fix problems&quot; but the harsh reality is that they shipped an alpha builld, for 50 euros, and now have to work weekends to fix it. Of course having announced the 360/PS3 versions, it is no surprise that the PC version gets zero support. If you try to post on the forums because say, 50% or more of the game you paid does not work, you will be banned on the spot. I will now list some other random problems to try and give you an idea how bad this game is: - any hireling you will get will get you killed, their AI is set to PULL ANY ENEMY IN SIGHT, THEN ANOTHER ONE, NEVER STOP, and you cannot give them instructions or stop them in any way. - Major NPCs and bosses can and will fall underground, below the game world, but will still be able to kill you. You will not be able to retaliate and you will be forced to quit and restart the mission. Some missions require an hour or more. - Since you cannot host your own server you are forced to use their own, which are laggy, crash very often (10 or more times a day) and will make you lose valuable loot and xp. - Your stashed items can disappear without a trace, a bug that has happened to MANY people so far, and for which there was no word from the devs. - DRM protection will randomly cause crashes - The chat system is also not working, using too tiny letters, and colors that makes it real hard to read. This is something so basic that it amazes me they would ship with this dismal lobby system. In closing, the game has been TOTALLY unplayable online in the last 3 days, with pings over 20 THOUSAND. Again, no word or support from the forums, the GMs or the devs. You should not buy this game for any reason, for any cost.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=420624">Expand</a></span>

The flip side: the load times are not as good as they could be, and the manual unlock system if you don&apos;t have internet is a major pain in the behind. My system is close to the high end recommended and I have to use the lowest graphic settings to stop the gaming jerking when I am facing multiple enemies. Even worse the manual is very confusing and poorly laid out. Great game, buy it, but buy it cheap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=83098">Expand</a></span>

Before the last patch the game was seriously riddled with bugs, most of them game-breaking. As of this last patch, a game that was broken before has become totally unplayable. In order to correct some item bugs, instead of disabling the items in question, the developers elected to delete all items you character was wearing and using. There was no previous warning or anything, they took the servers down to patch, and in the process destroyed all those items. If this was not enough, the patch fails to install for unknown reasons for a lot of people and therefore fails to solve the problems that literally fills an otherwise beautiful game world. This game was released more than 5 weeks and had 1.5 gigs of patches, but is still an unfinished and unpolished product. Therefore i rate it a zero.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=420667">Expand</a></span>

Many quests are still buggy, some of them can be resolved usually by reloading a save game but others are more messy, especially one quest I personally just failed (Hunting Fever 1) which was to kill 31 specific monsters within 10 minutes, normally that would be easy enough if there was actually enough of those monsters to kill in that time limit! I found 11..smh
<br>
<br>In a nut shell, Sacred 2 could have been a really awesome ARPG, I personally think it could have been one of the very best if it wasn&apos;t rushed to market.  There are many positive aspects, but the bugs, pathing issues and camera issues can really cause serious problems and that is the reason why it didn&apos;t score higher,  its a shame really because even by todays standards - I still think its better than Diablo 3 and thats saying something.
<br>
<br>ARPG fans can pick up this game for practically nothing these days, and if anyone has free time to burn then honestly, I&apos;d still recommend giving this a play through, there is a massive gameworld to explore - literally 10x larger than all the Diablo series combined, granted that size and the amount of side quests added to the amount of bugs in the end but still, the games main quest lines are usually bug free at least...usually.
<br>
<br>+ Large open world
<br>+ tons of items and customization
<br>
<br>- Very buggy
<br>- Possible to lose progress due to crashes
<br>- Pathing problems
<br>- Poor camera angles
<br>- Dead Multiplayer (can be played with 3rd party programs)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sacred-2-fallen-angel/user-reviews?user_review_id=6137818">Expand</a></span>
