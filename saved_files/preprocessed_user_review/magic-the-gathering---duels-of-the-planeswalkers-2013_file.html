It has a number of predefined decks with 60 card plus 30 more that are unlockable in-game by winning matches or by purchasing deck unlocks.
<br>
<br>That said, this quite a nice game to play solo or with a friend. The available decks contains some pretty crappy cards. This is very annoying at first - even after unlocking some nice cards you&apos;re still stuck with them. However, after playing a while, I find it interesting to beat more powerful opponents with cards you would never put in your deck.
<br>
<br>The interface is great and the game flows nicely. Everything is quite self-explanatory and you can easily pause the game the read cards you don&apos;t know. This makes this game perfect for beginners, but you can turn off all the tips if you already know the game. It also contains some challenges to make the you more familiar with common strategies - also great for the inexperienced, but reasonably easy for long time players.
<br>
<br>There seem to be some problems with multiplayer, although I never had any while playing with my friends. However, I&apos;ve had a number of crashes while playing Planechase, which is **very** annoying, because they tend to be long games.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t think this game will ever have custom deck building like so many people have been asking. Wizards of the Coast wants to sell cards. They already have an online Magic game that requires you to buy boosters, decks, etc (MTGO). Allowing custom builds will threaten to cannibalize their own product.
<br>
<br>Bottom line, this is a very nice casual game and definitely worth the price. If you are a MTG beginner (even if you never played it before) or just would like to play a match when there is no one around to play with, this is an excellent game. If you are looking for the full MTG experience and can&apos;t get over the fact that you won&apos;t be building your own deck, this is probably not your game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2509892">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>How embarrassing for Hasbro&apos;s software development managers that, after all these years, they still haven&apos;t developed a decent game engine to handle the moderately complex enough to be interesting algorithms behind this game. Fire some folks, and hire some folks who actually (a) know how to code, and (b) care about the game.

I could write a novel on all the glitches, problems, rule coding errors but there really is no need as the one major problem it has ruins the game even if it was glitch free. First off, Magic the game itself is just broken (even the real life card game). They have had to think of more and more special abilities for the creatures for too many years and the whole system is just broken. The game no longer is about strategy and tactics as much as it is about &quot;Who is going to get his broken, over-powered game busting card out first.&quot; In addition to that fact, Stainless decided to add a sub-routine back in the 2012 edition where the AI could access the library on the fly, get a card it needed for the situation at hand and simply overwrite a card in its hand. I call it &quot;Dial-a-Spell.&quot; (This was for Planeswalker difficulty setting to make it more challenging).  So, being that there were no core changes to the game engine between 2012 and 2013, the genius types (who had created their own 3rd party program after discovering the Dial-a-Spell sub-routine) were up and running right off the bat with this game. So, if the deck shuffling sub-routine doesn&apos;t land screw you (Happens often) or land glut you (Happens often) then you can look forward to seeing some of the Lamest decks ever created. Why they make decks that pure piss peopkle off I do not know. No Skill, No Talent Hack decks that take little to no thought to play. Jace grind deck. No purpose to that deck but grinding people&apos;s library into the GY. Takes alot of thought there. Gee, what will I do next? Guess I will grind some cards. LAME. How about Ajani Life deck? Alot of strategy involved there. Cast creatures gain life. Cast enchantments and sorceries gain more life. Cast broken OP Instant win creature  game over. Yeah. Blue/white enchantment deck  what a joke. Cast OP hexproof/ unblockable creatures, stack a ridiculous amount of enchantments on them  attack game over. great fun to play against. Then after all that Lameness, you get to look forward to the deck hackers who type codes on the fly to get exactly what they need at exactly the right time over and over and over. They are NOT hard to spot. They are the ones who take forever to act on any given turn and cause alot of game syncing due to the memory access of their 3rd party program. I have been calling them out as I see them and that usually makes them go into hiding for awhile but this game is a poor excuse for a Magic game. Until they can do something about blocking the 3rd party access cheat and make the decks fully customizeable and STOP making such LAME decks  this game will remain a stinker. P.S. Where are the Planeswalkers? My goodness we have had 3 editions of &quot;DUELS of the PLANESWALKERS&quot; and havent seen a single PW yet.

I put around 10 hours of it but each hour was frustrating and awful.
<br>
<br>Deck customization is limited in a horrible way. You cannot adjust the amount of land in the decks. Some decks have 4-5 more land than I would build a regular deck with and you end up flooded with it towards the end of the game. The RNG seems horribly broken and even with excess land I will sometimes have to re-draw 3-4 times and still end up with only 1 land or plain awful hands (or 2 lands and rest 4+ high mana cards despite the plethora of lower cost cards in the deck) and have to restart the duel. Even using card mana cost ratios similar to what I would use in my real decks generates results that are inconsistent.
<br>
<br>You are also limited to 10 different decks, of which only 1 is multi color which limits the experience. Why have two different blue decks? Why not combine the card pool and allow players to have more deck building ability?
<br>
<br>Each deck has 30 cards to unlock. You unlock one card with each victory. Unfortunately a large chunk the starter cards for many of the decks are just plain terrible which makes it hard to win the first battles. Too bad alot of the cards you unlock are garbage also and you may end up going through 15 battles and getting none of the cards you wanted to add to the deck.
<br>
<br>Some of the animations such as Exalted take forever to resolve and you must wait for a count down timer for each part of the round even though you are playing with AI. Why can&apos;t you just skip it? This drags the battles out far longer than they need to be.
<br>
<br>It is based off a console control system which makes the deck interface and the main menu a pain to navigate.
<br>
<br>All of this adds up to an incredibly negative experience for anyone who has enjoyed playing this game in person. Frustration from start to finish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2533498">Expand</a></span>

You have to use the game&apos;s pre-made decks with very little customization allowed.  The game is also extremely buggy on steam.  Multi-player games are very difficult to join and usually one player gets kicked off and the other wins by default.</span>

The decks seem more themed and certainly the synergy between the cards within each deck is greatly improved which I believe makes them more enjoyable to play. The added card options (40 unlockables this year compared to 20 in 2012) really gives you a chance to build your deck a couple different ways. Finally, the balance between decks is much better as well. In 2012 there were certain decks that were very difficult to win with consistently but in 2013 the margin between decks has been narrowed.
<br>
<br>There are still some drawbacks- land distributions is still not manually adjustable which can be frustrating when you have so many other ways to fine tune your decks. Additionally the &apos;card shuffling&apos; is a bit sub-par, leading many times to either not having enough land or having too much in any given hand; however these are not game breaking defects. Finally, the multiplayer connectivity, while improved from 2012, is still lacking in that there are many times when you find yourself unable to connect to your opponents. However, the mid-game crashes that plagued 2012 seem to have been cleaned up and I have only encountered one or two game crashes in over 250 online matches. Finally, I wish to note that many people mark this game down for not allowing full deck building options and I don&apos;t think that is fair. This game does not advertise that feature nor would it make sense for it to do so. Magic the Gathering: Online provides that service and charges large sums of money in return. On the other hand, for the $9.99 charge that this game incurs you get 10 decks each in excess of 100 cards, the price to replicate on Magic Online or with physical magic cards would be well over $1000. The game does well what it sets out to do - provide gateway into the world of Magic the Gathering, allowing the player to experience a number of different deck types, colors and themes without the prohibitive cost that acquiring those cards in Magic Online or paper magic would entail. Finally it gives what many magic players really need - an active online community to go head to head against.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2666924">Expand</a></span>

While 2013 has less decks available (16 versus last year&apos;s 19), they are overall more accessible for quick play because of the 10 promo unlocks provided post-release. The decks are also more balanced in power overall because you aren&apos;t locked out of the best cards anymore. However, this is a double-edged sword; While you can unlock a total of 40 cards per deck, many of them are dups and you can only unlock one at a time. To put this into perspective, beating the first campaign (the longest in the game) will unlock 26 cards.
<br>
<br>While I enjoyed the difficult challenges (the hardest challenges of the DotP games in my opinion), this game is riddled with issues that will never get fixed or improved since the devs have moved onto their next yearly release. Locking out all but two decks at the start is a terrible way to introduce new players to MTG, especially considering the target market for these games. The one new game mode, Planechase, is only worth playing with friends; The AI is terrible at it, seeming to attack and roll the planar die randomly. Despite being marketed towards new and casual players, this game can only be recommended for experienced MTG players because of the unlock systems and frustration with non-human Planechase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3441183">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Wrong, the multiplayer in Magic 2013 is buggy as all hell. Even getting a couple friends into the same game is fraught with errors and game crashing. When everyone does make it into the game many animations in-game take forever to resolve, drawing the game out far more than is required. Even when you get partway into the game about one in every four games results in freezing where the game will progress no further. Everyone is still connected and present in the room as they can still discuss how much a turd this game is as they bash their heads onto their desks repeatedly.
<br>
<br>I will not be purchasing the next year of this title and if I were Hasbro, I would seriously consider dropping Stainless Games as they have definitely left a stain on what was once an amazing game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2873779">Expand</a></span>

When Stainless Games first started advertising this game the big highlight was all of the improvements from Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012. Unfortunately, most of them didn&apos;t make it into the finished product. Bugs and glitches still run rampant. Combat with more than 4 creatures is still a nightmare (despite screenshots seen in advertisements). You can not edit the amount of land in a deck, which makes certain decks unbalanced. The decks are incredibly bland with uninteresting themes and poor selections of cards. The Planeschase gamemode is interesting until it does something that completely changes the flow of the game. When this happens the game sits there for 10 minutes while all the effects resolve and there is nothing to do but wait while the timer ticks off each one. The list goes on, but you get the idea. All in all it seems that Stainless Games did not learn from their mistakes, nor did they listen to the players. After a second failure I don&apos;t think Wizards of the Coast will license Stainless Games to make another Magic game. If you want new decks and new game modes the $10 price-tag might draw you in, but the rule of thumb seems to be that if it&apos;s made by Stainless Games then it&apos;s going to be poor quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2501194">Expand</a></span>

Duels is an excellent game to introduce new players to the world of Magic the Gathering.  It slowly, but enjoyably teaches players the core concepts of the game.  Learning Magic can be a daunting experience because of the depth and breadth of the rules but Duels 2013 makes the process simple by introducing concepts one at a time.  Duels 2013 also does an excellent job of showing different strategies players can use when building decks.  Every player should be able to find a deck that suits his or her individual play style.  There are controlling decks and aggressive decks.  There are mill-based decks and burn based decks.  Creatures decks and removal decks.  One problem with the game is that it lacks full customization options for its decks.  Players can substitute a few cards, but experienced Magic players that want a digital version of the game will want more options than what Duels 2013 will provide.  Especially after the Campaign mode is completed the game could have more repeatability if players could have more options for constructing decks of their own for multiplayer.
<br>
<br>The puzzles are much more difficult than last year but still easy enough to finish without using spoilers.  The multiplayer section of the game offers the brand new &quot;Planechase&quot; that mirrors the non-digital release of the product and offers a high variance, but very fun alternative to two-headed giant and free-for-all play.  Ultimately, just the campaign mode will give hours of fun for the low price of $10.
<br>
<br>The biggest problem with the game is the instability of the multiplayer games.  They are difficult to get started and have a lot of connection problems causing players to drop frequently.  Ultimately, even with these flaws this is an easy buy.  The game should provide significant value to new and old magic players and is a steal at $10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2491171">Expand</a></span>

The additions of both the end step and manual mana tapping (albeit through a clunky procedure) are great features and bring the game ever closer to traditional paper Magic. While there may not be true deck customization, there are certainly plenty of options available. From an unlockable pool of 30 cards (with more to come, surely) one can create a good variety of different strategies all with one central idea for each of the 10 initial decks (once again, more will definitely be added). The campaign actually feels as though it has a purpose and the Planechase campaign is very fun (albeit quite excruciating in certain circumstances). The challenges are definitely difficult in some places and make you think  differently than you would expect.
<br>
<br>The only real downside I&apos;ve seen is that the initial decks don&apos;t feel as ingenious and creative as those from Duels 2012. However, even if you have the first two iterations of the Duels franchise, 2013 is a must and at $10, how can you go wrong?
<br>
<br>Also you get a free 6 card booster in the real world, if that helps at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2501381">Expand</a></span>

Ideally, I&apos;d love to see Magic: The Gathering Online switched to this clean format, but for now, the single-player campaign and multiplayer (using only pre-built decks) is a good start.  It goes without saying that this incarnation is superior to its 2012 predecessor, but what&apos;s more exciting is looking ahead to future incarnations.  These are fun decks, but the desire to build one&apos;s own deck is something that should be addressed first and foremost in future editions.  The vast amount of number-crunching this program does is staggering, and at times it can miss (computer opponent AI occasionally does goofy things no live player ever would).  But bottom-line is that there are a lot of moving parts here and Wizards of the Coast has created one of the most faithful computer representations of the card game.  If you are a fan of MTG at all, this should be in your collection.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2933505">Expand</a></span>

It is far easier to pay to win than actually grind the card unlocks. So yes, the DLC is bad. However this is still a good magic game, and it is an excellent product as an introduction to the game for beginners or the curious. If you are a veteran magic player you may wish to avoid it. But if you are an outsider who wants to see how this famous game functions this is a good place to start. And of course the way around the high price of DLC is PATIENCE. Wait for the inevitable Steam sale.
<br>
<br>9/10 as a great demo for magic.

Then you block the wrong guy because you HAD to pick something before the block phase finishes (on its own with or without you).  So you lost a game when you had just finally built up a return army to wipe him on the next turn, because the engine sucks and this is just the most recent quirk.  Try it yourself, if you play MTG irl, this game is infuriatingly stupid.  Nevermind the stupid deck unlock grind, why bother when we gotta re-buy the 2014 version, and the 2015 version, new grinds new grinds.

The interface is nice if a little clumsy. But the real problem are the loading times (at least on the Steam version I got  don&apos;t know if there are different ones). On my computer, after I start Magic I will have to look at my desktop for approximately 5 to 6 minutes. Then the loading screen appears for another minute or so. Then finally the logos fade in and you&apos;re in. Unless it gets stuck in the loading screen, in which case you&apos;ll have to restart the computer. I have other friends and it&apos;s the same for everyone. Very frustrating. If a card game requires loading times that are more than 10x the loading times of Bioshock Infinite, for example, something is very wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3182031">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately they failed to translate the rules properly and still haven&apos;t fixed errors this long after release. If this edition wants to use a different ruleset that would be fine, but it prints the same rules on the same cards and the interactions are blatantly wrong. (Hexproof has never prevented blocking, but apparently here it does, and that&apos;s just one example.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-the-gathering---duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3195714">Expand</a></span>
