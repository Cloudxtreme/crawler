The main problem it suffers from is lack of innovation. Not a lot of things have changed since the previous title. Combat is the same, trade routes work the same, so does religion, enemy AI is just as stupid, etc.
<br>
<br>There are some areas where the game did some modifications though, the most noticeable being the Districts. This makes you &quot;specialize&quot; your cities as you can no longer build all types of buildings in the city and have to think very well what you build considering the amount of tiles you have available. The social policy system has been changed as well, for the worse in my opinion, as now you gain some social cards when researching a social policy and you can select the bonus of a number of these cards depending on what goverment you have. Again, like in Civ 5 there is no downside to any form of goverment and some of the combinations you make don&apos;t even make sense(for example you can drag the Rationalism Card to a Theocracy and you don&apos;t get any penalty).
<br>
<br>One thing that I liked is that you can boost your research of Tech and Social by making certain actions in the game. For example, building a number of Quaries can boost your Research towards Mansory, reducing the time you need to reserach this tech, or defeating barbarians can boost you research of Bronze Working and so on. This is the best addition in my opinion as you are no longer need to put a lot of effort in creating Science and Culture, especially if you like to play Military.
<br>
<br>I would rate this higher if it wasn&apos;t however for the horrible presentation of the game. I think everyone is already familiar with the horrible iPad graphics. Look, nobody expected this to have GTA 5 graphics and you can talk all you want about muh unique art style but there is no excuse for a 60 dollar game in 2016 to look like a Fremium iPad game, especially when it looks worse than its predecessor. The sound isn&apos;t any better either. The Main Menu theme is fine and the choice of Sean Bean as the narrator is excelent, but the music in the main game sucks. Previous Civ games had classical music to listen to as you built your empire. This game has the type of generic crap that you usually hear in Facebook games.
<br>
<br>My 2 cents? Wait for the price to drop or at least for some mods to show up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6771091">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s basically Civ5 + Beyond Earth, with Endless Legend districts and a shiny new skin. That may seem great on the surface, and it is, but there are many flaws and oversight, some of which should be common sense at this point. If you hated Civ5, you&apos;ll probably hate this one too. If you were fine with 5 and BE, then it&apos;s a slightly-better-than mediocre addition to the franchise. Everything is &quot;finished&quot; per-se, but nothing really feels complete
<br>
<br>Details:
<br>
<br>Right now the AI is useless, production queues are missing, the overall style is more cartoony than Warcraft, and diplomacy is all but non-existent. The new research/civic boosters seem cool at first but inevitably push you down the same path every time. You still can&apos;t make your own leaders or save world settings. Basically it feels like a game that doesn&apos;t want you to experiment.
<br>
<br>(Personal aside) - I thought I would love Sean Bean as the narrator but nearly every quote is juvenile and silly instead of the witty and sarcastic dialogue that Nimoy was given in previous installments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6774800">Expand</a></span>

Animations are OK, but as with all Civ games they become tedious by your second world. Leaders on the diplomacy screen are nice and detailed but again they are boring quickly.
<br>
<br>More me this is the biggest negative in the game - repetitiveness. Doubling up the tech tree with the new culture tree just feels like a pop up window style annoyance. The buffs they give are extremely specific and narrow for the most part - a lot of making up the numbers. Each one is accompanied by a quotation read by Sean Bean. A lovely voice I never thought I got get tired of hearing. Well welcome to Civ 6. Other leaders will occasionally send you messages which take a very long time to voice, and they have very few to choose from - again you find yourself hammering the esc to get on with things.
<br>
<br>War is still fun, and the obnoxious warmonger penalty has had some revisions to make it slightly less so. However you can be friendly with one civ, neutral with another, and declare war on a third, and expect to be denounced by the first two in the same way.
<br>
<br>City distracts are a fun feature, adding a visual element and slight tactical placement to the specialising aspect of city development. A campus (science) near several mountains and another district is far more effective than alone in the desert for example.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not bad, and I got it for &#xA3;36 instead of &#xA3;50 (seriously?) but it is quite boring and a little bit annoying.
<br>
<br>Too many little crappy buffs to click through, repetitive dialogue, diplomacy still pretty dumb, war is fun, districts are fun too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6770268">Expand</a></span>

The AI is just bad: how about a 12 tile island and the AI city produces 8 scouts?! Other examples of spamming and diplomacy weirdness are just as stupid. Frankly then, the game makes the biggest mistake of all - it is boring.
<br>
<br>And I personally hate games the overly rely on giving the AI buffs and the player debuffs just to make up for their poor investment in AI development. &quot;Let&apos;s just make it look puurdy for the suckers!&quot;
<br>
<br>So, here we have yet another example of developers producing a rushed game in full knowledge fanboys will buy it and try their best to love it saying, &quot;Yeah, this time is gonna be different!&quot; and it&apos;s just not!

First, the graphics; it appears that the designers made a performance trade off, giving us what you might called less than the original DOS version of Monkey Island graphics - cartoon like graphics; to increase overall performance I presume. My machine can take it; give me state of the art graphics.  Second, the map generation options are too limited; a step back from prior versions. Also, the type selections available all seem to generate roughly the same outcome.  No matter what you choose, you seem to get what has been called in the past a &quot;fractal&apos; map. Hopefully user mods will improve on the poor map generation options over time. It is unfortunate that they stuck with the naval/intercontinental movement model of Civ 5. Use and control of the sea is a significant real world problem that Civs prior to 5 dealt with in a more realistic fashion.  The AI is a major problem. AI cheats at higher levels frustrating.  AI seems to drive the game, you are reactive to the AI, with rare opportunities to be proactive. Game options also disappointing. Seems each new version of Civ, since 4 gives the user less options. Same with information reports.  Less than Civ 5, much less than Civ 4.  With the increased complexity level, more information reports should be available. The entire civics scheme seems like a waste of time.  The choices are so incremental as to have little impact. Could do away with it and perhaps improve playability. Game is just cumbersome; does not flow. It gets boring. Unit control also cumbersome; can&apos;t use keypad for unit movement; keyboard can be much more efficient in a complex game than a mouse alone. This game takes the keyboard out of the unit control equation except for five or six basic functions. City state importance has been escalated and you can&apos;t turn them off. It&apos;s nice to be able to play a game without the City States when you want to; like Civ 5.  Can&apos;t do that in 6. This game made me what to try Civ 4 again after a lay off of several years. Civ 4 much more playable and enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6775053">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is just awful.
<br>The leaders are very annoying and the comic-joke animation makes it even worse. Every second round the NPC factions want to speak with you. And with that comes the endless animation.
<br>The game design itself and the city spamming is just ridiculous. My best tactic until now, just spam settlers and settle everywhere. There is no negative side to expand stupidly. No world wide unrest, nothing.
<br>But the worst thing about this game is the KI. It is almost not existing. This game is way to easy, and boring.

<br>
<br>This may be my all time favorite game.
<br>
<br>The only negatives that dropped my score slightly (wish I could rate it 9.5): the religious combat system needs to be tweaked or possibly  revamped. I miss automating scouts to explore. It&apos;s totally fine all the way through the classical period, but it gets rater tedious now that I&apos;m 300 turns in. I also wish the interface was a bit more obvious about what kind of adjancy bonuses I would get. I found myself dropping what I was doing to check the civilopedia quite a bit. Overall the tooltip system needs a little bit more polish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6764800">Expand</a></span>

I have sweet memories of playing Civ1 on 286, but essentially the game has not changed (for good) ever since. Year after year, same crap. Only change is that it went from somewhat ok board game to confusing and stupid overwhelming card game. While in older Civs you could play as you wanted, it all went to +1 -1 mess now. The music and announcer just make me sleep. All the old problems are still there, from endless loading between turns to stupid restrictions (putting up a granary in new city takes same time 500BC and 2000AD), auto-exploring is absolutely random, etc.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re new to the genre, I suggest to go with Civilization 4. If not, I think it&apos;s time we put this franchise aside.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6765530">Expand</a></span>

The game is fatally flawed, featuring brain-dead AI that does not function even when propped by the crutches in the form of heavy cheating bonuses. The diplomacy system is atrocious, the interface badly designed, and the graphics are pain to look at. Civ 5 had also a rough start, but was polished to a reasonable state in time. However, I think this mess of a release is beyond redemption, and after the mediocre Civ:Beyond Earth, it&apos;s a sad evidence of a decline of what used to be a stellar game developer company.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6933324">Expand</a></span>

That&apos;s 5 seconds of animation. Want to turn on fast attack? That means you won&apos;t even see or know which of your units attacked. The AI players will interrupt you with weird statements that make no sense, and have overly long introductions.
<br>
<br>The AI in general still fails to grasp 1UPT - and I think it needs to be removed to bring this game back to life. Trying to negotiate with the AI is still a PITA (I captured 70% of your settlements - but you refuse to make peace Montezuma? Now I have to micromanage all of my units through mountains to get your last little **** cities. (No I don&apos;t actually - I&apos;ll just quit the game and do something better with my time)). Warmonger penalties are still retarded in that they last hundreds and hundreds of years with only minor decay.
<br>
<br>Civic system is nice, though about 20-30% of your time will be spent watching stupid animations of units or leaders, or waiting for turns to compute. How can the AI turn optimisation still be so poor on top-end hardware in 2017?
<br>
<br>Really disappointing. Its a shame there is no competition, Civ needs it badly. Game has gone downhill since Civ 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=7230602">Expand</a></span>

Civ V gave birth something exceptional - first ever bad Civilization game for PC. Waste of time, waste of money and disregard for most mature player base in the casual gaming world. If I want something childish, overly simple and unfinished, I can always download the Clash Royale - the playability and sense of achievement is far higher in that one than in new Civ VI.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6857351">Expand</a></span>

To list just a few pros, the city development is great (though, you will often find yourself with &quot;nothing to build&quot;, apart from military units); the game is as addicting as ever; the split tech and culture trees is exceptionally well implemented; the mini-quest boosts are nice (though, can be often a hit-or-miss); the turn-processing times are rather good; the policy cards are amazing. Overall, the aspects of the game related to building your empire are well-though-out and well-executed. I sometimes wonder whether I&apos;d be able to get back to Civ V.
<br>
<br>But, I might try to do just that because, on the other hand, when you&apos;re over with enjoying the empire-building aspect and think about the international relations in the game you&apos;ll be greatly disappointed. The AI either poses little or no challenge, or competes with you on extremely unfair terms. If you thought that AI in Civ V was bad, think again. Despite the patches, other leaders will still behave in an unpredictable manner (in the negative sense). What strikes me as most odd is that the AI seems not to upgrade tiles and builds not so many districts. Also, it is extremely reluctant to upgrade military units and is virtually useless when it comes to waging wars.
<br>
<br>So, the game has some good ideas, good mechanics, but the awful AI ruins the experience for me. In addition, there is the art style, that I&apos;m not very fond of.
<br>
<br>All things considered, I give the game a 6.5. As stated above, it has great potential, but is ruined by the moronic AI.
<br>
<br>However, I&apos;ll give it a 5 for ideological reasons: the price is just way too high for the quality of the product and rather sparse content. And the prices of the DLCs and additional Civilizations are unacceptable. So the final score is affected by the cancerous policy game publishers and developers have, that is milking their fans: firstly they sell half-finished products with limited content for a premium price, and then sell additional content (which may be good), but in very small chunks for a high price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=7288594">Expand</a></span>

<br>Imagine 60 bucks every year from hundred thousands of gamers for a must-have game!
<br>It is a must-forget game! The mechanic doesn&apos;t work and you need almost thousand year to build up a granary in a new city...hundred years for a simple iron mine.... totally crap!
<br>I&apos;m still wondering why critics are always so indulgent for all &quot;famous&quot; games.

You&apos;re ostensibly rewriting the social fabric of your civ, and yet it&apos;s just pick and choose. I&apos;d like to see more penalties for switching, and some synergies with certain governments and policies. While I appreciate the faster pace, the maps seem much tighter, with almost no neutral ground left after the first 50 or so turns. The religion mechanic is mostly unchanged, and still feels like an afterthought, with little decision making beyond send-moar-missionaries. There&apos;s even less difference between great writers, artists, musicians now, which is a shame. This really just feels like another game released with missing content just to force the player to buy the expansion pack. The district system is more of a gimmick than a new mechanic, since having more districts doesn&apos;t allow multiple production queues or anything. The AI is still mystifying, with the computer proposing horribly one-sided deals and rejecting perfectly reasonable deals, and they seem to love declaring war on me even when I have a massive army/tech advantage. Diplomacy victory is gone, there&apos;s no economic victory. If it weren&apos;t for the wonky new graphical scheme, it would be hard to pick Civ 6 apart from a Civ 5 expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=7631416">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>AI is schizophrenic. One shift asks you to send a delegation, you accept it but if you want to do the same, they will not let you. Five shifts hate you. At ten they declare war on you and you do not know what the **** you did to make them angry.
<br>
<br>The novelties, although I think they are noble in their proposals, they lack to be polished. The districts take too long to do, and although I understand that the idea is specialization, forcing you to do the aqueduct and the workshop (because you do not grow more) does not leave time for the rest.
<br>
<br>Religion is very annoying. If you do not fund an entry gives you much advantage, not to mention how unbearable it is to see hordes of missionaries bothering where they should not.
<br>The technological tree is the same as always. Eurekas are fine, but they help a lot to finish the tree quickly. If only they added more technologies ....
<br>The resources that are almost surplus, are very abundant, almost that you do not need to trade the strategic ones, and the luxury ones without the happiness lose much grace.
<br>
<br>Anyway, I hope they take out one or two expansions to fix it.

<br>You can either accept, in which case they will send you cookies and declare war on you again within 3 rounds.
<br>You can destroy them, in which case every round they will offer everything they have over -&amp; over again.
<br>Being at war with everyone is more enjoyable, because if you&apos;re in peace with someone (which almost never happens) they spam you &quot;offers&quot; every round, the offer is usually &quot;you give me a bunch of stuff, i give you nothing, what do you say?&quot; I click NO without reading it.

<br>But one thing annoying me most. Again AI is totally worthless. Annoying and stupid. There is totally no challenge in play. AI is not able to use or build army. I tried King. Only thing that change with difficulty is bonuses to AI and punishment to player. I hate this. Still on high levels AI sit like duck and complaining about my expansion, unable to do anything. Only Romans build some units and then send it to nonsense death. (army spread in my lands and kill itself from cities defenses, it does not try take city or withdraw for healing.) In late game AI do totally nothing. It seems that AI is totally broken.
<br>Firaxis Games &#x2013; fix this. Try Endless legend, Age of wonders, or even total war, please. This is really shame.:(

Too bad, there&apos;s going to be a missionary there for the next 10 turns until the AI missionary swarm chooses to move away.
<br>
<br>Do you like it when the AI requests to see your capital 10 turns in a row? I sure don&apos;t. How about demanding things from you every few turns even though you&apos;re ahead of them in everything but unit count. I&apos;m sure those cavalry pose a major threat to me, with my mobile infantry.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve yet to have an AI accept a trade that I proposed and thought was reasonable. I give you 2 luxury goods, you give me one? No? You want 100 gold per turn as well? When the AI proposes a trade NEVER MODIFY IT. Once you modify it they&apos;ll just reject it outright, even if you&apos;ve made it better for them.
<br>
<br>Is there a nice spot on the map you want to claim? Better produce a settler as your first unit, because the AI will magically have like 3 by turn 30.

<br>Prepare to have AI constantly declare war on you for no reason, yet not get labelled as war mongers and teamed up on. Then when an AI settles in the center of your territory and you declare war to raze the obnoxious city, you&apos;re a warmonger and everybody gangs up on you for the rest of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6828182">Expand</a></span>

My number one complaint is that they got rid of the replay movie at the end of a game, one of the best features of previous versions of Civilization.  When you win a game you&apos;re rewarded with a cheesy animation, and a line chart that looks terrible, like it was put together as cheaply as possible.
<br>
<br>Some other gripes:
<br>-The mini map is inexcusably pixelated and looks awful.
<br>- There&apos;s no large map/globe view, so you can&apos;t zoom out and admire the world, and you feel like you&apos;re stuck inside a small window.
<br>- The AI is awful, and makes incomprehensible decisions.
<br>- Setting up trade routes are now incredibly tedious once you have more than a handful of cities.
<br>- The diplomacy screen is slow and annoying and AI often offers pointless or confusing commentary.
<br>- The notification system is a pain to use.  The tool-tip menu that slides in and out is painfully slow, and the amount of &apos;spam&apos; quickly becomes irritating.
<br>- You can&apos;t filter the map to reveal only resources and exclude cities so it&apos;s sometimes hard to locate certain resources
<br>
<br>There are plenty of bugs too:
<br>- Objects can restrict view of city health bars, so you have to zoom in to see what&apos;s happening.
<br>- The game often freezes when you capture a city for a few seconds
<br>- The game runs slow if you don&apos;t have instant movement turned on.
<br>- Sometimes a unit becomes locked in place and can&apos;t be moved, and yet the game wont let you skip its turn either - I had to reload the game.
<br>- Diplomacy screen - in the list of cities that an opponent owns,  it occasionally bugs out and lists cities that are not even owned by that civilization.
<br>- Notifications - AI civilizations make references to relationships with destroyed Civilizations, as if they still existed.
<br>- If you leave a game to go grab a coffee or something, and come back some time later - occasionally keyboard shortcuts stop working and you have to quit / reload</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6803788">Expand</a></span>

Releasing games before they&apos;re finished should never happen, and when it does, it should never come from a huge gaming company.  There is too much info missing to fully understand all of the new rules/benefits of your chosen path, etc.  I am often declared war on by my OWN country and then suffer consequences since peace with yourself is impossible.  Late game is just boring.  Much more so than Civ V.  Many other problems that should be patched.  This review comes over 3 weeks after release an no updates to speak of, despite so many obvious problems.  Nice way to reward their day one fans with this unfinished pile of crap.  Big fan since the early 90s.  That might change going forward.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6810036">Expand</a></span>

<br>The successful changes to the game are mostly around the logical regrouping of existing features.

<br>The successful changes to the game are mostly around the logical regrouping of existing features. Perfect examples are the districts which coerce the player into specialisation early on or the rethink of happiness (now Amenities) to be local to each city. I also like the intro of support units (medics, obs balloons etc).
<br>
<br>Beyond that, it has been an extremely lazy development. It &apos;plays&apos; very much like Civ 5 and I cannot detect any changes/improvements to the actual game mechanics. This is mostly due to the AI which, as per the other reviews, really does suck. I got caught with my pants down by a stronger Civ while my army was warring in the west. Arabia came by sea from the east and declared war with 8 land units in the sea outside my capital. Rather than disembarking and taking my capital, his units just sailed around without attacking until I was able to bring in the Navy and destroy them all... ridiculous.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not just the battle AI which is bad, the &apos;pathing&apos; has actually regressed from Civ 5. You can no longer just right click your destination tile because the unit will rarely take the shortest path. I actually had it where I right clicked an adjacent tile and the unit went in the opposite direction... took 3 turns to arrive rather than just moving one tile. Seriously guys?? Not for a &#xA3;50 game please.
<br>
<br>The diplomacy - as always - is ridiculously bad. If I want a luxury resource to rent from another Civ, they will generally be looking for 30/40/50 gpt. When they offer money for mine, you can&apos;t negotiate them to beyond 2 gpt.... again ridiculous. The ensuing negotiations are a farce - if you try to negotiate them higher, after they refuse you will not even be able to get the original deal. You ask &apos;what will make this more equitable&apos; and all of a sudden they ask for obscene amounts of stuff.... again, pathetic, illogical, nonsensical AI.
<br>
<br>Finally, it&apos;d be remiss to not mention the new graphics. Yes, they are objectively uglier than Civ 5 and the colours are garish. However, the games is now much quicker between turns while the AI players take their turns and I suspect the down sized graphics may have something to do with this. If this is the case then I think it is a good trade off because you get used to them, whereas long waits are always annoying.
<br>
<br>My final gripe is with the map types. The preset ones were bad on Civ 5 and have received no improvement for Civ 6. They have however, greatly reduced the amount of available map types and have taken away options to tweak water levels etc so therefore you now have fewer to choose from and no scope to improve them. Continents - one of the few maps available - is SO DULL. Always the same, 2 big lumps next to each other surrounded by sea with nowhere to explore. Fractals always makes ugly maps.
<br>
<br>Considering the above you may wonder why my score isn&apos;t lower. Well, as I said, it plays like Civ 5 so its still a decent game but as I said at the start, a total missed opportunity and a lazy development.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6819360">Expand</a></span>

<br>Firaxis team,I respect all of you and your work,but this is not what was expected.please be up to release some super meaty dlcs and fixes to make the series perfect once again.thanks...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6820019">Expand</a></span>

<br>Devs where supposed to merge all the features from civ 5 and brave new world ( like tourism and religion ) and improve them with new style and new ideas ( sadly the ONLY NEW feature is districts ).
<br>The result is really awfull from a to z.
<br>Graphics are a shame. Cartoonish style is totally awkward and destroys the xperience of playing a game based in a real world. Theres no sense of realism whatsoever. U feel  like staring at a treasure map from some comic not to a rich realistic world ( civ 5 did very well on world graphics and they simply downgrade them ).  Graphs from cities are dull. Textures are clunky and boring, also for unities.
<br>THE AI&#x2026; they created a new concept.. AS ( Artificial Stupidity ). No further comments. Is a shame.
<br>Im only talking bout fatal errors otherwise this will be bigger than the bible:
<br>1)	Resources: WHERES gold?.... They ripped the most important resource of human history for social and economy development&#x2026; and ITS GONE. Whaaaat the hell were they thinking ?
<br>2)	Railway. Same. Whaaaaat?.. I mean WHAAAT
<br>3)	Workers can only make 3 actions. Forces us to lose tons of turns spamming them. Whaat?. Doesn&#x2019;t make any sense.
<br>4)	Tourism.. whaaat. Tourism have a huge impact on world economy and civ vi totally ignores that.  For DEV&#xB4;s visionary minds tourism is a number that increases with some bonuses from buildings and archeology&#x2026; dull.
<br>5)	Religion. The most WTFing and shamefull feature.  Seriously? Religion is a nonsensicall set of random bonuses chosen by god knows what criteria. Cities and civilizations changes religion once for turn with the RIDICULOUS AND MASSIVE SPAMMING of religion units&#x2026;  whaaat? Catolics turning to muslims and to budism and then to nomatterwhat custom religion with no consecuences . Religion is historically the first cause for war. Is disrespectfull with real history. Doenst make any sense!!.  Where is religion pressure and expansion??? They already did well in civ 5 why the **** they screwd this up?
<br>
<br>6)	Culture. Same as religion. Culture expansion and culture pressure was pretty ok in civ 5 and they did waaaaaay worse in this game. Wtf
<br>
<br>7)	Policies&#x2026;. Cards?? Random bonuses with ridiculous impact on game. No penalties AT ALL from changing to OPOSITE governments?  Terrible.
<br>
<br>8)	Tech tree. A joke. Ripped most of the historically relevant techs. LINEAR? Whaaat? Arcade tech tree most suitable for a childish mobile game. This an insult to all civ community.
<br>
<br>9)	Combat. Random and nonsensical.  Units in a tile prevent any other unit from moving through that tile&#x2026; even friendly units. So when u are at war u got to lose tons of turns walking around, and u cant deploy your own units properly. Is ridiculous.  Archers and swordsman still destroying tanks? facepalm
<br>
<br>I stop xDD that crap. I played about 15-20 hours. im sick even talking about it.
<br>The only thing with some potential are districts but&#x2026;. U can really get lost between thounds of requirements. U need lots of games and frustration to start to comprehend how to improve the district placement&#x2026; in the end the overall production is lesser than previus games so&#x2026; this needs to be workd on.
<br>Sorry for the novel. Don&#x2019;t waste your money. U better wait for further dlcs&#x2026; or some miracle.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6878781">Expand</a></span>

I keep my fingers crossed that the reason to release it in this incomplete state was not to milk cash from us but rather to accelerate bug fixing based on inputs from broader audience. We&#x2019;ll see in the coming few months anyways, but for now&#x2026;
<br>1)	AI is extremely stupid in single player game. I mean, we hear all the buzz about new technologies, artificial intelligence &amp; machine learning algorithm that adapt to the user behavior &#x2013; well, it&#x2019;s not about Civ 6. I started playing at the King difficulty being experienced player of Civ 5, but the gameplay is too simple and not engaging. I announced surprise war to my neighbor who in the agenda hates this, by stealing the settler. AI had 5 times more army than I and pulled 7 units next to one of my cities where I had just 1 warrior. And guess what &#x2013; nothing followed, apparently they came to have a party or something next to my city, just standing there and ignoring what was happening. In 10 turns and pulled in/build 4 archers and smashed that crowd. What the hell is that? Why do I need to care about diplomacy, city planning, trade what so ever, if I can simply skim through the game by doing bare minimum and still win?
<br>2)	User Interface &#x2013; holy cow, who designed that? The scaling of menus is extremely bad; the notifications during AI turn, so called &#x201C;gossips&#x201D;, simply stack at the middle of the screen covering the game window and other menus, and I always have to wait until they disappear. I don&#x2019;t know if this is an issue of HD resolution but hell, my PC is not strong enough to play it on higher resolutions. The science and civic trees design is horrible and provide little to know information which can be a bottle neck for new players. Also I am missing Demographics report a lot, the new reporting options are oversimplified and does not provide comprehensive picture on where the player stand against the opponents.
<br>3)	Some of the BASE content is missing, like Diplomatic victory mechanics. I mean it is there but it is simply disabled. I am 100% confident it will come in DLC to milk more cash&#x2026; On top, I do miss the ideology mechanics which was extremely powerful tool in Civ 5 to backstab your opponents by converting several other nations to your ideology and smashing the happiness level of your opponent.
<br>4)	The graphic design choice is questionable. Most people including myself don&#x2019;t like it, too flashy colors, too childish and cartoony objects. It&#x2019;s like playing Torchlight after Diablo 1. Anyways, I can live with that but I don&#x2019;t really understand why the game is so demanding to hardware? Apparently the engine is simply not optimized.
<br>5)	I don&#x2019;t like the switch to city-level happiness and housing bottleneck. It forces players to go wide and tall empires are in disadvantage. First 50-100 turns now all about spamming cities.
<br>To wrap up, it&#x2019;s not all so bad, it&#x2019;s still good old Civ but as I mentioned earlier it&#x2019;s far from being polished. I had a feeling that I am playing alpha version, not final release. The best improvement so far is by all means the districts mechanics. It forces you to build more specialized cities and avoid the MEGA city approach although this may be a disadvantage for people who enjoy 1 city challenge. I like the fact there are no overpowered Wonders anymore which eliminate the &#x201C;rush mode&#x201D; to get Pyramids or Great Library. The new government mechanics is also a good idea, although requires some improvements as well because at the moment you can overthrow your governments without any significant impact.
<br>Net, net, if the perfect game is 10, I would reduce it by 3 because of stupid AI and by 1 for the rest of the issues. Civilization 6 gets a 6 score from me.
<br>
<br>Ideal Civ game recipe from my POV
<br>Take from Civ 5:
<br>Visual Design
<br>AI (improve it to make more sophisticated)
<br>User Interface
<br>Culture Tree &amp; Ideology
<br>Take from Civ 6:
<br>City Development
<br>Science
<br>Government
<br>Religion
<br>Military
<br>Barbs
<br>City States
<br>Diplomacy &amp; Espionage
<br>Commerce
<br>Mix it altogether and release!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6780771">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>i never had time to try all the later civilization games, but after reading some rave reviews i thought id give the new iteration a try.
<br>
<br>what a letdown.
<br>
<br>sure, there are some nice improvements, but overall, its simply unfathomable that this is the game they come up with 17 years after alpha centauri.
<br>
<br>i started my first game on the 2nd highest difficulty setting, since i figured i still know the basics from alpha centauri. i played around 15 hours until 125 A.D. of ingame time, and then i just stopped, wishing i could somehow get the time back i spent on this pointless game.
<br>
<br>the first thing i noticed is that the randomly generated map makes no sense. it does not feel real - it has snow next to desert, no logic behind it. any game with generated maps does this better nowadays, and alpha centauri did this way better 17 years ago, having simulated weather, where you could even raise mountains to change rainfall patterns.
<br>
<br>the whole game seems incredibly shallow and tailored to kids. tiles in general only allow one given upgrade, making building improvements a no brainer. diplomacy is completely nonexisting, and so is any form of aggression or warfare. in the 4000 simulated years i played, there was a single conflict that i myself started, when i attacked a city state. it took me a couple of hundred years of ingame time to take it.
<br>
<br>there is no aggression from ai players. they will simply pop up every couple of hundred years with random messages that make no sense. diplomacy as a whole is non-existant.
<br>
<br>really, really disappointed by this. for me, this is just another proof that today&apos;s reviews on big sites, in papers or magazines, are 100% rigged and bought. i will stick to indie games thank you very much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6793172">Expand</a></span>

Despite having a high end system, I get 100-200 turns into some games and it crashes - and continues to crash on that same turn even if I go back 7-8 turns in the auto saves.  Additionally, the patch introduced a flicker to certain colors on my screen if I zoom in more than about 1/2way.
<br>
<br>Overall, there is a lot to like about Civ VI.  With the exception of the newly introduced flickering, the graphics are nice.  The many paths to victory allow one to replay even the same Civ multiple times in pursuit of new types of victories.  The addition of religious wars, although disliked by many, is a kewl new feature.  Allowing one to chain a builder or settler to an army is a nice touch.
<br>
<br>But there are so many issues...
<br>
<br>1)  No Mongols.  Seriously Firaxis?  A game entitled &quot;Civilization&quot;, all about Man&apos;s history on earth ignores the civ that created the largest empire EVER?  /smh epic fail.
<br>
<br>2)  AI is horrible at war.  It starts wars it has zero chance of winning.  It retreats when it should attack.  It too frequently attacks with only 1 unit despite having 10 other units (and almost certain victory in the battle) within 7-8 hexes. It often fails to use units which are even adjacent to enemy forces even when the unit could kill yours. As a war gamer, it boggles my mind how horrid the AI is at combat.  I want to feel like I won a tough engagement but all too often feel like I just beat up a first grader and stole his lunch money.
<br>
<br>3)  It leaves builders and settlers scattered about the map just waiting to get hijacked, even with the sanctuary of a friendly city 3-4 hexes away.
<br>
<br>4) It appears to have no concept of how to conduct naval warfare.
<br>
<br>5) &quot;Islands&quot; are frequently entire continents, connected to both north and south poles and impossible to sail around.  So, despite deliberately picking &quot;Island Plates&quot; so you can play a game in which navies are more meaningful, you end up unable to move your fleets around the globe because most of the &quot;islands&quot; connect to the poles and are not possible to go around.
<br>
<br>6)  The large number of playable Civs (but no Mongols) are borderline false advertising because it seems one can pick any civ and achieve any type victory with similar ease.  Despite what they claim, civ and leader bonuses exert very little influence on how you need to play.
<br>
<br>7)  Even more so than many games of this genre, Civ VI becomes a giant, boring slogfest about 50-60% of the way into it.  You have great fun in the beginning, work your butt off to set your Civ up on as path to victory and are rewarded by being bored to death for the next 30 hours of game play while you mindlessly press &quot;:Next turn&quot; praying for the gasme to finally end so you can start a new one and make it fun again.
<br>
<br>8)  Then again, since Civ VI didn&apos;t see fit to include a Hall of Fame or any other way of recording your god-like gaming skills for posterity, who cares if you finish?  When you finally reach the last turn or achieve a victory prior to the turn limit (very easy for culture and religious victories),, you get whisked away to page giving you a meaningless score and then when you advance to the main menu, all record four win disappears into the ether, never to be seen again.,
<br>
<br>For $60, I should at least get a Hall of Fame to record my best wins.
<br>
<br>And that is the entire problem I have with Civ VI.  It isn&apos;t a $60 game.
<br>
<br>If the game offered a $35 price point I would say buy it.  It is priced almost twice that amount.  In its current state, it is a $35 game asking you to pay $60 to beta test it.
<br>
<br>Wait til it is on a steep sale.  You will be glad you waited.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6818427">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>UI is bad. Weird, slow auto-unit cycling will make you do many accidental moves. In general, it feels like you have to micro manage units more than CIV 5. The amount of clicking required is just off the charts compared to CIV 5. Especially, spying and trading. You would&apos;ve thought that devs would make those little quality of life improvement in this iteration, but no.
<br>
<br>General art style of the game is childish/cartoonish. Leaders heads are ridiculously over-sized, their reactions are immature and overstated, as if the game is trying to appeal to 7-year olds.
<br>
<br>Rest of the game is pretty solid, but immersion is broken by the reasons stated above.

The AI is completely dumb, they attack you with no reason even if you have a much larger army. Also you can&apos;t choose what to do with you &quot;great persons&quot;, they just give you a few bonuses, in civ V you have different options in how to spend your great person.
<br>Overall the game is a bit boring, sometimes at later stages of the game you just have to click the next turn button, it is not well balanced, hopefully it will become a great game after the expansions packs in the future, but at the moment CIV V is a much better and enjoyable game, so is civ IV</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6776326">Expand</a></span>

Examples; I have the military power x3 of one civ and he/she stills declares war on me. In real world, if you dont like superpowers you just shut the f.k up, dont declare war on them. Second, civs declare war on me but since they are dumb, i can turn around the war and they beg for peace. if I dont accept their peace offer, then I will be the warmonger. Shame on you AI testers, ALL of you.
<br>
<br>And shame on some sites too, including metacrticis who reviewed the game in less than 24 hours and give it 9-10. Congratulations, we can expect this much dumb AI in civ 7 now.

<br>And as for the religion, my holy city/religion was wiped out by foreign apostles etc, cant train any units of my original religion anymore. So I am trying to revive my religion with the help of Jerusalem :))</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6772568">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Unstacking cities: probably the best change to the game. I especially like that wonders need their own tile and own requirements
<br>- City states management is more interesting
<br>- Road built along trade routes
<br>- Eureka/Inspiration moments
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- The most important one : AI is still very stupid, even more than Civ5. Combats are boring. The 1upt design requires to spend a lot of time developing a complex AI, which has never been done.
<br>- Difficulty levels: Again, increased difficulty levels does not make the AI smarter but just give them bonuses, which is lazy design decision
<br>- Trade routes: You can&apos;t have a full picture of all available routes from all your cities (only the ones from the selected city) making it hard to optimize. And internal trade routes are too powerful.
<br>- Religion: very similar to Civ5, I still don&apos;t like it but that&apos;s subjective. Religion war is very boring.
<br>- Tourism: bad design as well.
<br>- Spying: looks like an unfinished feature
<br>- UI can be improved: There is less and less reports that show you what you are looking for. For example there is no way to check when your border will grow and which tile will be acquired. Or there is no chart that show the food surplus of all your cities at once. Etc. But I suppose this will be fixed in a future patch.
<br>- Game auto switching to the next unit: hope this can be disabled
<br>- Delegation: why accept opponent request? for the 25 bucks?
<br>
<br>I gave it a 6 so far. Might change depending on patch release</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6772689">Expand</a></span>

<br>Con:
<br>The automatism that civ 5 gave made it a lot better. Removing automatic workers is a pain also the card selections of bonuses towards which government is painful and useless too much information to get submerged into gameplay. Also, the civics and influence spent to research the same as the technology research tree just clusters the gaming experience.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a whole mess that didn&apos;t make this game enjoyable. Will I still play ? Yes just for the fact that I spent money on it will I buy the expansions? Maybe if they fix what they have done to it which I doubt.
<br>
<br>I played over 30 hours already and still don&apos;t get the best of it. It just makes me want to go back to civ 5 and enjoy the game to it&apos;s fullest.
<br>
<br>Pros: I like what they have done with the city states loaning the military when in need is a great addon when you reach a certain level with the state for a certain price of gold but well worth it when you are at war.
<br>
<br>Districts are a cool addon as well to increase military culture science , religion on your territory at the expense of the tiles. But a really cool addon.
<br>
<br>and that&apos;s it! not enough to give a chance to this game, unfortunately, there is too much of a mess to get recovered the civics and automatism of the workers and even those government cards that are supposed to bring this game to another level of detail just does not meet my expectations it&apos;s unfortunate and I hope it is fixable but if not I will just put it aside and compensate on my urge on Civilisation 5 instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6777888">Expand</a></span>

The bad thing is that I dont believe that even future patches can even save it  from mediocrity . I mean we civ players are used to high standards and high expectations from Firaxis and unforunately this time the company didnt deliver. Anyway ....thank God that CIv 5 is still there. I agree that civ games are not all about graphics but .....its 2016 and although I started playing from the first civ back in the nineties when I was 18 years old, I grew up and I also loved all the previous civ games and I really loved the civ 5 with the lovely graphics that except being pretty like a picture , they also help the immersion of the game . So as I understand it , there will be some patches, some dlcs and even an expansion for the new game . Many of the game fans will not follow .
<br>I just hope and I am almost certain that in just 2 years after the original release the project will be concluded and the next time the respected company will take different approach !!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6806598">Expand</a></span>

Realism has always been important for Civ games, feeling like a real leader of a real nation has always been something unique that other 4X games didn&apos;t have. Why then Firaxis chose to go for a this cartoony, goofy art style? They can&apos;t say it&apos;s just because the cartoony map is less cluttered and easier to navigate because the leaders are just goofy, cartoony caricatures of real people too. I understand that for most players the art style of a strategy game is not important but for me personally it completely ruins the experience of playing a Civilization game. The only consolation is it&apos;s not 2005 anymore, Civilization is not the only 4X game on the market.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6775777">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game feels a lot like copy and paste! And it feels like it has been heavily influenced by the games available on mobile (cell) phones. I mean look at the graphics.
<br>The game is running in the back ground but I had to stop to write this as I cant be the only one experiencing this.
<br>Two new concepts. (first is mainly for experienced players, second is universal. Also the second is quite long, so you might want to make a cup of tea now before you get there!)
<br>
<br>One: Districts, which are pretty good I have to say. Good way of spreading specialities and forcing us to really think about the development of our cities, and limits Wonder Production so I can no longer have a really &quot;Wonderful&quot; city (eh eh, see what I did there!) while the rest of the empire actually does everything else! Now a lot of wonders require adjacency to a specific district. More to it but you get the idea. Well thought out new concept, it seems.
<br>
<br>Two: Shocking User Interface. I mean this is bad! Let me elaborate.
<br>*I like edge scrolling, just a preference on these type of games. Now the buttons at the top to access Religion, Great People and all the rest of it are above the threshold for the scroll. Which means that when I am looking at an area or City and want to access the menus, the map scrolls away from my desired location, before the mouse pointer gets to the buttons. I mean seriously guys, was that tested?
<br>*Overlays on Overlays. No more right click to see what resources and terrain a tile has. Just hover the mouse over the tile and it displays info. Great. However problems arise when you get the notifications on the side, which you can also hover over to see what the say. What happens. The info of the tile in the background pops up over the info of the notification. This is so poor.
<br>*The info does not show as updated when changes are to a cities resource gathering. Ie. I select a city, currently has 16 turns to finish building. Select more production based resources. Production reduced to 8 turns, however city on world map still shows 16! I have a screenshot. Why must I wait till the next turn for updated info on world map?
<br>*Rigidity! No longer is information easy to access and generally all in one place. City options can only be accessed (by mouse this is, not hotkeys) by clicking the specific icon. IE, Click a city, you now see its production in a pretty picture telling you how many turns remain. However you can&apos;t access production by clicking it. Nope, you must select the SMALLER production icon to change it. Another example is (and this again is poor) you can&apos;t double click a city and be taken to its citizen screen, instead you must click the city and then again click the smaller citizen icon.
<br>*The most confusing fog of war I have ever encountered. Now Fog can be very disorientating at the best of times, but it shouldn&apos;t be an issue when I&apos;m sat looking at a screen. Instead of just fading, shading or blurring; the areas you have explored but can longer see. You are treated to a nice parchment, hand drawn, tea stained colour looking map. Very pretty, it is. Why the beige? seriously why cant the colour of the terrain under the fog be visible. I mean, a unit went there, saw it is green grassland, so why the beige? I find it actually makes settler planning a little trickier.
<br>
<br>Sneaky third point(s)
<br>*No Personality. You can&apos;t change the name of your leader or empire.
<br>*The graphics are really poor. I want the completion of a wonder to be, well wondrous but the graphics make it look so cheap.
<br>*This game is far too dumbed down compared to other civ games. Bring back everything from Alpha Centuri, I mean everything. Let the players really work it out. Its a strategy game after all so cater to the market instead of trying to be more accessible in order to increase sales. (i expect alot of people to disagree with me on this one).
<br>
<br>I must conclude as I am out of space.
<br>As stated in the opening this is a very confusing experience. It is Civ! it has all the necessary elements for you to be able to enjoy the strategy game. It also comes with a lot of nonsense, as mentioned above.

<br>Score Breakdown
<br>1 For Turning Up
<br>1 For Effort
<br>1 For Sean Bean (got to love Beanie)
<br>1 For new districts feature and because I love Sid Meier&apos;s games (no , that should not therefore be two points. Can&apos;t be trading on old glories!!!
<br>Total 4 out of 10
<br>
<br>No points for: graphics, immersion/customisation, user friendliness (I could raise another point about it&apos;s poor explanations), user interface, the price, for trying to reinvent the wheel when all you needed was new rims!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6906972">Expand</a></span>

<br>So far, so extremely boring. I haven&apos;t actually enjoyed myself yet, just been waiting 3 hours for something interesting to happen. Couldn&apos;t build a powerhouse city if I wanted, couldn&apos;t build an army to conquer if I wanted. Just so so boring.

Graphically, it was a nice upgrade, but the whole game-play experience changed and not for the better.  More city management and expansion at the cost of the feeling of scope that was in previous Civs. I will stick with Civ V until Civ 7 hits.</span>

<br>&#x2022; The introduction of separate research trees (nice in theory but becomes a pain the arse in practice)
<br>&#x2022; Removing workers and replacing them with builders who are limited to 3 or 4 actions before disappearing, requiring you to build more &#x2013; No automated improvements to tiles &#x2013; Seriously!? I&#x2019;m surprised I have to mention this
<br>&#x2022; Expanding cities to tiles requiring the user to individually place minor buildings on tiles (again, nice in theory, but just a pain in the arse when you have halve a dozen cities and want to focus on wars, economic growth, geopolitics and espionage)
<br>&#x2022; Government policies are too convoluted &#x2013; far too many to choose from
<br>Other problems with it include:
<br>&#x2022; A repetitive soundtrack where you want to gauge your ears out. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, the quality of the music is fantastic, it&#x2019;s just that your limited to your nation&#x2019;s them and those who you have met. This means it&#x2019;s on continuous repeat. Over and over again. They really needed to stick with the Civ 4 model of music, changing as you switch between eras.
<br>&#x2022; Some of the models for units are just terrible. For instance the cruise missile ship looks like a **** fishing boat. Particularly after you&#x2019;re used to the size of the battleship that it replaces &#x2013; it&#x2019;s about the size of a fishing boat. Also destroyers look ****
<br>&#x2022; Sound effects for bombing is ****
<br>&#x2022; AI is retarded.
<br>The series is crying out for AI governors to manage cities. Its back to CIV 5 for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=7324479">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Plenty of people who can&apos;t handle change will complain about the graphics (who cares, they do the job and you will cut the animated leaders talking after a few games to stop being interrupted all the time).
<br>
<br>Like all 4X wannabes these days, you will anyway have to wait 3-5 years to get the extensions, mods and a complete game experience. The game also lacks mod support at the moment besides a few UI fixes and customization, so we have to wait until mod tools are released which could introduce some rules variety in the gameplay).
<br>
<br>I had a lot of time to play Civilization VI since release and got rapidly saturated.
<br>More than anything else, the infuriating times between turns are absolutely awful when you go beyond a small map. This removed a whole point in the subjective grade I gave to Civ VI.
<br>
<br>The lack of variety between games is a huge downer. I think the game needs to go further into leader specialization and really think hard about the mid game slog that goes all the way to the end. To be honest, the only motivation to end a game is global thermonuclear war, but once you have done that once, there is not much reason to end a game.
<br>
<br>My biggest critic is the kind of dissociation between units and production / science. Moving your armies should go way faster so the player could actually DO something. Right now, producing units then moving them around is just a time waste considering how much else you could do with these turns in terms of development to your cities.
<br>
<br>I like the workers having only 3 charges by default, it introduces a bit of dynamism.
<br>I wish wonders could be built outside the 3 tiles limit of the city itself. Wonders should be restricted to the territory, not the cities.
<br>
<br>With time, Civilization VI will undoubtedly become a really good Civilization if Firaxis brings as much attention to it as they did for Civ 5, but we will all be paying a high price for the finished game again ...
<br>So yeah, 6, is generous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6843005">Expand</a></span>

A few of the features seem to work sporadically, music and animations have a tendancy to drop out. Graphics are okay but nothing special. Music is nice when it works. Game play is pretty slow and even after 300 turns you might be limited to making one click per turn. I do like the game but think we need to see a lot of improvements in the next few months. AI is terrible, lost count of how many times I have been invaded and outnumbered 10-1 but end up victorious in just a few turns and claiming multiple cities in the peace treaty. I know it is still early in the games life but I have to say that currently the potential outweighs the delivered content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6773557">Expand</a></span>

<br>First impression: a chatty tutorial that can not be saved (ORLY, Firaxis??).
<br>Very old issue: Lack of special resources still completely prevents combat unit production. Stupid. STUPID. My Civi immersion once died long time ago when being forced to build horse carriages instead of tanks ...
<br>
<br>Overall enough fresh ideas for someone who quit after III. Cities now grow organically over the map, no dedicated screen. Craftsmen with limited actions are ok with me, a consequence of playing on the main map only.
<br>I may tinker my own religion. There are now two trees to explore - science and culture, the second for social progress. Fine tuning your own government with policies is nice, the execution as text cards in boardgame style in not. Leaders are generated, providing small boosts but often needing very specific requirements to be triggered.
<br>Overall interesting dimensions, but too much micromanagement for the gain.
<br>
<br>There seems to be no limit to a civi&apos;s expansion, which IMO is a balance issue. Spamming settlers seems a valid strategy. Minor Civs to interact with, good. Initial survival pressure comes from barbarians roaming the lands, manageable.
<br>
<br>New techs pop up very fast from the start, especially as two trees trigger in parallel. Pacing feels strange.
<br>Treasury became an issue for me, with lots of tradeoff, felt ok. Compared to the old CIV also keept troop count lower, good. Units gain experience and may level with a small tree of improvements.
<br>
<br>AI seems stupid; sorry. Not impressed by diplomacy or war strategy yet.
<br>
<br>Overall: Tons of details, but hard to get the big picture.
<br>Will be a nice detraction to explore casually, but I don&apos;t see me spending lots of time with it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6776215">Expand</a></span>

<br>To devs - make more units per tile and it wil solve AI war waging (and it will be more interesting and realistic than wars taking two eras). Make dipplomatic actions more viable for AI, ie coalitions against stronger civs, you wont need to buff AI so strongly.

<br>
<br>It really is hard to not compare VI to V. Civilization V (Vanilla) is such an exceptional game in its fundamentals, mechanics, combat, accessibility, replayability, learning curve, engagement, user interface, etc. The only aspects in which VI outshines V is in a much deeper diplomacy. Almost everything else falls flat.
<br>
<br>The atmosphere in this game is non-existent. Wonders don&apos;t feel rare or great, or give you that sense of accomplishment after completing them. User Interface is absolutely terrible. I should not have to battle the UI when trying to play through the game. If anyone has spent at least 100 turns playing the game you know exactly what I mean. The game feels so dull and dare I say just boring. Who cares if the civic system is more &quot;complex&quot; than Civ V&apos;s social policy system if I can&apos;t even feign interest in continuing to play one more turn? The graphics is just inexcusable for a 2016 AAA series backed by a AAA publisher. I don&apos;t have a problem with the style but the quality is so poor. Its like the graphics were developed by a low budget indie developer. I&apos;m a devout fan of Civ but any review for this game above a 7 is simply not accurate.
<br>
<br>You have to be able to draw and capture the interest of a gamer. This game is not at all accessible for new comers or even many old fans. It has a slow, complex learning curve, and for those with not the interest to keep playing the game they will never learn it because the atmosphere of the game is too uninteresting/unaccesible to get to the intricacies of the new features.
<br>
<br>I would go back to playing Civ V if I hadn&apos;t already spent the past six years playing it. I wasn&apos;t expecting VI to be exactly like V or to even be better than V. I was however expecting it to uphold the exceptional quality the series has made for itself. All of these perfect scores and near perfect scores from both user reviews and critic reviews I have to shake my head at. I can guarantee these are from die-hard Civ fans with just a slight bias. I&apos;m as big a fan of Civ as the next guy on here but I will reiterate this again: any review for this game above a 7 is simply not accurate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6769572">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I overall don&apos;t like the feel of it. The pace is weird. The flow is terrible. It&apos;s slow and messed up. Maybe it&apos;s the inability to be able to queue production. Maybe it&apos;s the fact that you have to constantly interrupt your production to make workers for your neighboring low production cities because they only last a limited number of improvements. Maybe it&apos;s the fact that you have to build districts before you start reaping benefits and feel some sense of progress. Maybe it&apos;s the terrible housing system.
<br>
<br>I hate the housing system that stunts your population growth. You don&apos;t get 1 citizen per tile anymore, no. You start with between 1 to 3 housing capacity depending on conditions and get 0.5 housing per SOME tile improvements (not mines), then SOME buildings will give you few additional housing. Housing is SCARCE in early game. When your number of citizens reaches your housing limit minus 1, the growth rate is reduced. Good luck if you have land with little production, because it then becomes a vicious circle of production deficiency : You need population for more production and you need more production to build housing units to get more population. If you start in a tundra or a desert, you might as well start over.
<br>
<br>Districts aren&apos;t a well executed idea. The concept causes great balance problems. All the buildings you could build in previous games that would allow you to make up for low food and low production environments are gated behind... *drumroll*... population (which is gated by food and housing) and production! Building districts at an acceptable rate requires production, which requires population, which requires food and housing, which requires production. And then, as if that wasn&apos;t enough, districts are gated behind population minimums. Tundra and desert tiles are very hard to play for that reason. Other than the ONE trade route you can get in early game to get more food and production from another of your cities (which is a very bad thing to depend on for food), I really don&apos;t know what to do about that. Nothing in the policies helps with that either. Oh... and you can&apos;t build farms on tundra and hills next to freshwater anymore.
<br>
<br>Great people are given out like candy.
<br>
<br>Civics are weird, annoying and a little too much to think of for very little reward ; The bonuses are plenty in numbers, but they don&apos;t really feel significant or relevant. Everyone is going to have access to the same ones and progress roughly the same way. There is no specialization. There is little punishment if you don&apos;t plan ahead, don&apos;t think things through or make mistakes. You are forced to research civics that you do not want or need, as prerequisites to others that you might want. Being prompted to look at them and switch them every time you are done researching one (often) is annoying. I liked Civ V&apos;s way of doing it better. The buffs were fewer and more significant within the game balance and the choice you made really mattered.
<br>
<br>Eventually, you realize that civilizations have been at war and you were not notified. Well you were, among the 3 messages that last 5 seconds that pop on your screen at the beginning of a turn then disappear. AND THERE ARE NO LOGS for these things. If you miss it, it&apos;s gone. Forever.
<br>
<br>There is no diplomacy overview that I could find. You have to check each civ for its relations with others. THERE IS NO OVERVIEW TO SEE EACH CIV&apos;S RESOURCES &amp; WONDERS.
<br>
<br>The UI is a mess and all over the place.
<br>
<br>There is no indication of how long until border expansion, nor which tile the city is going for.
<br>
<br>The fog of war and unlit terrain are way too much alike. It is way too difficult to see resources on unlit terrain.
<br>
<br>Friendly civs can have units in each other&apos;s territory without open border which makes moving your units around even more tedious and can block your workers from making improvements. This is BS.
<br>
<br>There seems to be no way to tell a civ to piss off with their religion so be prepared to protect your cities with units. There is a new system with religious units that can attack each other... like normal wars weren&apos;t enough and we needed even more warring BS in this game.

<br>It&apos;s time-consuming in a bad way that doesn&apos;t entertain you.like you need to control each and every builder on your own, and they disappear after 3 improvements. That gets very time consuming when you have a big empire.
<br>The soundtrack in my taste is not good at all, especially for Arabia , which had an excellent soundtrack in Civ V. there are a lot of things that I hate about this game, I just don&apos;t want to waste my time writing them.
<br>I just can&apos;t enjoy the game , I am trying to enjoy it , but I guess that&apos;s the end of the road for me in civilization.
<br>In my opinion , this game is a major step back from Civ V , and I think every score above 5 is fake or paid.
<br>Any fan of civilization will agree with me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6774714">Expand</a></span>

Being a devote fan of Civ 5, I couldn&apos;t wait for the day to come for the release, but when it came, my initial thoughts were one of disappointment and disappointment turned to loathing. The ridiculous load times, the lighting which beggars belief... I mean why would you have what appears to be &quot;day / night&quot; lighting in a game that spans time periods in years? Awful twee cartoon graphics of leaders that I just want to punch, let alone play with. Untidy menus, overzealous space bar where you click to end the turn of one unit only to jump through multiple ones. The AI is frankly laughable making odd choices. Oh my god, I so wanted to love this game but to be quite frank, I doubt that I&apos;ll even complete one game with it, it&apos;s that bad. They had every chance to make this ground breaking and honestly you SHOULD break new ground with this game, as you bury it away, forget about it and go back to playing CIV 5.  If Sid Meier&apos;s isn&apos;t holding his head down in shame at this travesty, he isn&apos;t the gaming god I thought he was.  An awful game, avoid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6785441">Expand</a></span>

Different strategic elements are jumbled together and grossly unbalanced. Player can&apos;t optimize the big picture to win. Instead it&apos;s about optimizing the minute details like planning out every move (literally in everything - from unit movements, through tech, policy to buildings) to get the achievement like inspirations for your path on the tech tree, or planning out a city 3 wonders and 5 districts in advance... and than doing the same for 2nd city, 3rd city and so on.
<br>
<br>Graphics are very good, cartoony but it fits the casual feel of the game and music is average. AI is terribly idiotic, diplomacy is meh. It has a minimalistic, streamlined interface which lacks a LOT of important information but it&apos;s also easy to use. All in all, if you just go with the flow and build yourself a farm... I mean a civilization that I think you&apos;ll enjoy it. But if you are for the deeper substance - you won&apos;t find any in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6774180">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- Static, blurry painted backgrounds when talking to leaders instead of the beautiful, dynamic 3d backgrounds we had in Civ V.
<br>
<br>- No unique soundtrack when talking to leaders
<br>
<br>- Animations have to be turned on in the menu, are repetitive, and run at lower fps than Civ V.
<br>
<br>- AI is worse than Civ V. Just to give you an example, if France declares war on Japan, and you&apos;re friendly with Japan, and you declare war on France to defend Japan, France and Japan will just ally and gang up on you. In Civ V if you declared war on a warmonger in order to protect another civ they would act grateful. Not here.
<br>
<br>- Barbarians are far too aggressive and you pretty much have to go for Domination because if you stop producing military units to make anything else you get overrun.
<br>
<br>- Civics tech tree is crap, most of it is irrelevant and it&apos;s pretty much linear with only two branches. Social policies were better, their bonuses meant something it reflected the personality/playstyle of your civ. There was a lot of diversity in what policies different leaders chose. With the civics tree everyone pretty much gets the exact thing with minor differences which the AI will go to war over.
<br>
<br>- Science tech tree is practically gutted and unbalanced compared to Civ V. Like the civics tree it is very linear now, you can just research techs in a straight line to the next era without having to ever research all the ancient era techs. It has probably 1/4th the techs it used to.
<br>
<br>- The new District system is gimmicky and cumbersome.
<br>
<br>- Builders are stupid, they get consumed after building 3 improvements. You&apos;ll spend half the game making builders.
<br>
<br>- The art style is a downgrade. Some people might like it and say it&apos;s a matter of preference but the realistic models and dynamic 3d environments along with the unique soundtracks in Civ V obviously costed a lot more to make.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6775847">Expand</a></span>

The game design is not well thought out.  It&apos;s difficult to manage your cities for strategic purposes &#x2013; tile improvements often offer very little real improvement in food or production, making cities too uniform for production purposes.  Losing builders after three improvements means you have to constantly interrupt  your production in order to make more builders throughout the game.  Even basic move commands don&apos;t make much sense: a unit will show one move left, yet is unable to move to a tile with forest or mountains (compare with Civ 4 where a remaining move just means a remaining move, regardless).  The research quotes are insipid.  You&apos;re even forced to listen to the same opening spiel about your &quot;greatest quest&quot; every time your game loads.
<br>
<br>There are also a lot of bugs, as if the game was rushed for publication.  For example, if you have the scroll function turned on when your mouse cursor nears the edge of the screen, you can&apos;t click on other civilizations&apos; leaders without the screen also scrolling.  Sometimes the game ignores move commands altogether.
<br>
<br>With the exception of the opening theme, much of the music is terrible.  There was little attempt to match music with historical periods or civilizations.
<br>
<br>The game runs very slowly even on a new MacBook Pro with dedicated graphics card, despite the fact that the graphics are nothing special.  My activity monitor shows the program using over 200% of the CPU, which probably points to inefficient programming.
<br>
<br>Another failure, and the last time I&apos;ll play a new Civ game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=7212113">Expand</a></span>

My fav is Alpha Centauri, and from the pure Civs, Civ 2. Civ 6 is basically Civ 5 with its 2 addons, plus even more unneeded stuff added on top. The series is moving in a direction which I don&apos;t like, piling up features that I don&apos;t want. They are tuning for dumber and dumber audience, trying to cash in on converts from mobile.
<br>
<br>The good:
<br>- well, it&apos;s still Civ. If you haven&apos;t played any of the Civ games, Civ 6 is a Civ game, and the tutorial is so friendly and accessible that you will even learn what a turn-based game is, in case you didn&apos;t know
<br>- like in Civ 5, combat is interesting, with units not dying after a single fight, there are adjacency bonuses and exp accumulation like in tactical wargames, just simpler
<br>
<br>The so-so:
<br>- the districts system (taken from Endless Legends), not that it was needed or adds much
<br>- the 2 separate trees for cultural and scientific advances - could have worked easier with a single tree, each tech just costing culture+sci.
<br>- graphics are obviously made for iPad players and kids, from which I suspect a planned port to mobile. I don&apos;t care about graphics much, but I can imagine this will upset many PC gamers
<br>- dragging cards to determine government and social policies - ok but i found bonuses of certain governments pretty strange. And I don&apos;t like trading cards games, so the whole aesthetic of cards being put in slots feels inappropriate here, at least to me.
<br>- city states - didn&apos;t like them in Civ 5 with their &quot;quests&quot; and attitude, though I know some people like the feature
<br>- workers can now only build 3 tile improvements after which they get &quot;spent&quot;, and roads are built automatically by &quot;trader&quot; units - this apparently only slows down construction of tile improvements which isn&apos;t a bad thing but isn&apos;t good either
<br>- some techs get researched faster if a certain prereq is met (e.g. develop Archery faster if killed 1 unit with a slinger) - a good idea at first glance, but adds immensely to the rules bloat (more about that below)
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>- in general, this plays too much like Civ 5 with its 2 addons, barely justifying the purchase (&quot;why not just play Civ 5&quot;?), and sadly carries over all the bad features added in those addons
<br>- still only 1 unit can be on a tile (annoying traffic jams)
<br>- tons of minor effects various things give which are hard to keep track of and which don&apos;t really change the game much. It almost feels like an RPG game where a chest piece gives +0.5% to fire resistance. The multitude of factors to consider doesn&apos;t make it a strategy game where you decide something but rather a tedious simulation with unclear, bloated rules which you mostly forget the next time you start a new game. Apparently the abundance of tiny rules makes the game simpler and takes away decision making. This game is so bloated that I wonder they could even bring it to release! It must have been a nightmare to test, debug and balance
<br>- religion is beneficial, even can be a victory type now, and there are tons of religions to pick from where you customize their tiny bonuses. You produce a &quot;faith&quot; resource which you can use (like gold) to buy things. This is ridiculous. Let temples make 2 citizens content and reduce that to 1 citizen after discovery of Scientific Method or something, that&apos;s just about how much attention religion should get in this type of game. I&apos;m deeply saddened by the fact that they gave in to the political correctness train and started catering these complex games to religious market segments (do they even play Civ?)
<br>- tourism? Even a victory type for it (make more ppl in other countries come to you for a vacation rather than stay home)? This absurdity came in the 2nd Civ 5&apos;s addon, together with a minigame of putting great works of art into slots. But I get it: millions of Chinese are now cruising the world making selfies, so why not make a feature for them specifically.
<br>- the voiced-over texts for different countries which are shown/spoken each time you start or load the game. They aren&apos;t as idiotic as in Civ 5 but the overall feel of &quot;glorifying&quot; the player and praising him for something he hasn&apos;t even done (just picked up the game, haven&apos;t even won it) is stupid. Just check how little you get in Alpha Centauri for winning the game - a simple popup, and a score breakdown list. To me, that feels much more rewarding than this empty pathos.
<br>
<br>As I wrote in other reviews of other Civ games, Bryan Raynolds is not involved anymore (and he is the genius behind AC and Civ2 - the games I like the most). Civ 6 isn&apos;t a game made by passionate geeks who had tons of ideas. It&apos;s a franchise driven by market research. They want more players to buy the game, so they see what&apos;s popular now (e.g. Clash of Clans) and add that. It&apos;s the same thing that happened to the XCom, Fallout and many other games. My only hope lies with indies now. And it seems I won&apos;t have to uninstall Alpha Centauri any time soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6853211">Expand</a></span>

For me the best Civs was Civ 2 and 3 - Civ 5 was good also, but this is another Civ with updated graphics and slightly updated gameplay. AI is still stupid as a trunk. Same units, same technologies. I understand there is nothing to replace tank and spearman in Civ games, but why to make another same game then? What next? Civ 7, Civ 8, Civ 9?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6900980">Expand</a></span>

It has really gotten a face-lift from the previous games in the series.
<br>
<br>Secondly, I really like that Firaxis decided to make something new with the somewhat tedious system of workers in the games and even though I am a huge CIV-fan and have played every single one of them and appreciated the layout in the earlier system, the concept of builders instead of workers makes the game run so much faster and smoother without taking away any of the strategic thinking.
<br>
<br>Now to the negative remarks..
<br>Even though the new way of building improvements at first may seem like a delicate yet clever upgrade from the previously somewhat tedious method there are some serious glitches in my opinion. For one, you cannot, in any way remove/move a district. While this may seem like a part of the strategic depth of the game at first I feel that it would be somewhat more advantageous to be able to move at least certain districts like for say the encampment, seeing as how this can have a great impact on the placement of your enemies cities or your expansion plan, not to mention it would seem logical to want to be able to have an &quot;army on the move&quot;. But this is just a minor thing and I recognize that it may just be my opinion.
<br>
<br>The problem with the AI&apos;s ability to make half-witted to wholeheartedly insane decisions however is a problem in a different dimension entirely. Not only the fact that they seem to be about as trigger-happy as a pawnshop-owner that has been raided by thugs just one time too many but they declare war as(it seems) a statement rather than anything else. I have played the game for about 50 hours or so by now, so, I admit, its not very much, but every 15-30 turns or peace I find myself in a war against an AI opponent on the basis that my haircut offends them.. Or so I assume..
<br>The AI is constantly declaring war, not only without a good reason, but when I line up my defensive units I too often see them coming at me with clearly inferior units, either in number or in way of science. And, if that is not bad enough, at times they actually manage to amount a decent army that should go wrecking ball in my territory, however they just seem to mope around taking multiple hits from my city defenses and garrisoned units until they decide to retreat, barely having scratched the walls and raided AT MOST two improvements. Yet other times, I face no army at all and when I send out a forward party against their cities they have basically no units at all!
<br>Its like the AI declares war upon you based on the basis that there has been peace for too long and thinks the player is bored, but merely does it for show.
<br>
<br>That said, I have some issues that I find falls in between in severity, probably because I&apos;m as experienced when it comes to playing CIV as I am but:
<br>
<br>1. The tooltips for this release is.. lacking just doesn&apos;t cut it. It is non-existent! While this isn&apos;t a big bother for me who has several thousands of hours of gameplay combined on the previous games its really annoying when I find a new feature only to realise that there is no explanation anywhere as to what it does. Yes, google is my friend but really?
<br>
<br>2. While I like the fact that you brought back religious victory in this game, you have to tweak it.. really. It is far to easy to win a religious victory versus the AI because the religious units are simply too powerful. I get the point with inquisitors, really, I do, but then again? They cost way less than an apostle and have basically a VETO against you spreading any religion but mine among my cities. One action(out of three) and everyone believes in my god again. The AI never uses them that I have seen, but if they did, it would just make religous victory pointless again because it would be completely impossible so..
<br>By now, with inquisitors, religion has no other effect than a few bonus policies.
<br>
<br>3. The tech tree and policy trees need some work and tweaking. I like the linear system with both &quot;policies&quot; and tech but the trees in my opinion isn&apos;t really balanced. Also, there are so many policies/techs that could be situational, that you wanna use sometimes on some playthroughs, maybe. But they never end up being good enough in any situation, especially not since you get to change policies every time you discover a new one, completely for free! An easy way to give this a bit more strategic depth would be to bring back the &quot;revolts&quot; from some of the earlier games with the tweak that during the lower tier governments you have longer unrest if you wanna change during a specified number of turns.
<br>Example. Tier-1 2 turns of unrest if changing withing 20 turns at standard speed. Tier-2 1 turn of unrest if changing withing 20 turns.
<br>
<br>Overall, its a decent game. It could be great with the tweaking and a vast AI improvement. Unfortunately I&apos;m a bit disappointed in my overall experience at this time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/user-reviews?user_review_id=6873644">Expand</a></span>
