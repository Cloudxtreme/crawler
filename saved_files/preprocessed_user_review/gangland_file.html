Building up a family is hailed as a huge part of the game, but really the only missions you ever get given to complete are to kill &apos;so &amp; so&apos; &amp; that does become very repetitive with no business or strategy side to it as is also promised on the box. The developers also hailed the action in the game to be based on strategy, strategy being whoever has the numbers of men it would seem. The AI of the computer aggressors always has them running right upto you rather than strategically taking cover so you can easily take 4 or 5 henchmen and clean up anything in your way with them. The games ideas themselves could have been great, except rather than being a great example of all the ideas within it instead feels like a poor attempt at trying to invent a reason into doing the same thing over and over again. Graphically for the system req. it needs it isn&apos;t all that spectacular looking and you&apos;ll often be cursing what you can&apos;t do in the game more than what you can do. The control system is also not what it should be for a game of this type. If you like Mob games then chances are you&apos;ll get some enjoyment out of this, otherwise don&apos;t expect anything groundbreaking as it tries to sell itself as.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gangland/user-reviews?user_review_id=374518">Expand</a></span>
