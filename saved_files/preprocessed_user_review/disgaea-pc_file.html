The character textures were not updated but a filter was added to smooth them which in my opinion makes it look worse. However, you have the option to turn that off. The UI has been redone and also has the option to use the classic version of that but considering how well done the new one is I think that is better. The animations during cut scenes are crisp and clear also.
<br>
<br>They keyboard is a bit difficult to get used to but after about 20 minutes of playing it feels almost exactly like the PSP version. The mouse can be helpful if you want to get from point A to point B faster but as far as combat goes it is very difficult to use. While using it I often canceled my moves or selected the wrong square to move to. It is possible to disable the mouse in this game and just use the keyboard which I suggest you do.
<br>
<br>Many people have already complained about the game not working, which is probably why this game has unfavorable reviews, but I simply messed with the compatibility mode on the .exe and was able to get it to work with no problems. Of course that is with all of the correct redistributables installed.
<br>
<br>As far as the actual game goes it has a quirky ridiculous story but that is not its main attraction. The main attraction is the fact that everything can level up in this game. You can literally take a basic HP pot that restores 100 health and level it up so it restores 10,000. It is the same for every item in the game including weapons and armor. Your characters can level up to 9999 and there is loads of content for people who make it to that high of a level. You can transmigrate your characters back down to level 1 and level them up all over again. It all seems like a bit much but once you get to that level it actually goes really fast the second time around.
<br>
<br>Overall I gave this game a 9 out of 10
<br>Actual game 10/10
<br>-So much stuff to do and will make you want to do it.
<br>-Nearly never ending power.
<br>-Lots of secret stuff to find.
<br>-Awesome ability animations.
<br>PC version 8/10
<br>-Everything above.
<br>-Could have better character animations.
<br>-Mouse is difficult to use.
<br>
<br>Disgaea ruined all of the other tactics games out there for me because it is just that good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/disgaea-pc/user-reviews?user_review_id=6123753">Expand</a></span>
