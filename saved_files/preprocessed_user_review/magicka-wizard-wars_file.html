To complete the disgrace, this game has a daily reward based on your daily wins, so yeah, people will group on pre-made high lvl party and stomp noobs all day farming free wins for this stupid daily reward. And everytime you lose, people will insult you like you commited a crime.</span>

The learning curve is a little steep, but honestly i assume in the future they will have tutorials to teach you more, considering it is still in alpha and they are more on focus with getting the game done. But yeah after you learn to play, each battle will feel different, get some friends to play. And it will be a good time!</span>

<br>The community is amazing. I&apos;ll commonly have duels with people that would stop and tell me how to counter what they&apos;re doing and give me a chance to learn. I don&apos;t know of any other game with people that friendly.
<br>
<br>The only downside to the game is that it&apos;s 110% skill based. 8 elements to combine into unique spells is tough enough, but the real power comes from combining 2-3 spells to get strong interactions between them. This means that if an experienced player goes up against a new player he&apos;ll win every time. Thankfully, there&apos;s a practice mode, and a larger player base now, and new players can face off against other new players and have a great chance to learn.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka-wizard-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=4256450">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Gameplay is incredible, if a little bit hard to get into. You will die a lot but dying in this game is not very detrimental and consequently the community is pretty stellar unlike LoL. Once you know what you are doing and you start playing against others that know what they are doing the game gets incredibly tense with some duels lasting for more than a minute going back and ford. It is insane.
<br>
<br>The other great side is that it is all about skill. Absolutely everything has a counter and there are so many spells and so many different strategies and the action is so fast and fluid that it can be breathtaking.
<br>
<br>Graphics  are great and super fluid, you never feel constrained chaining complex combos and doing crazy stuff. Sounds are pretty good as well.
<br>
<br>Only problem with the game(hence the 9) is that social features are virtually non-existant as well as any bells and whistles when logging into the client. No stats screens, game history, or nothing.
<br>
<br>And finally the servers have been down a lot and even if they are up it literally will take you like 10-20 minutes to get a 5 minute game. The developers have been very forthcoming and great(ive been around since alpha) so I can let it slide but if it doesn&apos;t get fixed soon I will have to lower my score dramatically.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka-wizard-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=4231384">Expand</a></span>

There were a few log in issues at launch, but hey not as bad as watchdogs at least. Overall for a free2play title which is still in Beta its an amazingly polished smooth fun game with fast paced action and good teamwork. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka-wizard-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=4227679">Expand</a></span>

It will challenge you on how good you can perform in a pinch. You must adapt every game and to the styles of your enemies. There is a counter for everything. Button mashing will lead you nowhere !</span>

<br>The community is amazing. I&apos;ll commonly have duels with people that would stop and tell me how to counter what they&apos;re doing and give me a chance to learn. I don&apos;t know of any other game with people that friendly.
<br>
<br>The only downside to the game is that it&apos;s 110% skill based. 8 elements to combine into unique spells is tough enough, but the real power comes from combining 2-3 spells to get strong interactions between them. This means that if an experienced player goes up against a new player he&apos;ll win every time. Thankfully, there&apos;s a practice mode, and a larger player base now, and new players can face off against other new players and have a great chance to learn.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magicka-wizard-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5268382">Expand</a></span>
