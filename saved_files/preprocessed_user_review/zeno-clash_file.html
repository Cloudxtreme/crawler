<br>Gameplay pretty solid, although repetitive; still, it is original enough to keep me playing.  And the story is whack, like i said!  :)</span>

                                        <span> Not for everybody, but if you are interested in the strange and the bizarre, this game is worth your attention. The surreal universe is reminiscent of Dark Crystal, Mirrormask, Labyrinth, and the like. Characters and plot are relatively weak, but the visuals are stunning. Won&apos;t win game of the year, but for 4 hours and $7, it&apos;s worth it to enjoy the setting and eye candy.</span>

I love these creatures.. straight from a twisted fairy tale, in the style of Pan&apos;s Labyrinth. But the gameplay is so extraordinarily constricting. The combat is fun enough, for sure... but this is the most on rails game I have ever played. You basically move from one cramped arena to the next, with unsettling cut scenes in between. The scenes are great, the oddness is great - I wish I could give this a higher score - but the gameplay gets very old very soon. I suspect this is something you will dip into now and again, but an extended session would be much too boring. that said, despite the 7, I do recommend this as a decent $20 spent, simply to experience the great atmosphere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=423750">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t know whether any of you ever played those old Half life 1 games using the old engine, but this felt like a mod fit for the first half life, not the source engine. This thing looks lovely, honestly lovely, but it&apos;s not that great. It&apos;s not really about melee, it&apos;s a hype. Whenever I could I would pick up a gun and shoot whatever was comming toward me, because melee combat in FPS is really borring, it&apos;s always been best suited to Third Person in a 3D game. This isn&apos;t &quot;Dark Messiah&quot;, the melee is borring and repretitive, Id you want a game where you can stab things, punch things and really play with the source engine in melee, really do funny things to your enemies in big beautiful environments with swords and armour and a little RPG thrown in for good measure, without taking away from the fantastic 3PS sword plat, but &quot;Dark Messiah: Of Might and Magic&quot;. Zeno Clash is a lovely looking universe, the story was novel, but it&apos;s been done. Don&apos;t get me wrong I loved the steam punk universe with all the crazy modelling, but the gameplay is flaccid. Here&apos;s the krutch guys, it&apos;s source, and you don&apos;t play with the environment, you don&apos;t do silly things with physics and the funniest thing is, you can&apos;t jump. Thats right, there is no jumping in Zeno Clash. For your enemies? Sure go for it. Not you. This is linear, linear, linear. To give you an idea of how linear, &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot; is less linear. That game was made in 1993. This game was made in 2009. If you want a good punchem-up now, go back and get a Sega Megadrive emulator, now, find a copy of &quot;Streets of Rage&quot;. Enjoy it. If you want weapons and swords and a gorgeous source powered universe, buy &quot;Dark Messiah&quot;. If you want a good shooter, buy &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot;. To cap it, this is one time play through of a game that takes half an hour to complete on medium difficulty. Why won&apos;t I play it on hard now? Because I know the end of the story, it was rubbish. The only thing that kept me in was because &quot;somehow&quot; through this bad 1995 &quot;Star Wars, Dark Forces&quot; &apos;don&apos;t jump&apos; gameplay, was a storyworld that was compelling. Do I want to play the game again now the story is over? No. Waist of my &#xA3;11, I will never play this game again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=423692">Expand</a></span>

Weapons have unlimited reloads and as such means there is no real need for considered strategy other then the formulaic Boss fights.<br>Quite how it managed to win &quot;PCGamer 2009 Game of the Year&quot; (listed on Steam store page) I don&apos;t know - it does not deserve it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=1461594">Expand</a></span>

It feels like there&apos;s a much bigger game in this, but for whatever reason the bulk of it was cut and never saw the light of day. The story makes no sense, and not because it&apos;s bizarre, but rather because it&apos;s missing large chunks. Like the ending. Instead, it&apos;s padded with what I assume was intended to be &quot;weird&quot; and &quot;atmospheric&quot; but just ends up being redundant and irrelevant.<br><br>Other people praise it for its gameplay, which is just about mediocre, but a game with this much potential should not have been written so poorly and ineptly. The characters are flat, boring and uninspired. Every single line of dialogue that comes out of their mouths is exposition, every single action they take serves as a plot point. None of the named characters have any personality whatsoever. This doesn&apos;t make them weird. It makes them badly written.<br><br>Visually, the game fails to deliver. There are several interesting set pieces, such as a beached whale and large walking things, but if you&apos;ve seen a trailer, you&apos;ve seen them all. Beyond that, it&apos;s essentially Heart of Darkness meets Another World. If you&apos;re looking for a &quot;weird&quot; setting and story, try either of those. Both are better written and more fun to play.<br><br>The combat is clunky, stiff, limited and very, very repetitive to the point of boredom. If you&apos;ve fought one large enemy, you&apos;ve fought them all. If you&apos;ve fought one humanoid enemy, you&apos;ve fought them all. Even Father-Mother isn&apos;t all that distinct. Weapons are slow, cumbersome and largely useless anyway, making the achievement for not using any a no-brainer. It&apos;s an interesting idea, to be sure, but it&apos;s so cumbersome it just doesn&apos;t work. If you want a game that mixes weapons and and hand-to-hand combat, try Bungie&apos;s Oni. This is just slow.<br><br>The only reason I don&apos;t give this title the lowest score I can is because I can appreciate the effort and I can appreciate the innovation. There really is a very good, very interesting game buried somewhere in Zeno Clash, but Zeno Clash itself ain&apos;t it. Contrary to people&apos;s opinions, I feel this would have been best served as a big-budget studio title, as they would have been able to spring for a decent writer, talented voice actors and actually a complete game that isn&apos;t padded to extremes and still far too short while missing any real depth.<br><br>Zeno Clash should have been more than Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, and it just isn&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=1464077">Expand</a></span>

Fighting over a weapon on the ground becomes a fight with the controls as the button that cycles your targets is the same button that picks up weapons when you&apos;re looking at them - making it near impossible to pick up a weapon when an enemy is near it. The shooting, while nothing special, initially detracts from the game, but becomes more fluid as it continues. It still amounts to nothing beyond average in this aspect, though. The game is short but challenging, and left me with an overall sense of enjoyment. I couldn&apos;t help but think that the surreal storyline and characters were often weird purely for the sake of weirdness itself. As a first person brawler, it is quietly revolutionary, but this shining aspect is muffled by the storyline, unecessary lock-on system, and mediocre shooting. I suspect that the developers lacked confidence in the brawling aspect, and felt some people may become disoriented by the pace of such close-up action - that would explain why they added so much needless fluff onto anotherwise great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=424809">Expand</a></span>

There are some minor flaws (check out the official forums for a comprehensive overview), but overall it&apos;s an excellent title, and a stunning debut. That they&apos;re already working on free content updates just adds to the value. Recommended!</span>

That&apos;s what it is, and anyone expecting a full-blown original gameplay masterpiece is going to be more than a little disappointed. About the only new gameplay mechanic you will find in this game is a melee system that rarely gets used to its full potential. In fact what little gameplay elements the game seeks to exemplify are muddled by poor, and occasionally, frugal level design. The game is deserving of one accolade, however, and that is the plethora of props and characters meshes produced by the team. It&apos;s just a shame that those same characters do not add any value to game; they remain hollowed peons of a supposedly story-driven game. It is a damn shame, because when I got a chance to play this game at GDC and spoke to its creators, I was getting the impression that there were going to be evolving themes and motifs about perseverance. Instead the game&apos;s story randomly spurs the aid of a &quot;Demigod&quot; of sorts to draw a close to the story. From the lack of growth to the poor gameplay mechanics, it seems that the game falls prey to the ambitions of a group of individuals who halfway through production, realized they did not know the rudimentary rules of proper game design. But, in all truth, I would have rated this game closer to a 7.5. In the end it&apos;s a heavily stylized mod, but it never really pushes its identity past being more than just a mod.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=425432">Expand</a></span>

As such, the combat is repetitive and the levels are very, very linear. Where this game shines is in it&apos;s art. Maybe the engine is the most technologically advanced, but the art direction is superb. Visuals alone, this game is very memorable. The story could have been more fleshed out, and the voice acting is pretty poor, but they aren&apos;t the focus of the game. Those that rate it very low seem to have a very skewed view of art or pass of anything different or weird as bad. I hope to see more from this developer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=740703">Expand</a></span>

I absolutely love this game, and I&apos;m sure anyone else who plays this game all the way through would admit that this is one of the most original games ever made(if not, THE most). Artistically, this game isn&apos;t comparable to many games. The art style is so much different from anything else on the market that it&apos;s arguably as artsy as games get in the visual sense, but when you consider the story and the amazing cinematic feel of it all you can easily see that there&apos;s more to it than pretty visuals and an amazingly realized world. I would compare this to Final Fantasy 9 for holding a special place in my heart, but this game is shrewdly mature(not in an M-rated sense, either). This game is appropriate for teenagers, but adults and older teens might get the most out of the deep story, with its twists and turns, mature plot(I&apos;m gonna compare it to The Watchmen in some regards, and Pan&apos;s Labyrinth in others), and beautiful execution. This is my favorite video game at this point in time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=423652">Expand</a></span>

I initially ignored this title as it arrived quietly and sat in the budget shelves of GAME (UK) stores with little to inform the potential buyer, one YouTube clip later and I had bought the title. Zeno Clash is all the more impressive knowing that as an &apos;indie&apos; title, it comes from a small, little-known developer. It&apos;s a little on the short side and as linear as they come but what a ride.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=1707127">Expand</a></span>

The odd and unique art direction reminds me of the &quot;weird presence&quot; (phrase ripped from AVGN) that some old video games had... that special brand of weirdness that didn&apos;t seem too forced, it was just part of the game universe.  The satisfaction of the melee combat reminds me of old beat &apos;em ups like Street of Rage.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s some bad elements to this retro feel.  The voice acting is a little rough, though far from the worst I&apos;ve heard.  I lived through the FMV fad of gaming for god sake.  Also, if you don&apos;t like linearity, don&apos;t play this game.  This game is ridiculously linear.  I&apos;m talking super old-school, worse than Wolfenstein 3d or Doom (the originals).  That is not an exaggeration.  Those games were far from open-ended but at least had a few paths branching off to the sides.  I could get lost for a little bit in Wolf 3D til I got my bearings.  You will not ever doubt your position for a second in this game.  It is Point A to Point B, period.  The most unrestricted progression you will see in this game is when you backtrack in a straight line to the point you came from.
<br>
<br>That being said, none of that is a deal breaker for me.  Linearity does not equal bad in my book, nor does funky voice acting.  What equals a bad game for me is when I&apos;m not having fun, and I had fun playing this game.  I&apos;ve read and heard other people saying that the control for the melee combat is a bit clunky, and that&apos;s true, but once again, it&apos;s fun.  That&apos;s my cardinal rule for games:  at some point I ask myself, is it fun?  In this case, yes.  I partly believe that what people may be berrating as cumbersome control is actually the weight and feedback of the characters, which I&apos;m enjoyed.  Punching someone has that nice OOMPH to it, especially with the big wind-up heavy attacks.  Pretty satisfying when you connect, the camera shakes, you get a nice loud crunch sound, and your enemy goes flying back into other fighters behind him, knocking them over.
<br>
<br>Weapons are infact clunky like some folks have said but hey... did you notice what game you&apos;re playing?  Emphasis is on melee combat folks, and if you didn&apos;t happen to notice, your firearm is made out of rope and old bones.  I dislike how they implemented the weapons more than I dislike the weapons themselves.  In the actual melee fights, I used the weapons more or less how I believe they were intended to be used:  for a couple extra points of damage as the enemy charges in, tossing it into their face as the clips empty and then leaping forward to finish the job with my knuckles.  My least favorite parts of the game were the linear shooting segments.  Shooting rabbits in a straight line for The visuals obviously aren&apos;t the most breathtaking in terms of prettiness, as this is running on an un-upgraded Source engine, but they still manage to be more interesting and fun to look at than other games that look &quot;better.&quot;  I mean, I would rather watch one of those huge, Dr. Seuss-looking desert creatures lumber around a surreal backdrop in Zeno Clash, more than I would like to admire the latest brown monster run around in the latest brown cave in the latest brown Gears of War game.  I think it&apos;s also important to keep in mind what you should expect from this:  this game launched for 20 bucks, and most places these days you can get it for 15 or less.  I don&apos;t think you should be comparing it to big budget titles.  Personally, I got it on sale for 3 dollars.  What I got for my 3 bucks was an enjoyable distraction for a couple hours, with an interesting if fairly non-sensical story, eye-pleasing scenery and set pieces, and satisfying melee combat.  Far from perfect but a good deal, and surprisingly fun for a budget title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=1723834">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay at its heart is a first person brawler,  with a healthy mix up of shooting here and there.  but the story,  woa ho ho....  man.  imagine a world that was generations deep with inbreeding, as well as cross breeding with chickens and pigs,  and not the cute jrpg way,  but more of a demented master blaster way.  This is the world you&apos;re going to get into with this game.
<br>
<br>I did not like the melee combat at first,  but the story kept me playing, and I ended up finding that the parry hit and run knee to the face smash tactics to be,  well.......    really good.  and by the end of the game I found myself actually wanting to toss my guns down and put my fists up.  It&apos;s short, but left me satisfied.  I hope we see more of this twisted world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=2143976">Expand</a></span>

Zeno clash is a very mediocre game. However, it comes at a time when there&apos;s a bit of a dearth of top class new shooters around, and the mainstream media has been regularly criticised for overpraising mainstream games and underpraising indie games. It&apos;s as if everyone decided this would be the &quot;token&quot; good indie shooter; so they&apos;re praising it very high. But it&apos;s just not very good. There IS no &quot;jaw dropping visual design - Hellbored&quot;; this thing is using the half life engine and it&apos;s starting to look a bit dated. The gameplay is not &quot;refreshing and exciting - Cheatcode central&quot;, it&apos;s shooting combined with kicking and punching. How original. It doesn&apos;t &quot;Stick with you long after you play it&quot; - I was bored within minutes. Basically, it&apos;s just a half life mod that looks weird. The voices are poor; the game was developed in cuba (I think) and they&apos;ve all got weird accents and strange ways of saying things. The graphics, far from being spectacular, are lame; the half life engine was designed for urban or indoor environments and does a poor job of rendering zeno&apos;s fully outdoor environments. The foliage looks awful and the ground textures are poor. Rent this before you buy it - and then you probably won&apos;t buy it anyway.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=423720">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> I highly recommend this game. Every second of it was fun and memorable. I beat it in one night, but it was so good i wanted more.. I kept replaying the challenges I unlocked after winning the game, that helped me blow off some of the anxiety I had from wanting more. Yes, the game is odd, and some people like to bash creativity, but i want more of this weird crap. Sequel please.</span>

What I also hate about this game is that it&apos;s extremely reppetative. It&apos;s just fighting, shoot with your handmade guns, and then, cutscene, loading, cutscene, loading.

You will by screaming at your screen after the stupid auto lock on feature gets you killed the the millionth time. You will be laughing at how crappy the characters look, (tweaked poser models they found around the net.) You will be wondering how many times they will reuse the same exact character that you just killed over, and over, and over again. This game wanted to be Alice; it was not Alice.

After a few videos of interesting combat and questionable character/overall world designs from screenshots, I had no idea what I was getting into, but I can say without a doubt, that I don&apos;t regret buying this title whatsoever. Without spoiling the story, I&apos;ll say this: it&apos;s based on a great premise of originality that we hardly see nowadays, much less an actual story at all, which is one of the main elements that kept me going throughout its long and difficult journey. The combat is amazingly fun and fluid; you punch and kick the living hell out of these awfully disgusting creatures, which is definitely a welcome change to the generic FPS formula, though, it does have some newly designed guns and grenades for you to toy around with, they&apos;re not quite as satisfying as the brawling combat system, but still differentiate themselves from any other random FPS title, though there are a couple of blunt weapons which are somewhat interesting to use, being the only things you can use to even damage tougher enemies, still, none of these things could could even come close to that of the innovative and expertly crafted brawling system. The voice acting among most of the characters, especially that of the protagonist and his companion(s), could have been implemented more thoroughly, but that doesn&apos;t detract from the game&apos;s overall charm whatsoever. Plus, if you want to get more out of it once you finish the short, yet enjoyable story, the game also offers its own Tower of Challenges along with a plentiful list of achievements to keep you throwing punches and landing counter-kicks. And all of this, including the fact that it&apos;s only $10, makes the game worth every penny, I highly recommend buying this amazing indie title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=2561057">Expand</a></span>

<br>How do you even begin to describe this game?
<br>For one, it&apos;s a first person brawler. A brutal one at that. You punch, kick and on some occasions, shoot some sort of gun. It is done in a manner which you probably have not seen in many other games. It can be a tad frustrating but very satisfying when your fist connects to some creature&apos;s face.
<br>What makes this game unique though, is that art direction. It is demented. Chileans are an artistic lot and this games shows it. It is whacked to the point of disturbing yet beautiful.
<br>The story is just as strange but despite the truly alien landscape and characters, you do become engaged in it.
<br>
<br>The only down point is that it is too short. But for what it is, it&apos;s a great addition to any gamer&apos;s collection.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=3127262">Expand</a></span>

Now don&apos;t get me wrong, i don&apos;t mean that in a negative way, it&apos;s just a little out there. In other words, it has to be your thing otherwise you&apos;ll be playing this no longer than 10 minutes.<br>Especially all the different characters bring the world to life. Character design is great as for the modelling. There is so much variation between all of them.<br>So why did i give this game a 5 than? Because i lost interest quiet fast. Each minute i wanted to just quit even more than the moment before. The first person melee action is okay, even though a bit rusty, but i&apos;ve seen it all before in Breakdown on the Xbox and i never got to finish that one either. It just isn&apos;t my piece of pie. I&apos;d rather break some jaws in 3rd person.  Next to that i didn&apos;t like the stage fighting all that much. You&apos;re not really walking through an open world you&apos;re just set against 1 or more opponents in a set stage and you have to duke it out and win so you can continue on to the next level. But worst of all has to be that out of all the awesome characters in the game your character just looks lame. But what&apos;s even worse is his voice and the acting that comes with it. Just awfull.<br>Story wise there is something there but the storytelling itself is kinda weak. It didn&apos;t hold my attention for long anyways.<br>In the end i&apos;ve played for an hour or so and then i called it quits but i don&apos;t think i&apos;ll be starting it up anytime soon. But hey, it only cost me 3 euro&apos;s and it&apos;s still a very creative piece of work. Props for that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=1461423">Expand</a></span>

Nothing is quite so unique in what it tries to be than Zeno Clash. However sadly the implementation of the game is poor. Painfully bad voice acting, clunky controls and often there are battles that, while not difficult are just frustrating based on the tactics you have to use taking forever. There is one particularly long and unnecessary on rail shooting portion that was easy, but so long and boring I wanted to cry.
<br>
<br>The combat system IS fun, but the implementation does feel off. IF its on sale I&apos;d say pick it up if you like the idea of a unique hand to hand combat system, otherwise pass this game over.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=3225944">Expand</a></span>

You go around in a very weird and interesting world punching people in the face and sometimes shooting them with the strange gun. The world Zeno Clash is set in is very strange and you immediately want to know more about it, but you never will. The story is hard to follow and makes next to no sense. It&apos;s also unfortunate that the combat quickly becomes repetitive. Even though the story is only 3-4 hours long, by the end you will be tired of executing the same moves over and over again. In the end, Zeno Clash is a huge waste of potential that could have been so much more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=3869147">Expand</a></span>

It does get boring after awhile, but on Hard Mode it was still pretty fun. You can&apos;t reload while running so sometimes it got frustrating and i just tossed the gun and fight hand to hand. I think thats what they wanted you to do in the first place anyways. The story and game itself is solid but it feels more like a really long demo than an actual game to me. Visuals are good but you dont get to really explore too much and level design is pretty straightforward linear paths. overall, good solid game to kill some time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=3055762">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Zeno Clash is cool to look at, but not fun to play, therefore it fails as a game. Perhaps Tripwire Interactive (the wire bit needs to go) should have made a short animation movie instead.</span>

This entry is pretty fun, but it lacks the quality of storytelling, free-roaming mechanics and of course, 2-player coop. However, it is significantly more straightforward (and thus, shorter), and the guns can be reloaded, though they have a habit of being knocked out of your hands. They do less damage then in the second game, and the hammers are much more awkward to use. Generally it&apos;s much easier to just punch things- except for the obnoxious heavy fights, which require you to use the hammers.
<br>
<br>Still, without having played this one (or had someone explain the premise), the second game really would not make a lot of sense, given the weirdness of not only the setting and asthetic but the morality and motivations of its characters. Collectively, the series is certainly the most unique thing to come out of the Source Engine, and worth playing. I would advise you play this entry before the second game, however.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/zeno-clash/user-reviews?user_review_id=7232778">Expand</a></span>
