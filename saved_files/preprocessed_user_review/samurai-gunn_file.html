I am in game development and had an idea to make a samurai one-hit-kill game. It&apos;s a good concept and Teknopants did a good job. It&apos;s Super Smash Brothers without the complexity or button mashing. It was released with a few bugs, but they are being patched. Now, you will notice that some people will say the lack of online multiplayer hurts the game&apos;s score, but I think this is a good thing. This incourages people to be more social in real life. Also, online multiplayer is bad for fast-paced fighting games like this, because a little bit of lag can go a long way.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, this game is a must buy. Well, I guess I have to make something else. Stay tuned for a game by me (Hydro Cobra).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/samurai-gunn/user-reviews?user_review_id=3878507">Expand</a></span>

<br>Here&apos;s a list of the stuff that should be in the game but somehow isn&apos;t:
<br>- replays
<br>- an option to base spawning on the proximity of the enemy, so that you won&apos;t spawn near players and be able to instakill them just because you got lucky.
<br>- tournament mode in which you choose how many matches you want to play and the winner will be the one who wins the most. There could be some stats shown between each match. You could choose which levels you want to play or have the game randomise them.
<br>- an option to play continuously, without being thrown to main menu after the match.
<br>- an option to choose whether I want to see the menu instantly or wait for it to fade in (the former, the effect is cool the first time but it&apos;s tedious to wait for the menu to pop up after being thrown to it after a finished match).
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t recommend getting the game at it&apos;s basic price. It&apos;s really fun and has a great soundtrack but at the same time it feels like an early beta at this point. Wait for a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/samurai-gunn/user-reviews?user_review_id=3921310">Expand</a></span>

<br>All of the above relates to playing this game with others. This game is sweet when you&apos;re playing with friends, but not so much when you&apos;re on your own. I regret my early review of the game, I don&apos;t think it was fair.

<br>The only negative I&apos;ve heard thrown around is &quot;lack of an online multiplayer.&quot; But the game simply *would not work* online. Even a little bit of lag would ruin the game from the inside out. I *prefer* local multiplayer for a game like this. Teknopants has taken a somewhat controversial stance on this, for his game, consistent with his design for what the player should experience, and I support it 100%. It wasn&apos;t a decision made lightly, and there is no solution short of speeding up the internet as a whole to the point where average pings are at the level of LAN play, and are as consistent. But that rather goes without saying, doesn&apos;t it?
<br>
<br>So, assuming you&apos;re convinced that the local-only nature of this game is not the fault of the developer, you should be asking, &quot;Are there any other problems, negatives or downsides?&quot;
<br>
<br>No.
<br>
<br>F*cking buy this game, right f*cking now. It is amaze-balls. If you have at least one friend, you *will* have the time of your life cutting each others&apos; faces off. Guaranteed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/samurai-gunn/user-reviews?user_review_id=3941800">Expand</a></span>
