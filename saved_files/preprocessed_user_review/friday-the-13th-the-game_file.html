<br>Now released and advertised as the full game, it&apos;s still in a state that could be compared to a beta test. Missing promised additional content and the content that is available is fairly limited. Charging full price for a game that feels unfinished, promising to patch in features.
<br>
<br>This kind of behavior gives indy developers a bad name. What the hell did they do with the $800K dollars plus all of the pre-order money?

<br>
<br>You essentially paid 40 dollars or more if you pre-order and could not play it the first week. And for the console users, especially the xbox vers. people still can&apos;t play the game. I don&apos;t understand how can you pay full price for a product that doesn&apos;t work. They had over millon dollars to make the game and even more with sales. So, how is this ok? If these developers actually cared about their product, they wouldn&apos;t have released it in first place until it actually works. You would only release it for more money and use the players as game testers.
<br>
<br>Also, this game has game breaking bug, where Jason flies out of map and dies. Sometimes it was just hitting jason, using sweater in doorway, grabbing people in fireworks or shooting a flare, and other random reasons. They still haven&apos;t fixed just seen recent video of it. There is another random bug where u can&apos;t pick up or use items.
<br>
<br>Onto glitches, there are soooooo many glitches in this game it is ridiculous and they are not just minor graphical glitches. These are invulnerable or hiding spots just waiting out 20min timer. You can trap glitch to rooftops, bridge glitches, glitch into and on top of walls, invulnerable glitches like flying, outhouses, wardrobes, and boats. There is car flipping glitches that happens randomly.
<br>
<br>In order to get access to other characters, jasons, animated kills, and perks, you have level grind and farm virtual currency. This rewards invulnerable,  hiding spot glitchers, teaming with jason, point farmers, and other toxic gameplay. This is fastest way to level for least amount of work. Had they removed mindless game mechanics of leveling and virtual currency gambling slot machine for perks, then there would be no reason for these types of toxic gameplay. Why wait 20mins in glitch spot, point farming, or go invunerable, if game doesn&apos;t reward it. You would just be wasting your time.
<br>
<br>Also, they added -1,000 exp for team killing which is dumb because team killers don&apos;t care about leveling. Team killers care about griefing. This only punishes players from trying to save people with shotgun. Now there&apos;s no point in risking, which kills the team play. Seems like developers have any clue what they are doing.
<br>
<br>Lastly, their only consistency is that their patches and updates only seem to make the game worse. The recent patch freezes and crashes more often on loading the game. It&apos;s all over forums and even streamers are having same problems. I really don&apos;t see how any honest reviewer can give this game 10. When majority of time you are not playing game because you are trying to find a with decent ping, a group who speak english and has a mic, loading game back up because of crashes, or waiting in observer mode 10-20mins because you spawn next to jason with no items and died.
<br>Just wait for summer sales and probably the game will be fix by then.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=7371872">Expand</a></span>

Currently buying perks are unavailable, making it almost playing each game as a counselor with using nothing but the bare bones default perks, which sucks. Had several glitches where hopping off a small ledge had me floating in midair, which is obviously a game breaking bug. There is a problem with saving your profile data and the saving icon animation remaining on your HUD throughout the game. Jason is more or less OP and if you know his controls well, you can pretty much take everyone out without any much skill. As with unlocking counselors perks, you have to also unlock Jason&apos;s kill animations. His basic executions are a crotch shot with an axe or choking them out starting out. This makes it boring to kill every other counselor the same way, although there are few environmental executions you can do that are spread out across the map. The Xbox One version currently is still in &quot;broken&quot; stage without the day 1 patch that both the PS4 and PC users have already received.  This game is definitely not worth the $40 price tag. Either wait for a price drop or find a better game. I&apos;d advise on the latter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=7329597">Expand</a></span>

<br>Apart from that, the game itself is okay, despite some big flaws like:
<br>1) no separate queue for killer and counselor, meaning people who don&apos;t want to be counselor get assigned to counselor and then just leave, making it a lot harder for the team
<br>2) friends can join as a group with one of them killer, resulting in a very common occurrence of killer being friendly towards some counselors +/- the friend counselors disclosing non-friend counselors location to the killer
<br>3) no text chat or prerecorded voicechat, meaning without a mic you have quite a handicap (and also if you have teammates without a mic, you still have a handicap even if you do have a mic, because teamwork is quite important)
<br>4) various glitches/bugs/exploits. They are being fixed, but others are introduced at the same time (currently, the game tends to freeze/crash about once every 2 hours for me)

<br>
<br>Another thing that is kinda worrying is that they keep saying &quot;We aren&apos;t AAA&quot; but they priced it at digital AAA pricing and raised 2M+ in Kickstarter and SlackerBacker funds and delayed the launch significantly. Then they say &quot;We are just a small team&quot; Illfonic is not a small indie development house from what I can tell, they used high level outside contractors (all covered in their updates and twitter feeds) like Art Bully and Gunmedia is a moderately experienced team as well.  The level of weird on this is hard to ignore when seeing the quality of the game.
<br>
<br>I would wait for a price drop or at least until servers are working and single player is out.  Streamers are having fun but have a headstart on the community in terms of perks and levels (There has been no reset before launch).
<br>
<br>So avoid until they either prove singleplayer is fun or wait for a sale if you only want online play.
<br>
<br>Hope they fix it in the coming days and that the community isn&apos;t dead on arrival.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=7325120">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So After 10 hours in the game &#x2013; I can say fully that Friday the 13th is one of the my dissapionmets of 2017. even more then Outlast 2. And I&apos;ll explain it with eveything.
<br>
<br>Firstly, the benefits. There are 3 maps, and they are huge with a lot to explore in each house. The ways of escaping are largers, you can call the police and wait a couple minutes for them to come, and you can find some pars of a car/boad and escape. there are many consulers and jasons but they are not pefect and I&apos;ll explain it later. the soundtrack is gorgoues as final for the benefits.
<br>
<br>now what about the cons?  As a start &#x2013; the graphic is terrible with so many unfinished places to take care of. There are many many many many many bugs and lags. the server crused me at least 7 times since I&apos;ve begun to play. The animations&apos; faces maybe funny but getting tired after a couple of times when Jason is running after me and I&apos;m with a face of **** I&apos;ve **** to do and a murder is after me&apos;. now, this is fine, but it&apos;s happening even when Jason is not chasing me, and i&apos;m opening a door with the same **** faces, jesus. oh yeah, the lags are very effectives in the game, when you open a door and the door is opening where your hands aren&apos;t there, the same goes when Jason grabs u. The thought of the way the fatalities are manage, are great, but when it actually done (in actual fact) it looks so awful. the delay of the animation kills is a beginner developer and if you think it&apos;s like Mortal Kombat X, it&apos;s not even close. The &apos;Tommy Jarvis&apos; charactor isn&apos;t special at all. the only differences btw u and him, is that he has a shoutgun with one bullet that isn&apos;t help much (even at all, when you nervous and aiming the gun against Jason who is closting to u,  you&apos;ll notice that you won&apos;t harm him because u missed from stress) and is stealsh at 10, something that is good, but has for other chracators too. I&apos;ve played more then like 70 or more matchs, and my chances of playing with Jason were all so less that I had more chance to win in the lotto. Some sad things: You cannot change anything in the keyboard and mouse settings. The developers aren&apos;t letting u until they&apos;ll release an update that letting you rebinding. You cannot run evn a little bit. If u run, your stamina goes down, and if you&apos;ve wated all your stamina and Jason is chasing after u &#x2013; your chances to get out alive is like I&apos;ll have more chances to play with Jason all the time &#x2013; and it&apos;s not happening at all.

Do not buy for at least a year or until they get a grip of this. Shame on you developers for treating the people who took a gamble to back you in the first place and you turn out not only a dog mess but provide no support to the kickstarters who backed you. Caveat emptor people. The only thing that will kill you in this game is NOT Jason Vorhees - it&apos;ll be frustration and boredom and sitting watching a **** awful load screen for hours before the game crashes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=7332023">Expand</a></span>

Also, with private matches being viable for experience and leveling, all you need to do is have a group of friends and the fun will not stop. A working Mic is definitely a must! I think it is worth 40 bucks, bc I&apos;ve been playing it non-stop for 3 days. Longer than I have a lot of single player games. If you wait for the price to drop, well I don&apos;t know if the game will have peaked by then, bc it&apos;s a pure MP game. The developers seem to be on the ball! Have some patience and take the risk, if you don&apos;t die laughing then maybe this game isn&apos;t for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=7328099">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m going to compare this to a recent asymmetrical survival multiplayer game called Dead by Daylight, which I liked too.
<br>
<br>Friday takes a more realistic approach and forces you to fight for your survival, find car parts and fuel, or find a propeller for a boat, or you can call the cops, or you can call Tommy Jarvis and his shotgun to save the day. Either way, it&apos;s way more challenging and more about avoiding Jason and searching houses for supplies. It&apos;s not just about repairing 5 generators each and every single game to open the exit gates. There many other gameplay elements that are unique and can&apos;t be seen in Dead by Daylight. For example - the ability to disturb or even kill Jason! There are many weapons which can be used to stop Jason for a limited time - for example, flare guns or crackers can be used to stun him, knifes can be used to save yourself if Jason grabs you. Shotguns can stun Jason too. Whereas, you can&apos;t do anything to the killer in Dead by Daylight.
<br>
<br>From Jason&apos;s perspective - it&apos;s a very intense task to hunt the campers down and then kill them by hanging them on a tree, throwing them out of a window, choking them etc. There are a lot (and when I say a lot - I mean REALLY A LOT) of animations that were recorded with motion capture that are brutal and satisfying at the same time. And playing as Jason isn&apos;t that easy as it seems. Each Jason has his own pros and cons - one can sprint and the other one can swim and use his abilities way faster. Each of them has his own weapon which has (again) has its own killing animations.
<br>
<br>As the game progresses, Jason becomes more and more powerful, while you might be able to escape him in the first minutes, he sure will come back for you as soon as he&apos;s able to use more powerful abilities to make sure you die brutally.
<br>
<br>Well, that was a description of both sides - campers and Jason. Other things I&apos;d like to point out are - great matchmaking, able to find lobbies with friends in a few seconds (max one minute) - compared to Dead by Daylight&apos;s &quot;Survive with Friends&quot; mode, which forced us to quit the game as waiting for 10 minutes and then realizing the host has left wasn&apos;t very entertaining. This game uses dedicated servers too, so it doesn&apos;t depend on host&apos;s connection - less lag. Progression system isn&apos;t that bad either. It doesn&apos;t take hundreds of hours to get all the perks you&apos;d like to. Another thing I liked is balance. I think the game is just in the right place concerning the balance between the two sides - Jason is very powerful, so don&apos;t mess with him, though if you co-operate as survivors, you might be able to outsmart Jason and save each other.
<br>
<br>Now, let&apos;s talk about the game issues. And so far, the only issue I see is bugs. There are, unfortunately, quite a few of them and sometimes they make the game unplayable. I&apos;ve also heard there are many issues with even launching the game at launch. But it&apos;s understandable to have such issues at the game release and I hope the developers will make sure to make the experience as smooth as possible.
<br>
<br>One more thing I&apos;d like to point out is the game price. Yes, 40$ might be a lot for some people. But don&apos;t forget about the server maintenance costs and the singleplayer campaign that&apos;s coming out this summer. Yes, you&apos;re right, a singleplayer campaign.
<br>
<br>Overall, I think it&apos;s a really good game that will entertain me for a couple of hundreds of hours. You should definitely try it out. 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=7324886">Expand</a></span>

But as a huge fan of the Friday the 13th movies I must say this game is one big fat sexy LOVE LETTER to the film franchise.  They absolutely NAILED just about everything you can think of.  Jason&apos;s design and infliction of terror are absolute PERFECTION.  Playing as a counseler makes you feel as helpless, weak, and sometimes stupid as one of the characters in the movies.  Why do people think that is a bad thing?  This game isn&apos;t meant to be competitive per se...it&apos;s meant for a bloody good time.  And that is most certainly is.  Some games play out like a little mini movie and those make for some of the most tense, engaging, and surreal bit of gameplay I&apos;ve experienced since the first Left 4 Dead game.

(which have only gotten better now) I have to say this game really surprised me. There seems to be a good balance between the counselors and their abilities. I have seen many complaints about not having a chance against jason but I think they missed the point! You really are supposed to be at a disadvantage.  I have been playing mostly as a stealth character and while I am not very good and I don&apos;t bother to learnt he &quot;pro&quot; strategies , my survivability has been pretty good,
<br>I find myself in tense moments trying to hide, hoping Jason doesn&apos;t see me, hoping after I stab him with the pocket Knife I can jump into the window of a nearby cabin and escape!
<br>
<br>TOO much fun! watching and playing game is so much like watching the best version of any of the movies. Play Jason is of course tons of fun but its also fun trying to escape him. I really think you should give this a try if you have some disposable income and like to get your heart pumping!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=7332109">Expand</a></span>

People complain that this should have been resolved during beta, how is that possible when there wasn&apos;t 75k people playing in the beta?  The devs have not only been working on fixing the issues but they have been very transparent and providing updates.</span>

I was curious about this genre from some time ago, I enjoy watching streams of Dead by Deadlight, but the fact that a Friday the 13th was getting a new game made me jump into this one ASAP! I didn&apos;t get to play the beta, but I pre-ordered the game and played it as soon as it was available at midnight..
<br>
<br>My experience has been great, the game is tons of fun, me and the strangers that I&apos;ve found on random parties are having a great time doing all kind of jokes, screams, laughs, drama, etc. It has been a wonderful experience. Since last friday I&apos;ve played 15 hours, that is way too much by my personal standar. I read about the database loggin error that make people ask for refunds a day after it was released and yes, it happened, I got the error but it was not nearly as bad as people was saying. I got that error on Saturday at 11 pm until they fix it on Sunday morning, other than that I&apos;ve been playing on daily basis and it plays like a charm! The matchmaking works great, no lag, no disconnections so the game launch has been far frmo the hell some users claim.
<br>
<br>Now onto the game. This is an asymmetrical game, you enter a room with other players, one of you plays Jason and the rest the counselors. The game game generates a random map with different layouts, the cabins, the highway, the boat, the car, etc. Then you have Jason trying to kill them all, while the rest of the players has to escape or survive. This can be achieved by doing different things, and this is one of the differences with Dead by Deadlight, while in that game you have to turn on the generators to open the exit and escape, in Friday the 13th you can escape by car, by boat  or calling the police with a radio and running to them, but not before you fix those things,  you have to fix it first and the parts are across the whole map. Also you can &quot;win&quot; surviving Jason until the match is over and it is also possible to kill Jason, but that is not easy task,  There are different items like your flashlight (always with you), a map, pipes, machetes, pocket knives, gun flares, shotgus, bear traps, etc. and any of those items can be the difference between life or death. On the other side Jason has different skills that make him overpowered (like it should be), most of them are amazing. You will unlock new counselors, the Jason from different movies, etc so there is some character progression, both for the counselors and Jason, and different versions of Jason have different skills. You can also personalize slightly the look of the counselors as you progress.  The game is brutal as it should be, Jason&apos;s finishers are as gory as it gets, Jason will use his hands or weapons, and also he will use the enviroment, no matter the situation they are very creative with the kills.
<br>
<br>The game is not perfect tho, it looks good but there are some weird animations, even comical, not sure if someone could be bothered by this, I find it funny, it is one of those weird occations when you don&apos;t know if it was on purpose. Being an asymmetrical game every match feels like something new, even when it has the same goals. I hope they expand on this game, they should add customization options, perks, characters, maps, etc. At this point there is the single player campaign confirmed and coming soon, so there is more content comming.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m having a great time with the game and to be honest it comes as a surprise, I was worried about the game and never thought it could be this fun. Most things are great, some things are rough or not very polished, but the result is really fun. This is comming from an avid gamer and a fan of this franchise. Friday The 13th for the NES in 1989, so I&apos;m very very happy to have another Friday The 13th game after almost 30 years! And that was a mediocre game, because the new one is good and tons of fun!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=7333747">Expand</a></span>

I have spent 35 hours on this game and I am still enjoying it! Many critics are bashing the game for the server issues that it had at launch and the minor (not game breaking) bugs. Every game experiences server issues in the first few days of a release. Game developers should have the infrastructure to handle a large volume of traffic and devs should create games with no bugs.. but this day in age those happen to be unrealistic expectations.
<br>
<br>The developers have been working on these issues and majority of these issues have been resolved. The developers made sure they kept their fans up to date on what they where doing (through social media). Thumbs up to the devs for doing this!
<br>
<br>Jason is strong. As he should be. Is he too strong??? Maybe, but it&apos;s also hard to say this early on. Time will tell. Friday the 13th would not be a good game nor movie (s) if Jason was easily stopped. You will DIE more often than you will escape. Keep this in mind! If you don&apos;t, you will not enjoy this game. As a survivor you will be given customization points to unlock new perks. Early on, you will be extremely weak. Therefore your chances of survival are lower. As you unlock perks your chances of survival increase. The kill animations are fantastic. Jason will rip off your head, arms, punch a hole right through your chest, just to name a few. This makes for a bloody good time playing as Jason. The only downfall is Jason is randomly chosen. You have a 12.5% chance on being Jason. Therefore, you usually play as the counselors (still a good time).
<br>
<br>The counselors have 4 ways they can live. They can call the police (escape to the police), escape by car, boat, or wait for the timer to run out.
<br>
<br>The devs did a great job recreating the Jason films. What do you mean by this? Well essential the films and the game are no different. You have Jason running around killing teens. You can truly tell the devs are true fans of Friday the 13th.
<br>
<br>I recommend picking this game up if you are a fan of Friday the 13th.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=7341796">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It runs terrible most of the time. Jason can resort to cheap tactics such as shift grab which is you play as one of the slower characters is un avoidable.
<br>While on the topic of Jasons grab it can be near impossible to get free from it. I main Vanessa who is one of the faster characters and if Jason grabs me I typically die within seconds of the grab, I hope Gun nerfs the grab... Other than that I would say the balance is decent. Still a few issues but nothing too terrible.
<br>
<br>The main issue is just how boring the game is when Jason is not chasing you, the game literally turns into the most boring scavenger hunt since the 2017 white house easter egg hunt. I spent nearly 15 minutes without Jason finding me (I wasn&apos;t staying still I was just running yes running from house to house trying to find the stuff I need)
<br>
<br>The game is also glitchy as all hell.. Literally I was in a tent hiding when Jason hit the back of it at which point I jumped out as fast as my character could and it launched me into the air where I stayed for the rest of the game just literally floating above the map (I will admit this made for some awesome eye in the sky viewings of the kill animations but it removed the tension and fear as I was literally unkillable). On top of that glitch I also experienced the dreaded Database Login Failure which plagued me for the first two days of the games launch, and after that error was sorted out I was unable to level up for a further two days... No this may seem like a non issue but try playing a game against a level 30 Jason with high tier kills with the base Vanessa without any perks, Trust me it doens&apos;t work well at all. It&apos;s about as effective as hitting Michael Myers with a spoon.
<br>
<br>However I will say that this game is only entertaining to me when me and a few buds team up and play it. When I solo play I just get so bored and annoyed at how unbalanced the game is and how some teammates don&apos;t communicate and leave in the car on their own. This game works well with friends... there is nothing more satisfying than killing Jason with a team of friends that communicate well.
<br>
<br>Another issue I have with the game is the music. Sometimes Jason&apos;s combat/ stalking music will play when he is on the complete opposite side of the map. This is super infuriating because it will make me stop whatever I am doing and hide, I get this at least once a game.
<br>
<br>Now on to how the game looks itself, this game is created in the Unreal 4 engine but it looks like it was made in the Unreal engine 3. The textures on Jason himself are actually the best textures and animations in the game.... however the counselors look even worse than Mass Effect Andromeda&apos;s Ryder did. Chad in particulat looks just I have no words to describe it... Oh wait I do DATED.
<br>The faces and animations look dated. I mean Assassins Creed 2 had similar looking faces.... I mean I get it the characters are sweating from fear or whatever but there is no way a human face is supposed to look shiny and well... I guess like Play-dough.
<br>All the counselors look like they were molded from clay. I would even say some of their faces looked better in the beta. Yes looked better in the beta.
<br>
<br>I mean at least you can get a few laughs out of these horrendous faces and glitchy animations.
<br>
<br>Oh I haven&apos;t even mentioned the glitchy fighting mechanics... Doesn&apos;t matter what weapon you use the hits might not register sometimes. For example I was in the combat stance with an axe (the most powerful weapon in the game bar the shotgun) right in Jasons face and hit him with it. I got the fight back notification and the stun one but somehow Jason was still able to grab me and throw me through a window without actually getting stunned. The game expects you to fight Jason when you are cornered but it rarely works. I mean holy hell how do you expect me to fight and stun something that doesn&apos;t even register my hits.
<br>
<br>I will admit that some weapons like the shotgun and flare gun work almost without fail. A lot of work must have went in to ensuring the accuracy and reliability of those weapons. I commend them on that... but that&apos;s about all I can praise without a single complaint.
<br>
<br>Now this may seem like I hate the game... But that is far from the truth. I just find it horrifyingly dissapointingly bland, boring, and the worst of all it&apos;s offenses is that it&apos;s disapointing. It claimed to be the Dead by Daylight killer but that game works better and is waay more balanced, but even that game is far from perfect..
<br>
<br>In conclusion I would give this game a 3/10. I cannot recommend this game for this price. $40 for a multiplayer only game is a bit steep since it only contains 3 maps and one game mode. Maybe get it on sale if you&apos;re friends have it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=7332439">Expand</a></span>

Negative reviews seem to be from people who had a bad first experience and then stopped playing after that. It&apos;s a little glitchy right now since it just came out, but nothing game breaking. I highly recommend this game if you&apos;re a fan of horror multiplayer style games.</span>

It&apos;s a lot of fun to play with friends. I&apos;ve spent about eighty hours on this game, and I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;ve wasted a minute. The only reason this isn&apos;t a ten is because of the server issues at launch.</span>

<br>Now they are about to go crazy with paid DLC which adds very little to the actual game.
<br>
<br>I had backed this game prior to release by buying it, Virtual Cabin, clothes and savini jason. Virtual cabin stopped receiving updates the minute they released the game and the clothes DLC was just a couple of bad reskins. They just announced Virtual Cabin 2.0 free with single player, meaning i paid extra for nothing.
<br>
<br>The game is still buggy as hell and the majority of ingame players seems to be some angry chinese or russian kids of which will rage quit when something they didnt like happens. They will only be happy to verbally annoy you when their attention span drops (very quickly).
<br>
<br>If you are Jason people will still just rage quit right at the beginning leaving only half the councillors. When you kill players as Jason most of the time they intentionally DC during the kill animation, meaning you have to go through a buggy animation with no character there. Sometimes you lose the XP too (Even though they said they fixed this, they have not).
<br>
<br>I was struggling to play the game within a couple of weeks.
<br>
<br>Save your money even if a massive Friday the 13th fan like me. The majority of you will quickly regret buying it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=7648110">Expand</a></span>

<br>More connection kills than councilors
<br>Friday the 13th is currently and online only competitive 7 v 1 survival game where you play as either Jason or a counselor and you&#x2019;re thrown into 1 of 3 maps...
<br>your goal is to escape, survive or of course kill all of the councilors&#x2026;
<br>Every character has their own advantages and disadvantages.. Their own stats... the character you play as is random every match and you unlock more characters as you level up
<br>Asa councilor you start with a flash light and nothing else&#x2026;
<br>you have a mini map but unless you find a map within the game that&#x2019;s all you have to go off of
<br>your goal is to find a nice hiding spot and wait for the timer to go out&#x2026; call the cops, call in a shotgun wielding hunter character with 1 single bullet to do massive damage, or fix a car or boat and get out of there&#x2026;
<br>around the maps are houses with supplies to fix the phone or one of the cars on the map..
<br>Attempting to do so will throw you into a quick time event where every precious second matters as Jason could be around any corner&#x2026;
<br>being cautious of your noise and fear level as this will make you easier to detect...
<br>you can barricade doors and open windows for a quick escape, or even set traps for Jason if he comes smashing through one
<br>there are also tons of weapons laying around, though none of them are a true threat to Jason..
<br>Killing Jason is a possibility... but you&#x2019;ll need to team up with the other councilors to do this, as you&#x2019;re definitely not doing this on your own... Not even with the single use shotgun
<br>weapons are mostly for rescuing other players or stunning Jason to escape...
<br>And you can communicate with players using a mic once you find a walkie talkie within the game which is a cool twist
<br>The fun part to me comes in the form of playing as Jason..
<br>There are multiple Jason&#x2019;s to unlock and Just like the counselors each has their own stats... their own strengths and weaknesses...
<br>as the match goes on the stronger Jason gets&#x2026;
<br>at first you just have a map, then you unlock a fear censor to see characters running around, a teleportation ability which allows you to dash through the air to pop up right in front of a counselor, useful for catching up to cars and stopping them in their tracks, or catching back up with an enemy after they stun you.. a stalk ability that turns of audio cues that you&#x2019;re near, and finally a rage mode towards the end of a match that buffs all of your abilities, allows you to run faster and smash down doors with ease&#x2026;
<br>and to kill la councilor you can grab and use a finisher, attack them with a melee weapon or do one of many environmental kills like throwing them through a window&#x2026;
<br>however I found that actually being Jason was far too rare even with him set as my preference I only got to play as him once every hr. and half, matches fly by when you&#x2019;re the killer, but as the counselor they seem to drag on forever, made worse by the fact you have to stay and watch in case you&#x2019;re randomly selected to come back in as the hunted character or if you want your xp at the end of the match..
<br>Which awards you points to unlock a new random perk or finish for Jason...
<br>you can attach these perks to your characters all with buffs and debuffs, and if you get one you don&#x2019;t like you can sell it back to the game.. .
<br>By biggest issue with this game however is its match making&#x2026;
<br>Creating matches takes a ridiculously long time&#x2026; and that&#x2019;s if you&#x2019;re lucky enough to stay in a lobby without one of the frequent error connections&#x2026;
<br>once in game things are fine.. But actually getting into a game probes to be a bit of an issue on the PlayStation 4&#x2026;
<br>Friday the 13th is an entertaining game for a while... more so when you&#x2019;re playing as Jason&#x2026;
<br>But constantly playing as counselors I started to get bored with the game fairly quickly, and the server issues left me feeling frustrated when I just wanted to get into a game and play&#x2026;
<br>I give Friday the 13 the game
<br>A 6/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=7612716">Expand</a></span>

A lot of movie references and some unique deaths. No rendering issues yet. Jason is very OP. Way more elaborated than Dead By Daylight.

<br>
<br>You essentially paid 40 dollars or more if you pre-order and could not play it the first week. And for the console users, especially the xbox vers. people still can&apos;t play the game. I don&apos;t understand how can you pay full price for a product that doesn&apos;t work. They had over millon dollars to make the game and even more with sales. So, how is this ok? If these developers actually cared about their product, they wouldn&apos;t have released it in first place until it actually works. You would only release it for more money and use the players as game testers.
<br>
<br>Also, this game has game breaking bug, where Jason flies out of map and dies. Sometimes it was just hitting jason, using sweater in doorway, grabbing people in fireworks or shooting a flare, and other random reasons. They still haven&apos;t fixed just seen recent video of it. There is another random bug where u can&apos;t pick up or use items.
<br>
<br>Onto glitches, there are soooooo many glitches in this game it is ridiculous and they are not just minor graphical glitches. These are invulnerable or hiding spots just waiting out 20min timer. You can trap glitch to rooftops, bridge glitches, glitch into and on top of walls, invulnerable glitches like flying, outhouses, wardrobes, and boats. There is car flipping glitches that happens randomly.
<br>
<br>In order to get access to other characters, jasons, animated kills, and perks, you have level grind and farm virtual currency. This rewards invulnerable, hiding spot glitchers, teaming with jason, point farmers, and other toxic gameplay. This is fastest way to level for least amount of work. Had they removed mindless game mechanics of leveling and virtual currency gambling slot machine for perks, then there would be no reason for these types of toxic gameplay. Why wait 20mins in glitch spot, point farming, or go invunerable, if game doesn&apos;t reward it. You would just be wasting your time.
<br>
<br>Also, they added -1,000 exp for team killing which is dumb because team killers don&apos;t care about leveling. Team killers care about griefing. This only punishes players from trying to save people with shotgun. Now there&apos;s no point in risking, which kills the team play. Seems like developers have any clue what they are doing.
<br>
<br>Lastly, their only consistency is that their patches and updates only seem to make the game worse. The recent patch freezes and crashes more often on loading the game. It&apos;s all over forums and even streamers are having same problems. I really don&apos;t see how any honest reviewer can give this game 10. When majority of time you are not playing game because you are trying to find a with decent ping, a group who speak english and has a mic, loading game back up because of crashes, or waiting in observer mode 10-20mins because you spawn next to jason with no items and died.
<br>Just wait for summer sales and probably the game will be fix by then.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=7449903">Expand</a></span>

I think he totally deserves a 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/friday-the-13th-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=7816993">Expand</a></span>
