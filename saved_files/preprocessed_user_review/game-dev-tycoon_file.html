Also the lack of being able to develop DLC. Also, after you made a lot of sequels it&apos;s hard keeping track of what kinda sequels you have made. Also the lack of upgrading engines is horrible. Having to spend a lot of money on developing a new engine 24.7 is really annoying. I also have a feeling employees have no use. Game development takes the same time, and the game&apos;s rating doesn&apos;t increase, it&apos;s just spending more money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3150407">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s a good game for the low price of $7.99. I have gotten about 10 hours of entertainment out of it in my first 30-year playthrough. Replayability is mediocre as the game becomes repetitive in the late stages, but this is a chronic problem of &quot;tycoon&quot; games. Experimenting with different genre/topic combinations is a core element of the gameplay, and it can be both frustrating and rewarding.
<br>
<br>I would have liked to see more transparency in the way your games are scored by the critics, such as showing a breakdown of how the various aspects of your game were rated (engine, gameplay, story, etc). This would make it less frustrating when you receive a low overall score on a game. Another thing that would improve the game is for the timeline to slow down a bit, or for the passage of time to slow as the game progresses. In the mid and late game, it felt like new consoles were coming out too frequently and your game engine basically became outdated upon release. The speed of the game felt rushed all along.
<br>
<br>In general, the game was fun and ran smoothly with no bugs for me. I believe the game should be expanded and tweaked for an optimal experience, so perhaps a cheap DLC (2 or 3 bucks) or free patch would be appropriate in the future. I will probably come back to the game periodically and try playing through it again when the mood strikes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3145385">Expand</a></span>

You can make all kinds of improvements to your game engine and become focuses on making great games in a certain genre but the game penalizes you harshly for repeating genre combinations.  So I make a great fantasy role playing game and it gets amazing reviews, I improve my game engine with things like rich backstory, character development, and other aspects pertinent to role playing games but when I make another fantasy role playing game it gives me terrible scores because I&apos;m repeating myself.  This isn&apos;t at all similar to what game development is like.  The fact that I have to go from fantasy role playing games to making a casual virtual pet game for kids in order to have success is ridiculous.  If any of this game was reality, companies like Bioware, Blizzard, and Maxis would have tanked after their first game.  I&apos;m sorry, but the mechanics in this game are ridiculous and it just makes the game feel clunky and broken.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3157063">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;ll try and sink more money into the next game to make it successful however it doesn&apos;t end up mattering. In the end the game has you sinking tons of money into everything it can think and you end up bankrupt. You have to pay to make game engines to take advantage of new features then for some ridiculous reason you have to pay each time you want to use the features of your game engine in a game that you&apos;re making. All of that while having to pay increasing salary to each of your staff members. This is the only game that has frustrated me to the point of actually making an account and writing a review on how bad it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3147223">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First off the gameplay is good but very repetitive, all you do is adjust sliders for different genre. When you get your reviews they tell you next to nothing on to improve your game in the future, but that doesn&apos;t matter because by Year 30 I had already all the slider settings down, so the complex equations that everyone say you need to get a 10/10 is false, I got many perfect games (5) in my first playthrough. Which brings me to another point; there isn&apos;t much replay value in Game Dev Tycoon, it almost exactly the same thing everytime. There is consoles without much difference and no reason to choose one over the other besides personal preference and market share (exceptions being Dreamvast and Oasis.)
<br>
<br>The graphics are okay I didn&apos;t like too much, but my friend so your choice on that pretty much, but the sound is a bit different. The music is okay but there&apos;s only two tracks that I remember and the sound effects annoying, every time a point goes up there a little blip, but when start getting 10 points it make turn off sound effects.
<br>
<br>Speaking of sound effects that is all the options menu; Music (On/Off), Sound Effects (On/Off), Volume, and toggle fullscreen. Besides options there is your basics (Save, Load, New, Exit),Highscore  Help, and Achievements. First off Help is useless the game is pretty much self-explanatory and when click skip tutorial when you start up a new playthrough it only skips the beginning tutorial on how to make games, but everything else is still there which is annoying. For Achievements there hefty amount for a game of its size with many secret ones. Highscores is basically all the things you&apos;ve done are given points and added up, the trick to be more efficient with making games, research and consoles.
<br>
<br>Overall Game Dev Tycoon was fun at first, but got boring after a while and the lack of content really weigh Game Dev Tycoon down giving it a verdict of 5, it&apos;s alright but names a lot of work and I can&apos;t help feeling I didn&apos;t $8 of fun out of this, if it was $5 it maybe would gotten a 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3464345">Expand</a></span>

In short, the game&apos;s system is extremely fickle, unpredictable at times, and utterly arbitrary.
<br>
<br>The limited &quot;topics&quot; do little if anything to enhance gameplay and instead only serve as an artificial block for creativity - if you want to succeed at the game, you do not get many chances to make the games you truly want in many cases. You instead must settle for the topics you have to work with. In addition, the way topics are implemented penalizes you for thinking outside the box. While &quot;X topic only goes with X method of gameplay&quot; may be a line of thinking that is popular among some real life publishers and developers, blending unusual topics with different game styles has proven successful in the past, and gamers shouldn&apos;t be penalized for wanting to try unusual combinations.
<br>
<br>The game is extremely difficult if you aren&apos;t sticking to common themes. According to the wiki and guides written to help players build a successful company, the game essentially penalizes you for making too many good games - you are only competing with your own score, and competition does not actually exist. Your company single-handedly decides what the bar is for games and that makes it extremely hard to do well throughout the game if you get a good start early on. You will spend a long time trying to recapture the same success of your first game, and this will force you to pick combinations along the same lines, if not remake constant sequels - but never too close together, as making games with similar topics too close to one another causes a backlash.
<br>
<br>Individual employee stats are horribly implemented. &quot;Leveling up&quot; does not improve stats, it only serves as an experience limiter to determine what specializations you can pick up by pumping up stats through training with your usually very small allotment of research points.  While a little training seems justifiable for the purposes of keeping your team competitive and for helping them achieve specialization, this game takes it to an extreme.
<br>
<br>In other words, the people you hire early on, despite constantly gaining &quot;experience&quot; with the tech and the industry, don&apos;t actually get any better just from making games. This means when you get the bigger office, the smartest move is to fire all your veterans and hire kids from the university to replace them. This is because the &quot;industry veterans&quot; on your team since you got out of the garage will invariably have laughably poor stats compared to the specialists you can hire immediately from the university. I could understand wanting to supplement by developed team with a few new kids for fresh new ideas, but again, this game takes it to an extreme.
<br>
<br>The timeflow goes EXTREMELY fast. Even a moment or two of idle &quot;watching&quot; your team can severely impact your progress if you want to get things done while story events are still happening - you need to be giving orders every step of the way, or your team will sit there doing nothing for entire weeks at a time. It&apos;s enough to make you want to fire them for their inefficiency, but hiring new people costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, just to get the message out that you need new people. Even though this is basically a ton of peoples dream jobs. Talk about an immersion killer. Your team is also limited to 6 at endgame, which is an unbelievably small team given the scale of the industry by that point. Again, what is immersion?
<br>
<br>Your team ALSO cannot be sent out for their &quot;vacations&quot; preemptively, and can only be sent off when they start complaining and losing efficiency - to make matter worse you cannot delay the release of your games when this happens, meaning that unless you want to let your team piss around and do nothing but collect a paycheck for a little while first, you risk them needing a vacation in the middle of development, hurting the max points that go into making the game good. It would have been nice to be able to preemptively give them a little time off before a long development cycle to prevent burnout, but such plans in management never occur to your character no matter how many times issues arise.
<br>
<br>The development cycle is repetitive and and constant no matter the game/topic/engine/size. You churn out games every few months in the beginning and maybe one or two a year if you&apos;re working optimally later on.  There&apos;s way to develop more than one game at a time even when your team is big enough to support AAA games. The decisions for what games work best for what systems are arbitrary and contrived at worst and wish-fulfillment at best (I don&apos;t, to this day, have a clue what makes the Dreamcast so good for simulation based gaming, nor have the faintest idea what makes the PC bad for casual gaming).  I could go on, but character limits. Suffice to say that this this journey through the game development world isn&apos;t going to end as nicely as you&apos;d hoped.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3946907">Expand</a></span>

The game does not give you enough info on what goes good with this or that, while they have added a few elements that make creating a hit game a little more frequent the random critic scores are very tiresome and at many times frustrating.</span>

<br>According to the wiki, you are playing to beat your previous high score, and the quality of the game means little. The fact that &quot;Good quality  Good reviews!&quot; is a little annoying. I can make a game real quick while I am doing research for my big game, and it will get three 10&apos;s and a 9. My big game will get 4&apos;s and 5&apos;s.
<br>
<br>After seeing that you were competing against your previous score, I made a sequel to my best game, using an incredibly new engine with many new features. The game was better than my previous high score in a number of ways, yet still got worse reviews.
<br>
<br>In the end, there are many fun times in the game, yet the review system nearly ruined it for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3809627">Expand</a></span>

That doesn&apos;t help. If you have bad luck, you will have bad luck in this game. If you have good luck, you will have bad luck in this game.
<br>
<br>Overall, good game at the start, but it gets tedious and devastating around the middle.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3895397">Expand</a></span>

The game calculates the score that your game receives based on two main things, how close you get to the best technology to design ratio and by comparing it to your last released game. The giant flaw in this system is that the best method of playing is to make games not as good as they could be in order to allow you to make your next game get a higher score easier. This is one of the most frustrating systems I have ever seen in a game. The rest of the elements of this game are great and I would love it but this one mechanic makes the game unbearably annoying, punishing me for doing well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4416071">Expand</a></span>

In a word, it&apos;s unsatisfying. In another, it&apos;s boring. So, two hours after dropping &#xA3;2.50 on it in the Steam sale, I&apos;m done for good.
<br>
<br>From what I could garner about the underlying mechanics of the game, success is based upon the correct combination of topic, platform, audience, genre, and then a variety of in game variables such as choosing to focus on dialogue, level design etc. The problem is that instead of having much at all to do about games or business management, GDT is all about making a series of guesses about correct combinations. It isn&apos;t about making your own games at all, or running your own start-up, but instead about replicating game history, as the only guiding principle a player really has for success is their own knowledge of what games were historically successful on what console at what times and for what reason. It&apos;s hour after hour of tapping boxes, getting one-liner reviews, a good or a bad score, then rinsing and repeating. The only &quot;reward&quot; for the player is the prospect of a good review and an occasional change of scenery. The pace of the game is very fast as well which, whilst irritating in some ways as it encourages button spam, serves to mask the one-dimensional game mechanics.
<br>
<br>Certain bizarre occurrences include harsh penalties for making game &quot;sequels,&quot; or specialising in a particular genre, obligatory wage hikes for staff, no system for managing overheads and entering both the gaming and management industry completely blind! Everything is trial and error. Instead of having an option to research the status of the gaming industry at a given time to plan a game&apos;s structure and release date, I just have to take a guess and cross my fingers. Even when training staff, I don&apos;t know what it is I&apos;m actually training them in (!) until their training is complete. If I knew as little as my avatar does, with zero knowledge of game or management, there&apos;s no way I&apos;d create a start-up in my garage, yet I feel as if this is what I&apos;m supposed to believe.
<br>
<br>A game of this sort could work very well, but it needs a serious injection of personality. As it is, I honestly wouldn&apos;t even play it for free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4871755">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game starts you in your humble basement, at the beginning of the video gaming era. You work with what you have, making small games with minimal hardware, hearing the announcements roll on by; consoles are slowly released, murmurings within the industry heard, trends are identified.
<br>
<br>You pour your efforts into parts of the games you feel are going to give the best reviews, and thus generate the most revenue. Want to make a Medieval-Action game? Sure. Invest more time in the gameplay, but you&apos;re going to have to cut back in other areas, perhaps dialogue.
<br>
<br>Eventually, you&apos;ll make enough to move out into your own office. You can hire a team, each with different stats. You can train them (and yourself) up as you release more hopeful winners, while keeping up with the technology curve. With enough time and money, you can even make your own consoles, and have an R&amp;D department.
<br>
<br>Because of my ineptitude towards tycoon games, I initially felt underwhelmed. The Farmville-esque graphics deterred me, and I kept needing bailouts from the bank.
<br>
<br>But then I hit my first winner. An overall 9.5 rating for a particular game. My bank account swelled. I suddenly knew what I was doing. I was hooked, trying to get that perfect 10 game (I never did, sadly). Watching those thought bubbles rise from your workers, seeing your game get more and more tech-design points was addictive. Wanting to try all the combinations of games. Trying out all the witty Pun-related game titles.
<br>
<br>Add all of the mods currently available on steam, and this could warrant several playthroughs (the story goes through 35 years of the gaming industry).
<br>
<br>Game Dev Tycoon is great if you like this sort of thing, and even if you don&apos;t normally go for these, it&apos;s still worth a try. It got me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4909061">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>The first look and the first game is fun and is motivating to play a stage in one night.
<br>But after that I don&apos;feel to replay it again, because If you know how it works, the game is no longer a challenge.
<br>There are no random events such as financial crises and the impact of software piracy .
<br>Conclusion so far, good idea, but this was presented very clumsy. Hope for a better version in future.</span>

<br>The major issues with this game are that the ways to make a successful game are almost completely nonsensical, and a viewing through the raw data is the only way, excepting extreme luck, to have much success. These include such oddities as the fact that any non-action title on the NES or SNES will flop, or how the PS2 is apparently only for action games and RPGs.

<br>The only thing notable about this game is the guilting of pirates the devs have done in an attempt to get attention, which I find ironic considering that they&apos;ve done something far worse than piracy, they&apos;ve ripped off another game.

<br>Now on a more serious note, this game was really worth 8 bucks. The large span of different combinations of game topics, genres, platforms to develop for and engine mechanics made the game very re-playable. The only problem I have with the game is the tiny amount of &quot;immersivness&quot; in the game. Sure you can choose the game&apos;s topics and genres and adjust an engine you have made to fit the kind of game you would really create but there is just so little that goes into it.
<br>
<br>The only other problem I had with it was the repetitive nature of the game. Once I got really &quot;into it&quot; with the game I found myself taking breaks from it. But again it was definitely worth the 8 bucks, for some good ol&apos; indie game fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3175399">Expand</a></span>

Anyways, this game is pretty fun at the early stages, and some in the later stages too. But it gets repetitive and boring really fast. You end up just pushing out game after game just to pay the rent. It quickly stops becoming about what kind of game you want to make into how much money you can make. Especially in the end game the review scores just get ridiculous. It&apos;s almost impossible to not over work your workers. If you over work them you get worse reviews and end up with nothing but 1-6s. There are some cool end game things you can do but I don&apos;t think a lot of people will waste the time and repetitiveness to get there. This game is below average. Remember 5/10 is average and I agave it a 4 so it is slightly below average.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3263458">Expand</a></span>

However, The difficulty curve is steep because of the algorithm  used to calculate game scores, which rates games based not on a constant scale but on how they compare to your previous games. This means that in order to maximize a profit as you enter the 32-bit era of the game you must aim to make each subsequent game about 10% better. The game also introduces many new technologies and ideas but does not give you enough time to research them, causing  your employees to become overextended because they don&apos;t understand what a cowboy is. Overall, the game is promising and looks to be really fun, but its mechanics are a bit repetitive and the way your games are reviewed is awkward and can be very difficult.

There is to much little fussing to be a time killer type game. And not enough to play seriously.
<br>
<br>To me this game is the type you pick up fuss for a while then shelve for weeks on end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3160998">Expand</a></span>

Not only it was extremely addictive and fun, but it actually made me realize I want to specialize as a game developer (I am a programmer). I even left my previous job and now I am starting in a simulation/game studio !
<br>
<br>Now, what makes this game such a gem  It&apos;s really challenging and your head will be consumed with the idea of making a perfect game (10, 10, 10, 10). Ideas like  what genre, what target audience, what kind of gameplay, do I put more graphics, or more intelligence in it  Do I want to support gamepad or cloud service  Yep, just like that. There is no optimal or safe way through this game, the options in the creation of games are endless and anything can become success or failure. Only the middle part of the game might get slightly repetitive, apart from that  it&apos;s an amazing and colorful simulation game with very intelligent math and algorithm background that will make you ROCK HAR-
<br>
<br>Oh well, not to mention the guys behind Greenheart Games became famous for the anti-piracy security included in the game (I would only comment that as a &quot;trololol &amp; iseewhatyoudidthere paradox&quot;). Damn, I am looking forward for another game from these gentlemen, now you go and enjoy this one  I am sure you will.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3458976">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Unfortuantely it&apos;s not that good  Instead of more, it feels like less. You don&apos;t seem to have the same level of control or different ways to do things as you do in GDS. Also, review scores seem to be pulled from nowhere, and there are some issues with balance  research points are way too hard to get for example. It&apos;s hard to figure out what you can do to improve from within the game itself, and your own thinking, and that&apos;s a major sin for a tycoon game.
<br>
<br>Most importantly however, it&apos;s just not that fun. It lacks the charm of &quot;Game Dev Story&quot;, there&apos;s little incentive to keep on playing, and that&apos;s the biggest let down :(
<br>
<br>So there we have it. It&apos;s only a fiver, I suppose it&apos;s almost worth it, but I&apos;d rather pay Kairosoft a tenner for a desktop clone of their game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3465423">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is difficult to lose at, but difficult to win as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3586955">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>We do not have to be hooked up to a social network to play it.
<br>
<br>Being a developer, I feel it is a very fun overview of the process.
<br>
<br>Thank you!</span>

<br>The theme itself and number of references to real life game industry are just brilliant. Authors have shown some really deep understanding of the topic.
<br>I don&apos;t agree, that playthrough is repetitive, it&apos;s a great fun for me to play it for the 4th time.</span>

<br>
<br>I downloaded it and it&apos;s okay, nothing special, I expected a bit more to be honest. The only reason I&apos;m giving it 1 instead of 0 is because I&apos;m nice like that. This is one of those rare games that I most definitely wouldn&apos;t buy, even if I did end up liking it because of the developers&apos;  moves.
<br>
<br>So congratulations to the developers for losing a sale!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3828224">Expand</a></span>

This game simply must provide the player with some proper feedback, maybe even some graphs, surveys of the audience, just something that means you can play with the mechanics. You want to explore these further mechanics, but you become scared, as one bad game plunges you into bankruptcy. Living on the edge may be fun, but not if &apos;living on the edge&apos; prevents me from not just making the same three games over and over, and failing whenever I try something new.
<br>
<br>So hey, have fun for a few hours, but if you want GDT, I seriously recommend waiting for a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3467073">Expand</a></span>

<br>Fort a small indie game you can pick up any play is does well.
<br>Although i can&apos;t see you being able to put 50 hrs into it it is still a great game. But once competed  the story and have almost unlimited money it becomes a tad boring but worth the money spent on it.</span>

The humour is one of the major strenghts, definately, for you might see companies like Ninvento invent the largely popular Gameling or  Micronoft&apos;s mBox. Perhaps you&apos;ll buy a license for Vony&apos;s Playsystem 2  These are not spelling mistakes, these console names are in the game.)  With many different game possibilities, such as popular ones like Fantasy/RPG to Wild West simulation game (bleurgh!)  it&apos;s up to you.
<br>And, unlike many other games, it actually gets better in the later stages, with lots of new oppurtunities popping up all over the place. The random events are very also well implemented.
<br>
<br>Obviously, the creators at Greenheart Games poured their very heart and soul into the production of this game  and an awesome anti-piracy stunt)  However, the main fault I found with it is Replay value has much to be desired. No matter what way you look at it, you&apos;ve probably done everything of interest in your first playthrough. That said, It&apos;s not that bad, and you&apos;ll probably get a couple of games out of it.
<br>
<br>Overall, Game Dev Tycoon is certainly worth the money, and DEFINITELY worth yours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3479021">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The nice range of options for staff and research make the game very immersing and I can&apos;t help but play this for 8 hours at a time. But I do wish their were some more features in this game.
<br>
<br>Features such as starting at whatever year you want after completing the game once or features like playing a scenario where you pick a company like Maxis and play out the company&apos;s history.
<br>
<br>And their are some things I have wrong with this game such as the graphics and gameplay making the game seem like a Facebook game at times, also the game is very repetitive, you are basically doing the same thing over and over and it does get dull after a couple of days of playing the game/
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong I love this game, and I would happily give this a 7/10 overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3602928">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s genuine, fantastic, and like an advanced Game Dev Story at first, but after a couple of games and getting to know about every single corner about this game, it starts getting repetitive, arduous, and plain boring. It&apos;s definitely fun to create your own games and get good reviews from it, but at this current moment, it offers too little to play forever. It is a game in development, so I expect great things to come from it in the future, as a game where you can become Nintendo and make mature games and take series like Star Wars is absolutely fun, interesting, and bloody funny can go a long way in the case of an indie game. Oh, and it&apos;s only $9.99  worth it indeed if you like this sort of game, but again, it needs updates to become a fabled game like Minecraft.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3639329">Expand</a></span>

The game is too punishing. Every little mistake costs you tons of money, so don&apos;t even bother experimenting. Time passes by WAY too quickly. Seriously, a month goes by literally every 20-30 seconds, which just drains you of cash. On top of this, everything is incredibly expensive, from new engines that you constantly have to make, to staff salaries which will be raised out of your control. How is this a tycoon game again? I don&apos;t even get to choose whether or not my staff gets a raise? What if I am really short on cash and cannot afford it? Too bad, the game does it for you. Truly, this is pathetic game in terms of &apos;Tycoon&apos; games. If you want a good tycoon game, go to the ultimate of Tycoon&apos;s, Roller Coaster tycoon, which can be bought for quite cheap anyway, given the quality. This game may seem &apos;cheap&apos;, but there is a reason. The quality just isn&apos;t there. The presentation is bland beyond belief, the interface is clunky, the way the game is executed is very poorly done, it is just a bad game. Truly though, the biggest flaw by far is the insane difficult and horrid time system, which goes by incredibly fast. I was literally losing 51K every 30 seconds or so and I really did not have much control over it. Then, it went up to 61K, just because my staff member received a mandatory raise due to leveling up. Again, how is this a tycoon game if I cannot even decided that important aspect? Another horrid detail is the &apos;review&apos; system. We really are never told how it works, what went wrong in the case of a bad game, and how much it affects the sales of a game.
<br>
<br>$7.99 or not, I found this to be a frustrating experience that not only angered me, but, once I went bankrupt for the 7th time early on, it bored me as well. Many will disagree, but I say stay away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3185271">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Review system is nothing more than just random number generator which is not affected by actual game quality. I don&apos;t know how to improve or what should be improved in order to get higher scores. (After the 30 year story line review system works as a stupid monkey.)
<br>- When you have Research Lab and Hardware lab the performance goes under zero. HTML5 and JS may not the best choice.
<br>- Why I can &quot;update&quot; existing game engines? Seriously, I have plenty of game engines named: 1+, 1++, 1#, 2+
<br>- The &quot;click anywhere&quot; menu system should be improved because now it&apos;s not a user friendly stuff. (eg opens slowly, instantly closes after open).
<br>-The game itself adds nothing to Game Dev Story&apos;s formula. Which is really sad.
<br>PROs:
<br>- The graphics is decent for a game like that.
<br>- Polished interface and gameplay compared to Game Dev Story. (Although not the best.)
<br>- Potential &quot;Indie Bundle&quot; game for few cents.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3151039">Expand</a></span>

<br>on the surface its as simple as choosing the platform,Genre and name of the game.
<br>but after playing for awhile its pretty clear that it is a little bit more complicated then just that.
<br>you also run into the various events that real companies run into like Piracy(even in the legit version) but also little coding competitions within the company and the E3(called G3 in-game)
<br>the game&apos;s various stages,markes as Offices,add some new interesting game elements everytime you enter a new one, like getting employees to work for you and making another division to your company to research stuff.
<br>all-in-all. its pretty cool to see a game,simulating a game to this degree.
<br>if you&apos;r a fan of Game Dev Story,then you will love this. it has some of the elements but adds TONS AND TONS of new gameplay elements that will make the experience a worthwhile endovour.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3151173">Expand</a></span>

There haven&apos;t been any proper tycoon games in quite a while, and this game definitely fulfills the many great tycoon games of the past (RCT etc.). Of course this is Greenheart games first game and there are many things that can be improved. First off this game definitely needs some way to properly mod it. Mods could make this game a lot better. Also the game doesn&apos;t quite last that long. It&apos;s quite easy, and isn&apos;t very hard to master. After you beat it, you might not quite have a reason to play it again. Another reason this game needs modding. This game does, obviously, have many positives. The game pretty accurately depicts the history of gaming. It offers pretty unique gameplay. It let&apos;s you go from a singular developer to a huge company. You can even develop MMO&apos;s and create your own consoles. Creating consoles is pretty limited, however. Overall I&apos;d give it a 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3201523">Expand</a></span>

It may not be free like most games of it&apos;s type but it doesn&apos;t pester you about paying RL money for coins or something similar. I would give it a 10 but this is payback for all the bad reviews I get in-game. &gt;:-D</span>

I bought it on Friday for a mere &#xA3;6.86v (roughly) and I have played it at every opportunity since.it may not be the most detailed game but it has character which is missing from a lot of games recently.if you are new to tycoon games I recommend buying this game. I cant wait to see what else greenheart comes out with.</span>

                                        <span>Great game, fun. played around 7-10 hours. you have game development, research lab and hardware lab. MANY options in the game department to mess around with.   frame rate kinda goes down when you get all the departments running at max at the same time.   would love to have option to combine two topics like the type of game.
<br>
<br>Looking forward to game dev tycoon 2 with more content!</span>

<br>This game isn&apos;t perfect for sure, how can you sell 36 million games for a system which sold only 7? This doesn&apos;t stop you from going on for hours though and try to create the perfect game. The game might seem too repetitive, especially at the beginning, but the limited time (25,30 or 35 years) and limited resources always make you go back to the game and try to make it even better.
<br>Achievements are a nice touch to an already great game.

<br>My advice? Get &quot;Game Developer Story&quot; for Android or iOS. It&apos;s only $5.00, it&apos;s a fun game, it looks better and it plays better. You can get even software that emulates the Android OS on your desktop and links to your Google Account so you don&apos;t have to re-buy it all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3444695">Expand</a></span>

At first look and while playing through the tutorial, the game seems like it will be a simple grind to make more money, then purchase or train to bigger and better things. This is not how the game functions.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t let the name &quot;Tycoon&quot; fool you. It is not a &quot;Tycoon&quot; game like any previous &quot;Tycoon&quot; games. You don&apos;t slowly work your way up by making more money to purchase bigger/better things until you have the biggest &amp; best. Then attain all the biggest &amp; best things in the game and just sit there making money. There is a strategy to the game that starts at the very beginning.
<br>
<br>If you stick to the tutorial, you will probably start out fine as a developer and get mediocre reviews &amp; earn mediocre money, but eventually go bankrupt. You might make one or two successful games, but the mediocre &amp; bad ones will kill you. This is partly due to how fast the calendar moves in the game &amp; the monthly expenses you incur ($20,000/month for one level 2 employee?!).
<br>
<br>The best way to succeed at the game is learn how it works and learn what is expected of you. Unless you enjoy trying to figure this out on your own by playing &amp; replaying the game over &amp; over again, I would suggest using the community to help teach you. You can use YouTube videos, message boards, or wikis.
<br>
<br>The game uses an algorithm to gauge what review scores your game will get. This can mean big money, or not making enough to cover the cost of the game (not to mention the monthly expenses). This algorithm is what makes the gameplay so frustrating and ultimately what ruins it. I spent an hour or so reading the wiki on how the algorithm works, it tries hard to get it right, but essentially fails. I feel like I should explain further here, but there is just too much!
<br>
<br>(If you&apos;ve read the wiki: competing against your own top review score, improper balance of development/tech means bad scores, why can&apos;t I focus more time to have great story/quests in my action game without it hurting my score? and more)
<br>
<br>I am not saying it is impossible to be successful in Game Dev Tycoon, but the learning curve is high. You cannot be successful if you just try to go make the biggest &amp; best game by getting as much dev/tech points as you can on every game you make.
<br>
<br>There are some great features to Game Dev Tycoon, but it was too easy to focus on the biggest negative that is: trying to figure out all the appropriate combinations to be successful. But, this hasn&apos;t stopped me from playing &amp; trying to master it.
<br>
<br>If Game Dev Tycoon were to review itself it would say there is too much tech, not enough development.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>1. One click interface
<br>2. Surprisingly in-depth strategy
<br>3. Some customization
<br>4. Addictive gameplay
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>1. Algorithm that tries too hard (steep learning curve!)
<br>2. Very little sense that you are competing against other developers
<br>3. Staff salaries are way too big (Lvl 1: $8,000-11,000/month Lvl 2: $16,000-23,000/month)
<br>4. Minor interface glitches
<br>
<br>Things I hope change/get updated:
<br>1. Can only develop for one platform at a time and never pre-launch
<br>2. Weeks/months speed by a little too fast. I am not talking about adding speed adjustment, but rather slowing down the weeks/months compared to how much development is going on. (I admit this would probably make the amount of work done in a short amount of time non-realistic. But I think it would improve gameplay)
<br>3. Include better explanation of how reviews are scored in tutorial or in help menu.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3151306">Expand</a></span>

There are definitely some in the end stages (final building), where the software can&apos;t differ between you clicking on a developer or just anywhere on the screen  bit annoying but okay. Also a minimize function that works would be helpful.
<br>I studied the algorithm behind the game a little bit (what makes a high rating, what sells best) and ever since just keep making ridiculous amounts of millions, prior to that though figuring out what sells best is a stupid guessing game. For example military as an adventure game on the PlaySystem will get you a horrible game, even if good configured, because the raw algorithm data shows that&apos;s a bad combination.
<br>Also the game gets boring quickly, you can&apos;t start again and take a different approach (like other tycoon games) since it has an extremely linear story. It was said before but updating game engines would be a good idea, also more interactions with your fans. Here are some more basic ideas:
<br>Being able to set up a fanshop for continuous money, being able to set the price for games, being able to release downloadable content, release games for many platforms at once, ...
<br>I like the game but I feel like it is far from finished, since playing it gets boring quickly due to the very limited options you get.
<br>The graphics are nice, music is good  nothing special for a 2013 game though.
<br>Very excited what the game will be like in a year. I hope for major updates.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-dev-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=3150575">Expand</a></span>

The review system runs on an algorithm that calculates the score based on many factors like scores of your previous game, balance between tech and design, right usage of sliders etc. and if you get a low score on your game review, your game suffers from low sales.

This game really captivates and motivates the user to experience a real role play of sorts. The only complaint is a lack of proper feedback from the game on your games. Other wise, a truly unique experience, and one any casual gamer would love.</span>
