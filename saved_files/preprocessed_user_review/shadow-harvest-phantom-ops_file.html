The mouse sensitivity is absolutely horrible, your turning speed is always horribly slow, even with 100% sensitivity, but when you aim, there is no decrease in speed like most shooters so your aimer shoots around like crazy. The cut scenes are unskippable which is brutal because the checkpoints are so far apart that if you die in the beginning of a level you will have to sit through the boring scene again. There were lots of times when playing as the guy that your cover would obstruct an enemy and prevent you from hitting him but not him from hitting you! As the woman, the enemies are some of the biggest idiots, you literally can just run in front of them and they won&apos;t catch you (her sections are stealth-based) which is a shame, she has a lot of cool spy/stealth things like distraction bolts for her crossbow and sneaking up op people gives you the option to either finish them off or inject them with &apos;nanites&apos; on death, turning the body invisible. In some sections stealth is literally forced, in that getting caught instantly ends the mission even if you kill the guy who caught you before he calls out. The enemies are literally hive-mind&apos;s, the moment you are caught even if the guy who saw you doesn&apos;t say anything, all nearby enemies instantly know where you are. The overall HUD layout is quite nice by comparison, looking at objectives brings up detailed information, and the night vision is quite well done, unfortunately the voice actors for both of the lead characters are absolutely horrible. The man&apos;s voice is not suited to the roll and he seems to phone in his performance, dragging down the horrible cut scenes even more. The female voice is a little more suited to her role, but still feels like she doesn&apos;t care about the part and is just reading lines. The story is slightly interesting the first time you watch it, however the lack of skippable cut scenes means that there is no replay value. One other strange thing is that  playing as the woman, even if you have the weapon, your superior (on the headset naturally) has to &apos;unlock&apos; everything, as if she couldn&apos;t just fire the bolt, or use the pointy claws on her arm. This is part of the tutorial of course but they had so many better ways to explain things then arbitrarily locking things and not making sense. Overall a good concept, and a great new HUD idea, but falls extremely short of that, and creates a huge mess thats not worth even $10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-harvest-phantom-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1563171">Expand</a></span>
