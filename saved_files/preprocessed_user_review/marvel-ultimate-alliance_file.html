<br>Great Potential
<br>Marvel Ultimate Alliance is a dungeon crawler beat em up where you play as your choice of 4 marvels heroes, or a mix with online or local co-op out of 25 different characters to be unlocked with collectibles , secrets and story progression.
<br>You team up of course to stop doom from doing his usually doom thing of trying to take over the world&#x2026;
<br>your journey to stop him will take your characters to a variety of locations like Atlantis and asguard&#x2026;
<br>unfortunately while the scenery does change at a decent pace, the gameplay doesn&#x2019;t&#x2026;
<br>This game is a monotonous and ridiculously long 17 hours&#x2026;
<br>During this 17 hours you do the dungeon crawl thing of just killing everything for fairly minimal loot with very much welcomed but too thinly spread out puzzle and platforming sections &#x2026;
<br>Bosses will drop rings for stat boosts, but that&#x2019;s about it&#x2026;
<br>There no real incentive to explore or even defeat all enemies other than unlocking new characters as leveling up doesn&#x2019;t seem too significant... and if you have your favorite 4 unlocked, why even bother finding these hidden figures&#x2026;
<br>As you level up your stats unnoticeably increase and you unlock new moves that you can assign to a button command.. you can also unlock suits by using characters or completing a comic mission hidden throughout the world&#x2026;
<br>These optional comic missions tell the story of one individual character to give more insight on them to new fans and hit that nostalgia button of existing fans of characters.. And as stated already, completing these missions successfully will unlock a new suit for your character... and thankfully these suits are not just skins... they all have their own special perks which will actually give you a hard time choosing from&#x2026; and you can upgrade these perks with the coins that enemies drop.. but again it doesn&#x2019;t really feel too significant&#x2026;.
<br>Combat in this game is fairly basic, but characters do all handle and feel unique, some can fly, some have projectiles, some are straight up brutes&#x2026; if you get too bored, which you definitely will, you can switch out your team at any time when you run into a save point&#x2026;
<br>there&#x2019;s also over 17 boss battles and mini boss battles in this game&#x2026; but are essentially either a straight up beat em up brawl or dodge attacks and do a quick time event&#x2026;. Which are surprisingly some of the more better boss fights as they throw in a splash of variety&#x2026; but really aren&#x2019;t that great and don&#x2019;t require any real strategy&#x2026;
<br>While Marvel Ultimate Alliance is a great love letter to the marvel fans, packed with material that even I can appreciate while not being a marvel fan.. I feel like the game drags on and keeps you in its lackluster locations far too long, ultimately making this game feel like a drag...
<br>That being said, if you&#x2019;re a marvel fan I still believe this game is worth your money
<br>I give Marvel Ultimate Alliance
<br>a 7.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-ultimate-alliance/user-reviews?user_review_id=6579096">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The RPG aspects could be explained better, but there is enough there to have some fun tinkering with skills and combinations across a couple dozen heroes. The fighting would get repetitive but you can switch character(and therefore playstyles) on the fly. Also, and this is getting lost in the online generation, this is one of the best local multiplayer game types I have ever played. The games is played with 4 heroes on screen and you and a friend each pick one but can switch from the 4 on screen whenever you want. It can create some fun combos though maybe letting the screen move out a little more for when you are separated would have been a huge help in some areas.
<br>
<br>Overall if you look at this game on a technical level its really fairly poor, but there is just a charm to it that cannot be denied. It is greater than the sum of its parts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/marvel-ultimate-alliance/user-reviews?user_review_id=6514577">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> I played for about 2 hours online with 2 local friends of mine and it&apos;s pretty obvious this game has P2P networking because the gameplay was extremely sluggish. We dropped one of the players and it got better but it was still pretty bad. The gameplay itself is extremely linear and has a console-port feel to it. Probably better played on an actual console for online cooperative play.</span>
