<br>Because the reviews of this game are very positive I gave this game more time than I think it deserves. I still doesn&apos;t deserve a score of 0, it did run and I didn&apos;t find any bugs but that is all I can say that is positive about it.
<br>
<br>I tried to like it. I ignored the graphics, which are so bad they hinder gameplay. I don&apos;t mind the lack of voice acting. Not having played the first season the story didn&apos;t make much sense - more bizarre than interesting.
<br>
<br>What is left - the puzzles. There aren&apos;t many puzzles and when I got stuck it was because I hadn&apos;t done enough blob hunting (low resolution version of pixel hunting) or I didn&apos;t walk on the correct section of the floor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-last-door-season-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6685410">Expand</a></span>
