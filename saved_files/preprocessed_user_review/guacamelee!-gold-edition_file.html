<br>The combat can be a little stiff at the beginning. But after learning more moves and getting used to the control, it&apos;s a lot of fun tossing bad guys around.
<br>Plus, the art design and music is pretty unique. As a 2D game, it&apos;s pretty enough. The lack of voice acting is a little disappointing though. The characters may do some pretty hilarious things while talking. But players have to stare on the subtitle for the whole time.
<br>Overall Guacamelee really worth my money. I suggest to buy it in the first week. You got 10 percent discount and another game from the studio as bonus. Absolutely increase the value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guacamelee!-gold-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3409864">Expand</a></span>

Gold Edition, is arguably the best of the many modern metroidvania games released recently. While other modern metroidvanias tend to favour combat and RPG elements, Guacamelee instead focuses on providing satisfying, yet interesting and puzzle-like combat, along with many thought-provoking platforming puzzle sections. It&apos;s clear that Drinkbox know their game mechanics, and most puzzles and combat scenarios are perfectly designed around use of the many game mechanics, an example of one being dimension switching, a mechanic which is used to great effect throughout the game. If Guacamelee does have flaws, though, it has to come with the obnoxious internet memes, the length of the game (clocks in at, like, 7 hours), and the fact that opinions on the game are easily subjective.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guacamelee!-gold-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3604894">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s got a delightful aesthetic, and I can&apos;t think of any other game that looks quite like it. There&apos;s a lot of humour, and it&apos;s a cheerful and colourful game whose very darkest moments are several shades lighter than Scooby Doo.
<br>
<br>I should warn you that it&apos;s quite challenging. Customers who are used to easy games, or struggle with accurate timing, could have trouble here. Then again, maybe Guacamelee will train you and turn you into a seasoned platforming expert!

<br>If I had to choose between recommending this or Rayman Legends (the two best platform games of 2013) then without question I would pick Rayman Legends, but you should certainly play Guacamelee too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guacamelee!-gold-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4372077">Expand</a></span>

It demands absolute precision from the player, but is pretty sloppy with its own hit boxes and timings.  Boss characters are given massive amounts of invulnerability frames, which aren&apos;t indicated in any way, that you&apos;re forced to learn by trial and error.  Conversely, you can be damaged at any time, even during special moves when your character is just a blur, which is maddeningly counter intuitive.  Many people are reporting they never get past the final boss, which leaves little incentive for me to play the final quarter of the game. This is a punishing game for 15 year-olds who have the time to play it as obsessively as it demands.  I used to have that sort of patience, but now I realized games are supposed to be...fun.  On the plus side, it has amazing style and a great sense of exploration. Really unique stuff.  But with all these rave reviews, I thought someone really needed to chime in with a reality check.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guacamelee!-gold-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3446968">Expand</a></span>

Mandatory dialog is frequent and sometimes funny, but also got old quick. I bought the game because I love metroidvanias, but it feels more like a fighting game. There is a lot to like here, but it just didn&apos;t hold together for me.</span>

<br>
<br>However, all of this is a smokescreen.  By the time you get to the endgame, the difficulty cranks up to hateful levels, unfairly changing established rules and making mandatory level segments near impossible for the average gamer. Any &quot;professional reviewer&quot; who gave this game high marks obviously didn&apos;t make it past the first hour of gameplay, when things were still fairly manageable.
<br>
<br>You could charitably call this a Metroidvania-style game, but the big difference is that those titles&apos; designers knew how to properly scale difficulty. I got so frustrated with Guacamelee that I simply deleted the game entirely without finishing it.  My only regret is wasting a few hours of my life to get that far in the first place -- thankfully I didn&apos;t pay actual money for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guacamelee!-gold-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3988347">Expand</a></span>

<br>I am usually not the guy to play sideview fighters, especially chaotic ones. However this game  it deserves everything. The graphics are great and fit the gameplay.. not to detailed and slightly cartoony, while maintaining the resolution and graphical advancements found in the newer games.
<br>The gameplay is great  it has nice performance on even weak PC&apos;s and the game just feels very smooth. Pressing 30 buttons per second will happen, but it wont show even the slightest microstutter on the screen.. its all fluid and smooth.
<br>The storyline is very immersive (ive heard people actually pinked away a tear and i myself felt touched at some moments to so far) and the game keeps you in a tight lock  im known for never finishing games, which is a trait alot of gamers suffer from. However since ive started playng this game im stuck to the screen and will certainly finish this (will be my third pc game ive ever finished in the last 8 years (others were Trine 2 and.. Star Wars Battlefront 2 i believe)...
<br>
<br>This was my short recommendation. If you want a full review.. sorry but i dont do those.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guacamelee!-gold-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3417942">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>No really, it&apos;s Cartoon Sushi of the best of everything. Metroid, Zelda, Earthworm Jim, Castlevania, Smash Bro&apos;s, Portal, Gunstar Heroes and countless more inspiring titles; there are so many great classics represented here in the most genius subtle tamale pie bake of all their fine elements, I&apos;m left speechless. Yet, it&apos;s completely fresh and unique and adds to that cadre with its own twists. It&apos;s unbelievably addictive and so much deeper than I ever would&apos;ve guessed.
<br>Quick list of amazing traits.
<br>
<br>Art  Gorgeous. Samauri Jack meets Nacho Libre. You have to simply experience it. The visual cues are perfect.
<br>
<br>GamePlay  Breakneck and satisfying. I can&apos;t say more without spoiling it.  Attention to detail is thicker than molasses. It takes some skill but jaw dropping things will result.
<br>
<br>Story  Classic. Few games can pull off this simple story, hit a grand slam and do it with style to spare. Imagine Zelda  Mario  Portal  Earthworm Jim  Okami all smashed together.
<br>
<br>Sound  You want 5.1 surround. Crank it. Bring Tequila.
<br>
<br>Control  The depth, speed and responsiveness are so well done the only problem I found was remembering how much beat unmerciful you have at your disposal. Definitely my favorite aspect.
<br>
<br>Overall  Great wholesome, scream-at-your-screen-in-ecstatic-frustration-because-you-were-so-friggen-close FUN.
<br>
<br>This would&apos;ve been an instant 90&apos;s classic giving the likes Sonic and Crash a run for their money.
<br>
<br>Also, co-op, though I haven&apos;t had a chance to experience how insane that must be.
<br>The only con I have found is it leaves you wanting more. However, replay-ability, yup it&apos;s got that. I would wager a bet this would be a smash at parties w/ co-op.
<br>
<br>There are a lot of good side-scrollers coming out these days. This is one of the best.

<br>
<br>It&apos;s corny and humorous at times, which gives the game a personality all it&apos;s own. The game is downright charming.
<br>
<br>This game also does not forget its roots and knows it&apos;s fan-base. It has plenty of Easter eggs that pertain to it&apos;s inspirations, which will only add more flavor and appeal to those that like this kind of game.

<br>
<br>Combat:
<br>This is the real heart of the game. Your move set is a little like Captain Falcon from Super Smash Brothers, and you get to have a lot of fun knocking enemies into the air, setting up the best combos, interrupts, dodges, etc. It gets a little frantic and can be frustrating in parts because you can&apos;t just mash through, you have to pay attention to enemy attacks and work proactively. The difficulty does get quite high, especially if you are playing hard mode and going through some of the optional content. There are many &apos;arenas&apos; as part of the regular gameplay where you walk into a room and the walls close and you have to fight through several waves of enemies to progress. These increase steadily in difficulty, and later ones you will probably die at least once to learn the tricks you need to progress. However, it is pretty fair about death: you only have to restart the waves.
<br>
<br>Platforming:
<br>Really standout, you have a pretty intuitive and familiar set of abilities that you can use platforming, but many of the puzzles are very clever, especially some of the challenging optional content. The platforming elements reminded me very much of Metroid Zero Mission, especially some of the optional parts. The difficulty for each section can get quite high, but is never insurmountable especially since there is very little punishment for failure (usually just restarting the section you are on).
<br>
<br>There are cute retro game references, the music is really pretty fun, and I grew to really like the graphics (I wasn&apos;t really into the subject matter and it won me over). It is probably a little racist (I was mildly offended by some of the Mexican stereotypes) and really quite sexist (you are saving a damsel in distress, the main female villain&apos;s motivation is that she is jealous and short tempered) but it didn&apos;t really hamper my enjoyment of the game. The plot is secondary to the amazing gameplay, it&apos;s just a shame.
<br>
<br>This is still the 2d game I have enjoyed the most in at least a decade, it&apos;s also the first steam game I got every achievement for. Even after having a perfect hard mode file, I still come back to play it because I find it so enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guacamelee!-gold-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4194198">Expand</a></span>

Also the music, art, and luchador theme are hilarious and wonderful. I loved this game.</span>

You are Juan Aguacate, a destitute agave farmer who finds his village under attack by the undead army of Carlos Calaca. The love of his life, who happens to be the daughter of el presidente, has been kidnapped. What is Juan to do? Why, acquire a magic lucha mask and go on a non-linear platforming adventure, get powerups from &quot;choozo&quot; statues, power-slam bad guys, find secrets and navigate rather tricky jumping puzzles, of course. Guacamelee oozes style from beginning to end, with a colorful palette, excellent music and a well-used light/dark world mechanic, requiring the player to frequently switch Juan between the living world and the Mexican land of the dead via portals, often in mid-jump. But the game is inconsistent in difficulty. The combat is generally managable and the boss fights are quite simply awesome, but some of the jumping puzzles are incredibly frustrating. In addition, to reach the game&apos;s golden ending, it is neccessary to obtain a number of secret items, some of which are located at the end of some fiendishly difficult challenge rooms, many of which, like the trick jump room with its accursed disappearing platforms, I was unable to complete, and this left a bad taste in my mouth. The final boss is also quite difficult, requiring you to demonstrate a mastery over all the abilities you have learned over the course of the game, but when I had finished, I was very satisfied despite not getting the best ending. I would recommend the game to any fans of Metroidvania, but with caution- it is not a forgiving experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guacamelee!-gold-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507855">Expand</a></span>

Special combos and abilities are expertly introduced and keep the experience fresh and enticing throughout ; These amphibious game-play mechanics means that most of the special moves and combos used in combat articulate with the platforming elements to form an ultra-fluid action experience ;  Brilliant. The controls are ultra-responsive and are a joy to interact with. The pacing is superb and the levels are both, clever, challenging and action packed. The audio-visual presentation is both lovely and immersive. Simply put, this is one of the most ingenious and brilliant platforming experience to grace this medium.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guacamelee!-gold-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6391761">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros:
<br>+ Very comfortable controls that allow you to move intuitively (with controller)
<br>+ Interesting visual style
<br>Cons:
<br>- Feels very short
<br>- Some enemies get very stale by the end
<br>- Story starts promising and ends nonsensical
<br>
<br>This game bills itself as a &#x201C;metroidvania&#x201D; type platformer, and let&#x2019;s face it: it pretty much is. Some areas are inaccessible until the correct special movement is unlocked, but ultimately there aren&#x2019;t that many special moves, so many areas are open to you right from the start. You play as a luchador, so there won&#x2019;t be any weapons to find, either; the few additional moves you can get in the game are all grapples (a move you can complete when smallish enemies have taken enough damage). The low number of moves contributes to the short feel of the game (probably about 8 hours for the first play-though), but man are they satisfying! Throwing a damaged enemy through a whole crowd of others and sending them flying like bowling pins should bring a grin to anybody who picks up this game.
<br>
<br>On the other hand, there are only a few enemy types, and late-game difficulty increase consists largely of forcing you to take on more of them and introducing some unblockable types (read: fire-based attacks). As you get good, you&#x2019;ll find that you can destroy many enemie types in 1-2 seconds, which is good, because otherwise you&#x2019;d get really bored fighting the same 8-10 monsters.
<br>
<br>The story starts out feeling epic, but pretty quickly you find you&#x2019;re actually just rescuing Princess Peach from Bowser again. The boss minions of the main enemy have very crudely sketched reasons for working with him, nor is it ever clear just why your girlfriend was abducted in the first place. Furthermore, the devil is introduced as a character, then plays essentially zero role. Why introduce a pointless character you might ask? Maybe because the developers just wanted to&#x2026; in any case this is not a game you should play because it &#x201C;features elements of hispanic culture&#x201D;-you won&#x2019;t pick up any traditional lore at all.
<br>
<br>Overall, the game is pretty darn good, and very memorable in some parts. You may find that you&#x2019;ll get replay out of it if you go in for additional modes unlocked at the end of a run, but I&#x2019;d try to get it for less than $10 if possible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guacamelee!-gold-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3974209">Expand</a></span>

With its great Mexican atmosphere, great story, great animation and great and smooth combat, Drinkbox Studios made a great Mexican game with great melee combat!
<br>
<br>Guacamelee has some of the best atmosphere environment/scenery I have ever seen, with its transition from the living world, to the living of the dead like in Mexican tradition, to its great Mexican music, it really made me happy how much the atmosphere was put together well! The story is great and really made me happy seeing the comedy written in the story, as well as the great cultural references and game references like Castle Crashers and the troll face, it really made me smile and laugh
<br>
<br>The animation reminds me of the classical Disney and DreamWorks animations like Aladdin (from Walt Disney Animation) and The Road To El Dorado (from DreamWorks SKG) and many other great classical animations. The combat is smooth and very satisfying, reminds me like I am playing Dust: An Elysian Tale which also has great and smooth combat
<br>
<br>The only thing I was not really happy with is that the game is best played with an XBOX controller which I don&apos;t have and the controls especially on the keyboard are really awkward at first, but after getting used to them you will easily play through with the game, plus I did not enjoy the shift in difficulty, first the game is fun and enjoyable, next it is frustrating and you have to keep on retrying which kind of put me off, also I was dissapointed that as I heard the Main Storyline is really short (round about 6 hours) which I was surprised, but if you do finish all of the side quests the game should finish between 13-15 hours
<br>
<br>BUT with all of its greatness and some problems, you HAVE to, not should, you HAVE to get this game, sadly there is no Multiplayer Co-op but only offers Local Co-op
<br>
<br>Oh! Also, after 2 hours or so into the game... you get to play a chicken! OMG NEXT-GEN!!!
<br>What&apos;s next!?! Moving fish!?!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guacamelee!-gold-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4371015">Expand</a></span>

The second fight (flame face) was too easy and I first-attempted it. There are various sections of the game with gruelling horrible platforming sections that do not require much skill but patience. They are a cheap shot at making the game harder. You will find yourself clutching various buttons on your controller (or keyboard) at once, then messing up and pressing the wrong buttons. Breathe deep during these sections to reduce the risk of a panic attack... Once you finally beat these sections you feel rewarded... for about 30 seconds, then you are faced with another horrible section (ugghhhhhhhh). The third boss (Jaguar Javier) is SO FREEEKIN HARD. The game goes from -meh kinda medium difficulty- to -HAHAHA ALL THAT WAS JUST A TROLL NOW WE ARE GONNA GIVE YOU A BOSS WHICH YOU WILL ONLY GET 2 HITS ON BEFORE YOU DIE- diffuculty. All his attacks are fire so you cannot dodge them. He constantly gives himself shields which you neede to press some kind of combination which you are so likely to mess up, then he gets a hit on you. The annoying part is that you have a delay from being hit to getting back up again (which means as soon as you get back up again he sends you back down.
<br>
<br>OK, enough of the cons. Aside from what I just mentioned the game is preeeeety cool. The open maps are fun to explore and the metroidvanian exploration, backtracking, opening new areas and exploring them is all a blast. Also the art style is cartoony and cool. I like it. Let&apos;s talk about the core of the game: the combat. It is polished and satisfying to whack skeletons and throw them aginst the roof, reducing them to a mere pile of bones. The El infierno stage of the game adds an extra challenge for completionists to unlock all of the characters. The storyline is not the strongest point of the game, it is a cliche story of an ordinary guy who becomes a superhero to save the world from monsters, except this time, it&apos;s set in Mexico. &#xA1;Oh si! Burritos! The Soundtrack is catchy and fun, and the game is an (sorta) good time (apart from what i mentioned before...)
<br>
<br>By the way, don&apos;t try to play this with a keyboard, you will spend half an hour just re-mapping the atrocious controls, only to make them a tiny bit less atrocious.
<br>
<br>Verdict: This game is cool, but only get it if you are a fan of rock hard difficult games. If you are a fan of super metroid, try this game out. After all, it is metroidvania. For me however, what i hope to see in the future is an easy mode.
