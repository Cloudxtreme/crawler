<br>
<br>The only gripe I have is the story line which clearly wasn&apos;t its main focus, and its easily forgiven given the game play provided. However given I bought it for 26$, the value provided compared to allot of 60$ titles is astounding.
<br>
<br>I look forward to more titles from Wild Flying Hogs, they&apos;ve done a fantastic job!
<br>
<br>Do yourself a favor and pick up the title at 30$, you&apos;ll be supporting a developer who is dedicated to your platform and focused on value for your $.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1752240">Expand</a></span>

It feels old-school like Quake or UT, but upgraded with some very good-looking modern graphics and a few original twists. Why old-school? There are several secret places on each map (Duke Nukem 3D), the weapons are futuristic (UT), you run around faster than in many new shooters and you often have to move around a lot to evade a horde of robots with circular saws closing in on you. I think the main weakness of this game is not how short it is, but how poorly the story is presented. The comics seem cool, but they don&apos;t clearly communicate what the heck is going on. So when I reached the end of the game, I had no idea it was the end because the story left a lot of loose ends and I still didn&apos;t really understand what was going on. Another dumb quirk in this game is that your character feels very large and can&apos;t crouch. That would be okay except that the game has a lot of fences that are raised 4 feet off the ground (so you could get through IF ONLY you could crouch), and nooks that any normal person could fit through, but you can&apos;t because your body is so frickin&apos; big. Kudos to the devs for providing an FOV control (unlike many other games, I won&apos;t have to dock this one for prohibiting peripheral vision), and for working well in Stereoscopic 3D. And as many others have mentioned, there are really lots of weapons (2 times 10) although it&apos;s hard to earn enough XP to acquire all of them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=2277197">Expand</a></span>

Challenging battles that make you want to upgrade weapons and replay. great environment, and generally has an addictive quality as you try to minimise the amount of times you are killed. Could do with more upgrades for replays, and being a bit longer. not very good on sli systems  - patch needed.</span>

It&apos;s not going to play itself for you. It will challenge you, and boy is that refreshing in this endless stream of Gears of Duty: Waddling Space Marine Editions that have been rolling out non-stop for the past few years.<br><br>Sure, there might be 2 weapons. What the negative reviews &quot;forgot&quot; to mention is that each weapon has 10 different fire modes. That&apos;s right, 10. Making the total amount of weapons actually well above the average. And even if it didn&apos;t, the weapon modes in Hard Reset are SO FUN to use. You have your general array of plasma guns and rail guns and shotguns, but some of the modes are very original. For example the stasis grenade, which can freeze time around the impact point.

Do take note that I didn&apos;t even praise the graphics as that&apos;s not what makes this game stand out, but they are absolutely stellar.

This game is for anyone who played Quake, Painkiller, or Serious Same.  Minus the bunny hopping, this is a modern adaptation of the same game-play elements.  People tent to knock it because it is short, this isn&apos;t really a problem if you play on the hardest difficulty as you will spend hours looking for all of the nano so you can upgrade fast enough to survive all of the fights.  The engine reminds me of Unreal Engine 3 minus the high amount of Vaseline on everything.  The Cyberpunk atmosphere reminds me of Blade Runner. Neon Signs everywhere, amazing lighting.  Most recent patch added a survival mode with 2 locations.  Please support Indie Developers who make great games like this, they are too rare these days.  I&apos;m really looking forward to more DLC or another game by this developer.  The lack of Multiplayer, Game length, and the strange and somewhat forgettable story are the only downsides, but honestly, if you are looking for a fast paced shooter and not some gun porn, story is probably a low priority.  To be honest, I&apos;m slightly glad the developer spent time on a Singleplayer game, it added to the quality of both the coding, and the actual game-play rather then them focusing on something that would probably feel tacked on.  They should try in their next game.  Definitely a Flying Wild Hog fan.<br><br>Pros: Painkiller style    Fast paced single player<br><br>Cons: No/Difficult Bunny-hopping    No Multiplayer Graphics : 10/10<br>Sound: 10/10<br>Game-play 9/10<br>Story 9/10<br><br>Overall 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1844841">Expand</a></span>

The weapons are pretty diverse, and the game puts you in plenty of unique situations where you really need to think about your tactics and what weaponry to use, and that a furious pace. The graphics are wonderful, especially the weapon effects and the results on your enemies. Great fun!</span>

<br>1) As mentioned by metalhead980, the campaign is not much longer then the demo;
<br>2) The storyline should have been played out more. The demo promised much more cutscenes, but like a lot of movie trailers, all the best shots are shown in such a way as to be BETTER than the movie itself;
<br>3) It&apos;s fast-paced because playability is VERY simplified; you have barely any jump clearance, a limited sprint and no crouch feature, something rarely omitted from any fps.
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, the game itself is very kick-ass and I still replay it from time to time. It just doesn&apos;t live up to the hype of the demo, which by itself is almost as kick-ass. And I totally love the cyberpunk genre immersion, which could be better with more interaction with civilians and some NPCs, as there are none. The only targets are rampaging robots. So I give it a 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1993745">Expand</a></span>

This game suffers from another pit that it tries too hard to hide those &quot;exp&quot; pickups in extremely hard-to-reach places, staggering the game by minutes each time it happens. It also rewards player wrongly: being an action game, players should be more substantially rewarded by killing enemies faster, more brutally, or many at a time, etc. However, it rewards pickup scroungers like I said earlier too much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=2077787">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I especially enjoyed the visually spectacular graphics, specifically its detailed environments, bright, colourful effects, discernible enemies and plenty of explosions!  Throw in some fast-paced music and bassy sound effects and explosions, and you get a very visceral and satisfying FPS.
<br>
<br>Being an indie game, I was surprised to enjoy such a smooth and beautiful engine.  Some of the modern paradigms worked really well, including the leveling system coupled with nostalgic secret-hunting.  Find more secrets, and you&apos;re rewarded with better weapons and skills via the leveling system!  The only drawback was the checkpoint save system was too restrictive, inhibiting the player from &quot;messing around&quot;, and the interface can be laggy, especially when one wants to switch weapons or jump.  It took me 7.4 hours to beat Hard Reset on Hard Mode, and was excited that I can replay the campaign to max out my level with an &quot;Ex&quot; mode!
<br>
<br>Overall, I loved the experience, and really liked the game&apos;s design, but felt that it could&apos;ve been perfect with a smoother interface and less restrict save system.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=2501404">Expand</a></span>

Hard Reset is an inexpensive indie video game made by people who love old shooters. Its deceptive because the game looks and feels so good that you think that you&apos;re in a full-blown main stream video game but hopefully anyone with a brain will realize that anything that is lacking in this game is because there really wasn&apos;t  a big corporate budget to back it. Look up the company that made the game, Flying Wild Hog and you&apos;ll see that they&apos;ve never made anything else. As soon as people started talking about this game I dove right into looking up information about it and when I found out that it was made by developers pretty much on their free time I knew the game wasn&apos;t going to be Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I&apos;ve never had so much fun on a brand-new $30 PC game. Don&apos;t let some of these knuckle draggers bring you down, its good mindless fun, just don&apos;t go in expecting Call of Duty, its a 30 dollar video game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1759182">Expand</a></span>

Now imagine yourself at the controls.  That&apos;s what this game is like: non-stop explosive action in a gorgeous and compelling cyberpunk game environment from start to finish.  From the moment you suck your first group of 10 robots together with a gravity grenade then blow them all into the sky with an adjacent explosive barrel, or disable them with an EMP pulse and then electrocute them with the NRG Blaster, you will be in love.<br><br>While the game is full of these adrenaline-fueled scenes of chaos (where seemingly everything in the environment can blow up and kill your enemies--or you), you will also experience moments of meditative peace as you explore the beautifully crafted city while being moved by a sublime soundtrack.  When was the last time you played a game that encouraged you to find the secrets and presented you with a scoreboard at the end of each level?  Hard Reset brings back mechanics like that to make a game that stands in stark contrast to the cutscene-filled &quot;interactive movies&quot; that modern FPS games have become.<br><br>Add to all this a dev team that has been implementing gameplay suggestions from the community and you have a winner that should get way more attention than it has.

The thing i most hated during my playthrough was that after you entered an area, the exit behind you got blocked, so the game was presented to you just by running through closed arenas. The second thing was that there were invisible barriers everywhere. The game was open, but still, very linear. No autoheal was the main reason i bought this game and it showed how the cover system is absolutely not needed for a good FPS. But great gameplay made me to forget about these things and i enjoyed the game extremely. Very simple story, but who cares? This game is about shooting and its a thing this game&apos;s good at.

<br>There are three FPS games which shaped the whole genre. After Half-Life FPS games started adding dialogues. Almost every FPS after Stalker had RPG elements. And finally Call of Duty made FPS more casual. Now, imagine the world where these three games were never made. Hard Reset was made in this world. It denies all the cliches and instead gives you a good, old-school FPS, allowing you to carry around tons of weapons (technically, there&apos;s only two, but they both have five different modes) and fight giant bosses.  In short, if you&apos;re kinda person who spent hours killing monsters in the original Doom and now is waiting to enjoy Serious Sam 3, this game is definitely &quot;must have&quot; for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1767325">Expand</a></span>

<br>it is simply moronic to say a game is short that is designed with a) exploration and b) multiple playthroughs in mind! if you don&apos;t want to explore and don&apos;t want to try to upgrade your weapons and don&apos;t want to finish it in &quot;ex game&quot; mode - that&apos;s YOUR issue, not the game&apos;s. if you don&apos;t like it... fine. don&apos;t play the game. but it pisses me off to no end that these things (summed up as replayability) are barely even mentioned anywhere. everywhere, it&apos;s the same dumb &quot;it&apos;s short&quot;.
<br>don&apos;t let that fool you and consider that these morons are often comparing hard reset to full price games! (i would also recommend reading the thread &quot;4 hours my @ss, no way!&quot; in the steam forum...)
<br>
<br>aside from the fact that the length is perfectly fine for the price, the only things i would criticize about it is that the graphics are &quot;just&quot; good but nothing groundbreaking (which many comments made it sound like), that there is no quick save and the cut scenes feel pretty chaotic at times. i respect innovative story telling but it just feels like a bit sluggish writing to me. the look and atmosphere of them is great though.
<br>between that and the fun gameplay and the insane amount of upgrades (again - if you only run through it once, you probably won&apos;t even see all weapons!), this is a must have for any old school shooter (as in: quake, unreal, duke nukem 3d) fan!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1759154">Expand</a></span>

And I really like it because it&apos;s first game like this since...i don&apos;t even know! All the other ones are call of $hitty ripoffs that makes true PC veterans cry. This game brings the genre back to its roots. No infinite health, no infinite ammo, carry as much as you damn well please, explore the areas to gain edge against enemies, and most importantly - have some ACTION instead of cowering behind a box every 3 seconds because you got hit and your screen is flashing red. I don&apos;t understand why people are complaining about relatively short SP campaign - this game has tons of secrets into it, thus great replayability value. And remember - skilled player is able to finish basically any old school FPS in matter of minutes. Even very long ones like Half Life - record speedrun is just above half an hour. Try to do this with extremely scripted modern games that won&apos;t let you progress until script finishes (and there&apos;s one every 3 steps)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1919987">Expand</a></span>

Well I haven&apos;t mind it during my 1st playthrought, but after that I just wanted to dig a little, and understand its meaning - and its also quite nice - small additional flavor to overall experience.<br><br>But most of all this game is all about having fun. Gameplay just feel right, its all very intense except for some moments when you can take the breath an immerse yourself with this futuristic vision. Also it looks like devs will be supporting it for a while - as least I hope to get some additional content soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1768639">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s also by and large the best looking game you will see.  It puts any other AAA FPS to shame because of the fact that it is made exclusively with PC technology in mind.. It is not created to play well on crappy antiquated console technology that is 5 years behind the PC.  The mechanics and gameplay harken back to classic fast paced, actioned packed FPS games of the past when the industry wasn&apos;t coddling the masses.  If you want a challenge, if you want something beautiful and if you want gameplay like you&apos;ve never experienced before this is your game.

Unfortunately what I got was just a longer tech demo. This game just does not feel involving nor does it have enough variety in it to be called a full reelase. Many things are right - challenging and fast old-school combat, boss fights, pretty graphics and fluid engine. But many things are wrong - too many invisible walls in unexpected places, failed weapon selection system, checkpoint saving system, weapons despite upgrade are limited to perhaps choice useful in combat with other just being a demo, overall very short game and lack of variety in either enemies or environment. I wish developers great luck and REALLY hope to see a full-scale release from them. As for now, my cravings for good old school shooting will have to continue to be filled by good old Painkiller and Doom 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1830083">Expand</a></span>

When I first heard about the game, I was expecting something similar to DOOM, complete with the cleverly designed levels that characterized the first and second entries in that series. Instead, this game is basically Serious Sam, right down to the &apos;run at you and explode&apos; enemies. Only that doesn&apos;t work well with the relatively gritty aesthetic of Hard Reset compared to the haphazard and off the wall entertainment of the Serious Sam games. And even compared to the straightforward running and gunning of Serious Sam, I would say Hard Reset&apos;s levels are still underwhelming. Objectives are nothing more than excuses to guide you from point to point, killing the same enemies over and over again along the way, and secrets are almost always obvious. As I just mentioned, the enemy variety is sorely lacking and, other than having to dodge the ones that charge at you, none of them force you to change your play style. I think that the weapon upgrade system is great in concept, it makes the idea that your character is carrying around a bunch of weapons make a little bit more sense, and allows player choice rather than developer choice in terms of which weapons come next. Unfortunately, none of the weapons are overly worth playing with. I used the machine gun that you start out with almost exclusively for the entire game, occasionally throwing in mines as well. Hard Reset isn&apos;t a bad game, but it&apos;s not a wonderful one either, even taking into account the $30 price tag. It&apos;s full of unfulfilled promises and the ending comes out of nowhere and doesn&apos;t really resolve the game&apos;s minimal plot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1792351">Expand</a></span>

I played through it multiple times, beat it on Insane difficulty. But there were still many flaws with it. The enemies were very repititive, making the levels (which are decently long) boring. The campaign is short (About 7 hours completion time the first time through on Normal difficulty). The bosses were awesome-ly huge. Some of the most jaw dropping bosses i&apos;ve seen since Shadow of the Colossus or the end boss of Jak 3. The weapons aren&apos;t balanced, some will be far more effective to use and others are seemingly worthless. They claim that the action is &quot;fast paced&quot; but your movment speed (especially strafing and the VERY short sprint) are quite slow for an arcade shooter. I have a higher-end PC and my framerate still chugged at times when the enemies got close or explosions were a plenty. Now, my 2 biggest problems with the game: 1) Enemies can damage you through walls. You can sit inside a shipping crate and missiles will hit the outside top of the crate and you will take damage from it. In once of the boss battles you hide behind statues while the boss shoots missiles at you, you can take damage from rockets hitting the opposite side of the statue. There is one part of the game where you ride a glass elevator and you can get inside while enemies are chasing you. I successfully go inside with the door closed and those enemies were able to melee attack me but i was unable to shoot them as they were on the other side of the wall. 2) The story. It was **** I played through 10 times and i can still only tell you the very basics of the story. The main problem with it was not that it wasn&apos;t a decent story, it was the way it was presented. Instead of making real cutscenes with their awesome graphics the devs put their hearts into, they made a **** comic. Really? A **** comic? It was god awful. Bottom line is Hard Reset has a lot going for it and can show a lot of promise in the future if the devs fix the issues of the first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=2287155">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Standard: shorgun, machine gun, rocket launcher, mine, etc
<br>Energy based: railgun, plasma ball gun, electric bomb thrower, etc
<br>
<br>Each weapon has 3 upgrades that give extra effects or even new posibilities. Like the railgun being able to use X ray vision and easily hit targets behind objects. Or homing electric balls, etc
<br>
<br>The interface with doors and upgrade terminal is cleverly using the PC mouse. If your pointer is close to the terminal screen it changes to a small pointer and you can click the button to open the door.
<br>
<br>The level design has destructable surroundings, that could help you defeat enemies.
<br>
<br>The enemies are not limited to a few, but the boss fights are nice! They are huge!
<br>
<br>Between the levels there is an animated video telling the story in between. Interesting way of drawing.
<br>
<br>This game stands out in the whole list of doom clones. Certainly entertaining.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=2265160">Expand</a></span>

Shoot waves of enemies, hit switches, complete game. There is a story in this game, however it is throw away and disjointed. The gameplay however, feels fantastic. Far more than the even more recent serious sam 3. The setting is superb, and the visuals are breathtaking and cutting edge to say the least. The visuals/world and physics add this incredible layer of chaos and the pumping techno music, and pumping techno lighting make the game feel like a cyberpunk rave. If you are sensitive to flashing bold lights and electronic music. Don&apos;t play this, you will have a seizure. If you are not - and this kind of thing gives you a buzz - it might be the best game of this type for you as well.  It even has an rpg-like upgrade system, and a reason to explore the world attached to it - in the form of glowing orange collectibles that act as &apos;xp&apos; or &apos;currency&apos; for upgrades. The biggest downfall is the repetition of the enemies. Best played in short spurts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=2217592">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Absolutely linear plot (that was meh... in my opinion) with a passable disgruntled badass main character. The UI never quite felt right to me but honestly didn&apos;t really care much since this was a rather fun game and you spend more time shooting than looking at the UI elements. Though not exactly my favorite type of game, I&apos;d say it was worth the few hours I spent doing the campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=3829287">Expand</a></span>

I mean super meatboy looked like ass, but the game play was clever and fun, the reverse is true here.<br><br>The controls get flaky when action heats up, terrible lighting (I&apos;m a military grade security cyborg, but I cant work a flashlight so I have to stumble around in the dark???), dumbass invisible walls EVERYWHERE, dumbass gates that remain locked only to stop the game from being 20 minutes long, check points only (ugg)  that force you to repeatedly play boring sections, poor weapon upgrade paths that if you choose &apos;wrong&apos; make it impossible to kill every boss, very limited number of types of enemies...<br><br>The game could have been really really good, you know Blade Runner meets Terminator.  But the huge number of compromises that were made because of budget restrictions or whatever to the gameplay render the game dull and frustrating.  Maybe they could have spent less on music, actors, and graphics and a little more on gameplay dev.  Nonetheless, I&apos;m glad an indie shooter PC only game was released in 2011 and I&apos;m glad I could support them with my $15.

On the downside there isn&apos;t a large variety of enemies so you end up killing the same machines repeatedly, and the length can be considered short, although I thought it was reasonable.

Some things look like they were made for 90&apos;s game. Lighting feels wrong. Weapon system sucks, because effects of some weapons seem to be duplicated, and you frequently need two button presses to select one you need, can easily die while doing it. Some weapons, like smart gun, are too cheap, and there is no fun in using them.<br>Dumb story. Irritating in it&apos;s stupidity and pointlessness.<br>Still, I finished this game and would give it a 6 or 7, because it still made me remember some good games of old, better than this one. But points are deducted for their shameless self promotion tactics. Using classic writers and games to promote this mediocrity? Writing dozens of fake reviews and up voting them? You deserve to burn in hell for that.<br>And in case someone wants to play a much better fast-paced 4-hour game with cyborgs, transforming weapon, lots explosions and huge robot bosses, try Vanquish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=2303306">Expand</a></span>

Perhaps what was most impressive about the game was the fact that the presentation was so top-notch and attention to detail so good that it didn&apos;t even feel like an indie game. As probably everyone admits here, even the negative reviews, the visual aesthetics are really stunning (even on low graphics settings) and the environments are atmospheric. The gameplay is quite straight-forward. You go round from area to area, fighting off groups of robots, and then upgrading to new weapons and facing a bigger challenge. Although this may seem repetitive, I personally have had a lot of fun, because there was a very decent variety between the different weapons. You have two types: the ballistics type and the energy type. Each one had 5 different weapons you could acquire through upgrading, so that&apos;s 10 weapons in total really, plus each weapon had two different firing modes, so in a way you have up to 20 different ways to kill the enemies. And it&apos;s not like all the weapons are similar. In fact each and every weapon could be useful in certain situations. I personally found myself using every single one of them at some point. And the fighting itself was a little more engaging than what you might expect. There were a lot of destructible and explosive objects in the environment, so using environmental kills is highly encouraged throughout pretty much the entire game, which was a really nice touch, because many games of this style tend to suffer from the lack of this feature. The boss fights were pretty challenging too. In fact the whole game was challenging, and I notice a lot of negative reviews here criticised the game for being too hard. But that&apos;s what the Easy mode is for. If anyone wants a casual experience, they should play on Easy, and if they want a challenge, then they should try higher difficulties. As for story, yeah, maybe it wasn&apos;t anything too special, but it did add some spice to the game, and the comic-book style cutscenes in between the missions were a really nice addition in my opinion. Admittedly the game isn&apos;t very long. It took me about 7 hours to complete the original game plus the Exile DLC, but this is pretty standard for single player FPS games, plus the game was fun enough and I am sure I will be back to it again in the future, especially that there are plenty of Steam achievements to get. And speaking of DLC, I thought it was really decent that the DLC was actually free and comes together with the original game at no extra charge. Now this shows that the developers are really passionate about delivering a good, satisfying game to the fans and not for dishing out extra cash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=2888361">Expand</a></span>

There isn&apos;t a lot to see here, really. It definitely harkens back to the FPShooters of the past, but not entirely. Its gameplay is as simple and repetitive as the old shooters, but the level design is definitely modern in that it&apos;s mostly linear and scripted - essentially the worst of both worlds for me. This definitely isn&apos;t the boost of adrenaline the FPS genre needs (which is how a few people I&apos;ve met have described it) but at this point I don&apos;t know what is. Runnin&apos; and gunnin&apos; has never made for great gameplay, at least for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1756038">Expand</a></span>

<br>Story isn&apos;t too cool, but interesting. Shooting robots is funny. Especially shooting big boses. When i say big i mean 15 meters hight spider or 30 meters hight big guy.
<br>Graphic is pretty good. Enjoyed game on hight graphic settings,
<br>Sound is awesome too.</span>

It&apos;s mediocre at best. Offcourse, it&apos;s arcade shooter fun.  But it has so many annoying flaws. First of all - the story. It&apos;s totally dumb. You can skip the cutscenes as fast as the game loads and jump into action without knowing or caring about the story.  It just does not matter, it&apos;s rubbish.   Graphics are cool, right. But there&apos;s only one landscape to watch  - cyberpunkish city. You&apos;ll get tired of it very soon.   Guns are fine and the idea of modules/modifications is pretty cool. But you cant really use the full potential of that idea... the modules switch kinda slowly. All your hopes for a fast pacing shooter and using all your arsenal at the proper moment... it all ends, when you&apos;re stuck in a corner with enemies all around you, trying to change your gun from rocket launcher to shotgun... and ending in blowing up yourself up... And guns are not the only problem.  Even your character seems slow, unable to avoid most of the attacks. Strafing, jumping - it does not matter. You&apos;ll end up getting shot/sliced/rammed...  Comparing this game to glorious Painkiller is a bit off.  That&apos;s not Painkiller. It&apos;s not trying to be.<br>It has its good moments - believe me, killing waves of robots and finding a way to use environment against them ... is fun!  But overall the game is good at pissing you off. And the game ends before it starts - 4h of gameplay? ... Developers promise to patch the game and some dlc are in the making. Maybe then i will try to replay the campaign... But for now?   Just 6/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1757969">Expand</a></span>

There is little in way of player decision or choice save for what you upgrade: and even that is rather meh, because all the upgrades are simply plonked onto the same two weapons and are powered by the same two ammo types.  Plotwise?  In truth, I wish there wasn&apos;t a plot, because what little plot there was was laughable and presented poorly.  I thought the Max Payne noir-esque aesthetic interesting, but the comic art was not very well drawn, and contrasted jarringly and greatly with the in-game aesthetic, which was brighter and more colourful.<br><br>To be fair, I found the in-game aesthetic to be rather nice.  A lot of detail went into the environments of the early maps: look up and you&apos;ll see wires dangling all over the place, with massive blimps crossing the skies above said wires and neonsigns.  But that was pretty much it: it just looked nice, but did little more.  The game simply didn&apos;t engage the player on a level, which was a great shame because the game, as a cyberpunk FPS, had potential.<br><br>All in all, I&apos;ll say it&apos;s a game that you should only get if you&apos;re a big fan of Doom, Unreal or other old-school shooters; and even then only when it&apos;s on discount.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1754764">Expand</a></span>

I miss the days when &quot;Ultra&quot; or &quot;Max&quot; settings would bring a 1-year-old PC to its knees. Music is decent but repetitive. Voice acting is bad and in many cases cringe-worthy. Story, while not terribly important in an FPS is boring. Levels are linear and repetitive. Secrets are too easy to find. Combat is relatively fun at least, and there is a good variety weapons since each of the two guns has 5 unique modes. Finally, I don&apos;t like the fact that the first patch straight up decreased the difficulty. There was absolutely no reason for that. If you&apos;re an FPS fan, it might be worth picking up on sale since it&apos;s cheap to begin with, but the game had so much more potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1765148">Expand</a></span>

The visuals are pretty nice, the guns sound cool, but it honestly just screams mediocrity. There are only a few types of enemies, all of which are easily taken down by the incredibly powerful RPG that you can unlock about 1/3rd of the way through the game (meaning about 2 hours in. It&apos;s really very short) that also doubles as a sniper rifle with a single upgrade. The game is very boxy and linear, even though it flat out says &quot;You don&apos;t always have to take the obvious path&quot;, since there usually is only one path.<br><br>People often say this game is brutally difficult, but on Normal it was incredibly easy. So keep that in mind if you want a challenge.<br><br>And now, my biggest problem: The story. I don&apos;t know what they were thinking. It&apos;s like they made the game, decided that they needed a story after all, and then wrote it up over a coffee break. They leave practically everything unexplained, and the game just suddenly ends. Big boss battle that has nothing to do with the overarching &quot;story&quot;, and then the credits roll with absolutely no conclusion at all.<br><br>Honestly, play this if you&apos;re really very bored. Other wise, let it pass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1765086">Expand</a></span>

Then i hit the real snag in my review.<br><br>I&apos;m a casual gamer (i play all kinds of games, but not for hours on end anymore), and have a lot of interruptions in life. Hard reset has no way to do your own manual save points. This forced me to re-do many many parts of the game over and over again because I couldn&apos;t sit down long enough to get to the next checkpoint. On top of that, the game won&apos;t save the upgrade credits you find along the way if you do happen to die or have to close down the game between plays and you didn&apos;t hit a way point. Without the upgrade credits, you can&apos;t upgrade your weapons. This forced me to try to remember all of the upgrade locations and frustrated me even more when/if i died. This completely soured my game experience. A simple manual save option would have greatly improved my rating of this game and should they ever add it in a patch, my review will be revised.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=1775270">Expand</a></span>

Putting you into a future setting, with a war dividing man and machine. PROs- Hard Reset captures the intensity of most top notch shooters. Allowing you to customize your weaponry with power ups, that are scattered around it&apos;s futuristic metropolis. The game shines with stunning graphical capabilities, as explosions rumble and electricity ignites beautifully. Showing an array of over the top mayhem, the AI is intelligent and deadly. Showing no mercy by strategically charging you position no matter your location, even separating their numbers to ambush you from front to back. Mainly the same minions of enemies in the opening, Fly Wild Hog studios does gravitate to more elaborate combinations of enemies towards the mid eventually. The length isn&apos;t extremely short, but scavenging for useful items thoroughly will still leave you with under 10 hours of game-play. The campaign has some direction and feel, with a few noteworthy turns. CONS- Fly Wild Hog Studios has done an attempt at making a franchise shooter, to say a few hiccups along the way would be an underestimate. The AI is unbearably difficult at the insane setting, making the game more of a job then entertainment. Hit detection was a major problem through my walk-through, to the extent of dead on and still the conclusion of a miss was absurd. The voice acting is humerus in the beginning, but as the story drags its feet. It becomes annoying to the point you just want no dialogue till the conclusion. Such repetitiveness of enemy units in the same formation is overlooked in the first few hours, but as the 4th and 5th hour enter. The game becomes so repetitive that it will leave you with the feeling you just played the same outcome of the last fight and the last fight and so on. The story is weak, and lacks emotion and character. Other than the character of being an annoying muscle head of common sense, with the sum of his vocab being minimally lost in a few swear words and couldn&apos;t you have thought that in your head like questions. CONCLUSION- A good game for a one time play, the price point is questionable on what it gives. The graphics and mayhem are the strong suites, along with the sophisticated weaponry that has multiple secondary functions. Impressive take on the first go for their studio, but it can&apos;t get my full appeal without fixing the important aspects that basis of any shooter. Hit detection is must, and without it, even on an easy setting the game feels fickle. BOTTOM LINE- Hard Reset gets a 6.9 out of 11 by CD0</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=2863050">Expand</a></span>

The upgrade system is implemented quite well, there are some tough choices to be made, and what upgrade paths you choose will ultimately affect how difficult the final boss will be to bring down.</span>

More types of enemies, diverse locations and even darker, metallic, shining, cyberpunk atmosphere, and more achievements of course. Relatively cheap game, looks nice, runs well even on mediocre PCs.

Hard reset es un shooter old-school que vale cada centavo invertido en el. Eso si, debes de estar consciente de que es lo que est&#xE1;s comprando, ya que este no es un shooter que trata de mostrar una historia &#xE9;pica y situaciones pendejas, sino uno donde todo se resuelve como debe de ser, a tiros con m&#xFA;ltiples explosiones. Pero de todos modos, &#xBF;qu&#xE9; importa la historia cuando puedes pegar de tiros a todo lo que se mueva? Esto es algo as&#xED; como la carta de presentaci&#xF3;n del juego, y lo demuestra MUY bien.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=3864316">Expand</a></span>

It comes to us by the grace of some of the folks behind Painkiller, and is comparable to games like that and Serious Sam in its sensibilities. Numerical health, hordes of enemies, very big guns all with alternate fire options and no need to be reloaded, gigantic bosses and lots of secret areas to find. It even has a new game plus function, so you can keep on buying upgrades and try out weapons you missed. The story is a bit thin, being the tale of a gruff, alcoholic enforcer who rebels against his corporate overlords, but that&apos;s not what games like this are about. It&apos;s a game about fun, and blowing up robots in the most graphically pleasing way possible. All of the weapons are useful, and you will have to switch between them quickly. Luckily, switching your CLN firearm or NRG weapon&apos;s modes does not reset their cooldowns, so you can to keep up a sustained fire rate, which you will need to do to keep up with Hard Reset&apos;s incredibly aggressive enemies. It&apos;s also extremely affordable. So if you dare, then let Hard Reset take you back to the golden days when men were men, cover was for amateurs and pulling the trigger made things go boom. I recently replayed this game and enjoyed it even more then the first time I played it, as I also had the chance to play the free Exile DLC, which adds several new levels to the campaign. It seriously beefs up the game&apos;s total length and adds a more satisfying conclusion, as well as another boss fight. If you didn&apos;t play Hard Reset when it first released, or you did and found it lacking, you&apos;d be doing yourself a favor to give it (another) shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=6508004">Expand</a></span>

It mainly looks like this the whole way to the end  you enter an arena, shoot swarms of enemies, take some medipacks and powerups, upgrade some stuff and go to the next arena. Overall very simplistic gameplay but fast and satisfying. Lots of lightning and blur, nice textures here and there, nice looking maps, few ok bosses and that`s it. The story is so generic that it would not make any difference if they did not include it at all. Adequate for gamers looking for pretty fast arcade shootemup game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=3153884">Expand</a></span>

That may be the general idea but in doing it keeps all the failings that those old school games had like crap controls and repetitive gameplay. The best thing about Hard Reset is that is looks great. Very detailed environments, stunning lighting and fluid character/enemy movement. It&apos;s unfortunate that those pros are nixed by its cons: limited controls with no ducking or action activated options, sticky floors/corners where the character constantly gets stuck (or usually trapped) on corners and debris, limited upgrading of boring weapons, short sprints (that can&apos;t be upgraded) and annoying gameplay. It&apos;s frustrating and ill-conceived and the narrative is propelled by unoriginal comic-book art  story and horrid voice-over work.  It does have its fun and challenging moments but the designers thought that the more crap thrown at you makes the game more &quot;challenging&quot;. The music is good and the foley work is great as well.  Too bad. This could&apos;ve been something great. Half-assed indeed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=3153507">Expand</a></span>

<br>Well, they don&apos;t come much dumber and frantic than Hard Reset.
<br>
<br>First of all, the game looks technically great! I can&apos;t say I&apos;m crazy about the art direction, but it does look shiny and technically competent.
<br>
<br>The story is... um... I have no idea. Something about AI and robots or something. The plot is paper thin and it&apos;s just there as an excuse for stuff to go boom.
<br>
<br>The level design is OK if a little contrived. It&apos;s all very linear with the odd secret room or had to reach area sprinkled around the map.
<br>
<br>Thankfully, the shooting justifies the price of admission. Frantic, crazy shooting with plenty of weapons and lots of enemy hordes to mow down.
<br>
<br>If you liked Painkiller or Serious Sam, you&apos;ll probably enjoy this brainless but very fun roller-coaster ride of destruction.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=5423838">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are good for an indie game and the environments are impressive and immersive (it&#x2019;s clearly influenced by Blade Runner, and that&#x2019;s no bad thing). Physics play an important role: there are plenty of explosive and electrifying objects in the environments to help with the frenzied firefights. The enemies are well-designed and quirky (some even have propellers on their heads) and, although there aren&#x2019;t that many classes, their attack methods develop as the game progresses to keep things mixed up. Although you only get two weapons both can be upgraded to add lots of additional fire modes (I liked this aspect -- some games have too many weapons). I really enjoyed this game despite the fact that I normally prefer a more nuanced shooter. It&#x2019;s fast, furious, and a whole lot of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=5887509">Expand</a></span>

Enemies are all the same and boss fights are not anything special, cool them are, I give you that. If you are looking for oldschool hardcore fps, pick up serious sam or Painkiller. This is just monotonous boring fps.</span>

<br>I seriously love the way this game looks. The city graphics are second to none for me, but I haven&apos;t played all the most modern games. Combat is great, if a bit tough at times. Although slightly short it has become one of my favourite gaming experiences. I played the demo a few times. I have played though on hard difficulty twice. My second play through took 12 hours including DLC levels. My first play through took longer partly because I was gawping at all the graphics.
<br>
<br>Combat with robots is extreme sublime.
<br>
<br>Really though I feel I am there in the comics, like they came to life, and I am in it. Incredible feeling. Awesome engine and concept. A good i5 and GTX650 Ti will keep frames rates above 25fps with settings maxed. It will be well over 25fps, but this type of hardware will keep it smooth in the most heated battles.
<br>
<br>Hint:
<br>Make the shotgun your first upgrade. It is a game changer.
<br>Take the railgun and RPG upgrades as soon as you can, as again they are game changers. (Other weapons may be just as effective, but I found these worked excellent. Other weapon types I did not even try.)
<br>These weapons are the game winners for me. I took them and all the combat gear upgrades.
<br>
<br>Minor bad point:
<br>One or two of the checkpoints are a bit far apart.
<br>My fight with the first boss nearly stopped me playing, but youtube showed me I had to use different weapons.
<br>One particular secret I can not work out. I could look it up online.
<br>Shame it is slightly short, even with the free DLC. I just haven&apos;t had enough for such a superb concept game.
<br>Occasionally very difficult. Especially in the free DLC content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-reset/user-reviews?user_review_id=4346128">Expand</a></span>
