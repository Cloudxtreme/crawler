<br>
<br>The puzzles are not fun and to make it worse they usually have their own set of horrible controls and on top of they are timed, you might know how to solve the puzzles but end up getting annoyed at the horrible controls. Some puzzles are just trial and error and there is a few puzzles which make absolutely no sense (unlocking a certain door), I googled so see if this was a known way to open a door and there was 0 results for opening a door in the way the game suggested.
<br>There are an insane amount of game breaking bugs (even with the update) that requires you to restart the game to fix a puzzle/screen, some screens load without half the assets and you walk around an invisible maze of where the stairs and platforms should be.
<br>
<br>The game series should have been handed over to Telltale, at least they know how to make a 3D puzzle games!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syberia-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7264954">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- Movement/interaction: It&apos;s extremely clunky, especially on keyboard/mouse. Sometimes it completely breaks as your character moves on her own despite input.
<br>- Camera angles: I know they probably are a staple of previous games but they just don&apos;t give any good or useful angles and are even contributing to the problem of movement. It simply would have been more appropriate with a 3rd person camera like that of e.g. Life is Strange or any of the Telltale games.
<br>- Lip syncing: Aside from often being completely out of sync sometimes there&apos;s not even any voice at all for speaking characters.
<br>- Poor optimization: Frame rates can dip down to 40 and 30 FPS even on high-end hardware, despite last-last gen graphics.
<br>- Overall lack of polish: One example of this is in Dr. Olga&apos;s room near the beginning of the game where it&apos;s just completely silent. No sound effects, no music, not even any footsteps from your character. This lack of attention to sound design is prevalent throughout.
<br>- Poor logic in many puzzles: It&apos;s easier with an example (minor spoiler).[spoiler]    As you visit Mr. Steiner in his shop he has a heart attack and you have to get him his medicine with haste. He will gladly complain about you not finding his medicine if you look at the wrong stuff but he simply won&apos;t tell you where to find it (why?).    [/spoiler]    Ultimately it becomes extremely contrived [spoiler]    and you end up having to spend half an hour or more finding that you have to turn back a clock to a random time in order for it to make tea and add pills to the tea which you can then give to Steiner...    [/spoiler]    These types of illogical puzzles are just tedious and should be left out in my opinion.
<br>
<br>There are a couple of good- and potentially good things however:
<br>
<br>+ Mechanical puzzles: Unlike in any other game I&apos;ve played this is a very interesting and unique gameplay mechanic.
<br>+ The game doesn&apos;t rely to much on previous storyline which means new players to the series (like me) can get into it. Though I was confused a couple of times who Oscar was. Like in Dreamfall Chapters, they should have added a recap video at the start of previous games.
<br>+ Music is good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpFwrvuaGdc
<br>+ Dialogue wheel: I always love having choice in what the protagonist says. Even if it&apos;s just an illusion of choice.
<br>
<br>I will comment further on the overall story and characterization after I&apos;ve finished the game. These were just my first few hours of impressions. Given these, I do not recommend the game currently. Especially not at &#x20AC;40, unless you&apos;re a hardcore fan of previous games. For everyone else, wait for it to be polished and reduced in price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syberia-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7253749">Expand</a></span>

This game has me hooked and for the 20 to 30 hours I&apos;ll be playing my way through it, it really takes the place of movies and novels. It has a presentation similar to movies but a length and depth more akin to a novel.

<br>
<br>So, I&apos;ve probably played a good chunk of this game now. I had my expectations set low, as I didn&apos;t really know how this game would turn out. Before playing it, I thought it would be another tacked-on sequel, with no new ideas or personality.
<br>
<br>I was pleasantly surprised.
<br>
<br>The game follows Kate Walker, after being ditched by Voralburg. She&apos;s on the run after not returning the contract for the Voralburg factory, with accusations of embezzlement. However, she has the Yukals on her side on her journey.
<br>
<br>About controls: they have changed since the first game. Don&apos;t get me wrong: this is still a point-&amp;-click, but movement is controlled using the arrow keys. I guess you could say it&apos;s slightly clunky, but it works.
<br>
<br>I personally think that the graphics are quite nice, however, that could be subjective. Some parts definitely look better than others, and I actually prefer the in-engine cutscenes to the pre-rendered ones. The graphics aren&apos;t any different to the trailers, so you can probably make judgement based on that.
<br>
<br>Puzzles and story is where this game really shines. The story does a great job at continuing the adventure: and adventure there is. I&apos;ve already experienced some plot-twists I&apos;ve never saw coming, and I feel that the pacing is quite good. The puzzles are similar to the previous games, if not slightly easier (which is welcome to me, as I found the previous games pretty difficult).
<br>
<br>The only criticism I would say is at the beginning, the game sets you down a narrow path. If you find an item, sometimes you cannot get it until someone points it out to you. This is pretty frustrating.
<br>
<br>Overall though, this game feels like a Syberia game, and gets the tone right. A couple of technical issues are there, but they have not made me enjoy this game any less.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syberia-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7251429">Expand</a></span>

Graphic is so outdated, moving to full 3d made it even worse. Laggy on GTX1080, no widescreen support. Plot and characters are childish, don&apos;t even compare to previous installments.

The game does not support widescreen monitors, the highest resolution is 2560x1440, and the graphics settings do not have many options. Often there is lag between speeches and person&apos;s facial expressions. I am very dissaopointed.</span>

<br>click everything til something happens...
<br>And once you have some stuff in your inventory... click everything else until something else happens to progress the game&#x2026;
<br>The puzzles here are actually pretty logical, so a guide isn&#x2019;t really necessary for this game..
<br>But does that mean the 8 and a half hours are fun to play through?
<br>No
<br>not at all&#x2026;
<br>The puzzles have way to many steps to them, bringing the game down to a constant crawl&#x2026;
<br>and none of the puzzles are interesting or make you feel clever
<br>The answers are all obvious... you just have to go find the stuff and trade things for other things
<br>They all feel like fetch quests..
<br>Annoying roadblocks in the way of the story&#x2026;
<br>Which also isn&#x2019;t good&#x2026;
<br>Evil doctors are after you of course&#x2026;
<br>They&#x2019;re trying to get these village people to leave...
<br>But I just couldn&#x2019;t take any of it seriously
<br>the characters are lazy
<br>the voice acting is a joke...
<br>The lip syncing looks like they didn&#x2019;t even try...
<br>They probably didn&#x2019;t actually...
<br>They just made the lips randomly move...
<br>And the audio will randomly put pauses in between words
<br>At least Kates outfit is cute.
<br>I give Syberia 3

Syberia 1 &amp; 2 was reasonably looking in their times but were jam-packed with atmosphere, interesting puzzles and story elements. Unfortunately, Syberia 3 was a bit of a letdown to me.
<br>
<br>The story was a bit mediocre, the characters simplistic and the runaround mundane. The puzzles weren&apos;t that challenging once one figures out there was an interaction point missed somewhere down the line - even when hints are enabled - that was somehow overlooked because the main character faced the wrong direction when walking by and didn&apos;t prompt. Other times, the interactive points went offscreen and had to reload from autosave.
<br>
<br>Ah, autosave. There is only one save which you should backup periodically just in case and there is no way to save at any time. Technically possible, but I guess manual save had to go so people don&apos;t (easily) save-cheat on the 3-4 puzzles which have achievements attached doing them right the first time.
<br>
<br>The camera was terrible at times, not changing perspective when needed, other times changing and the direction keys suddenly meant different directions so the character started running back where she came from. But the biggest enemy were the stairs on themselves or combined with the camera angle shift: I spent a minute trying to climb the stairs to go up and down because the direction keys had reverse meaning on the top compared to the bottom of the stairs.
<br>
<br>The voicework is disappointing. The main character got the classical (English) voice from the previous versions but almost all the others have fresh young voices often sounding ridiculous when attached to a middle or old aged NPC. Other times, they sounded like the VO was recorded over the phone and not in a proper studio.
<br>
<br>The story was also non-engaging, even though picking up from where v2 left off, the premise of getting from A to B while military C is chasing the group I was unable to identify with. Maybe I missed explanations in game but the stage was kind of arbitrary.
<br>
<br>Maybe the only memorably thing was the music.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syberia-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7272899">Expand</a></span>

I love the cities and how the camera change the perspective as you walk. I love the atmosphere. Very artistic surroundings. I love the short cinematics when you discover something for the first time or you enter an important building. Or that the background changes when you move/remove objects or destroy things or open/close doors etc. I like that you can see your character from close up. I like the story and the plot. It is so interesting at all times. There are some things going on that you cannot predict! From diving to traveling on board or moving inside an abandoned subway station. Amazing! The carousel city seems a rotting hell - gives you the shivers. So perfectly creepy. The Youkols are crazy! The game is magnificent. Artistic. Epic.

<br>I am really glad that Syberia 3 actually happened. I played the game after the release of patches. It is so nice to see that the attempt to go from 2D from the previous games to 3D gave this interesting outcome. You actually feel you can explore this world.
<br>
<br>Looking forward for Syberia 4!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syberia-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7464300">Expand</a></span>
