It was a fun, decent batman game that doesn&apos;t offer anything new but does expand on what made Arkham City so great. HOWEVER, the PC version is riddled with bugs and glitches that can prevent you from continuing. I&apos;ve had to reset my game over 8 times because I was stuck in a position where the exit doors wouldn&apos;t open or combat was frozen or even trying to climb through a vent, your hands would get stuck. The larger city doesn&apos;t play well with the game either as there are times where it looks like you can obviously walk or jump over an obstacle when you have to walk all the way around a crack in the floor... I would advice purchasing the game for now as there are way too many issues for someone with a fair temper to enjoy.  This isn&apos;t even mentioning the multiplayer aspect of the game. While fun in itself, there are only 4 maps and one game mode as of current and will likely lose its gimmick value pretty quickly over time. Also, there is a stats reset issue right now in MP where your progress will not be saved upon exiting and returning to the game which is absolutely ridiculous. I&apos;ve lost hours of progress on this issue and the only thing gamers can do right now is to wait for a patch. With rookie developers like these, it&apos;s likely these issues won&apos;t be fixed for another few weeks. Great game, too many bugs. Do not buy for now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3670972">Expand</a></span>

I got through the game and I can&apos;t understand WHY this game got so many negative reviews. It has everything we could have asked for! Story is remarkable and I don&apos;t see absolutely anything wrong with it. In fact, I would say some parts are even better and more mind blowing than in AC. This is so far the darkest and most interesting Batmans IMO, since it tells us so many stories that shine the light on things some players were wondering about (those who didn&apos;t read the comics, of course). Glitches? Bugs? They happen! Throughout the game I had some here and there, but they didn&apos;t even frustrate me to the point where I would even bring it up if others didn&apos;t. I absolutely love this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=4573561">Expand</a></span>

Had this game been an original development, I would&#x2019;ve considered it a fantastic game. However, fundamentally the game is Arkham City, which carries nearly all of the game&#x2019;s integrity.
<br>
<br>The gameplay lacks the originality and intricacy of its predecessors. The fact that the game has reused the open-world map of Arkham City with the addition of some Christmas decorations says a lot for what to expect of the game. The puzzles also use the same framework as AC, but they don&#x2019;t have the same complexity. It feels like the developers just played it safe rather than pushing the limits of the game&#x2019;s engine. Instead of going through a process of repeatedly playing through a puzzle and fine-tuning it, they&#x2019;ve either made it simple with slack timing or used copypasta.
<br>
<br>This lack of play-testing is also very apparent by the amount critical bugs that plague this game. Some of which have been absolutely game-breaking, some have been patched but there are still many that have not.
<br>
<br>The combat is more difficult, but this is due to the fact they have increased the percentage of armed and special enemies are in mobs. Despite the fact that the enemy types remain the same, this is good as it does provide more of a challenge as to not disappoint the seasoned Arkham player.
<br>
<br>Warner Bros have done a good job at bringing the characters to life with a good atmosphere, and great animation and voice acting. It&#x2019;s not quite as good as the previous two games, but it is good enough that it&#x2019;s still very immersive.
<br>
<br>In my opinion, if you&#x2019;re a fan of the series I would hold off on buying it as the game doesn&#x2019;t quite justify its price. Aside from the cinematography, the game feels like DLC and is worthy of being priced accordingly. If you&#x2019;ve not played the series before, stop reading this and go and buy Arkham Asylum right now, finish it then buy Arkham City and finish that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3714721">Expand</a></span>

The free-flow mechanics are as tight as ever, and there&apos;s even a few new enemy types to be thrown in.
<br>
<br>But honestly, that&apos;s where the good news ends for me. The entire time playing this game, and even through the ending I got a whole &quot;Been there, Done that feeling&quot; playing the game. Some parts of the map are ripped right from Arkham City. The Curfew being enforced over the city makes the streets look empty, and being Christmas Eve, it&apos;s even set in the snow..Again.
<br>
<br>Warner took a key to what could be great, and made it mediocre. While Arkham Origins plays beautify, it never gets any near the &quot;Epic&quot; feel of the other games. Especially Arkham City. The story here is an &quot;ok&quot; Batman story, while the story from Asylum was &quot;good&quot; and City was &quot;One of my favorite Batman stories EVER in any media&quot;. The whole thing seems predictable and there only a few moments of epic-ness to be found.
<br>
<br>Where Origins absolutely nails it though, are the &quot;Boss Fights&quot;. Even in &quot;Injustice&quot; I had a better time fighting Deathstroke, or Bane as Batman in this game. The fights capture exactly how you think they might go from the comic, and are on par with &quot;God of War&quot; as far as boss battles.
<br>
<br>Now that I&apos;ve completed the game and am writing this review, I can&apos;t help but think how blown away I&apos;d be with it, if It was indeed the 1st game in the series. But after playing both Rocksteady&apos;s entries, it all seems a bit old. Almost like a yearly &quot;Madden&quot; or &quot;Call of Duty&quot;. Even though it wasn&apos;t even yearly!
<br>
<br>The voice cast is excellent. And the replacements for Kevin Conroy (Batman) and the Mark Hamill (The Joker) are excellent, and you hardly would even notice they&apos;re gone. But one of the main issues I had with the game was believing this was the 1st time Conroy&apos;s take on Batman had ever heard of The Joker. Conroy&apos;s Batman has been fighting Hamill&apos;s Joker so long hearing Bats discover the Joker for the first time, just didn&apos;t feel genuine to me, and maybe the story could&apos;ve been told in a different narrative.
<br>
<br>Again, It&apos;s not a bad game by any means. If this were the first &quot;Arkham&quot; game I&apos;ve ever played it&apos;d be a 10/10 for sure. But Warner really fails to introduce anything new or fresh. So if you&apos;ve played the last two, this whole game just kind of feels like one long expansion pack.
<br>
<br>If you haven&apos;t played any of the Arkham games, play this one first. Then Asylum, and City.. The way this series is meant to be played.
<br>
<br>Rocksteady absolutely nailed the feeling of actually being Batman more than any other game with the character has ever done. I&apos;m hoping maybe surrendering this license to Warner will let them be free to work on some other D.C. characters. Superman is begging to have a great game, and imagine a &quot;Max Payne&quot; style game featuring &quot;the Flash&quot;.
<br>
<br>There is some good ground work laid here, and if Rocksteady is indeed done with Batman, I can&apos;t wait for their next release.. And if more Batman is coming before another hero, we really need some fresh ideas.. Part of the story lacking here makes me wonder if Warner is missing Paul Dini.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3741540">Expand</a></span>

This initial disappointment overshadowed the rest of the game for me, no matter how good it became, and even the good part is a mixed bag.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re desperate for more Arkham City, and you&apos;re persistent, you&apos;ll get some fun out of this. I&apos;ve never been able to face playing it again, though. Playing Arkham City again and waiting for the forthcoming Arkham Knight might be a better strategy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=4376238">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The cons of this game: Yes, it is glitchy. But only sometimes and nothing at all that would make the game unplayable. They had one instance in the game where the dialogue should have been a cutscene, but instead used the player models.
<br>
<br>The improvements: The unlock-system for abilities I really liked. It allowed you to buy all the later/better abilities after you&apos;ve bought the ones before it (all abilities are connected and buying one unlocks a few others). The shock gloves are a &quot;gadget&quot; that make you much stronger that you can active after racking up hits on enemies, and they are GREAT.
<br>
<br>As far as story goes, I thought the Arkham Origins story was pretty good. I really loved the Arkham City story and it kept me interested and wanting to progress in the game. This game&apos;s story felt shorter, but it seemed to be more well polished. Batman actually learns a moral lesson (no spoiling what it is) and the sudden plot twists in the story were very cool.
<br>
<br>When it comes to side quests, I think overall I liked Arkham City&apos;s slightly better. Origins had half really good side quests and half not-great side quests. In City they were all just pretty good side quests, so it averaged out to be little better than Origins.
<br>
<br>Riddler Challenges. in Arkham City there were 282 Riddler Trophies, and then a bunch more scanning riddles besides that. As a person who likes collecting things and 100%ing games, this was even a little too much for me. In Origins I am SO GLAD they took down the count, with only 200 trophies (called Datapacks in this game) to be found, and no scanning things.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game was pretty good. No, it was not as good as City, but it was still a good game and got a lot more hate than it deserved. The only thing I wish is that the creators had ironed out the glitches BEFORE initially releasing the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=4573145">Expand</a></span>

In honesty this game wasn&apos;t a complete failure, but it didn&apos;t have the heart the previous two games did. As you play throughout the game you can generally tell the developers were sloppy and a lot of things will persistently bother you. I was a bit disappointed, as it was pretty clear this game was designed to be a guaranteed quick money grab riding on the success of the former batman games. But I&apos;ll give it a little credit, this game is still better than most of the trash they release these days. The story was good but not great. That&apos;s why I gave it a 7, which is a C, which is barely passing.
<br>
<br>Around the middle of the game I became frustrated by all of the things that was wrong with this game and I started to take note of them. I have decided to inform you so that you may be warned. They aren&apos;t spoilers:
<br>
<br>There are a LOT of things wrong with the combat system. Let me explain a few. I remember playing the previous two batman games and often getting 100x hit combos. It was difficult, but I remember it used to be deeply satisfying. In this game, that is nearly impossible. It&apos;s not that it is harder, but it is simply impossible to avoid getting hit under certain circumstances regardless of your playing skill. The problem is the &quot;counter windows&quot; (the little lightening symbols that indicate when an enemy is about to strike). Contrary to the previous two games, the &quot;counter windows&quot; are significantly shortened in this game. It is so short now in fact, that certain attack moves by batman take longer to execute than how long it takes for an enemy to display a &quot;counter window&quot;, which leads to batman getting hit no matter what. Let me hit you with an example. Batman begins a double-front-flip-roundhouse-kick-to-the-face on a thug. In the middle of it, another thug comes up to him and throws a haymaker (the &quot;counter window&quot;). However, the &quot;counter window&quot; is so short now that batman cannot do anything except watch as he gets smacked before his foot connects to his original target. If the &quot;counter window&quot; were longer, batman would have countered the other thug before or after he had successfully kicked the other thug. This to me, is a major MAJOR flaw in an originally perfect, unique, and badazz combat system. I am extremely puzzled as to why the developers intentionally tweaked something so that it would be fundamentally broken. My guess to their answer is &quot;we did this to make the combat harder&quot;. BULL. This is frustrating, not more challenging. Why take a perfect formula and ruin it? This totally turns me off from playing the combat bonus levels. Another thing that is wrong with the combat: lame gadgets. I know this was supposed to be &quot;younger batman&quot; but did they really have to take away all the fun gadgets? In arkham city I had so much fun chaining my combos being creative with so many of the quickfire gadgets. It was fantastic. Now there&apos;s only like four quickfire combat gadgets. And they&apos;re nothing new (ice grenade re-branded glue grenade? seriously?). And one more thing for the combat system: You cannot execute a glide kick unless you start from a ledge. Remember in the previous games when you were flying you got a little bat symbol over a thug&apos;s head if you could glide kick them (and it told you to press left click to execute)? Yeah, it&apos;s glitched even after the patch.
<br>
<br>And overall the game&apos;s just filled with glitches that constantly annoy you. The silent takedown from the back of an enemy sometimes just doesn&apos;t work and you end up awkwardly running into them and getting shot in the face. And there&apos;s a gadget called the disruptor (the same gadget that disables guns and such in arkham city, except heavily nerfed) in which its bullets sometimes do not register on the enemy. One time with the disruptor I shot an enemy with a gun about 20 feet away, clear line of sight, and I ended up using all of its three shots simply because it glitched and wouldn&apos;t disable his gun.
<br>
<br>Sometimes you finish a sidequest and the game tells you &quot;you have unlocked a new waynetech upgrade&quot; but it does not tell me which freakin upgrade I unlocked, or how to perform or use it. So I end up going through a good chunk of the game without knowing I could use a really cool combat move but couldn&apos;t because it didn&apos;t tell me about it.
<br>
<br>One of the biggest letdowns of the game were its bosses. To describe them in three words without spoiling anything: uninteresting, unintimidating, and repetitive. I remember the good bosses of this game in the past: fighting killer croc, in which you just felt so helpless and terrified, and fighting mister freeze, in which he learned your fighting techniques against him and countered you.
<br>
<br>I would recommend this game if it were around $20.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3888564">Expand</a></span>

<br>The details in Arkham Origins is near-perfect (at least to me). The characters and environments are well-detailed and nothing really important seems left out.

The game also show the beginning of the Batman/Joker relationship and it&apos;s very good(SPOILER). The biggest problem, for me, is a bug that occurred when I was with 2 hours of gameplay.

The game suffers from a lot of bugs that really hinder combat.  In several instances there would be enemies that I already defeated up and walking around during battle and in a large group you can get easily confused as to which is the enemy that&apos;s not really there.  At times the writing is insultingly terrible and at times it&apos;s done really well.  The is was the first in the series where I became annoyed and just decided to rush everything.  Overall it felt like a poorly executed expansion to Arkham City.  Not to mention the game was nothing more than a cash grab filler game until Arkham Knight arrives.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=4184199">Expand</a></span>

It might be the single-most underrated game I&apos;ve ever played.  I loved both Arkham Asylum &amp; Arkham City, but Origins is my favorite game in the franchise to date.  The combat mechanics are almost identical to the first two, but I thought the feel was actually a little different. I would use the word &quot;tighter&quot; to describe it -- as in it felt like strikes/counters had to be more precisely timed than in the previous two games. It made combat slightly more challenging at first, but once I adjusted I actually preferred it to Asylum &amp; City because I felt more in-control of my combat maneuvers which led to much longer, better, more satisfying combat sequences.  For instance, I never used Free Flow Focus mode on the first two games, but became a master using it in Origins.  I was also able to string together 40 and 50+ combos which I rarely if ever did in the other games.
<br>
<br>I also preferred the presentation Origins to the previous two Batman games. I&apos;m not the best an analyzing and articulating these kinds of things, but the game just had a more immersive, cinematic feel to it.
<br>
<br>It also had more gadgets/gameplay wrinkles than the first two games, which was a welcomed change.
<br>
<br>Overall, I thought Origins was an amazing game. 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=5487317">Expand</a></span>

The copperhead fight is too linear and SHOULD HAVE A TIMER (It doesn&apos;t make sense without one because of her attack) and makes it TOO EASY.

<br>2. Bane should have more attacks and do TON&apos;S more damage.  It&apos;s ridiculous how minimal the damage he does, even in the last battle
<br>
<br>3. The getting through a lot of the game is repetitive.... See a bunch of thugs, sneak around, attack the thugs...rinse and repeat.  Even the grappling ledges(statues) have the same look through out the game.

<br>Graphics are great, voice acting is great (a tad repetitive during fight scenes) but I wouldn&apos;t rate this game above a 6 because it does get repetitive after a while and the above (3) reasons.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3735479">Expand</a></span>

I started playing the day after it came out.
<br>
<br>Batman cannot pull the grate off due to a glitch. There is no other side route down below. I cannot find a noclip hack or console command that will get me past this point  but will continue that searching. So, my game has ended for now as the first patch did not correct this glitch. I tried the lowest resolution and turned off the PsychEX mode. No luck.
<br>
<br>My last option(s) until future patches come on the scene (that may or may not fix this grate glitch) is using XYZ numbered coordinates via Cheat Engine software to place Batman in another area either just beyond the grate or forward to the floor below. Or, I could get a save game from another user but I have not verified PC save games can be transferred around yet for this title. Lastly, I could start a fresh game and maybe the glitch will not be there the second time.
<br>
<br>The game has a weak save system typical of console games  looks like one autosave slot. I automatically deduct a point for that no matter what.
<br>I am thinking of trying to backtrack out and play other side missions but the way back may be blocked. I have spent many hours on the Steam and WBID forums and other websites trying to crack this problem. I am reasonably upset with Warner Brothers and WB Montreal. I think we need better consumer protection for our $60.00 investments. I could settle for a new game credit and they can lock me out of this game. Perhaps some groups of players can file a class action lawsuit to get credit back for the game.
<br>
<br>I have played over 60 titles of AAA PC games across 4 different PC&apos;s since Jedi Knight Dark Forces and this is one of the first times I&apos;ve hit such a game-destroying roadblock. That&apos;s my story.
<br>Based on these severe problems and the other similar bugs players have complained about, I can only give this game a 3 for now as I assume I will be able to get back on track.  (In the meantime I have continued playing Splinter Cell Blacklist  no such problems  and ordered Crysis 1 as I have not tried that series yet.)

<br>
<br>I was disappointed that Joker was yet again the person behind everything. I was really looking forward to another person taking that place, like at first i thought it would be Black mask because it built up to it so good, then it feel dead when it turns out Joker kidnapped him, but then it was starting to build up to Bane being the boss at the end, which would have been great on the account he was smart, cunning and knew that Bruce Wayne was Batman. Again it feel dead after he went dumb and mega-strong, which i understood, but was still sad about..
<br>When you go to confront the Joker all you do is beat him up and leave, i thought it might have been like the last two games were he makes the fight harder for Batman, for example in Arkham city, when he sent loads of his minions to fight Batman whist there were high speed train going at him, then he blow the roof up and trapped you (then catwoman saves you), which you then confront him (then he blows the floor and you fight clay face) and Joker dies which in my option was executed perfectly.
<br>
<br>Another thing that disappointed me was the Riddler (or enigma) missions in the game which were short and boring, making them pointless. The Arkham games are known for it Riddler missions are always big and puzzling, plus there&apos;s something at risk like hostages, but in this game the end result is you get your very first Riddler trophy, which does make you feel like you waste a bit of your time.
<br>
<br>Other then that the story is really good, because of the great twists and turns, and the one part when u save Alfred from dying</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3849709">Expand</a></span>

However, it fell short because of a plethora of bugs, some of them even hindering you from continuing the story line until they were patched. I would like to say that the game improves on its predecessor but unfortunately it does not. This review only concerns the single player portion of the game.
<br>
<br>Navigating the city is fun, but some buildings are &quot;ungrappable&quot; for weird reasons and it really ruins the flow of the otherwise good navigation. A welcome addition is the Batwing that enables you to fast travel after unlocking fast travel points. Another new addition is the Bat Cave, where you retrieve items, start challenges and talk to Alfred.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s only one new usable item, which I won&apos;t spoil. For some reason the Freeze Blast wan&apos;t good enough and it is now named Glue Grenade, with the exact same usage.
<br>
<br>Most boss fights are extremely generic and simply feels like an exchange of blows. Counter the boss, beat him up, counter him, beat him up. The game is very rarely difficult. The fighting is fun, but not challenging. The challenging (and fun) part is racking up huge combos. I don&apos;t understand the choice of villains either when there are so many recognizable ones from the Batman universe.
<br>
<br>The story isn&apos;t as engaging as the two previous games either. However, it is pretty fun that no one knows who you are and in some conversations you can really hear the fear among your enemies, not sure if you exist or not.
<br>
<br>By now I certainly hope that all bugs that I encountered are fixed. Here&apos;s the bugs I encountered:
<br>Batman disappears after fast travelling (had to reload).
<br>Mouse always visible in game, no matter what I did.
<br>Riddler informants displayed on map but not there when you arrive.
<br>Falling through the ground.
<br>Enemies getting stuck in environment.
<br>You getting stuck in the environment (happened once, and it&apos;s an open world game so it is forgivable)
<br>A vent that wasn&apos;t passable, hindering the story (Patched pretty quickly though).
<br>
<br>If you liked Arkam City, you will like this. No matter what people say, it is more of the same, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. The game looks beautiful, it never stuttered except for some slow motion finishers. Combat is fun if huge combos is what you strive for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3841110">Expand</a></span>

However it offers 12 hours of gameplay trough the singleplayer, it has an original multiplayer, and the grapichs are pretty good and a decent amount of side-missions to do after you`ve completed the singleplayer. Some glitches here and there but it never bothered me. The story is well built up and engaging. The only thing that really sucked with this game is the poor boss-fights. They`re to easy, to repetetive and way to short! However, I really  enjoyed this game all the way trough, it`s not as good as the other two, but it`s sure as hell a very neat prequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3843849">Expand</a></span>

The story is a standout, given the challenge of creating a compelling prequel narrative its amazing it turned out so well. Graphics are completely uniform with the other games in the series, ie excellent. Voice acting is totally up to par as well, obviously talents like Baker were not going to dissapoint. Its biggest &apos;sin&apos; is that is an iterative entry and people wanted more. But, and this is a big one, do you really wanna ping them so hard for that when we now have the hindsight of seeing how poorly Rocksteady incorporated the batmobile into AK? Sometimes gambles dont pay off. WB Montreal crafted a great and worthy game here, one that I would give a 8.5, Two years on I still feel it totally deserves it. Ive given it a 10 though simply to try and offset some of the ridiculous 0 and 1 scores.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=5637863">Expand</a></span>

<br>The relatively simple addition of blocking and counter attacks adds a great deal to the fight sequences, and makes them more than just a button mashing slog. A few new gadgets are introduced, but the total number is still manageable. The main quest is extremely linear, and there are few, if any, chances to deviate from the script. The world is larger than the other Batman games, but it&apos;s just populated with more of the same mobs, building types, geography, and trinkets.
<br>
<br>At release time the game is quite buggy. I was frustrated as hell when I realized the door I was trying to bypass at one stage didn&apos;t involve some trickery or inventiveness to get around, but just a restart to get past a software glitch. There are also numerous bugs affecting side quests, and thugs you need to interrogate, but can&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3743190">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Plus the game is lower in quality overall.  Batman model for some reason has really short arms, some missions are buggy, combat is just frustrating instead of fun because NPCs teleport around to get hits in or to avoid your hits, combat controls are often unresponsive.  You also arbitrarily can&apos;t grapple to some ledges.  Some missions force you combat where stealth would obviously be simpler, and quite possible.  Audio for distant conversations suddenly cuts in &amp; out.
<br>
<br>And don&apos;t get me started on mini and full cut-scenes where the PC is suddenly uncontrollable, forcing you to watch a built-in combat animation or dialog or something.
<br>
<br>Just play Arkham City again  it&apos;s mostly the same map but even the story is much more fun and colorful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3672385">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>One, the gameplay:  Just as great as Arkham City.  It&apos;s grittier, Batman is a hothead, earlier versions of criminals.  I love it.  The characterizations are great, especially the Joker.  A couple new enemies, a couple new gadgets.  It&apos;s a blast to play and viscerally satisfying to be the Batman.  The holiday atmosphere is a nice addition.  I think it&apos;s a worthy addition to the Arkham games and captures the philosophy, style, and play of the other two very well.
<br>
<br>Two, the technical stuff:  Unlike the other two games, this game was released with game-stopping bugs, glitches, poor AI, and idiotically obvious problems that HAD to be fixed before releasing.  I would absolutely not buy this game until they release at least one patch.  Maybe two.  The only redeeming things I can say about this is that 1.) you can _generally_ fix whatever glitch you encounter by restarting the last save and 2.) the main story doesn&apos;t seem to hit a glitch wall.  With restarts you can finish it.  Forget about the sidequests; from broken comm towers to bugged out disruptor you&apos;ll have a tough time finishing the Riddler or Penguin sidequests.
<br>
<br>I have a great time playing this game, right up until I hit one of the many glitches.  Then I get frustrated and turn it off and resolve to wait until the patch.  Then I convince myself it&apos;s worth playing because it&apos;s still a blast and try it again.  Rinse and repeat.  Going to be a great game when they get things fixed.  Until then, stay away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3679635">Expand</a></span>

Warner Brothers took no risks with Origins, and the few changes they made were for the worse. Everything in Arkham Origins is an exact replica of Arkham City, except with different buildings that you go into and obviously a younger story. They&apos;ve added a new combat gadget  the shock gloves  and replaced line launcher with a supped up batclaw which makes predator challenges better, but everything else is identical. The city is twice the size but is poorly used and there are no riddles to solve. The actual collectibles are still fun to get but the design is pasted from Arkham City. The other change is the unlock system. Instead of earning XP and unlocking whatever takes your fancy, you have to do them in a dictated order  for no reason whatsoever! Then there&apos;s the challenges, which again also have to be done in a certain order to gain the XP. Side missions are again pasted from City. The only thing that&apos;s stopping this game from being completely pointless is the story. Seeing the characters when they are younger is quite interesting, but the story lacks focus  it jumps around too much. Then there&apos;s the bugs. Performance issues aside, there are a number of game-breaking bugs which can be avoided with caution but persist throughout the game. It&apos;s also difficult to tell where to go in some parts of the game. The multiplayer is tacked on, and doesn&apos;t even work most of the time on PC. The concept and class system and stuff is all just flawed and tacked on for the sake of it. Overall, Arkham Origins has solid foundations but fails to expand upon them. Unless you&apos;re a big fan of Arkham City or Batman in general, I wouldn&apos;t recommend this game over Arkham City.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3674837">Expand</a></span>

I can&apos;t even finish the game because the final battle has bugged out so badly I simply get a black screen and a spasmodically vibrating controller.
<br>While I&apos;ve read reviews that call the storyline &quot;great&quot; I can&apos;t agree, the writing feels amateurish and Batman often comes off as whiny and immature and I don&apos;t care how early in his career this is meant to be that&apos;s not Batman. On top of the poor writing the decision to change the voice actors from Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill (Batman and the Joker respectively) to new people seems ridiculous as both new actors simply give their best impressions of their predecessors, bringing nothing new but instead being pale imitations of the series mainstays. Secondary voices such as Jim Gordon and the Penguin are cringingly bad as well.
<br>All up this has been a huge disappointment, and considering that I wasn&apos;t expecting much of a rushed cash grab handed off to a new developer in the first place it shows what a stink this has left in the room.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3684831">Expand</a></span>

<br>However, I wanted a living Gotham. I wanted sky-scrapers. Where are all the &quot;non-criminal&quot; people? Why is the whole city filled with only thugs and corrupt cops? You also messed up the combat somehow, I enjoyed the combat in Asylum in City but I found myself avoiding a lot of the groups in Origins.</span>

Falling through the floor, getting stuck in walls while climbing a ladder, game freezes up, some NPCs can&apos;t be interacted with when you need to for advancing the mission, I couldn&apos;t get past a boss fight because the game would mess up during a mid fight cutscene until they released a small patch to fix that specific problem. The list goes on and on. If it weren&apos;t for all the glitches, I would say this is a great game. Graphics are amazing, frame rate is extremely smooth on highest settings on my pc, story is pretty good, I love the boss fights.

The combat is one of my worst gripes. It seem to be designed to keep the player in large group fist fights. So far, there is no way to knock out an enemy before you just have to jump into the middle of a bunch of guys and fist fight. Throw some smoke into the fray to conceal your movement as you fight? Don&apos;t bother, it last all of 5 seconds and the baddies are still going to find you. Jump on a baddie from 10 stories up and knock him out? Nope, he will get right back up and keep fighting (WTF?). Hell you can drop on a dude 3 or 4 times and he will keep getting up. And the &quot;ground knockout&quot; move where you knock a guy over and then reach down and KO him is worthless if there are any other baddies because the move take SO LONG to complete, it is guaranteed to be interrupted. The fighting and gadgets, SUCK, hands down bad.
<br>Movement around the city feels extremely restricted. Your bat hook can only attach to, maybe a third of the building ledges and other surfaces that is should be able too. You will get stuck flying AROUND buildings because you can&apos;t grapple onto anything on the building itself. You will be looking at the edge of a roof and be getting a positive retical telling you that you CAN attach at that location, you will hit &quot;f&quot; and get the &quot;crossed out&quot; retical telling you there is nothing to grab even tho YOU ARE LOOKING RIGHT AT IT!
<br>And the glitches are numerous. I keep getting one where I go to drop onto a baddie from a flagpole, but instead, Batman will just lay down on his stomach on the pole and go nowhere. And if there is nowhere for you to hook your batclaw to pull yourself out of it, then you are stuck.
<br>
<br>I am sooooo pissed that they botched this game so bad. I would be happy if it were basically an expansion of the second game, but it is simply not good enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3738962">Expand</a></span>

<br>Batman Arkham Origins is NOT by any means a bad game, it&apos;s a enjoyable ride for any Batman fan, just lacking in comparison to the amazing Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, not to mention that Origins is just TOO easy, while in Asylum and City the battles were still easy but had some challenge which required you to use the skills you unlocked, in Origins however, there is no need for skill as you can beat every battle with little effort.
<br>The Boss battles are a great part of the game, my favorite being Deathstroke, but again, none of them pose that much of a challenge.
<br>The change of voice actors feels strange, whoever decided to cast Roger Craig Smith as Batman can go shoot himself, good god it sounded like that tool Chris Redfield in the Batsuit, while Troy Baker does a pretty good job as the Joker, rest of the cast is....meh.
<br>Batman Arkham Origins is a decent game, but a massive disappointment and is not worthy of being in the Arkham series. I just hope the true Arkham City sequel comes along soon.
<br>6.5/10(Decent Game) for Arkham Origins.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3671259">Expand</a></span>

A list:  Bugs.  A lot of bugs.  Bad guys stuck in walls. Dead-end rooms that leave you trapped.  The kind of bugs that make you wonder if there was any QA at all.  This is a knockoff of Arkham City, with a couple of new gizmos and some different baddies, it should not have been difficult to bring the magic that made that game special, but they missed the mark by a mile.    The main story is very, very short, though it had some cool moments.  Gotham is big, but the quests use the same three or four locations repeatedly making me wonder why. Most of it is flyover.   Side quests are also short and lacking.   While Arkham City&apos;s Batman was a joy to control, Arkham Origin&apos;s Batman gets stuck on things like rolled up carpets or chairs.    There are tall, tall buildings which cannot be climbed, and grapple points are missing in a ton of places they should exist.   To sum up, it&apos;s a very buggy, short, linear game in a giant sandbox that really needed a thorough debugging.  My thoughts are that this is what happens when a developer cannot focus and releases versions of a crappy game on every platform in the universe, including for some reason the iPad, but not Android.  While the focus is on that platform, the PC game product gets rushed out with bugs and a very short story line.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer:  I did not buy Arkham Origins to play a third person shooter.  Again, the developer has overextended and should have focused on delivering a great installment in this series.  Too bad.
<br>
<br>Now, I would like to chastise all reviewers and commenters that do not actually play the games they review, but base their opinions on YouTube previews, wishful thinking and marketing material from the developer.  Anyone who played this game should have thrown up their hands at the gigantic bugs in the side quests about a third of the way through the game.  They should have been frustrated by &quot;Batman&apos;s&quot; inability to scale small objects and short walls.  The reviewers did not.  It&apos;s very telling.  Giving a hugely positive review to a game this buggy and this disappointing does not help anyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3677312">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Unlike Arkham Asylum and City, Orgins fails to meet the high standard previously set, and in many areas falls far short of it.
<br>
<br>Boss fights are basically QTEs where you are locked camera facing the opponent and must click your mouse or press your keys at exactly the right time or be punished mercilessly. Side missions also suffer from the same unforgiving, scripted focus. Only after numerous deaths will a hint appear suggesting you might want to try something so hidden that you need the hint to find it. The horrific Mad Hatter section, which uses the Scarecrow platformer gameplay, is a perfect example of this.
<br>
<br>The reuse of basic AI behavior and weapons for both Cops and Thugs also smacks of lazy design. Since when do SWAT officers roam the streets with baseball bats and broken bottles?
<br>The city itself sacrifices content, atmosphere and immersive value to achieve a slightly larger playable area.  Not a good trade in my opinion as the game feels noticeably more empty and unalive than City.
<br>
<br>Fundamentally the game is solid, though some bugs, specifically the vent grabbing bug, have left certain side missions impossible to complete, and the terrible menu controls for PC are just pathetic.
<br>
<br>At least the graphics are nice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3667877">Expand</a></span>

Sad to say it was big letdown. If this game would have been released before Arkham City i would have had nothing to compare it to, but now? In this game they truly pulled Activision business model. Release updated game from before and use 90% of the budget into market, instead of making new innovation structures and develop brand new game that will be super good sequel. Quick pointers here:
<br>
<br>Pro&apos;s: New hud and more informative menus, good storytelling in lore, Getting level up means you get something very nice and got a lot of options for it, fast travel method (Hate that bridge), detective mode!
<br>
<br>Con&apos;s: Story is not catchy at all and takes massive leaps, cinematic&apos;s are made pretty badly, voice acting is horrible outside couple of characters. Game is pretty much same as Arkham City, but arkham city had far more interesting story elements.
<br>
<br>This game is okay-ish. You don&apos;t miss anything if you don&apos;t buy it, but if you buy it you prolly just play it for several hours and forget about it for some days.  Also this game is unfinished and rushed to stores. When you gonna pull Activision, you should do it properly.
<br>
<br>I do hope someday i find it in me to finish this game, until such time i hope people who tight on money won&apos;t spend it on this product. There are many others worth the money and time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3713168">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Graphics is almost the same and Batman&apos;s suit is not as good as the previous games,still Arkham asylum&apos;s Armored suit is the best suit.
<br>-Epic story that will keep you playing wanting to what&apos;s exactly going on with many Epic villains but there&apos;s the same mistake in Arkham city, i mean many viilains didn&apos;t take their chance and only appeared in one part of the game like Copperhead.
<br>-Awesome side missions with villains that could be included in the main story too.
<br>-City is almost the same with no citizens or people walking in steets, i mean they could make a city like this in grand theft auto with many citizens and cars.
<br>-i&apos;ve seen some glitches and bugs like this grate that i couldn&apos;t pass through in the Burnley tower,so i couldn&apos;t complete the riddler mission.
<br>-Awesome and challenging Bossfights(damn that Bane bossfight...) and enemies.
<br>-Challenge mode is still Epic.
<br>Totally this game just added more fun but the developers didn&apos;t do anything to move the series forward,so you gonna play only just for the story and more challenge maps.
<br>the game took me about 16 hours
<br>Arkham asylum was something very new at its time so i gave it a 10.
<br>Arkham city did too many improvements so i gave it a 10.
<br>so this game takes a 9 for adding more fun and awesome villains</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3945025">Expand</a></span>

<br>This 3. game about batman seems very crappy. I have just played trough first part and got out in the city. Standing on the rooftop and looking at the streets and buildings.. First think that crosses my mind.. Is this game not finish?
<br>
<br>The streets and buildings looks awful. The texture work looks like something 5 years back. Even seen normal mapping that are flipped. Come one. That&apos;s noob stuff. To many trainees on the production? Same with environment debris and probs. Its just looks so freaking bad. I turned the game off and I think i try to look again in a few weeks. Maybe a golden patch arrives. Otherwise i can&#xB4;t play this game trough.
<br>
<br>But sadly I think that the new team just came from EA or something. Sad sad sad :(
<br>
<br>And what&apos;s with the menu? Its so clumsy and strange setup. Same with to many info on the screen at the same time when you play the game. The camera control was great in other batman. Why change it to something that are worse.
<br>
<br>I feel like I could go on with the critic for pages and  have not played more that 30 mins. It is just not the game to hope for </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3668943">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Story:
<br>The story is absolutely fantastic.
<br>The game takes place about 5 years before Arkham Asylum.
<br>You play as a younger, less refined Batman trying to find and stop Black Mask who put a bounty of 50 million dollars on Batman&apos;s head, which automatically attracts 8 of the most talented assassins in the DC universe like Deathstroke, Deadshot and Bane.
<br>Even though the title says &quot;Arkham Origins&quot;, it doesn&apos;t have anything to do with Arkham, and it&apos;s definitely not an origin story. In this game, Batman meets his ultimate adversary, The Joker, for the first time, and many other villains and allies as well.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:
<br>Despite the fact that this is not Rocksteady who developed the game, it shouldn&apos;t come as a surprise that the core mechanics and the gameplay are exactly the same as Arkham City&apos;s, simply because Rocksteady&apos;s work is remarkable and irreplaceable, and it should never be changed. There&apos;s a few new gadgets, and I have one minor complaint about the new Shock Gloves that I don&apos;t like the idea of because it&apos;s too overpowered. You are able to clear a room full of guys in matter of seconds with those. Good thing is, you get them pretty late in the game and they need to recharge. Aside from a few new types of enemies and the new gadgets, everything is the same, and that&apos;s good. You don&apos;t try to fix something if it&apos;s not broken. You don&apos;t need to innovate when you already have the perfect gameplay that was in the previous games.
<br>
<br>Visuals:
<br>The visuals are excellent, and are slightly better than Arkham City&apos;s.
<br>The game has a lot of bugs though, and some of them are extremely annoying and sometimes they will not let you continue in your mission. For example: I encountered a major frame rate bug near the end of the game, even though my computer was able to run the game on maximum settings smoothly. I eventually managed to fix it.
<br>Aside from that, the animations look great and fluid, except for the weird lip movement in dialogue scenes (not cinematic). About the bugs, I believe there will be a patch soon that will fix them.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer:
<br>The multiplayer can be fun at times, but it&apos;s not polished.
<br>There are 3 teams, Joker&apos;s gang, Bane&apos;s gang and Batman and Robin. Both gangs are fighting each other while Batman and Robin need to take both gangs out.
<br>It has a lot of potential but it&apos;s not well executed.
<br>Still, it&apos;s always fun to play as Batman and do inverted takedowns on helpless victims.
<br>
<br>Summary:
<br>Definitely a great addition to the Arkham series like I said, WB Games Montreal did a great job with the writing on this game and the new Batman and Joker voices are a great replacement, especially Joker&apos;s which is portrayed by the famous Troy Baker.
<br>
<br>I give this game a 9/10, the things that really bothered me were the multiplayer and the great number of bugs, I wouldn&apos;t mind waiting a few more days and get a bug free game instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3672228">Expand</a></span>

I mean Asylum was kind of revolutionary game in my opinion. Great combat system that a lot of games copied later, amazing &quot;silent predator&quot; parts, all that Enigma&apos;s riddles and collectives and so on. Next game, Arkham City, wasn&apos;t a revolution, but a good evolutionary step forward. You were able to roam the City, do some side quests or even just help random guys in troubles (you are a super hero after all). And now Origins? Sorry, i can&apos;t say this game have something new in it because it has even less content than Arkham City. Map is about the same size (plus this huge bridge in the middle just for no reason) and mostly just a reuse of Arkham City assets, Enigma&apos;s riddles gone, Enigma&apos;s puzzles are a way easier. Well, the whole game feels like just a reuse of Arkham City idea, engine and everything else. Boss fights became almost QTEs (especially the one with Deathstroke).
<br>And the worst part of this game is bugs and glitches. I can count myself luck  i had only one crush to desktop, while some people experience all kinds of troubles (for example see Angry Joe rant on Youtube). But i think everyone know about that room in one of radio towers you can&apos;t exit. That really rise a question about were they even testing it? I mean this is a MAJOR thing that completely broken, there is no way you can&apos;t miss it not just with decent testing but just with simple walkthrough. And here is the funniest part  there is a video on youtube with workaround of this bug and you need to use one of games glitches. Only in our games you fight bugs with glitches!
<br>So, overall Origins isn&apos;t a great game, nothing new in it. You can argue that there are a lot of good games that aren&apos;t original. That&apos;s true, but in this situation way to success lays with technical aspects of the game. But Origins isn&apos;t the case. After (If) most bugs and glitches will be fixed you probably will be able to enjoy it. But right now it&apos;s a mess, so i can give it only 7 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3674322">Expand</a></span>

<br>I can understand why critics aren&apos;t as impressed with the game; it doesn&apos;t innovate on the series much and it doesn&apos;t have a GTA-style open world that feels alive and vibrant, but who cares?

Was not able to pass through first boss cause it was constantly...disappearing! Completely. Just vanished from game and did not come back. Even characters run from game like this. Some skills do not work properly. Basically time wasted.</span>

I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s the story (which is more interesting than the utter confusion that was Arkham City), the slightly different/less cartoonish art design, or the new voice actors:
<br>
<br>-I feel like I am experiencing something as Batman in this game rather than playing through a predestined story, I know that technically doesn&apos;t make sense but I guess feel a sense of purpose in this game that just wasn&apos;t there for me in the other games. Don&apos;t get me wrong I enjoyed the first two games but I felt like I was in Batman&apos;s shoes already. In this game he is still learning, he is still building relationships, he doesn&apos;t know everything, he is hard on himself, he makes wrong decisions, and he utterly f***s up sometimes. A good example of this would be very early on when Batman has to interrogate someone and he goes overboard and the dude passes out before he can get the information he needs, Batman just goes &quot;Damn&quot; and I feel like that was a genuine response to what just happened.
<br>
<br>-The art style is another thing I am digging. The character models look less cartoonish but still have their defining characteristics, and the ambiance is less overbearing in this game (It bugged me a lot in Arkham City). The facial animations for the non-cut scene parts are a lot better now in my opinion. Overall it has a slightly more realistic look but it fits and it&apos;s a welcoming design decision.
<br>
<br>-My last major point worth mentioning is the voice acting. I, like everyone else, was concerned when I heard the likes of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill would not be in the game. Then I heard that Troy Baker and Roger Craig Smith would be doing the voices of Joker and Batman. I felt better about it, but I was still on the fence until I heard Troy do the Killing Joke monologue at NYCC and actually played the game and heard Roger&apos;s Batman. Bottom line, they&apos;re mastering their craft and this game was like getting five stars on a song on expert in Rock Band for them. It was challenging but they stood up to the plate and delivered on all accounts.
<br>
<br>-The only problems I&apos;ve had with the game have been very minor technical issues. The only big one that I just ran into was when I was trapped in a room and had to pull down a vent-cover and grapple up and into the vent. The alignment on where Batman grasps the ledge is slightly off and his hands get stuck and I cant get into the vent, thus being actually stuck in the room. Other than that there was a very strange fluke incident where when I was fighting Killer Croc the game audio cut out entirely and Killer Croc&apos;s textures started to flicker.
<br>
<br>Final thoughts: I like it, it&apos;s grooving to my beat of how I want to play and experience the character of Batman. You might like it, you might not. It is a very technically sound game with great voice acting and a fantastic musical score. If I had to describe it in just a few words I would say Arkham Origins is: A refined, no nonsense, and satisfying experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3668846">Expand</a></span>

<br>ITS THE SAME FRIKKIN GAME AS Arkham City!!!
<br>-Combat is still the same
<br>-EXACT same gadgets are in. Gel,Crypto-hacky thingy,disruptor,etc
<br>-Exact same &quot;Detective mode&quot; and crime scene investigation mechanic.
<br>-SAME CITY. granted bigger, but i still get way to many deja-vu moments of &quot;Ive been here before&quot;
<br>-Plot &quot;Twist&quot; revealing the joker is AGAIN the main enemy....
<br>-Enigma (aka Riddler) devices to seek out in puzzles. is that all he ever does?
<br>-&quot;Scarecrow wannabee&quot; moment with the Mad Hatter using his device to plunge you into a odd world...again!!!!!
<br>I know its a series, but nothing has changed from the earlier games AT ALL. all the same ingredients are there, just (sometimes) improved.
<br>My major pet peeves im getting of the game is that the plot started revolving around the Joker AGAIN FOR THE THIRD TIME IN A ROW!!!
<br>I know he is the titular villian of the batman series, but i doubt he is the only one who can have a plot revolve around. at first it was kind exciting having Black-mask being the titular villain, but about halfway trough you learn its in fact the joker in disguise... Gee how surprising...
<br>The game has a selling point about batman being &quot;raw&quot; as this is a game set in the beginning of his career and having him go against the cops as well, but this is quickly made moot by the overly pointing out that every cop you do get to fight is so corrupt its basically a thug wearing uniform anyway (and hence treated as such) and the gadgets are still just as high-tech as first. the new graphics are nice, but its hardly that much better then AC. its just the same as AC and to be frank i think that story was more compelling then this as well.
<br>I went in with hopes, but they got crushed as the game quickly showed its basically just a slightly expanded Arkham city with the same goons, the same challenges, same plots and same EVERYTHING. it plays like a cheap mediocre Hollywood sequel made for the sole purpose of trying to get more bucks from its audience... *sigh*
<br>If you have a batman itch, play Arkham city (again). this isn&apos;t worth the full price tag
<br>Personal note: Why is the game called ARKHAM origins anyway?? this has nothing to do with the asylum at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3670267">Expand</a></span>

The physics are nice, and over all it&apos;s a good game. The problems I have  with it, is that countering attacks are difficult to do, and then bugs and glitches, which should be fixed in a patch. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</span>

It is true that it does not make that much different than Arkham City, but since AC was one of the best games of this generation, does it have to? I am glad that WB Montreal did not change the general formula of the game. You still explore one of the most atmospheric open-world environments, beat-up thugs and enjoy the cool story with its many plot twists. The graphics still look pretty good, the sound and voice-over is great and the free-flow combat is still one of the best combat systems to date. The villains and the respective fights are quite entertaining and the city is again full with content and areas to explore. I do miss the Riddler trophies, but there is a lot of other fun stuff to do and to complete. If you enjoyed the previous two titles, then you probably will also enjoy this entry. It does not make much different, but what it does, it does great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3674781">Expand</a></span>

AC&apos;s interface was &quot;consolie&quot; but usable in PC. AO&apos;s is even worse. You can&apos;t even use the mouse to drag objective box around in the map screen. You must pan using aswd. That whole section of the game (abilities, profiles, maps,  should be redone. Hell, even the console players would benefit from a rework. Switch it so they can control a mouse and use click and click-drag. It would benefit all of us. This game is an obvious money-grab with no notable improvement on gameplay or story. Now brace yourselves for the onslaught of 3rd-rate DLC sure to come. The multiplayer is nice but won&apos;t replace the great online experience brought by Left 4 Dead 2, Payday 2, BF series, COD, and many others.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3671919">Expand</a></span>

<br>The main problem with the game is the fact that everything in this game is, seemingly, a copy and paste from Arkham City. From the world it&apos;s in to the combat system, everything here feels the same and that&apos;s because it is the same. Some minor changes to the gameplay and the different way the Riddler Trophies are set up now (they are datapacks instead of trophies) is about all thats different here.
<br>The story kinda makes up for that in the fact that they had a great premise that had an average ending. The game had alot of promise but it&apos;s clear they didn&apos;t put alot of effort into the game. WB was content with taking about 75% of Arkham City, throwing a few new bad guys in there, and calling it a day. It&apos;s still worth playing but not to the point that City and Asylum were at when they were released.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=5262208">Expand</a></span>

From the first minutes it feels a bit unpolished. Later  some serious bugs appeared. Combat somehow feels not as good as in previous game. Something was broken there. Navigating the city although not as fluid as it was. But still  it&apos;s a very good game.</span>

<br>[Character SPOILERS]
<br>
<br>Fans of Arkham City will feel at home with this title, it&apos;s a different story told in a familiar setting. The city feels a little more fleshed out and some of the action (boss fights) in the game actually take place in some interesting places but only a few though the best I thought by far was Deathstroke that was actually difficult enough to be a challenge and visually pleasing enough to want to keep playing, even though I got my ass beat I still felt like Batman while it happened.
<br>
<br>There is nothing that makes me feel less like the worlds greatest detective than being stuck in a room and not knowing which door I&apos;m supposed to be going through... This game like it&apos;s 2 predecessors suffers from this.
<br>
<br>The storyline was really enjoyable, I feel like this title stepped away from the cartoon theme of the other two and made it a bit more aimed at adults which for me made it a great deal more enjoyable. The setting seemed grittier and the cut-scene&apos;s less Loony Tunes and more Nolan.
<br>
<br>There were mechanisms in the game that seemed to be thrown in for the hell of it (Glue raft?) which was there just to pad out the game I think, I feel like having the game run a 30 minutes less but loosing some of the pissing about would have done this game a favor. Door hacking is irritating enough, having to shoot a box with a really slow jammer gun and then hack a door? Doubly so.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d be really happy if the franchise continued down this route, make more boss fights like the death-stroke one and keep the story interesting and I&apos;ll keep buying them.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s well optimized, looks pretty nice, freeflow combat felt a little more difficult but was just as satisfying and best story so far (in my opinion).
<br>
<br>-1 point for glitches (One Riddler glitch had me stuck in a room and needing to restart) and -1 point for feeling a little too familiar... glue raft.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3790638">Expand</a></span>

The open world in Origins is a dead and lifeless copy of the heavily populated and visually stunning world of City. Pass this one up.</span>

If you are like me, everything is very familiar when you first start playing this game. It seems like you are about to emark on a journey where you feel like you are playing assassains creed and realize everything is the same as the last game with a new place. And that is how it starts out and I almost gave up.
<br>
<br>But I perservered and was glad I did. At about the halfway point is where things pick up a little. The story gets good, battles get harder, and you have to use your full arsenal to make progress. Yes it does get a little repatitive and many parts are just like the old games but it does just enough to keep you pushing through. Graphics as always were very beautiful and remember to turn of PhysX because it breaks everything.
<br>
<br>I wouldn&apos;t pay full price for this but if it is ever on sale id say go for it. It is a very good game overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=5293793">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The combat has also had some tweaks done to it. I find it to be slightly more fast paced, the animation sets are much much better and has a greater impact. I also found counters are slightly easier to pull off. The previous titles had an annoying quirk where enemies would strike you even if you&apos;d countered just because you got too close to the cutoff. This helps the combat feel better.
<br>
<br>Arkham Origins holds up to the previous titles nicely and while they didn&apos;t change the formula or style of the game WB did a great job to ensure the legacy of the series goes on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3666705">Expand</a></span>

I loved the previous games, but I felt that the only major difference between AA and AC was that AC was open world. The story in both previous games was great, and so far the story in this game is also great.
<br>
<br>In a lot of ways I like the story in this game more. It has a darker tone overall. Batman is new on the scene, the cops and criminals don&apos;t really know who he is and most even doubt that he exists.
<br>
<br>When it comes down to it, AO is more of the same with a few differences and on a larger scale. As far as I am concerned, the same applies to AC as a sequel. I&apos;m not sure why AO is being rated down for this while the same critics praised AC for doing the same.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s worth bearing in mind that the same critics have praised games like CoD year in, year out for releasing the exact same game, tweaked slightly, not expanded on at all...Go figure. Maybe the reviewers weren&apos;t paid off...
<br>
<br>The 100 vs 1 mode is an excellent addition to the challenge mode and pretty tough! The combat is as satisfying as ever, and their interpretation of a younger, less experienced Batman is great.
<br>
<br>All in all, if you enjoyed the previous games for their puzzles, combat and story, you will enjoy this too, as long as you don&apos;t have any unrealistic expectations about it being a dramatic departure from AC. It is mostly more of the same excellent gameplay as before, but with improved visuals and a new and compelling story.
<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t tried the MP yet, so I can&apos;t comment on that, but it isn&apos;t why I bought this game...I came for the SP story and the 100 vs 1 combat extravaganza and I haven&apos;t been disappointed! </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3670251">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>All in all get this in a sale at a discount but not at full price if you played the first two games and if you haven&apos;t get those instead.   It&apos;s not a bad game by any means it&apos;s just not very good either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3667274">Expand</a></span>

<br>Who cares?
<br>So far, i haven&apos;t run into technical problems. No crashes or lockups.</span>

This is strange because it uses the same engine as Arkham City but it has poorer shadows and is glitchier than Asylum. After going through the intro phase of the game, you begin the EXACT same way as City. You must defuse Penguin&apos;s frequency disrupters, fight in a gladiator arena and then defeat his ace etc. Did they literally just re-image a few characters, back grounds, and call it a day? It continues down this path and is littered with melodramatic catch phrasing to top off poor dialogue. It feels more like Die Hard than Batman.
<br>
<br>I love the series and I didn&apos;t want to think this was just expanded DLC but the story line matches up too closely with the fact that Black Mask, Falcone, Julian Day, and other B listers were set up in the last game (I love the under appreciated villains btw). It is apparent they just wanted an opportunity to cut corners and sell Joker statues. Continuity is all askew until you realize this was meant to take place after Arkham City and be done by Rocksteady.
<br>
<br>Only buy if you HAVE to have Batman, like me. I just hope this doesn&apos;t mark the end of a series like Gears of War Eday: a money grab by expanding DLC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3667162">Expand</a></span>

The feeling of having 8 assassins coming after you is compelling and exciting and makes you anticipate the next awesome boss battle. IGN, Machinima and Gamespot may have given lackluster reviews but don&apos;t let that sidetrack you from the awesomeness of this game. Those critics always find something to pick on and complain about and I no longer trust in their opinions and have lost faith in their reviews. The game is similar but different and houses an excellent and compelling storyline to go along with it. 10/10 for me so far, and I havent even got up to the good bits yet....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3666233">Expand</a></span>

That being said, I&apos;m seriously enjoying this game. Voice acting is better than expected and gameplay feels *almost* on par with the previous two titles. The environment design is creepy and it&apos;s still fun to roam around and fight crime. Not sure what happened with the cut scenes though, they are some of the lowest quality renders I&apos;ve seen in a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3675497">Expand</a></span>

Batman is angrier, Alfred is a little less lax and the status of the Bat is still an urban myth. Combat is still pretty much the same, as is the stealth takedown sections of the game. A few puzzles felt reused and redesigned from Arkham City. And without giving anything away, the Joker level was absolutely brilliant, essential for any Batman fan. This is no way a bad game as some might say, yet it isn&apos;t the best Arkham game either.

I mean it&apos;s just an utter crapshoot trying to play this game. I&apos;ve already hit three game breaking bugs which made it almost impossible to continue. I&apos;m convinced their &quot;reload from checkpoint&quot; functionality is basically broken as it triggers most of these bugs. I&apos;m writing this review after running into yet another game breaking bug that would not let me continue which forced me to throw my hands up and quit.
<br>
<br>Warners Bros had no buisness trying to follow up such an awesome game and this outcome was basically foreseen by everyone. I mean it&apos;s gotham on CHRISTMAS and its the most dull, grey, boring, lifeless excuse for a city I&apos;ve ever seen in a game. I often have a hard time figured out where I&apos;m at with how monotone everything is, a problem I did not have with the previous two games. Combat is the same, though I&apos;ve noticed they sped up enemy attack rates making the batclaw and ground take down really difficult to use. Characters are really poorly portrayed, missions are boring and desperately try to copy the previous games, like 75% less riddler puzzles, dialog/story is so  I&apos;m in disbelief, and everything just sucked.
<br>
<br>Overall the environment is dull and lifeless, the dialog from the main characters to the thug convos on the street is god awful, no new meaningful additions to combat/gadgetry, and bugs/glitches are plentiful and nearly unavoidable.
<br>
<br>What a terrible terrible end to an otherwise awesome set of games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3685760">Expand</a></span>

My only issue with this game is that they should&apos;ve play tested it more, it&apos;s pretty glitchy. For instance, a kind of game breaking one on the PC version happens when you try to hack the tower in a certain district, and often during combat when preforming blade dodges the game will switch me to using a gadget instead, being very frustrating. The gun deactivating gadget will also sometimes just not work. If they iron out all the glitches with patches this game could really be wonderful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3669187">Expand</a></span>

<br>Best story telling out of the series. Phenomenal voice acting. Great graphics, and SUPERB voice acting.
<br>Oh, and I can&apos;t forget the awesome story and even beefier combat system.
<br>
<br>Buy all three, and start with this one. It won&apos;t let you down.</span>

Bigger map; now Gotham is your playgroung, not a portion of it, neither just an Asylum. New stuff and gadgets; more approaches available. Cool villains; simply 8 awesome assassins to come across. Interesting boss fights; meaning you won&apos;t be boring by only roaming or doing stuff for the main mission. Even better graphics; not much to say here. It&apos;s just beautiful. All this implemented in the fine engine Rocksteady left in Warner Bros. Montreal&apos;s hands. They kept the good work done by Rocksteady and I don&apos;t see in any way a low standard of Arkham Origins compared with its predecessor. The new voice actors did a great job replacing the old ones. Batman&apos;s voice is so good you won&apos;t even notice the change. The Joker sounds a little bit different, but it&apos;s still incredible. So, if you&apos;re Batman fan, don&apos;t be disappointed by Rocksteady dropping the game in another studio&apos;s hands. They stood up for it and made a good game. If you&apos;re a fan of the Arkham series, this is absolutely a must play. The PC version can show minor bugs, but not game breaking. Plus, the game is greatly optimized for PC. I got a pretty crappy gaming PC and I just ran the game in a steady 40 fps, with almost everything maxed out. Don&apos;t skip this game, please. You&apos;re losing an epic adventure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=3675564">Expand</a></span>

<br>The buttons not always working - bad pc port as usual - if you make it console only why sell it on the pc?
<br>The update deleted all saves - we are not in the nineties anymore... Lamers :)
<br>That is when I quit, I won&apos;t play this game again from the beginning just because some braindead developer can&apos;t fix their own bugs but by deleting my saves. And I will not buy anything from rocksteady anymore.
<br>And you are one of them if you gave a score above 5 for the PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-arkham-origins/user-reviews?user_review_id=4149992">Expand</a></span>
