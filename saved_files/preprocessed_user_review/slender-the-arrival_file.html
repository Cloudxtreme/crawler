Ok, then I thought that maybe I should not look at him, and on a second attempt, when 8 notes out of 10 were gathered, i wanted to collect the 9th, but the guy was there, and walked with my back at him  boom dead. Now I had to restart the level again and collect the 10 notes from the beginning while avoiding the guy completely (i presume). He seems to be just teleporting randomly. If you take the scary sounds and the art away, what remains is a pointless and utterly stupid game where you randomly and slowly walk around and collect pieces of paper while occasionally avoiding a randomly teleporting object.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3374778">Expand</a></span>

<br>I like the concept. I was really engaged with the beginning part, of heading to the house to meet up with someone and finding out that something isn&apos;t quite right.
<br>The visuals are good enough to let you forget about them and focus on the experience.
<br>The sounds really add to the experience.
<br>
<br>Here is what I didn&apos;t like.
<br>The narrative is really disjointed. Why set up meeting someone in a house and then throw that away to have me look for pages? The pages (which seems to borrow heavily from the game of Hide) make little sense in the overall experience of the game. Why am I running around looking for them? I get that Slenderman gets more &quot;aggressive&quot; as you pick up more pages, but what is compelling me to pick them up in the first place?
<br>Opening doors is awkward and the scream at the end of the prologue is really cheesy.
<br>It is a nice looking experience but ultimately the game play is very simplistic (not in a good way). If this were an arcade game or something along those lines, I wouldn&apos;t mind it so much. However, it seems like there was some attempt at providing a narrative or overall context for the game and it lost me. In the end, it felt like I was just walking around to end the game...not like I had a goal like escape or discovery.
<br>
<br>Overall, not terrible but fell short of the potential it had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3106894">Expand</a></span>

You are to collect 8 pages at first then somehow activate 6 generators while being chased by both Slenderman and a hooded ghost which apparently seems off Slenderman&apos;s &apos;lore&apos;. It left me questioning whether this game meant to leave mysteries untold or the developers are just plain lazy and decided to make a poorly explained story. Scares in this game were at first terrifying but then it just got annoying as the hooded ghost will just keep stalking you. Overall, this is simply another mediocre jumpscare galore from cheap scary &apos;ghosts&apos;. *I am not against Indie games*</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3109605">Expand</a></span>

The jumpscares didn&apos;t make me jump anymore, all slenderman does is teleporting, and he isn&apos;t really scary at all. I ended up letting him take me after finding 6 notes because it got so boring. The game is way too intense on the jumpscares, so you end up not jumping from them at all.</span>

The Atmosphere is brilliant and engaging, with a nice mysterious story written by the wonderful team behind Marble Hornets.  The game is &quot;easier&quot; (or at least seems so) due to the new addition of a story.  But make no mistake, it&apos;s more terrifying than the original.  Our good friend the Operator has been learning new tricks to find his way closer and closer to you, making you panic even more than you did in the original, especially now that he can walk.  Plus, I won&apos;t say what, but there&apos;s more to be afraid of than our dear friend Slendy out in the darkness...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3068967">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_3089158"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">After the surprising hit last in the summer of 2012 that was Slender: The Eight Pages, Blue Isle Studios and Parsec Productions decided to take the basic, experimental game design that the original was and expand upon it. Now we have Slender: The Arrival, a sequel  re-imagining of the original that now has better graphics and an underlying story. So how does Slender: The Arrival hold up in an expanded upon package?
<br>
<br>The Story:
<br>The story of Slender: The Arrival has you play as Lauren, a girl who goes into the woods to see her friend Kate. When she arrives, she finds the house trashed and finds out that Kate is missing. After that, the story takes a backseat and is only occassionaly brought up. There are little collectibles that further expand upon the story, including Kate becoming a proxy, and even hinting that Kate was the original protagonist from Slender: The Eight Pages. While these collectables are interesting, the way that the events unfold is somewhat sloppy and contrived. Why again, did we have to go in the mines in the first place? Oh yeah. To meet the new enemy type, the proxy (Kate). The ending, however intense it may be, is a huge letdown. It feels unfinished, rushed, and left me dissapointed. Also, the game is extremely short. It took me roughly 2 hours to complete.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:
<br>Slender: The Arrival is what you would expect from a Slender game. Intense, atmospheric horror in a first person view with a soundtrack that will continue to haunt you even after the game is complete. However, where this does fall slightly flat is Chapter 3. In this chapter, you journey into an abandoned mine for no good reason and find the new enemy. The Proxy. The proxy is a hooded figure that, unlike Slenderman, will seek out the player and continuously follow you until you escape the mines. The first time you&apos;re attacked by the proxy is certainly intense, but begins to become less intense when you are constantly jumped and killed just as you&apos;re about to finish the level. The chapter begins very well and certainly had me screaming the first time I heard the proxy running behind me as I ran into a dead end. However, this is where the Slenderman takes a back seat and is rarely seen. After this, the gameplay returns to normal and goes back to being a Slender game.
<br>
<br>Sound Design:
<br>The sound is arguably the most important part of the Slender games. Everything from the subtle cricket chirps to the iconic drum bangs is spot on and really elevates the atmosphere to; at times, pure and absolute terror. My personal favorite sound design is ironically, in my least favorite part of the game. In the mines, the echoing footsteps and the cackling of the Proxy is absolutely terrifying.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>While Slender: The Eight Pages was an experiment in survival horror, Slender: The Arrival is an evolution of horror. While I had some problems with the story and the mine section, Slender: The Arrival managed to do something that very few games can do. This game terrified me, and had me looking around my room creeping myself out. If you&apos;re alone at night, and feel the need to be scared, Slender: The Arrival is one of the best horror experiences currently available on PC and I highly recommend that you check this one out.
<br>
<br>Short Consensus:
<br>With a great atmosphere, and sequences of pure terror, Slender: The Arrival is a great horror experience that suffers from a less than stellar 3rd chapter and repetitive gameplay.

Gorgeous graphics, incredibly immersive, interesting plot (though explanation of it is somewhat scant), and, surprise surprise, utterly terrifying.  What I really liked is that this game provides some context for why the pages exist.  However, it still doesn&apos;t explain why exactly you&apos;re collecting them.  The plot that is there is certainly intriguing, but there is still a lot that has yet to be explained and the ending definitely left me wanting more.  This isn&apos;t necessarily a  bad thing though because some of the best storytelling simply doesn&apos;t tell you everything you want to know and leaves readers/viewers/gamers with something left to discuss and speculate.  That said, there were parts of this game that truly terrified me, and I absolutely loved it because I enjoy getting scared (call me an emotional sadist if you will).  The detailed environments, spooky music, vague but interesting narrative, and Mr. Slenderman himself all culminate into one hell of an experience.  Sadly but understandably due to budget constraints and a relatively small development team, the experience is very short (though definitely worth the price of admission).  But this frustration is merely owed to the fact that I enjoyed this game so much and did not want it to end.
<br>
<br>If you have the expendable cash, throw a little extra when you purchase this to support the developer so we can see an even bigger and better third installment.  I know I can&apos;t wait for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3067684">Expand</a></span>

The idea that you have a story behind everything, and exploring an abandoned house in the daytime turning into nighttime just creeps me out so much!. Definitely play this if your looking for a scare!</span>

Everyone knows what is going to happen next so how can slender be scary. If you are looking for nice gameplay with some really scary elements i suggest waiting for new amnesia. Horror for kids  this is how it looks for me.</span>

Freaky environments that are totally unnerving and almost bad for your mental health. You start getting edgy and nervous just walking around. Gorgeous graphics and I loved the music. Overall, great atmosphere put together by a small indie team at Parsec and Blue Isle. A bit short but for ten bucks  good value. You get a sense of the thought they put into this with the opening prologue  eerie music and then you begin on a beautiful fall day in the woods. But the sun is setting and as the day comes to an end, the foreboding darkness envelops you.  That was a really nice touch! If ever there is room for a sequel, this is it!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3064968">Expand</a></span>

It&#x2019;s a powerful experience, a great achievement, and definitely among the best of the horror games I&#x2019;ve played. It felt absolutely worth the wait once I finished it, and it really was the experience I was hoping for. I&#x2019;m definitely going to remember this one for a while, and not necessarily because it made me wet my pants, but because the experience was just awesome, and one I appreciated greatly as a lover of horror. It&#x2019;s definitely worth buying if you&#x2019;re a horror nut or Slender fan of any kind. It&#x2019;s a must-play.

Everytime you play the game, levels look different. Pages, generators or even places change every time you play. For example once you have a toilet near the beach, but next time you play its not here. Second thing is the Hardcore mode. It makes the game harder, and,  what follows that feature, longer. You will be scared, but also will rage much. Really recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3063197">Expand</a></span>

<br>The feeling that someone, (Or someTHING) is following me in the game really makes it scary. All of the ambient, and artistic locations around the place make you want to stay as far away from them as possible. But of course, you HAVE to go in them to get the notes.
<br>
<br>While there are many good things about this, this is DEFINITELY not a perfect game. A few shorthands seem to mess up your game. Repetitive gameplay really frustrates me. The same danger, the same difficulty, ect. Also, Ive ran into graphic glitches. I was playing, I looked behind me, slender was frozen, not moving. He was like that for 5 minutes. This is just the first glitch out of many.

<br>Even still, Slender The arrival will make you love the amazing series even more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3119535">Expand</a></span>

But damnit, I won&apos;t, for the simple fact that this is the scariest game I&apos;ve ever played. No game has ever conveyed a sense of vulnerability, paranoia and scream-out-loud moments quite like this. This is horror done right. Amnesia: Dark Descent is the only one that comes close, but this is just raw, condensed fear. It&apos;s not easy (though easier than the previous iteration), you probably will die, but after each restart the levels rearrange themselves, keeping each new attempt fresh. Plus, Slenderman isn&apos;t the only thing to fear in this game...
<br>
<br>So for the price of a cinema ticket, you will buy yourself the scariest experience you will ever have.

The answer is never, with an exception of Shadow Man for n64.
<br>
<br>Blue Isle Studios is a company to watch out for. Seen a similar game called Daylight, might be good, but it has command prompts that tell you how to fight off the monsters. I think it will take years to replicate what this game offers. It might take another 15 years for another game to be scary. People will tell you that Amnesia is scary, but the truth is, those people probably think Saw movies are supposed to be frighting.
<br>
<br>Slender shows no mercy with it&apos;s hard difficulty. You will get completely randomized task locations every time you replay a level. Even non horror games need to mimic this idea. I like the part where you are trapped in a house and have to close certain windows and open doors before Slender came. It was very realistic. Reminded me of a being in a Haunted house, trying to hide from a demon or ghost.
<br>
<br>This game will be considered original for awhile until companies copy it. Make sure you know where the roots came from.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3088915">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve followed Slenderman stories for a few years now, and let me say when Slender came along, it completely ruined it. It made it not scary, turned it into a crappy meme, and made it some preteen fad. Complaints out of the way, Slender: The Arrival is much more respectable. They make it actually scary, give it a good atmosphere, and some actual objectives and scenery. The original was dreadful, and I almost fell asleep playing it, not even kidding. But this one feels more like an actual game. Personally, I&apos;m still not convinced it&apos;s worth $10.00 when compared to other titles of the same price. But if you want a few cheap jump scares, and a decent atmosphere (I recommend shutting the blinds and turning all lights off), then go for it. Have a blast. If you want a quality game, steer clear of any Slender related game for a few more years, until a company gets a real budget and a creative mind to put a twist in it and make it more exciting. Want a quality game? Look into Cryostasis, Dead Space, Penumbra, or Amnesia.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3094207">Expand</a></span>

About a year after Slender: The Arrival comes out and brings a lot new to the game play. It is really intense,  horrifying, atmospheric and breath-taking from start to the end. A well represented and a lot more complete plot makes it more scary than ever. The game itself however is very short, but the ending is very well done. There are some controlling difficulties at some parts, but they might be fixed in the future updates (if any). Over-all the game really shows a good result of expansion and some game play modifications. Slender becomes a more bigger title, which might have a very anticipated future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3088380">Expand</a></span>

The game contains few stages where the story-driven and survivor gameplay are divided into. Story chapters arent really last longing and there are not much of depth in the story, of corz its fun to read all the Scarpbook collections but still I was expecting a little bit more of a depth in it. The gameplay is divided into two levels unfortunately. one is the traditional level of collecting the 8 pages and another one takes place in a abandoned mine where you are tasked to tun of 6 generators while a creepy girl is running around the place and slenderman jumps in as well :D The 8 pages section is fun since the area is much varied and bigger but the Mine one is unfair, you dont know how to runaway from that creepy girl, you arent aware how much you will last after getting stabbed by her even, in this part the game have some serious lack of instruction and its even quiet unfair beside that its hard. I hope they improve selnderman more, after all they said  they had chances to put more depth in the game, add a better story and so on. Good that this short game terrifies you like hell  so you dont wanna miss it really if you missed the time you used to scream while playing 8 pages.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3094195">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As I said before the game is short, really short but for a price of $10 it&apos;s what you would expect. It may be short but the work put into the game truly shines with different places like the mines, empty homes, the forest and so on. The game play is sort of the same tho, collecting pages in the second chapter or turning on generators in the forth but each level always has something different.
<br>
<br>The only level to stay the same is the forest where you would collect the 8 pages, after that you will go to different places and discover something more then just Slender man awaiting for you.
<br>
<br>For the price of $10, it&apos;s great to see horror coming back in the hands of indie developers and I personally hope to see more of slender man in future projects, maybe in something even bigger I hope.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3085969">Expand</a></span>

The 8 Pages mission is actually included in this game, a game that is supposed to be new and bring more depth to the Slender mythos.  It&apos;s the first mission you are tasked with in fact.  Each mission seems to be about going to an area and finding something and then you are done.  The price point for the game is ludicrous for what it is, $10 for something that is essentially the same mission over and over and ends with an obvious &quot;To Be Continued&quot; feel.  The most enjoyment you can derive from the game is finding someone who is new to the genre entirely and is easily scared, then making them play it.  The game is less terrifying than the original because the music has a tendency to give away upcoming moments of terror,  That being said the actual sound effects are spot on, from the labored breathing to the very grating sound of the generators on the mine level powering up.   In all the game is just slightly below average for me due to the price point and the lack of innovation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3116235">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This is an epic horror done right. It takes the classic Slender concept and combines it with a fantastic narrative, awesome game play, and a beautiful upgrade to the graphics! The pacing of this game is some of the best I&apos;ve ever seen, however the latest update makes the player find all 8 pages (which is nearly impossible) and destroys the clear purpose of the game...</span>

The story is revealed more as you go along and there are new terrifying enemies. A little short, but that is to be expected from an independent, but growing company.

<br>
<br>You will always be on edge throughout the majority of the game, like the feeling of someone or something is constantly watching you. If you like a good jump scare then this is a decent game for you to do so!
<br>
<br>The graphics are beautifully well done, very well updated from the previous slender man.
<br>
<br>Just a quick brief review, the game isn&apos;t nothing special, just something to play when you&apos;re bored or to pass the time or if you purposely want to make yourself jump. (Some people are into that sort of stuff).

Things would pop up on walls that weren&apos;t there, the music was well made, little common horror elements were used well. However, the game was just a misfit. In the first Slender the Slenderman was actually a jump out kind of horror that was O.K. for a free game. However in this addition he appears so often it becomes so routine it is like killing grunts to avoid him. He doesn&apos;t kill on sight all the time. There are two other enemies in the game, neither of which pose any threat or are scary at all. There is a tiny outline of a story in the game, but it is boring. and is too secretive. Also, the game tried some Amnesia-esque mechanics (click dragging doors, collecting notes to put in a journal, etc.) that really just didn&apos;t fit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3167742">Expand</a></span>

I like waiting for something to get me, and the idea of bieng hunted by something that cant be killed is a great idea for a horror game. Its why Amnesia works so well. But although i do like it, its nothing exceptional. A great comparison is Surgeon Simulator 2013.  This game was a mod that got enough of a fallowing that they decided to make a full release. Its slightly expanded on as it has a little bit more of a story and makes the game a little more personal and the graphics have been updated. I can see why people hate this game, but i for one enjoy it even if there are many better horror games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3171353">Expand</a></span>

However, even though The Arrival hits all of those original points, it stretches them out too thin, and ends up falling flat.
<br>The first thing that you&#x2019;ll notice about The Arrival is the new look. The game is much improved over its predecessor and the environments are much more detailed. The trees look more like trees, as opposed to the sticks with leaves that were found in the original title, and the Slender Man looks more terrifying and real then he previously did  not that that&#x2019;s a reason to stare of course; he&#x2019;ll kill you if you do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3110742">Expand</a></span>

The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 was because it does have a few minor glitches at times but it&apos;s no reason to not play this game. It&apos;s worth the small amount of money to buy it. After watching a &quot;Let&apos;s Play&quot; of it, I went and bought it ASAP.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3591398">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yeah, the game is very short and this just can&#xB4;t explain the expensive price for the game, but I am very sure that the game worthies a try, specially if you gets scared easy like me. Once again... Loved the game! Congratulations for the team who made this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3661887">Expand</a></span>

In this remake, you star a Lauren, who, after going to see her friend Kate, crashes off the road and into a fallen tree. As the car is stuck, she decides to walk the rest of the way to get help. When she arrives to Kate&apos;s house, the whole house is a wreck, and Lauren is soon entangled in a complex mystery where she is being stalked by two mysterious entities (Slenderman of the title and The Chaser, a new entity that can be attacked with using your flashlight). The story is amazing, but it falls into a massive pitfall that snags many brilliant stories. The game needs for you to collect pieces for your scrapbook, some being totally useless, and others showing you the Slenderman&apos;s mysterious background story. If you enjoy this kind of game play, you&apos;re in for a treat, as the rest is repetitive, from page-collecting to turning on generators, the game stays to the original games roots of running round the place for several minutes, sometimes becoming lost. As well, the games new entity, The Chaser, appears only in one level, and on the same level, Slendy can insta-kill you just to scare the player. Thankfully, a steam release has saved the game from me giving it a two. The new version gives players more accessibility to the game, as well as The Chaser appearing in level one, with his creepy whispering appearing with the Slenderman&apos;s terrifying appearance, the steam version also extended the levels, so the game can actually last long enough to not count as an interactive movie. All in all, if you&apos;re going to buy this jump-fest, get the steam version as it majorly improves the whole game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=3675442">Expand</a></span>

The story eas written by the guys who dis marblehornets (which is ace by the way) but is given mainly in the form of the notes and ends up being a pretty dull story. You go to find out what happened to a girl in this house (whom i think you are related to) and find out she was being stalked by Slender. You go to find her. Ending is very unsatisfying. Game is still pretty fun but i still find the original has most reply value.

However after the most recent DLC that added about another hour of gameplay. I like it alot more. not only do the extra sections have some fantastic atmospheric gameplay instead of cheap jumpscares but they add some very interesting  backstory that im sure will only spark more idea from the slender community . Still wish it was a bit longer but now it feels like a complete game that features some solid horror and is truely actually worth the money</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=4588718">Expand</a></span>

The Slendy&apos;s AI is great but the other enemies are not that smart and you can&apos;t do stealth in this game because enemy&apos;s AI is bad.</span>

The settings are all very similar, and the camera overlay was a nice touch.
<br>
<br>It has a good atmosphere, with creepy sound cues and lighting. This could have been improved with more buildup of tension as seen in amnesia and in the slender vlogs, where you anticipate that something will happen around every corner. Still, the environments are well designed, and the graphics are very good, including shadows, hdr and a nice touch of colour distortion from slendy at various points in the game.
<br>
<br>The jump scares are fantastic, and really make the game. To see slendy in front of you and then turn around to find him behind you is terrifying, and is a good change from other horror games where you can just lock the door and know that you will be alerted to the monsters arrival when he tries to break it down.
<br>
<br>The proxy is a questionable addition in my opinion, and not well designed. While its good to have another enemy to run from, there seems to be no way of getting rid of her or to combat her. She will just stand there indefinetley when you point the torch at her, and when you runaway, she will suddenly appear out of nowhere behind you and kill you. Initially she is scary, but after the 5th time she gets you in a few minutes, she becomes more of an annoying obstacle than a terrifying monster.
<br>
<br>Overall, while the game does have its faults, it is still a fantastic horror game, and also a must have for any fan of the slenderman mythos and videos.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=4906549">Expand</a></span>

But then I finally got Slender The Arrival and it beefed up my gaming skill by over 9000! Okay, no memes. But this is one of the only Slender games with story. The art design may be a little weird as the Charlie Matheson Jr. figure in the burnt house in Prologue (expanded) is cut in half, and some effects are weird, but you do need to know: THE EFFECTS ARE AMAZING. The Slender man doesn&apos;t kill you by making you look at it for a long while. Instead Slender teleports onto you, or you run into him. There&apos;s more antagonists and protagonists, and the story seems creepy. The story started around before an update was released, but got more and more story as update 1.5 and 2.0 came out. In an early update, Genesis came out, and guess what: It&apos;s the original Slender game and more updated. A popular game inside another good game and it&apos;s updated? That seems like a sweet deal to me!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/slender-the-arrival/user-reviews?user_review_id=6830948">Expand</a></span>
