<br>2. Leveling:
<br>
<br>Leveling up a character becomes boring if you have to repeat the same areas    3 times before you attempt what they call &quot;end-game content&quot;.
<br>
<br>3. End game and rewards:
<br>
<br>That is running maps (with map levels from 66 up to 79) with a Bossmonster at the end of the map.That looks fine because we all know that Bossmonsters hold special rewards like cool Uniques or currency or even more maps. In fact, they drop crap. I ran lvl 77-78 maps with a guildmate who had an 400% increased chance to get rarer items for almost a week and got nothing valuable.
<br>
<br>4. Partying:
<br>
<br>see performance and technical issues
<br>
<br>5. Performance and technical issues:
<br>
<br>There are too many things ruining gameplay and have not been adressed as of now, one of the worst is desync. Loosing hours of playtime you have spend because your character dies and suffers a 10% XP penalty becaus the servers loose the exact position of your character and sends you back to a place where you had been a few seconds before isn&apos;t really fun. The official game forum is full of players complaining exactly this. And now, something funny: GGG declares this as a feature to prevent cheating.
<br>
<br>Partying sounds like fun, if you like dia-shows.Too many skills and character builds cause even high-end computers to drop down to a few frames when playing in a group.
<br>The last mini expansion &quot;The Forsaken Masters&quot; made it even worse.With this expansion players can have their own personal hideout, a place to rest or sort things in your stash, nothing special because this hideout is only  a small tileset with a few objects like bricks or a wall or a few trees. Guess what happens to your framerate when entering your or other players hideout? But hey........you can
<br>decorate your personal hideout with hundreds of objects (of course you can buy them from GGG, but there are also free ones)....guess again what happens to your framerate and loading time ?
<br>I forgot weather effects. Yes, weather effects have been implemented to more and more areas over the last months although many players complain about framedrops in these areas.Instead of adding a chance to turn weather effects off via the options menue, they add even more.
<br>Opening the box....surprise, surprise......whats in the box? While running around you may find kind of a chest box, called strongbox.Introduced in the &quot;Ambush league&quot; a few months ago, you&apos;ll get ambushed by monsters when opening these boxes.Sounds funny, but.............many computers freeze for 1-2 secs while the game is loading the monsters. Click the Resurrect button and take the 10% XP penalty.
<br>
<br>All in all this game is an ambitious project, but GGG failed in too many aspects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=4636388">Expand</a></span>

They&apos;ve created a free game that truly tries to keep it grounded so players have to actually play the game to progress, instead of just buy their way through, a la gear from an auction house, RL player, ect..  This product appears to be a true labor of love, and the title screen even touts &quot;After 7 years of development, we are proud to present to you POE!!&quot;
<br>
<br>And that might be where the problem lies:  The game feels extremely dated, extremely short, and fails extremely bad in most areas.
<br>
<br>The graphics are very meh, the story is forgettable  music is just-okay, and with the way the party system is setup, you can literally win this game within  ohhhhh, 4-10 hours?  True story.
<br>
<br>The game has different difficulty levels, but who cares?  It boils down to monsters hitting harder, not tactics.  All you do in this game is mash buttons.  There&apos;s so many animations and crap flying across the screen, you spend the entire game looking at your health/spirit level waiting to pop a potion, all while just holding down the auto-attack.  I literally held &quot;Q&quot; and pressed numbers 1-5 for my potions.
<br>
<br>As far is loot is concerned, this game should be renamed Path of the Ninja Looter, because it becomes a crazy game of Hungry, Hungry Hippo when a rare item (and by god, they are rare) finally drops.  You&apos;ll then sell that POS item to a NPC vendor who will give you scraps for it (literally) and then you put about 1000 of those scraps together to make some orbs, and then you spam-trade those orbs for other orbs (amassing about 1000 of those, too) and then spam-trade those orbs for other orbs, spam-trade more for another type of orb and when all is said and done  you&apos;ll come out of it with LITERALLY 1 orb.
<br>
<br>You&apos;ll then take that orb and find a spam-trader, whom you will then trade you a sword that he found for you&apos;re 1 orb.  Congrats  after all of that running back and forth to NPC and real-life spam traders, you now have a sword that does 3% more damage, with a chance to evade.  If this sounds overly-complicated and un-rewarding to you, let me assure you, it is.
<br>
<br>Now, I won the game at level 38; however, I see people leveling to 70+, grinding away to get the best gear, for a game, they&apos;ve already beaten ....
<br>
<br>That&apos;s is.  Let me repeat.  Beat the game in level 30&apos;s but grind away and spam-trade for gear up to level 70+.  Oh, and you cant even inspect another players gear, so it is truly self-gratification unless you wanna be that jackass spam-linking his gear.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3693192">Expand</a></span>

To say this game is the deepest or best RPG ever made is laughable.
<br>Clearly these people have not actually played this game for any substantial amount of time, otherwise they would not be giving it a 10 or even an 8.
<br>Tough to take this site seriously at all with such ridiculous ratings..
<br>
<br>Now to the game.
<br>
<br>I started playing POE in Open Beta and have leveled a dozen or more characters in that time, several hardcore, several in Onslaught/Domination. All my characters have leveled to between 40-70
<br>In that time I have learned A LOT about this game and all of its systems and nuances, as well as the gear, trading rates, orb rates, etc.
<br>
<br>What people need to understand is that this game is decent, but certainly not great. On the surface, its easy to start playing and be enamored with POE. It isn&apos;t until you delve more deeply into the game that you see the huge fissures which unfortunately show the game&apos;s true colors. In fact for almost every good thing in the game, it has a flipside that is equally, if not more so, negative. There is nothing in the game that is outright amazing, so again, to give it a ten is a silly joke.
<br>
<br>I will break down my post into sections.
<br>
<br>The Skill System:  Overall the vast variety of skills provides a user with options of how to build their character. Support gems further alter the usability of these skills and provide a good amount of variety and customization.  What sucks however about these skill gems is that many of these are either underpowered or downright useless. Some are not strong enough on their own until paired with support gems to buff them, and some are just pointless entirely.
<br>
<br>Loot: When you find something in this game, there is a feeling of excitement, like any RPG. The problem is that stuff DOES NOT DROP. Take it from me who&apos;s put in around 1k+ hours. If I could sum up the game in one word, especially when considering loot, it would be &quot;UNREWARDING&quot;. You will feel like you play for lifetimes only to find trash that is worthless and will net you a couple alts at the vendor. Good luck finding any gear that is a direct upgrade for the character you are leveling. By all accounts, unless you get insanely lucky, that AINT gonna happen. You will need to trade for anything you really need in this game, whether it be gems, orbs, or gear.. which leads me to..
<br>
<br>Trading: To get anywhere in this game, you need to trade. That is all there is to it. If you prefer to play self-found, run away from this game now.. I&apos;ve just saved you a lot of time and heartache. Trading is a pain because not only do people overvalue every item they wish to sell, many people do not even set a fixed price on items and instead ask for &quot;offers&quot;. If you offer less than what they wish to sell for, its not uncommon for them to set you on &quot;ignore&quot; or reply with vile speak. It takes forever to sell anything and the trade chat is nothing but a wall of spam on every channel.
<br>
<br>Crafting:  There really isn&apos;t any crafting in this game, which to me is a humongous let down. You have all these different base items, with all these different rolls and affixes, and yet to try to craft you need an absurd amount of orbs to do so with any effect. Orb drop rates are pathetic (after leveling now 6 characters in Domination, I have a total of 7 found Chaos Orbs, 1 divine, 3 Gemcutter Prism, and around 10 Chisels) so once again, you need to trade to get orbs. Orbs are more used for currency than for crafting in almost every aspect of the game. The worst part though, is that there is no progression.. you can use orbs on an item, and there is a small chance it will improve, but a better chance it will regress in quality.
<br>
<br>Content: The maps are pretty boring after a while. Nobody give a toss about the story, because its unmemorable, and generally its a slow grind with numerous gear checks instead of any real innovative monster skills or mechanics. Its just Up the damage and resistances and implement bosses with single shot capabilities. Graphically, the game is good but nothing amazing.
<br>
<br>What makes me laugh the most though are all these reviews saying that this game isn&apos;t pay to win. Are you all unaware of the rampant botting and selling of Orbs and other items for real money? There are a slew of RMT sites where you can buy gear for this game and even some high end players have been known to partake. Anyone who thinks it isn&apos;t pay to win is kidding themselves or just ignorant.
<br>
<br>Also, does a game being free mean its automatically a 10? Apparently that is this game&apos;s best quality.. that its free to play. Well, that&apos;s not saying much then is it?
<br>
<br>Overall, if you have no life and are masochistic, this is the game for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere for an RPG</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3909062">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Good:

-The game is free and although there are micro-transactions, they are just for cosmetics.
-You are able to customize skills and your own passive skill tree which ever way you want.
-Trading system revolves around dropable orbs which you can use to improve gear instead of a single base currency.
-Lack of bots.</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This game doesn&apos;t deserve the 8.8 user score and here&apos;s why.
<br>
<br>The Good:
<br>
<br>-The game is free and although there are micro-transactions, they are just for cosmetics.
<br>-You are able to customize skills and your own passive skill tree which ever way you want.
<br>-Trading system revolves around dropable orbs which you can use to improve gear instead of a single base currency.
<br>-Lack of bots.
<br>-Party system is simple and anyone can join any group at any time.
<br>-Regular updates.
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>
<br>-Massive lag and desync issues.
<br>-It&apos;s a terrible wannabe Diablo 2 clone where there is no auction house, and massive trade spam that lags you even more. The developers are obviously stuck in the past, and if most people wanted to play Diablo 2 they would do that instead because it&apos;s a much better game. It&apos;s like a bunch of old guys that say 60s cars are much better than cars today (they&apos;re not).
<br>-By level 50, it&apos;s just a GRINDFEST like any typical mmo.
<br>-The passive skill tree is big, but the +10 to whatever doesn&apos;t do much for your character. Furthermore, if you lead yourself into a bad tree, you can&apos;t reset your passives and undo skills unless you (grind) orb of regrets. This becomes a problem when you reach merciless, and realize your build is awful and really gear dependent. Then you have to spend another 20 hours finding another build that works.
<br>-By completing Normal difficulty in 5-10 hours, you&apos;ve already won the game. Past that it&apos;s just collecting items with different colored names to pvp with people that will always have better gear than you.
<br>-Hold the Q button and win. No tactics required.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3876488">Expand</a></span>

I just started and was having the greatest fun of my life! Unfortunately, the community and the staff are the worst of all. Because of this, I give this game a rating of 0 out of 10. Of all the games I played that were free to play, this is the first time my account got muted for something that the game actually allows you to do. Why would you enable a feature that you want players not to do? The worst company and worst staff. If you want a good game, just go buy the Diablo expansion coming out in March and spam and trade all you want in the chat rooms. This company and the staff is a shame. Also, the game is somewhat outdated in relations to recent games. If the company and their staff are going to continue to be as*holes, I am going to refer my friends out of this game and tell other people not to play this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3940298">Expand</a></span>

When you first start playing, it seems awesome because you&apos;re fighting skeletons on a scary beach.  The monsters are something you can relate to, and the environment is well-themed.  Lightning, dark caves, skeletons, and ghosts await you at every turn.  But by Act 3 that experience dissipates into a mockery of what the game built its roots on.

<br>You end up fighting fire beetles.  Yes, tons and tons of beetles, and the Act 2 end boss amounts to a giant can-opener or something ridiculous.  Then instead of cool, classic monsters, you&apos;ll be fighting ribbons.  Yes, I said ribbons.  And these weird, ridiculous monsters that don&apos;t use their claws on you, but try to leg-sweep you for reasons unknown, like some sort of mentally challenged ninja.
<br>
<br>Also, the maps in Act 3 become horrifically boring and way over-sized, so you&apos;ll have to spend hours upon hours just finding way-points unless you don&apos;t want to save your progress.  I played with a friend of mine and we raved about how great the game was at first, but Act 3 destroyed the entire experience and we quit playing it.  It was a depressing letdown and I felt like crying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=4199266">Expand</a></span>

<br>New players, look over the official game forums to see what you are getting into. Be sure to look in the feedback forum where the moderators move anything negative. In particular look at the desync and drop rate related threads. Item drops and trading are balanced towords no-real-life players, and the dev team refuses to acknowledge that the desync issues need to (or can be) be fixed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3892420">Expand</a></span>

<br>I realize that there is a fan base that holds this game as the true sequel to Diablo 2. I whole heartedly disagree. I think Diablo 2 is vastly superior in every way except graphics.
<br>
<br>I wish I could actually find another Diablo 2. Diablo 3, while fun- falls short of the mark. It&apos;s more of an action game. And PoE was just a painful experience. Maybe call it PoS?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=4432093">Expand</a></span>

The other downside is that the players seem to complain about not being able to freely trade in chat rooms. I agree completely with this. I blame the support team of moderators at the company called Grinding Gear Games. I think their supervisor is this guy called Michael. His group are the worst of the worst when it comes to account disables. I know many people who were muted and even locked out of their account for simple chat issues. This sort of a lack of freedom and abusive behavior at the company is what caused me to rate this game at the lowest. I know other companies do not really care about what you do as long as you buy their game. But for Path of Exile, its different. They offer a free to play method and also a pay to play method. I know many players who have been victims of these moderators and are waiting for the Diablo expansion for 2014. I recommend you not support them if their support staff continues to be anal about chat room posts and what not. They also try to cover up the negative truth. That is why I recommend the upcoming Diablo expansion which comes out this year and not Path of Exiles. Fair gaming experience, but bad company and bad support team.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3923106">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;m a gold closed beta supporter, and I can tell you there are less viable endgame builds in PoE than Diablo 3. The devs haven taken steps like increasing aura costs to increase build diversity, but judging from the highly negative community response, its unlikely PoE will ever live up to its promises
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll be back in a few years. Until then, enjoy 1 or 2 builds dominating the ladder, before GGG nerfs them and another 1 or 2 take their place.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3668663">Expand</a></span>

I understand that they are trying to crack down on botters, but seriously. The community is like a bunch of immature pool turds that do not want to mind their own fu**ing business. I blame all the moderators who are there for this to happen. I know many people who feel the same way. I give 0 to this game because they have lousy moderators. My reason is that if I cannot play, then I cannot enjoy the game. I would say the game has potential for a higher score from me only if they allow me to trade freely, fix the chat system, or add a trade platform for easier trades. The game moderators should go to hell.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3949066">Expand</a></span>

The first complaint I have is the fact that this game forces the character to be a certain sex or character for each class they want to play. the game is a repetitive grindfest from the minute you end up on shore. I fealt like after a few &quot;reskinned&quot; areas, painstakingly messing around with my pretend &quot;unique&quot; character, I fealt like I had already seen the game. the skill tree at face value looks like a innovative potential but a few ten levels and you notice no matter where you build you are going to end up with the same build regardless. there is no freedom in the skill tree. the trade system is piss poor, gold currency was made for a reason. the team finding system is piss poor. nobody answers chat, it is such a hassle to find the correct team. in a game that relies on heavy teamwork this game fails at creating teams. I spent alot of time being bored out of my mind than advancing in the game. what the game does right is blighted out but I will list it anyways. this game does materia and it does it well. even though the combat system is stale and borderline BORING MASH FEST, I find some of the magic fresh towards this stale series. the fact that it is free tells how bad it is, if I had to pay for this game I would be pissed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3962534">Expand</a></span>

Yes it has a huge amount of upgrades and customization but you have to be willing to pay the price of being bored to tears to get to a point where others say the game becomes interesting.

<br>Here&apos;s the good news: interface and short cuts are almost exactly the same as Diablo II.
<br>Sadly, they&apos;ve been redesigned very badly. Take the overlay-map as an example: it&apos;s next to useless because there no landmarks are visible for the player to orient himself.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s graphics are worse than those of the 13 year old Diablo II. Of course the resolution is a lot better, but PoE lacks details and most of all lighting. The character selection menu is so bad, I almost closed the game again instantly. The characters are hidden, and yes, that IS bad design, even if they&apos;re supposed to be &apos;in the shadows&apos; (there are no shadows, everything is grey). Showing off the characters is the point of a character selection, so why not use some contrast and light?
<br>
<br>Character and monster design seems equally uninspired, although that may change in higher levels (I only played two characters to level 8 and 10 respectively).
<br>
<br>The gameplay is boring to say the least. A very simple hack&apos;n&apos;slay but even that isn&apos;t really fun. Diablo 3 isn&apos;t much more than a hack and slay after playing the story through but at least it feels perfect and looks stunning.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve not seen any story to speak of, the characters are almost as bleak as the levels are boring. The latter are also not very well designed, making them more of a maze. They&apos;re also not dynamically created (probably because that would be difficult for an MMO).
<br>
<br>The skill system looks amazing at first glance with an incredibly complex skill tree dazzling the player. Mostly that is because all character classes are shown at once, though, making the whole thing quite confusing at the beginning. This super complex skill system stands in stark contrast to the lack of character customization. There are no stat points for strength, dexterity or intelligence that would make a truly complex character system.
<br>
<br>At least there&apos;s one interesting thing to note: Gems can be levelled and changed from weapons and armour without any cost. This allows for a lot of experimentation in character creation. Then again, most players will probably just not think about their characters as much if they know they can change weapons and armor at any time without penalty.
<br>
<br>Overall the game is quite well characterised by the Grinding Gear Games logo: ugly, rusted cogs that do not work smoothly, if they work at all.
<br>The only reason this game gets any good reviews must be that a lot of young players never played Diablo II.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3888797">Expand</a></span>

If the moderators are reading this, they should really back off of players who are trying to just play and chat game related stuff. These moderators are losers for sure. I give this game 2 points only because I play this free game called Dota 2. I can talk smack all I want and I do not even get penalized.

<br>The worst, however, is the constant BSODs that occur for just about anybody using a Creative sound card. This has been going on for years, and the only solution given is a command line switch to bypass using hardware audio at all. The good news? The &quot;solution&quot; kind of works. The bad news? Yeah, it doesn&apos;t really work  while the BSODs are lessened, they still happen. As far as I can tell, the official response to this is to use a command line switch to disable sound entirely. That&apos;s just poor programming and poor customer service.

I played so many free to play games and bought so many pc games that I never been muted for something so absurd like what the moderators do in this game. That is the downside to this company. They cannot even provide a fix to this and what they do is they mute player accounts. It is not even funny because when you are muted, you basically cannot enjoy the multiplayer experience. Its like playing offline mode, but they make the game an online game. This game is far from being the best and with such a scum moderator team, I am giving this a 1 out of 10. The one point is for a fun run through with the game. Other than that, bad moderators, and that means bad company. Go play Grim Dawn everyone!

End game (maps system) is based on pure and very unfair gambling and design to keep you as long as possible within the game.
<br>
<br>Maps have levels from 66  78. Anything worth farming and crafting (crafting is based on gamble too) starting from lvl 71 maps which will be unreachable to most of players since maps drop rate will decrease dramatically (drop rates lowered in background without any note to player) with each subsequent level of maps and will form a very high wall at level 71 maps. To counter that you will need insane amount of currency which can be acquired only through farming or trading. Since most items worth selling or using hidden behind lvl71 maps you will find yourself in process of very unrewarding farming.
<br>
<br>Stash space is limited. If you will run this game more than once or will want to reach end game you will need more. This is where free to play model comes in. Set of tabs for your stash will worth you 15$ (6 simple tabs) or 20$ (6 premiums). And you will buy them, because early game is so fun... But when you will reach end game, this will change into frustration of how it was designed (to keep you as long as it possible in game in hope you will buy some cosmetics effects or will run out of stash space again).
<br>
<br>After release they introduced Guilds which can help solve main problem of this game  it was designed for party not for solo players. Solo players will die a lot and in most cases you won&apos;t be able to find out why by yourself (game is based on many things most of which is not self explanatory). But, again, to get from guilds most you will have to pay with real money again.

<br>The currency system is a pure gambling. Instead of gold this game have usable orbs which can change properties of items and maps in many ways. But they based on chance so heavily that you can trash all of your hard-earned currency in minutes and will not get anything in return. Go back to farming to repeat this process later.
<br>
<br>Dsync  is another huge problem. You will die a lot because of dsync. Period.
<br>
<br>Game has &quot;old school&quot; (read outdated) leveling system. You will need to repeat process of leveling for every build you want to make. And since you will fail your fist build for sure, you will have to repeat this process over and over again while you learn this game. Follow the tip: go to the forum, find yourself a build and just follow. This will help to avoid much of frustration when things will not work as you was expecting.
<br>
<br>And some more  if you got hacked, company will not restore your stolen items or deleted characters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3664434">Expand</a></span>

<br>How fanboy see it: thousand builds
<br>In real world: 3.5 actual builds, other is weak and unplayable / playable only with gear grinded 500 hours.
<br>
<br>How fanboy see it: SOOOO MUCH PASIVESS!!!!
<br>In real world: 99% of nodes are same as &quot;put 5 points in str/agi/int after lvlup&quot;.
<br>
<br>How fanboy see it: free game, no pay to win, no money auction
<br>In real world: bots in every league, black market = same money auction but some people dont know / dont wanna use it

Well, my money is going to this new game called Grim Dawn. The support staff at the company are cowards and they know this. They cannot even take hate posts on the forum, so they have to make up a new rule to prevent hate posts. They also try to ban your IP if they do not like you. Talk about abuse there. Well, it seems as though this game is losing players fast and I am happy to hear that. A dead game means a dead community and that means the company is bad. Wait, the support team is bad and one of the worst customer service groups I have ever met in my whole gaming career. Shame on them coward losers!

Well guess what, this hasn&apos;t changed at any given time over the last years. The game is still just a facerole as party and a rather frustrating experience as solo player. Show some good design and give monsters new (aoe) skills depending on how many players are in a party. Don&apos;t just increase health and damage. This would also battle the problem of multiboxers.
<br>
<br>2) Selffound vs. Trading. This game relies heavily on trading and playing selffound or offering a selffound mode seems unthinkable as GGG&apos;s lead designer say things like:
<br>
<br>&quot;finding a unique item makes you excited because it has value to other players&quot;
<br>
<br>How can someone who likes ARPG say something so utterly wrong. There are a ton of players who just want to play selffound and mostly or with friends and PoE does everything it can to alienate those people.
<br>
<br>3) Magic Find. Mindlessly copied from D2 although it should be known that it is a completly  design as an item stat. No innovation whatsoever.
<br>
<br>4) Difficulty. Again no innovation whatsoever. Just a gear-check. Difficulty is only increased by increasing enemy health and damage. How about something more fun and something that actually rewards skill? Give monster different skills that require you to dodge, or make you take care not getting swarmed... oh wait..
<br>
<br>5)... I forgot, you can&apos;t actually make this game more fast-paced because it will desync all the time if you use something like flicker strike or high movement speed/attack speed.
<br>
<br>6) Skills. Although the trigger gems and support gem thing is very nice there are still missing a ton of actually fun spells. A fire witch has fireball and firestorm. Incredible.
<br>I know that this will get better over time but nevertheless I feel like pointing it out. ;)
<br>
<br>7) Item design is overall really good but the unique items often end up being a disappointment. The design goal here is to make unique items a build enabler, but especially in lower levels this makes finding one of the very rare unique items frustrating. Identifying a unique shield at level 30 and seeing that ALL it offers is the keystone passive &quot;pain attunement&quot; will result in you rolling eyes instead of thinking &quot;wow what a great item&quot;.
<br>
<br>8) Item progression is... well. Not that great to be honest. The skill system is something new, but at the end of the day it&apos;s just inferior to a skill point based system design like TQ. Also the required links/sockets and the rather rare drops of orbs of fusing will add to making self-found an unenjoyable experience.
<br>
<br>Well I could go on and on, but let&apos;s just end with this:
<br>
<br>Path Of Exile is a decent game and I still see lots of potential, although speaking from 2 years of experience I will say that I doubt that they will now suddenly start to fix, what they ignored for so long.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3664922">Expand</a></span>

Then got better with updates, but somehow don&apos;t get a second chance or a re review down the road. This is what happened. PoE would&apos;ve gotten terrible scores if it called it release. There&apos;s no denying that. It was unfinished, and is completely un fair to any game.
<br>
<br>If I were a dev, i&apos;d learn from this. Release in open beta, so no one can review you, continue to make money, develop the game and call it release when you know for sure you&apos;ll get a good score.

General game balance, in particular the scaling of skills. For instance, raise zombie is useless until the very late game and it&apos;s been like this forever. The lack of cooldowns for skills means you only have to use one, the best one.

<br>General game balance, in particular the scaling of skills. For instance, raise zombie is useless until the very late game and it&apos;s been like this forever. The lack of cooldowns for skills means you only have to use one, the best one.
<br>
<br>Desync. Their refusal to modify their game to combat this menace means there is no solution in sight and either you can accept it or you can&apos;t.
<br>
<br>The passive tree is a great concept but it&apos;s just as unbalanced as the skills. Many nodes will never be used because of how bad they are.
<br>
<br>Leveling takes way too long at higher levels (40+). A playthrough of normal difficulty is fun because you can run through each area once and complete the game. When you get to Cruel you have to start grinding the same areas over and over so you can keep up with the level of the monsters. Testing new builds is the most fun part of this game but the slow leveling combined with no option to respec your character makes this a chore.
<br>
<br>Grouping with other players is made easy by the notification board in the game but there&apos;s a serious flaw. It shows people from all over the world instead of just people in your realm. There&apos;s no way of telling where they are at so when you join a group and enter their instance it&apos;s pure luck whether your ping will stay the same or skyrocket to 200-300 because they live in australia and you live in US.
<br>
<br>The races that they do periodically are a good idea but the problem with them is that you always start at lvl 1 and often times they are only 1-2 hours long. Why not have some races start you in cruel difficulty at lvl 35 with some starting gear and skills?
<br>
<br>You can just press esc and close the game if you are about to die. Very hardcore if you ask me.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving a 0 because I feel 8.9 is too high of a score for all these flaws. A more fair score would be a 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3681299">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. Trading. Recent events in the game have made trading easy.  If you have premium stash tabs, the ones that allow you to change their names and colors, then you can now change a tab to what is now known as a &quot;public&quot; tab. This kind of tab will be indexed by the typical PoE store websites. You even get standard options on the tab like listing a whole tab on a single price or listing each item price individually.
<br>
<br>2. Leveling. I find leveling in PoE to be very enjoyable especially when comparing it to something like Diablo 3 where it is stupidly tedious and feels more like you are dragging your feet through mud doing nothing important. In PoE its not like that at all. You get the feeling the whole time you are accomplishing things by leveling gems, leveling your character, allocating points, and such.
<br>
<br>3. Network Connectivity. In the past, back in its beta stages, There were a lot of disconnects and desyncing from even just fighting mobs. It is not the case anymore! Many changes have taken place with their updated netcode and more server locations.
<br>
<br>Now here is a negative.
<br>
<br>5. Labyrinth/Ascension. So with the new content expansion of Ascendancy came new class expansion options. Which is great! The problem is how to get them. You must complete the labyrinth. Why is that an issue? It is really overtuned and sometimes just stupid.
<br>
<br>Now I am not going to sugar coat anything. I play hardcore only, and as such a single death means thats it. Its all over. I have died in the labyrinth a total of 5 times leveling up and being over leveled. It wasn&apos;t the boss either that killed me he is ok now that they scaled him back a bit for those leveling up. It was traps in the labyrinth. The damage set too high and being all together in weird configurations that are unpassable even with movement skills.
<br>
<br>I got so frustrated with this single aspect of not being able to ascend my character I quit playing for a while. It is that bad. I feel like Ascendancy points being tied into weird unpredictable content like the labyrinth is wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=6297659">Expand</a></span>

They really need to work on that. if it were possible to give this a 9.8 I would. Because its pretty damn good but it just has that one annoyance.
<br>
<br>The skill system is a breath of fresh air in RPGs. This game doesn&apos;t have classes so much as a massive sprawling skill tree system that is incomparable and unparalleled in its complexity. Its also extremely intuitive as well however I did discover that its possible to build you character wrong or rather at least not as optimal is it should be. The loot is surprisingly complex and I love the gem system which reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy 7&apos;s Materia system.
<br>
<br>The games non-linearity and choices are actually pretty meaningful and interesting.. Very refreshing for an MMO.
<br>
<br>The icing on the cake is the price.. The game is free powered by Microtransactions which are purely cosmetic. This is one of the most hardocre ARPGs I&apos;ve played in a long time and I&apos;ve enjoyed everything about it. Its also shocking to see a bunch of Indies from New Zealand make a better game than Blizzard and charge nothing for it. I hope to see a long career for these developers and this studio. Our industry is better because of them.
<br>
<br>Thanks for the great game guys. Looking forward to see what comes next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3753325">Expand</a></span>

<br>Don&apos;t give up just because your first character didn&apos;t work, or you keep dying and stuff like that. After a while playing, you&apos;ll get the hang of the things and will be able to enjoy the game a lot more. Remember: this isn&apos;t a game for everybody! This game is challenging, VERY challenging, but more important, it&apos;s rewarding if you don&apos;t give up. Just keep playing!
<br>
<br>They have a racing system that gives you item prizes as well as some bragging rights. They even implemented a guild system and we will get PVP tournaments soon, not to mention the 4 month leagues that works like a ladder reset. There will be always tons of stuff to do.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not giving a 10 because of the unfortunate connection problems the game suffers, mostly because GGG is a small company from NZ and they get their income with the microtransactions (only cosmetic stuff, this is not a Pay-to-win game), but I&apos;m sure this will be corrected in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3680714">Expand</a></span>

Tl;dr Fun endgame, many specs to choose from, awful retro graphics, dsyncing deaths like no other, constant bug fixes from devs and patches, overall great game 8/10.
<br>
<br>Path of Exile offers players a very diverse skill system in which I personally have not seen from another game. There are hundreds of ways to make a skill unique. For example, you can get a cleave gem and attach fire damage, frost damage,  bigger cleave area and things like that. You can literally play thousands of builds in this game. However, there are only a few handful of really good builds and the rest will fall short when it matters.
<br>
<br>The graphics in this game are fairly bland, don&apos;t expect to see anything close to Diablo 3. The good thing about Path of Exile is that is sets you in a world riddled with dark and twisted creatures. You could say in actual visuals it is close to Diablo 2 (only 3D).
<br>
<br>The music in Path of Exile is overall a bit lackluster, don&apos;t expect anything fancy other then a repeating background tune that differ in each zone.
<br>
<br>Here is where Path of Exile really tops itself in my eyes as the best ARPG currently available. The gameplay is absolutely fantastic. Each monster pack you encounter can be easier or much more difficult than the last and the boss fights in the game are overall very challenging. Don&apos;t expect to play this game and mindlessly advance level to level, you will need to play fairly well verse some of the monsters/bosses.
<br>
<br>Path of Exile offers a very easy way to play with other players. Unlike Diablo 3, Torchlight and others out there, all you need to do is create a group and give it a message &quot;Looking for more players for X&quot; and the group fills very fast. There is also many global chat rooms inside the game such as trade chat, general chat and other things like what you would expect from more of an mmo.
<br>
<br>The combat in this game has some goods and bads. The combat mechanics in this game are very well made. In games such as Diablo 3, hits register milliseconds before the actual attack lands which leaves little room to outplay bad encounters. Whereas Path of Exile has a combat system so the hit registers as the monster actually hits you, this allows you to dodge attacks freely and in a way makes this game much smoother than most in this genre. The bad thing about the combat is you dsync VERY often. This will have you dying left and right and pulling your hair out wondering how you somehow teleported 15 feet back into the pack of monsters you just swiftly ran out of. This is probably the most frustrating part about this game and overall if you plan to play hardcore this can make it or break it for you.
<br>
<br>Overall, if you want to casually play a game and not dump tons of hours (roughly 20+) to start really enjoying what this game has to offer, then this probably is not the game for you as you will be left short in your characters builds or if you have to remake a character due to a bad build. As for the hardcore players, I personally think Path of Exile is the best ARPG game out for our kind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3675814">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Path of Exile is what Diablo 3 should have been and could have been. It&apos;s a bit daunting at first, due to the complexity of the skill gem system and the HUGE skill tree, but after some practice and getting used to it all  it becomes second nature.
<br>
<br>The game caters heavily to hardcore players which is a breath of fresh air. Hardcore is fairly difficult with the different monsters in the game. They also have 4 month leagues that are even harder than the normal leagues for those who enjoy an extra challenge.
<br>
<br>All of this paired with their &quot;race&quot; seasons in which you race to be the highest level in a set amount of time (1hr, 3hrs, 1 week) make an amazing game! I absolutely love it and I never got to experience D2 when it was relevant, but PoE let&apos;s me experience that. It pays homage to one of the best games of it&apos;s time and strives to be as good as it, and better.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s free to play, so it doesn&apos;t hurt to give it a try!
<br>
<br>-------------------------
<br>
<br>My reasoning for giving it a 9 instead of 10 is simply because the game has much room to grow. The longer it&apos;s out, the more GGG will add to perfect the game. It has a fairly hard learning curve and also, desync can be rather annoying. Besides these things  the game is beautifully made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3668004">Expand</a></span>

<br>I think Path of Exile does a really good job as an arpg, better than Diablo 3. It&apos;s really fun to level up a character. The fights are fun, with a good variation of mobs, cool boss packs and plenty of good loot. The itemization is really good, with multiple properties being important and you regularily find a good item. For a noob to the game (it&apos;s pretty deep with loads of customization options), but familiar to the genre, the game is just hard enough. I died a couple of times and ran around like a headless chicken multiple times. Nothing is as fun as nearly dying, but getting away in a game like this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3899804">Expand</a></span>

More character slots.(and you start of with 24 of them). And 2. Stash tabs to store more loot in, and you start with 4 of those.
<br>
<br>I paid to get into the closed beta long ago and I am pleased to say that I haven&apos;t felt even a teensy bit of regret, the massive passives tree adds so much to the game, as well as the skill system. It is a blast to try out different combinations of skill gems and support gems.
<br>
<br>Trading in this game however, still leaves a lot to be desired, as most of the trade channels move so fast it makes it difficult to keep track of/find things that may be worth while. And it doesn&apos;t help when somebody decides it is a good idea to show off a whole inventory worth the items.
<br>
<br>As mentioned in my first segment, there is no pay to win, there is however, some really high prices for somethings. Stash tabs are pretty useful but are very pricey too, at the current prices, a single tab will cost about $3, or you could buy 6 of them for $15. Most of the legitimately interesting cosmetics are also very pricey. But I suppose this is better than, lets say, making one pay for accessing content, or making certain characters paid only.
<br>
<br>My only other major complaint is desync. and that without knowing you can suddenly end up in a horde of mobs a whole screen over, which means if you want to make a build that trades health/defence, for MAXIMUM POWER, you will need to play very carefully, or just not play the hardcore leagues entirely.
<br>
<br>Well I think that about sums up the major complaints, which when you compare it to the rest of the game, dwarf in comparison to how much fun you can have in this game for the low, low cost of absolutely nothing.
<br>
<br>Seriously, if you liked Diablo 2, go and download Path of Exile right now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3685490">Expand</a></span>

For sure this game has enough to please the casual guy, since it&apos;s free and fun to play, but with an amount of depth to please any hardcore guy. Other features that I appreciate a lot are
<br>- Leagues/ladders with features that are exclusive for that season (like the shrines in domination/nemesis league)
<br>- The amount of possible builds and the otimization which is huge.
<br>- The secret vendor recipes
<br>- Patches with new content every 2 weeks, like guild wars 2 but on an ARPG, which is more of my liking.
<br>
<br>Overall a great game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3728800">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- Replay-ability. Once done with the main story on three difficulties, you can venture into &apos;maps&apos;, which you have control over the difficulty and inners of the map.
<br>- Customization. There is a massive amount of content that can be altered by the player including cosmetics, gear, gear properties, passive skill tree (a mass of over 1500 different nodes) and skills.
<br>- Graphics. This game is beautiful. It has a range of different sceneries, atmospheres and colours.
<br>- Price. FREE. That&apos;s right, the game is free. The only charge is for cosmetics, that are completely optional and you are not pushed into buying them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3681245">Expand</a></span>

<br>The positive signs were there since the beta. The recent final release is so polished and balanced that offers a perfect gameplay experience with unlimited options and tricks available to the player. The creators made some very nice choices to differentiate Path of Exile from the ARPG pack. And they were 101% successful on their mission.
<br>
<br>All those nice options combined with perfect dark and moody graphics, excellent music and sound effects and absolutely smooth control and motion.
<br>
<br>Try Path of Exile if you are in this type of games. You will soon forget Diablo III or any other similar game.

<br>pros:

<br>+ Very high difficulty, even if you know the game and have solid character. Yet still, skill and knowledge helps overcome this difficulty. Not luck and gear.
<br>+ Complex game mechanics. You have to decide, how to solve mobility, survivability and damage from multiple possibilities. Therefore, you have to decide your way in skill tree, active gems usage, flasks, equip.
<br>+ Endgame.
<br>+ Events, leagues, ladders.
<br>
<br>The &quot;problem&quot; with Path of Exile is, that GGG developers are miraculously awesome. They are fixing and improving things so fast, that&apos;s scary to think, where all cons can be in few weeks, or months. They fixed major disconnecting issue during one weekend! I believe, they can fix de-sync over time. They are planning to add content. Improve graphic, sound etc  I was blown away, how they improving specifically this during beta! Being witness of the scale and speed of improvements, I&apos;m starting to think, if a new World of Warcraft was born? Since Path of Exile killed Diablo 3 oneshoot crit over 9000.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3727565">Expand</a></span>

I played Diablo 1 when it first came out and for the next several years if anyone asked me what my favourite game was - I would have answered without hesitation - &quot;Diablo&quot;. And then the sequels came out, neither one of which could compare to the original. Path of Exile takes what was great about the original Diablo and actually uses it, unlike its sequels, while at the same time adding cool new features.
<br>It&apos;s a pretty short game, experienced players can go from start to finish on the first difficulty level in 2-4 hours. That is a bonus in these types of games because it contributes to replayability - you can easily try out different character builds while not wasting 10 hours going through the game. Some other games try to solve this by letting you completely re-spec your character, and well - those games I will not be replaying, since there is no motivation to do so. And remember - in this type of game the gameplay IS mostly character customization, since there isn&apos;t exactly an amazing story or skill and precision-required combat like in action-adventure or fps games. It&apos;s all about the combination of abilities you pick and your inventory.
<br>The best aspect of this game is, of course, the skills and abilities. This is where Diablo 3 failed, and Path Of Exile very much succeeded. Giant passive abilities tree, every class has access to every other class&apos; skills. Some people complain that the freedom is illusionary and you&apos;re still stuck within your class boundaries if you want to make a playable character - and that&apos;s not true. If you&apos;re playing casually and are not trying to make a hardcore character to last all 3 difficulty levels -  you can make viable builds of all kinds and still have fun. Combining skills with other skills is an amazing feature too, and is something I really wish I saw more of in other games. I&apos;m still finding new fun combinations using skills I&apos;ve overlooked in the past, (spell totem + spark + multiple projectiles + fork = you got your own mini boss from one of the areas!).
<br>At a first glance this game appears to have the same &quot;trash&quot; problem as Diablo - useless (non magic) items all over the ground that you&apos;ll never bother picking up. Except this issue has actually been addressed in Path of Exile. There are skills that let you use up non-magical weapon and armor items lying on the ground to create a companion, who actually inherits the properties of those items (for example, if one of those items had energy shield - the companion will have it too). And these items can also be converted to magical if one so desires, for example in case of an optimal socket configuration (which sometimes is impossible to find).
<br>Music and art assets are good too. I read in someone&apos;s review that &quot;music was crap&quot; and honestly have no idea what they are talking about. (they probably don&apos;t either).
<br>Unlike any other game of this genre, Path of Exile also has end-game content: once you reach a certain level you start finding &quot;maps&quot; that give you access to stand-alone high-level areas.
<br>The one thing I would not praise is the story, but then again this is not the right genre to expect a great story from, (that&apos;s what Bioware RPG&apos;s are for).
<br>Although of course, if you&apos;re one of those people who will hate on this game just because it&apos;s a Diablo clone and/or doesn&apos;t have a Blizzard stamp on it - then don&apos;t bother playing it, because no matter how good the quality of the game is you&apos;ll blindly hate it anyway.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3965342">Expand</a></span>

Tackling the gameplay aspect, it plays really well, it offers deep character development via the huuuuge passive skill tree (a la Final Fantasy X) and a wide array of active skill gems, wich level up as you pass by wrecking havoc. This is one of the defining features of how skills are handleled to you in this game, in other games &quot;skill gems&quot; offer passive bonuses, while active skills are gained through character leveling via skill tree; Path of exile goes the other way around, giving the skill tree purely passive bonuses, while active skills must be earned through gems obtained quests or random drops, and socketed into specific gear in order for it to be active. It&apos;s a bold strategy, and one that may not convince a lot of players, but it&apos;s functional overall, and even more importand: it&apos;s addictive and engaging (the only quality action RPGs need to succeed).
<br>Character classes are interesting, they have a particular charisma, being gritty and enchanting at the same time, with fancy names like Maraunder (instead of the generic title of barbarian), Shadow, etc. 6 initial clases that are aligned to 1 or 2 of the main stats: Strenght, Dexterity and Intelligence. All classes have access to all passive skills in the skill tree, with the only difference being the point at which they start. That means that role playing is not completely restricted, with options for melee characters to have magic and viceversa. It&apos;s up to you to decide if this feature is a strong point because of the freedom it provides, or a weak spot in how it turns things a little bit generic.
<br>Graphically, the game is the bomb. It hits all the aesthetic and enviromental points that made Diablo II the dark gothic RPG it was, and in that sense, Path of Exile looks more Diablo than Diablo III will ever look like. Enemy design is good, although they tend to recicle previous models, and levels are really big and intrincate.
<br>The only gripe I have with the game is the lag....... it&apos;s really bad at some points. I didn&apos;t take into account this factor into the score, since I&apos;m not sure if the problem is their server or my connection, but you can be certain I&apos;m not alone in this one. The game has a bad tendency to &quot;ultra&quot; lag, making an unexpected pause for a few minutes, after which you find yourself killed by a miriad of enemies that weren&apos;t there before. But the most annoying tendency is the fact that the game just disconects every once in a while; log in again and you&apos;ll find yourself in the last town you visited, with your current progress in a dungeon ranging from partially to completely lost. In the best case scenario, the map will stay the same (enemies killed, chests looted, map discovered) and you&apos;ll just have to walk to where you left off; in the worst case scenario, the map will be randomized and EVERYTHING...... map discovery, enemy position and loot will be respawned like if you&apos;d never set foot on the place, which is complete BS. If it happens to you in a multilevel dungeon prepare to ragequit, you&apos;ve been warned!!
<br>This last aspect might deduct points for some of you, but in my view this game is a work of love, an art piece made for the sake of art, not gain. It deserves to be celebrated even in it&apos;s excentricities and faults, and in that regard it&apos;s one of the rarest gems, even if it&apos;s not the most polished one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3733249">Expand</a></span>

<br>main criticism at the moment is rocky server stability  which I am sure is being worked out. However, although I like the random maps (ala D2) I don&apos;t think they should be rest on a timer. As long as you are logged in, what you have explored should be remembered; this is one aspect I would change.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3768600">Expand</a></span>

The fact that Path of Exile&apos;s game mechanics, world creation, and story writing are ages beyond the lackluster Blizzard release are telling of what game developers can accomplish with the right focus rather than a huge budget.
<br>
<br>While the lack of currency may throw off some Diablo veterans, the ease at which Grinding Gear brings you into the world and the story make the transition a short learning curve.  And the payoff is quite good.
<br>
<br>Path of Exile is a beautifully crafted world with one of the most complex and elegant character building designs seen in recent memory.  The monsters, the bosses, the items  all are wonderfully reminiscent of Diablo 3, with a little extra flare that makes them both unique and engaging.
<br>
<br>No other free-to-play game gives such a wide range of content and depth with as little interference from their microtransaction store.  Definitely worth a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3677968">Expand</a></span>

Appreciatively on my part, you&apos;ll find no irrelevant &quot;go fetch 20 carrots&quot; or &quot;fritter away 5 minutes of your life by running between locations to collect bottles of goo&quot; for no apparent reason quests we&apos;ve become accustomed to from our RPG dosage.  Instead, each mission is both thoughtful and purposeful, and drives along the story at a gratifyingly pace.
<br>
<br>The gameplay mechanics are somewhat innovative especially in terms of character development and offer a grand scope of possibilities.  The music compliments to it&apos;s eerie atmosphere.
<br>
<br>My only qualm with Path of Exile is the fleetness of its existence, that leaves you pining for just a little bit more.  Perhaps though this is the best legacy for what is a good solid and memorable RPG.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3993619">Expand</a></span>

Since then it was getting better and better only to become the masterpiece it is now. If you like hack&apos;n slash &quot;diablostyle&quot; games there&apos;s no excuse for you if you don&apos;t try this. Deep and complex without being too complicated. Unique currency system takes a while to get used to but after some time you&apos;ll start wrapping your head around it and see how great it is. Character customization is unlike anything you&apos;ve ever seen in this genre. The leveling system is very much like Final Fantasy X  you traverse massive (and I mean MASSIVE!!!) skill tree and unlock one node every level. Abilities work like in Final Fantasy VII  you have gems with abilities and support gem which by themselves do nothing but like in FFVII if you find equipment with linked slots you can link them with active skills to change (sometimes drastically) how they work. Story is great  very gritty and dark. Crafting is complex and useful  you can craft some of the best items in the game by yourself. One thing you should know though  it&apos;s hard as nails. And that&apos;s a good thing:D Developers at Grinding Gear Games implemented awesome Free-To-Play model (pay-to win bullcrap) so it costs you knothing to try it out. You may be in for the ride of your life:)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3668431">Expand</a></span>

Playing with friends is a blast and the game is really maintains the same challenge even with more players. Leveling in the game is satisfying and Path of Exile&apos;s skill tree in INSANE, it&apos;s absolutely huge. Gameplay is great, combat is like any other dungeon crawler, pointing and clicking; but there are many powers that you can use strategically. The only game issue that I have experienced is an occasional lag spike, they are completely random and are not due to hardware or low FPS (It&apos;s quite easy to max out the game while we&apos;re on the subject). This issue is very rare, but annoying. All in all, this is a fantastic game, there is no reason not to download it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3669114">Expand</a></span>

The End result is a Hardcore Action RPG with unlimited depth with its Skill grid, socketable skills gems, flasks, crafting, insane amount of currencies that double as resources... i could go on and on.
<br>
<br>At the start of the game you have the choice of selecting seven classes. The Marauder, Templar, Witch, Duelist, Shadow, Ranger and Scion (complete game on normal to unlock). Once you select your class you are tossed into a harsh world that consists over three acts across over thirty sprawling zones, hundreds of monster types and Dozens of bosses.
<br>
<br>To keep things fresh GGG offer the player a choice of game modes and challenge leagues. You have your standard league (softcore) and Hardcore league then two others Domination and Nemesis the last two are four month duration leagues with slightly different core rules. PoE also offers PVP arena, Capture the flag and a variety of racing seasons over the course of the games life.
<br>
<br>The player has enough here to keep them busy for a long while. GGG has created something special with POE and its easily my favorite ARPG since Diablo 2... well done folks, well done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3667638">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I consider hardcore to be the only real way to play the game and cannot recommend strongly enough playing in the current 4 month leagues. The standard and hardcore leagues are essentially dumping grounds for old characters and gear, a showcase for old legacy items but not a good reflection the current state of the game. If you only play the standard league you are missing out on all the best features. This is to start  from scratch, beg barter and steal your way to power, and do so without a single death or a stash full of currency earned over the months, start from scratch leave the competitors in the dust.
<br>
<br>Firstly, it is a game made FOR hardcore PC gamers looking for an ultra deep, ultra challenging game made BY hardcore PC gamers looking for an ultra deep, ultra challenging game. The game here is the game that the developers dream of playing, it is not made to shift units, pump micro transactions or attract a crowd of COD kiddys following their favourite youtube personality. It is made to fill a void that has existed for a very long time, if not forever, in the serious PC gaming market.
<br>
<br>Their are no compromises in the games difficulty at any point, the developers have vowed never to make the game easier, only harder.
<br>
<br>The beauty and entertainment this game offers is not on a platter, your first character will suck, your second character will suck, you will be a failure at races, you won&apos;t understand how leagues work, you will not be able to get any hard to attain items or craft anything worthwhile, for months. But the tools to doing well at the above are not earnt through grinding, they are skills you as a player develop by acquiring knowledge about the games systems.
<br>
<br>The time you invest as a new player driven by intrigue and determination rewards you thousandfold not through items, skills or currency but by developing your own skills as a gamer and honing your understanding of how to progress, acquire wealth and create characters.
<br>
<br>When a new four month league starts every player who makes a character in it has no access to any items they have acquired previously, non of the characters, or skills (ala D2&apos;s ladders). Everyone has a fresh start at the same time, and only your knowledge of how to level quickly, acquire loot and stay alive that keep you in the running.
<br>
<br>The game is patched on a bi-weekly basis, the server downtime is usually a matter of seconds, less than 30 seconds. The bi-weekly patches tend to have a couple of new unique items, a new skill, some new vendor recipes and end game maps. Every 4 months a &quot;mini expansion&quot; is released, this coincides with the start of new 4 month leagues, new areas, challenges (very difficult league specific achievements) items and modifiers to the game are introduced and essentially tested here.
<br>
<br>I cannot explain how great this game is in 5000 characters, I could talk about it for hours, and hours and hours, but my lunch break is over and I better get back to work. If  you have dabbled in this game and did not enjoy it due to &quot;dysync&quot; &quot;sluggishness&quot; &quot;bad/dark graphics&quot; it is truly your loss, the more time and effort you put into this game the more it will give you back, but it is simply too vast and too complicated to be instantly rewarding, yes your characters skills may initially be feeble and sluggish, but this is a world apart from fully developed endgame characters which are capable of destroying 100s of enemy&apos;s in a minute in ways that you upon the first beach cannot even begin to imagine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3976114">Expand</a></span>

<br>5.  Currency/crafting system is very innovative and fun
<br>6.  Endgame is very varied and as fun as an ARPG&apos;s endgame can be.
<br>7.  Developers are seriously amazing.  This point can not be stressed enough.  They often speak directly to the playerbase.  They are very transparent with their goals, are very open to feedback, and work with the community as a team better than any other game that I&apos;ve seen.
<br>8.  Ethical microtransactions, no pay to win.
<br>9.  Very fun combat, especially in the late game.
<br>10.  Replayability is very high due to the build diversity and RNG.
<br>11.  Game rewards players for having a high level of knowledge and strategy.  Learning and applying the mechanics and strategy can be very rewarding.
<br>12.  Community is really helpful and there are tons of community created tools and guides.
<br>13.  Atmosphere is very dark and fits the hardcore vibe of the game.  You don&apos;t rush out of the game screaming and killing everything.  You have to work your way up in a world that is out to kill you.
<br>13.  Changes and new feature come so often that the game never gets stale.  Things are always being added, tweaked and perfected.  Just when you thought the game couldn&apos;t get better, another big patch comes and reinvigorates your passion for the game.  The 4 month leagues add tons of replayability and allows for the game to not grow stale and get dissected min-maxed to tedium.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>1.  Desync.  It&apos;s not always noticeable or a big deal but when it is a big deal it will kill you if you do not do something fast.  Developers are constantly combating it but it is one of the big flaws of the game
<br>2.  Early game can be a little boring combat-wise.  Skills are augmented by support gems and that is when combat get&apos;s more fun.  In the early game without support gems most skills can be kind of underwhelming.  There is something to be said for the atmosphere of the game being but that doesn&apos;t mean that GGG couldn&apos;t do something to make the early game more exciting.
<br>3.  Pretty damn complicated.  Your first character will probably fail, especially if you don&apos;t read any tips about how to build your skill tree.
<br>4.  Since trading is a big part of the game, people who prefer to play self-found will have a pretty hard time.  I find trading rewarding but not everyone feels that way.  You can meet some really cool people when trading and people will give you stuff for really good deals or for free sometimes.  Other times a trading partner might be really un-ideal and will piss you off.
<br>5.  It&apos;s a hardcore game.  This can be good or bad depending on who you are.  If you don&apos;t want to invest time and thought into a game and you don&apos;t want to learn how to trade then you aren&apos;t going to experience a lot of the most fun parts of the game imo.
<br>
<br>Overall this is the best ARPG on the market.  It is a harcore game made by hardcore gamers.  The developers are amazing.  The community is great.  The gameplay is deep and exciting.  The loot is sexy.  You can get lost in the breadth of this game and it only keeps getting better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3985528">Expand</a></span>

That is the real money market is all about cosmetic upgrades and a few utility upgrades (such as increased storage and the like).  It is refreshing to find that there is such an attitude in the online gaming community.  That being said the game itself has a few issues.  Most notably is the ability to connect and stay connected to the servers.  I routinely have found myself &quot;timed out&quot; for no particular reason and then waiting in a queue of anywhere from 200-2000 people trying to get back in.  High latency also can be an issue and as it is an ARPG such things can get you killed, this is a really big deal in the higher end Leagues where death is permanent or carries severe penalties.  Aside from that is also the issue of graphical optimization.  While the game runs great on a current gen PC (anything with 512MB video card and a decent CPU) it suffers on portable systems such as laptops with integrated GPUs (it even ran sluggishly on my laptop with an nVidia GTX 760M with 1GB dedicated RAM).  This is only an issue for those who like to play on a mobile unit like a laptop, but the graphics settings are sparse with little in the way of &quot;low quality&quot; for graphical settings (the lowest texture package is medium).  It is hard to draw a comparison from this game to Diablo 2 as much of the game seems to be taken straight from Diablo 2, especially the overhead map and Life/Mana bubbles.  That aside it has a refreshing progression system that literally has hundreds of possible avenues of progression and with the socketed skill system the customization of a specific character is practically limitless.  This alone makes the game endlessly fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3693362">Expand</a></span>

I am excited about this game. My friends are excited about this game. And I am not on the hype train anymore  this game is the real deal. Great job on releasing a complete game Grinding Gear Games!

<br>
<br>Path of Lottery is more like it.
<br>
<br>In many ways, the randomization works in the game&apos;s favor (random areas, monsters, encounters with special &quot;events&quot; or monster mechanics.), In many more ways, it works against the game (lottery endgame access, lottery stats on gear, lottery crafting, lottery stats on endgame areas +). The random nature of ARPGs of this sort is amplified into absurdity in Path of Exile, making it so only those who play in a &quot;no-life&quot; style can really benefit during the short &quot;leagues&quot;.
<br>
<br>Over time, those playing &quot;casually&quot; (casual - based on time spent, not dedication or investment of learning and planning) in the &quot;standard&quot; permanent leagues can eventually obtain nearly the same results, but they miss out on the new league features that are not always rolled into the standard game, or if they are, get watered down to obscurity, rarely impacting the daily gameplay, and they miss out on the league&apos;s unique items that only drop for their duration.
<br>
<br>The Devs say they like this because it encourages trade (the almighty economy) In an ideal world, you find stuff you don&apos;t need, and sell it to those who do. The randomness of drops provides everyone with something someone else wants, and rarely what they want for themselves. All sunshine and rainbows in that world, but Path of Exile has no in-game item search feature such as an Auction House. Additionally, players can only trade if they meet in person at the same time, in-game (with people playing in several leagues, or participating in activities that they cannot quickly leave and return to, just to conduct a trade, many ignore trade requests, even if they are online.) (One of the key selling points of new Leagues, is the re-starting of their fresh economy... this game does not have a stable working economy in standard leagues - their little social experiment has failed hard)
<br>
<br>Oh, and there&apos;s no standardized currency that all monsters drop. Instead, it&apos;s a barter economy that has taken to trading &quot;crafting orbs&quot; for items (Mainly Chaos Orbs and Exalted Orbs - think $1 &amp; $100 bills). These Orbs can also be used to alter gear, or be exchanged for gear in NPC shops. These Orbs are like coins you use to pull the slot machine arm to randomly gain stats on gear or the itemized endgame &quot;maps&quot;.
<br>
<br>So, when we talk altering gear, we&apos;re talking about 6 potential modifier slots divided into 3 prefixes and 3 suffixes. There are tiers to the modifiers (some have as many as 9 tiers, some only 1 tier) The max tier of a modifier is based on the item level of the gear. As you get higher item level gear, the larger the modifiers can be on that gear. However, no matter how high an item level the gear is, you can always roll the lowest possible tier of any modifier, so the amount of trash you find/roll is phenomenal. (the lowest tiers should stop rolling at a certain point, but the devs don&apos;t agree; in fact, they have intentionally created bad modifiers just to dilute the pool of good modifiers, so more trash is created/found).
<br>
<br>Gear has &quot;Gem Sockets&quot; for abilities so you can use them in combat. These Sockets have 3 colors; only ability gems of matching colors can fit. The Sockets can then be &quot;linked&quot; by &quot;fusing orbs&quot;, to use Support Gems to make those abilities more powerful or alter how they act.
<br>
<br>You may find an item with 6 very nice modifiers, but wrong socket colors, or not enough links. Due to the cost involved in &quot;fixing&quot; those absolutely necessary parts of the gear to use abilities, many people choose to go many levels without upgrades, despite having found the upgraded gear, only spending orbs on ilvl 68+ gear.
<br>
<br>The closest this game comes to crafting, is master crafting benches. You can use orbs of different varieties to overpay for 1 underpowered modifier to put on a piece of gear. These are all lower tier modifiers that don&apos;t come close to what you can find on random drops.
<br>
<br>-
<br>The primary endgame is &quot;mapping.&quot; Endgame zones are accessed by keys called &quot;maps&quot;. Maps can be rolled like any other gear, with modifiers making the monsters or circumstances more difficult. Maps drop like other loot, with higher level maps dropping less often, leaving strong characters unable to challenge appropriate content most of the time.
<br>
<br>-
<br>The Labyrinth mini-game was recently added, with traps that ignore 90% of the character building choices you&apos;ve made. Despite disconnections being a reality in online games, if you disconnect, you have to start the entire mini-game over. If this were just side content for fun, fine, but they put build-defining &quot;Ascendancy Classes&quot; as the reward for finishing it. Game breaker here.
<br>
<br>-
<br>* Bullet-hell style boss encounters are becoming more common, with one-hit kills.
<br>* Graphics and sound are good but not optimized well. Great computers can have horrible fps.
<br>* Balance is usually whack-a-mole, nerfing based on popularity, sledge hammer for a fly style.

There is no pay-to-win, no content is gated behind a paywall. You cannot make your character stronger by paying money. How amazing is that in a FTP game?
<br>
<br>As to the game itself, if you&apos;re a fan of Diablo and the like, this game is right in your wheelhouse. PoE has its own spin on powers and abilities, but in the end they feel quite similar once you become familiar with the mechanics. Character management is closer to D2 than D3, as there is less hand holding and more thought that must go into making your character. Mistakes CAN be corrected, but you cannot simply recreate your character on the fly. That is a PLUS in my book, mind you.
<br>
<br>As to the rest, Graphically, it is between D2 and D3, though the art style is far darker and grittier than D3&apos;s cartoon coloring. The music is slightly above average. I haven&apos;t heard anything that annoyed me, but nothing stands out as amazing beyond the first mini-boss theme. Controls feel fine, just like any other game of its sort.
<br>
<br>My parting thoughts? Look at most of the negative reviews. They say after playing dozens and dozens of hours they think the game is bad....does that make sense to you?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3674913">Expand</a></span>

We get the gritty killing and looting that we all expect from an arpg, with great animation, sound effects, background music, etc., PoE has it all.  The 7 character classes combined with a passive skill tree with over 1400 nodes ensures an almost infinite number of builds are possible.  PoE does take awhile to get comfortable with the pace of client input to server response timing but once you do it quickly becomes intuitive and easy.  The concept of using spell gems that socket into gear with links that allow additional support gems to enhance the base gems function makes for wonderful combinations of physical and elemental attacks.  This arpg actually has a story to tell (unlike D3 or TL2) that further enhances your total immersion into the world of Wraeclast that you have been exiled to for your crimes.  GGG is stating a goal of new minor updates every 2 weeks, major new content every 4 months, and a new act every 9 to 12 months, so long term arpg playing is there in spades.  If you got burned out of D3 or hate the cartoony look of TL2 then you owe yourself a favor and should take a serious look at this free to play arpg.  Highly recommended for new and old arpg fans alike.  Two thumbs up.
<br>
<br>ps.  This game can not be judged in only a few weeks of play.  The real fun is knowing that this arpg is going to take time to master and the journey you take from newbie to mastering PoE is a major part of the fun.  So don&apos;t dismiss this arpg jewel after only a few hours of playing.  Remember, raw diamonds are unimpressive looking too until they are polished.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3674927">Expand</a></span>

Some unique features that make this hack and slash different from others, is it skill system(it kind of like the one from Final Fantasy VII(7)), it currency system(Items base), and it passive tree(it kind of like the one from Final Fantasy X(Ten)). In all, Path of Exile is a great hack and slash game, but unless you are going to put a  good amount of time, learning it rules and ways, I feel some players will be confuse or lost to what to do. Have a nice day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/path-of-exile/user-reviews?user_review_id=3668957">Expand</a></span>
