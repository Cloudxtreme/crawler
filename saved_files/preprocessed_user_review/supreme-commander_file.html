Running it on an AMD2 4200+ with 2 gig of RAM and a 7900GT and I have stellar performance most of the time and beautiful graphics. I literally spent minutes at a time just watching my units and still LOVE the T3 artillery swinging into position. Is this an ugly game? Not by any stretch as long as you have a decent computer. You know, buy 1500$ in parts and build it yourself instead of being lazy and ordering from Dell and you might get a good machine. As for the gameplay? Priceless. I have never had an easier time with builds in my life and, to boot, there&apos;s something simple enthralling about being able to airlift units across half a map and right into battle automatically, not to mention looking cool when doing it. The visual of half a dozen heavy transports and sweeping onto an LZ is simply priceless and something no other RTS is likely to pull off soon, even the Company of Heroes (yes, I also have it) which I quite like is missing the ease of use and clean camera control which this game featured. True, I do have a minor whiff about unit AI, like most of CT&apos;s game it&apos;s a tad oddball, though enemy base AI seems to be a bit better it&apos;s reliance on unit patrols remains mystifying. This is, however, the first RTS where the AI can use nukes effectively, and the second RTS with truly ranged artillery, unlike most other games where artillery gets a scant three grid advantage over other units *cough*Starcraft*cough*. I could go further; get into the rest of the awesomeness about naval units and air units that no other game has tried to accomplish, but I&apos;ll just leave it at this. My retinas are spoiled and my scroll-wheel is a lot more worn by this game. Well done GPG!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=397655">Expand</a></span>

GPG&apos;s answer to that was graphical; they made an RTS with large differences of scale between the units. But apart from that the differences are minor. I found it yawn-inducing. Yes it&apos;s got integrated cut-scenes, a story line, character development etc etc --the whole check-list -- but as a game, it just feels like every other RTS you&apos;ve played before.In fact, it feels like a skin-pack for Age of Empires 3 -- Age of Empires 3 in space, if you like. I&apos;ve already uninstalled it. If you&apos;re an RTS fan you&apos;ll probably love it like you do every RTS; the average gamer will probably find it boring.

Each tier, usually referred to as tech 1-4, the units have more damage, health or utility. Each tier having lots of units within them. Land, air, naval and stand alone units are all included. Games can be played with 2-12 players on maps that range from small to insanely massive. The  forged alliance forever community, a community made by players with a better game game client than steam, is helpful and very friendly to new players.
<br>
<br>The game starts with just your Armored Commander Unit(ACU). Your ACU is a diverse unit that has high build rate but also can be very useful for fighting early on. Games vary immensely on size of map and skill of the players involved. Maps with high resource escalate quickly towards high tier units. Longer games will see experimentals(tech 4 units), nukes and long range artillery. There&apos;s also plenty of units that allow you to out think your opponent. For example some factions have mobile shield units, stealth fields and plenty of other great features.  The Forged Alliance Forever(FAF) community has made lots of custom games and hundreds of new maps so game possibles are endless.
<br>
<br>Overall the game is a lot of to play whether you are competitive or casual about gaming. I&apos;d recommend it to any gamer who likes RTS games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=4338079">Expand</a></span>

No other RTS on the market has the same level of depth and immersion you&apos;ll find in Supreme Commander. The control system is amazing -- unlike other RTS games where you can give your units &quot;orders&quot; in Supreme Commander you can give them entire missions! By queuing up commands you can have some of your units automatically carry out simple tasks or &quot;hit-and-run&quot; missions while you focus you attention on more complicated battles. While some may find the base creation system and resource system tedious, I find it a fun challenge to develop the most effecient war machine possible. I refrain from giving it a perfect &quot;10&quot; only because some minor balance issues make certain units almost entirely unnecessary. I would also offer caution to anyone who tries running this game on anything other than a VERY powerful system as you are likely to be dissapointed with it&apos;s performance. That said, if you have a computer that can handle it, and if you feel that RTS should be about more than just rushing or &quot;point-and-click&quot; invasions from a large, unorganized mob, than you should definitely give this game a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=396924">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s amazingly fun, and the single player alone will have you hooked for a long time. The single-player is well presented, with a throwback to Starcraft (vanilla) in the mix of short pre-rendered cut-scenes, gameplay, and mission-briefings. The story here is above average, and any sci-fi fan will enjoy it. Multilayer is where this title really shines. Like Total Annihilation, this is all about macromanagement and strategy. We&apos;ve got features that should have been though up years ago (movable waypoints on patrol routes come to mind), and some seriously bad-ass units. Shields are implemented better here then in any RTS previously, (they block shots that hit them, rather than giving a unit more hit points), making their use critical to success later in game. There are enough different strategies here to keep you playing for a decade at least; patches, easy-to-create mods, and expansions should add even more tactics. Resources aren&apos;t the PITA they were in Total Annihilation, as you can quickly build heavy mass or power generators that provide virtually infinite resources. Now, the down sides. There are a few minor annoyances which a patch should be able to fix (namely an inability to cue up commander upgrades, and the fact that you can&apos;t set patrol points from a new factory to match those of an existing one, resulting in a million different patrol routes by the end of the game). All in all, these are minor, and won&apos;t bother 99% of people. The big issue here is system requirements. I&apos;ve tried running the game on a couple of different computers, and, I can safely say that when Chris Taylor says the game will run on a 6600, he means, it will start up. At lowest settings, the game gets single digit frame rates on a 256 meg 7600GS, on a machine with a gig of ram and a 3 ghz processor. And that&apos;s on the smallest map with two players and a unit cap of 250 (the lowest). If you want to run the game at a mediocre frame rate (20-25FPS), I would say that a 7900GT would be a minimum. Duel core and a few gigs of RAM is a must. If you enjoyed Starcraft, Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds, Age of Empires II, Total Annihilation, or Dawn of War chances are you&apos;ll love this game. It&apos;s the perfect blend of civ building and brutal combat combined with excellent strategy, assuming your machine can run it. Overall: 8/10. This would be a 10/10, had the game not lied about it&apos;s minimum requirements.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=395931">Expand</a></span>

Though on a side note there isn&apos;t really any competition as any other &apos;strategy&apos; game currently available is more or less only a tactic game.<br>The variety of huge maps available through the community and the fun of building massive armies consisting of hundreds of small and huge robots, ships and planes is practically unrivaled. But even with thousands of units brawling on 40x40km maps its still possible to control because Supreme Commander allow you to zoom out into the strategy map. Where you can control and give advanced orders like ferries or coordinated attacks easily.<br>The sometimes criticized resource- and build-system might take some time to get used to but it&apos;s in no way inferior to any other strategy game.<br>The only negative critic I have is that this game hogs your PC quite radically. Even after 4 years and with a modern mid-class PC it still gets slow when 2000-3000 units are present on the map.<br>In my opinion everyone with a slight interest in strategy games should get a copy of this. Including the addon &apos;Forged Alliance&apos; it shouldn&apos;t cost more then 15$.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=1649400">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Supreme Commander is a really good strategic game. It is clean, fun and makes you think. The Campaign takes up a lot of time. Playing Skirmish is fun, especially on the huge 50k by 50k maps. The units and stuff are well designed, well animated and have really good sounds.<br><br>This game is really fun, I have all three SupCom games!</span>

                                        <span>One of the better RTS games around. Supreme Commander has 3 diverse races that have many interesting and fun units. Experimental units are one of the best parts of the game. But the ability to control thousands of units in real time on a large map allows for supreme strategy unlike other RTS games. Graphics are good aswell but the user interface can be a bit hard to get the hang of.</span>

It has it all: GIANT robotic armies, tons of ground/air/naval units, experimental weapons (Colossus robots, flying motherships, etc.), great balancing, good difficulty curve, endless fun in Skirmish mode against AI. The campaigns aren&apos;t bad, they&apos;re not the best but they are enjoyable and have somewhat interesting stories. The Skirmish mode is amazing, AI has multiple difficulty settings that will never stop challenging you, the battles are complex and strategic, and the unit count is off the charts! If you like RTS games with huge armies, tons of units to choose from, MANY buildings and endgame experimental weapons, definitely give this game a shot! I played this along with War Front: Turning Point, C&amp;C3, AoE III, Starcraft: BW, and Warcraft III, and the only game out of those that were better than Supreme Commander was Warcraft III. One of the best RTS&apos;s I&apos;ve ever played, probably my third favorite of all time. The three different races are complex and give a good variety to any battle, and the amount of different attacks/approaches/defenses that are available is incredible, and will make sure no two battles play out the same way!
<br>
<br>The campaign&apos;s theme of EXPANDING the map instead of loading a different one makes the game require some heavy duty hardware in your computer. By the end of a mission the map will be HUGE and there&apos;ll probably be like 1000 units on it at once, so be warned that you need a hefty computer to handle this game, or you&apos;ll have to decrease the graphics a lot (Which by the way, the graphics are REALLY good for when this game was made: they even stand up to today&apos;s standards in some aspects!).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=3896531">Expand</a></span>

Supreme Commander is a great title because this game is really supreme. I have played about every RTS I can find and this tops them all in its scale and scope of game play and it&apos;s terrific graphics. The abilities one has to control the units is simply enormous. You can queue up build orders, attack orders, designate patrol paths, set ferrying orders so that transports will wait by factories until units are constructed, then load them automatically, fly them to the point of your choosing, unload and return for more reinforcements.  You can set multiple build orders in a factory: Build two of these, five of those, three of these and so on, even have the loop repeat. You can upgrade the Commander with various new abilities which differs by faction. You can literally scroll out in a second to view an enormous landscape and yet still control all your units with ease. The game runs very smoothly at maximum settings with hundreds of units on the screen with any decent computer today.  The models and animations are highly detailed and you can zoom in very close.  No, I wouldn&apos;t compare this game to the Total War series:  Those are the slowest, most boring games I ever played.  If I wanted something that slow-paced, I would still be played Avalon Hill strategy board games, like I did as a child.  At least they were interesting. Don&apos;t listen to the naysayers here, just look at the amount of positive reviews and realize they are only trying to rock the boat.

<br>This was never really a story-driven game for me, and I only played to build units and watch them blow each other up essentially. Of course, I do like to deploy my units strategically during combat, but I also sometimes feel lazy and simply want to throw units at my enemy until they die  which SC allows you to do really well once you manage your resources well enough and you have enough unit factories and drones to speed up the unit production process.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=3228928">Expand</a></span>

<br>Base building plays a large role in survival in this game, expect to lose a lot of units to a barrage of artillery, nuclear attacks, or experimental units.

I recommend using this with Forged Alliance Forever so that they can get on the multi-player scene with friends or the community. It also adds helpful fixes, content and balancing that can really improve the Sup Com experience.</span>

I have no idea what all the hype is about, myself, I was horrified when I played this sorry excuse for an rpg. And here&apos;s why. 1. The maps are ridiculously large it takes many minutes to walk half way across the map, no exaggeration. 2. You rarely get to actually watch your guys duke it out with the enemy, you have to go to the tactical overlay every 5 seconds. 3. You spend all your time building powerplants. The resource system is horribly weak. You just build certain buildings and they give you resources, or tell your guys to go eat rocks or trees. 4. He who gets a larger army wins. Pretty much all you do is build many bases, and many soldiers and send them to the fray. This game did not interest me at all from the moment I started, however I forced myself to finish for the sake of this article. Bottom line, calling this game a strategy came is ignorant. Get a real game, one from the ages series preferably, Medieval 2 is a great one too if you like a mix of strategy and rts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=396401">Expand</a></span>

There were some good features, like the zoom, but overall, it&apos;s terrible. You want epic? Go Total War. SupCom has hundreds of little, badly detailed blobs running around. It&apos;s just BAD. But, you owe it to yourself to try it.</span>

I don&apos;t see anything in this game that hasn&apos;t been done better in RTS games that came out before it -- the tutorial isn&apos;t very friendly (no scripted, guided scenarios, just a bunch of disjointed videos), the graphics are terrible -- poor, tiny unit models with no detail whatsoever, and dull, lifeless textures that aren&apos;t engaging. The unit sounds and music lose their novelty fast, as units only make one sound when selected. The interface is uninteresting -- wow, little pictures in colored boxes. Gee, thanks. I can&apos;t say much about the maps or the gameplay -- I didn&apos;t play past the tutorial and I see no reason to. Games like Command and Conquer and Company of Heroes provide everything at it&apos; best -- gameplay, graphics, music, sound, the interface, it&apos;s all there and it&apos;s all AMAZING. Some might argue that the gameplay is worth it. and that the extra large maps add an interesting dimension, but I still don&apos;t find that it&apos;s enough to make this game worth any serious attention.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=396051">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are improved and there are now 3 factions with what appear on the surface to be diverse playstyles.   Unfortunately this is mostly on the surface as the large map sizes often meant ground combat became a total stalemate and it turned into a sheer brute force weight of numbers and economy battle rather than tactics.  The existence of the shield generator buildings made it possible to create mass overlapping shield bubbles that made most attacks incapable of doing much critical or significant damage.
<br>
<br>Finally, the Commander unit itself while nice is a far cry from the Total Annihilation commander with its D-gun.  The Commander was near the end of the game more liability than asset due to its volatile death explosion, and its gun, while in theory capable of one hit killing most things, was not enough to save it as the gun did not penetrate through multiple units like the D-Gun.  This meant the Commander in mid to late game could not fight its way from any reasonable sized collection units, and was often reduced to hiding in its base.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=3946159">Expand</a></span>

I was under the impression that it did, however not much of my second core sees much use in my rig. Athlon 64 x2 3800 @ 2.4GHz 2gig Mushkin DDR400 @ 200MHz Lanparty nF4 Ultra-D XFX 7600 GT @ 620/750 300gig 7200.9 System drive 80 gig WD800JB Data drive (Swap) I have the AMD dual core patch installed. Fast and stable, yet struggles mid - late mission during most missions, typically when there are many units on the map. There really is no excuse for this, i reckon its just bad coding. High time devs started coding for multiple cores and 64 bit. I&apos;ve heard plenty of excuses why not, but none of them stick. Multiple cores and 64 bit has been around for more than 10 years, and readily available on the desktop for at least the past 3 years. You struggle to find a single core 32bit Dell these days. Time to unleash the power and advantages laying dormant in our CPU&apos;s /me climbs off high horse. Adjusting graphics doesn&apos;t seem to help much. So... any ideas on how to get rid of the late game slowdown?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=398087">Expand</a></span>

I played the beta since November of last year, and to say the game is boring without any strategic options, is utterly insane. There are so many ways to win or lose in just a 1v1 game. The tide of battle can turn on lucky strike or a beaten down foe can recover and defeat thier attacker while on the ropes. Forget the many ways to exploit a group of players in larger maps with 2v2 and 3v3 4v4 games. But I do understand what people think strategy is how quickly you can click the &quot;Special Spell&quot; on their SnoreCraft &quot;SuperHeroes&quot; at the right instant. These are the same people who thought Mortal Combat was the first RTS. Then again it might be the system requirements, yes you need to have a video card that is 33% as powerful as the current generations. Sorry, want to play games without investment - by a PS3. To see if you suck and just don&apos;t know it - visit Tom&apos;s Hardware and peep the VGA charts. Secondly, for the AI to have any chance at all in a single player game (yes it must use the CPU to &apos;think&apos;), forgetting about multiple AI&apos;s, you will need a fast or Dual Core processor. Now that I have covered the technical aspects. Let&apos;s go over some the possible ways to win. By land - early or late with Air Support. Bombers and fighters doing early game attrition damage. Using transports/ferry system to move massive numbers of Tech1 and Tech2 land troops close the enemy base - works on a large or small maps. Using Naval, even Tech1 Navy can hit from a distance, Tech 2 and 3 are devastating. Missile strikes, tactical and strategic nukes. Medium, long and global artillery, backed up by multi tiered mobile artillery. You can lunge at an opponent, who can defend or strike back. You can hurl death through the air from a heavy protected base, wearing down your foe&apos;s defenses. You can scramble for resources and Tech up quickly for a pin point execution of the enemy commander. The list is nearly endless, capturing rather than destroying unprotected targets, covert remote base constructions, power or mass generation strikes, huge experimental units, combination of land with air and naval bombardment support. Any critic who said the game is simplistic is painfully two dimensional in their tactics and I, like the rest of SupCom beta testers would love to ring the bell, and school them on tactics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=395956">Expand</a></span>

If you like RTS games you owe it to yourself to seriously consider getting it. At first glance it may not seem like much but give it some time to get a grasp of it or check out the better replays available in GPGnet. I&apos;ve seen people talking about the game online in forums and often they are mistaken as to a certain feature or ability of the game so just because someone says X doesn&apos;t mean its true. This is a huge and well thought out game. Many people complain it&apos;s a spam units kind of RTS but the game offers many types of ways to defend, too. Also not all players are spammers and in games with more than two people you have another added dynamic. The graphics are simply amazing. You can pan the camera around and move it rather intuitively which is more applicable when watching replays because you&apos;ll be busy when commanding. Just watching the good SupCom replays, though, is very enjoyable all on its own. One of the really cool things about this game is watching huge numbers of units go into battle. I just watched about 80 fighters flying around and not only is it nice to be able to command so many, it&apos;s just beautiful to watch. Each unit has a lot of computation as to firing angle, speed, target tracking speed, experience, speed of movement, height, etc etc etc. The game is doing a lot of computation for each unit and this adds a lot to gameplay and replayability. I agree with Ira Gardner-Morse&apos;s previous comments here on this page except with his mention of the slow game performance in the single digits -- it was slow for me too until I set my directx sound acceleration to &apos;basic&apos; (until the patch comes out to fix this) because of a known bug (feb 2007). Once I did that, performance is quite good for me on my AMD 4200+X2 with nV7600GT with 1GB of RAM. I love SupCom and I&apos;ve had it less than a week. I&apos;ve been gaming since about 1976 and I&apos;ve played a hell of a lot of games. This is a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=396083">Expand</a></span>

The units are all unique and useful, without having anything just used for filler. The AI is good enough to hold its own for those nights with no friends, while not being over done. The maps go from small 1 on 1 quick matches, to epic 4v4 world-sized conquests that take hours upon hours to complete, and are never boring. This game is a great time spender. I say spender, because to call it a waste of time would be completely untrue.

In most RTS&apos;s, it feels to me that the player guides their units or squad from encounter to encounter, trying to build up that one group so that you can take out the enemy&apos;s base. You rarely focus on multiple fronts. From what I&apos;ve seen and experienced, COH did a good job of making you think about the entire battlefield...but SupCom does it even better. In SupCom, I&apos;ve found that I don&apos;t try to think about using one or two squads to conquer the entire map. Instead, I end up setting up multiple rallying points, support lines, and firebases outputting troops. I am CONSTANTLY expanding and thinking about how to best approach my enemy. I find that I use Radar and Scouts to (GASP) actually gather intelligence. And then, I use a combination of air, ground and sea units to begin try and remove the capabilities of my opponent. But, here are the high points. The way the game handles patrol points is fantastic. The Ferry System...as soon as I figured that out, I had a moment of &quot;Oh Dear LORD!&quot; It&apos;s very elegant and simple. I can now, with this game, set up a transport to ferry to one location, which creates a Ferry Point. Then, I can have a few factories produce units in tandem (2 or more factories producing the same build order on repeat, a very nice touch) and have them dispatch their new troops to the Ferry Point. Then, by ordering my other transports to Assist the original transport, all of a sudden I have a FLEET of transports moving my rapidly developing strike force. It&apos;s a beautiful sight. This game does a good job in moving your focus to the entire field of battle, instead of just one &quot;path.&quot; I find myself fighting on multiple fronts...and loving it in this game where as I would have hated it in any game before. I find myself looking at each map as a puzzle to be solved, instead of a series of discreet engagements leading up to a base trashing romp with a &quot;super squad.&quot; Here, it&apos;s a full field battle. Oh, and besides that...the nukes are just fabulous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=396124">Expand</a></span>

It raises the bar for all RTSGs by its scale, its multiplayer matching and rating system GPGNet, and its modifiability. The design discourages micromanagement of battles, enabling an unrivaled scale that puts the strategy into RTSG. A recent patch demonstrated the love that Gas Powered Games has for this game--it addressed nearly every common complaint about the initial release by tuning factional balance, fixing minor bugs and UI issues, and adding new features to make the game even more playable. Every common complaint was addressed, and performance improved to boot. Any RTSG fan should not miss this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=398120">Expand</a></span>

With breathtaking graphics and enormous battles, this game actually puts the Strategy back into Real-Time Strategy. Only downside is that you need an uber-computer to play it smoothly. I have a decent computer and had to set almost all the video settings on the game down to the minimum. Still though, it has a great plot and gameplay.</span>

<br>
<br>Now, however, after patching the game and learning the ins and outs of the gameplay, I can say that it is one of the most enjoyable Real-time Strategy games I&apos;ve played.  
<br>Most importantly: **patching the game increased my frame rate from 20fps average to near-constantly above 60fps with NO changes in my hardware**.  The patching system really sucks, but it&apos;s more than worth it for the performance increase, new features, and online multiplayer.
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;d say if you&apos;re new to the game (or the genre), STICK WITH SUPCOM!

I can tell that Chris Taylor and his team have poured their hearts and souls into making this masterpiece. It forces strategic and tactical thinking. and often forces the player to improvise new tactics in the midst of combat. Like Hector G. said &quot;you can&apos;t win by larger army&quot; is very true. Anyone who says that this game is unoriganal or brings nothing new has obviously only played this game for a few minutes and couldn&apos;t comprehend its vast and deep military and economy system. I have never heard of another RTS that has such an excellent Economy system (doesn&apos;t mean that there isn&apos;t another one) based on rates, building costs are deducted as the unit is built not, all the resources are taken away at once making you wait forever to get enough resources to build something then losing it all in one fell swoop then awiting forever for it to get built. Also very few other RTS games including the very good and Popular Company of Heroes have fully realized navies and air forces, radar and counter- intelligence. complete arsenal of nukes, tactical missiles, missile defenses, short and long range artillery, shield genorators, tide turning expirimentals, Full zoom from the entire map view to up close to see the smallest unit in detail, and the best and most innovative feature is the assiting of units and factories streamlining unit building, repairing, and resources gathering and really maximizing the players Command potential. In short Supreme Commander is a must have and is indeed a very origanal RTS, Its much more than it&apos;s first impression blandness (i hated it until I got the hang of it and now its incredible) But don&apos;t take my word for it go to the store and buy it and the expansion because its even more awesome, and expirience the extreme depth and immersion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=407829">Expand</a></span>

I was waiting for this game to be the next big step in RTS gaming, but it feels like a step backward. Yes it has a large scope, at the cost of just about everything else that makes RTS gaming so much fun. The units feel bland and generic and the action feels removed and sterile. The graphics are subpar when compared to other recent RTS games which help lend to the bland removed feel of the game. I am sadly disapointed by this game that I&apos;ve been wating so long for. One final complaint, the UI is ridiculously big (even on higher resoulutions). The actual gameplay takes place in a small window in the center of the screen surrounded by excessively large box of superfluous buttons. It is like playing the game in a letterboxed format, and while increasing the resolution does help somewhat it does not entirely mitigate the problem and may not be feasable for people with less than state of the art computers since the game takes a significant amount of processing power to begin with. A lot of people do seem to enjoy the game, so this one disillusioned gamer&apos;s opinion should not disuade you from trying the game or at least the demo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=395767">Expand</a></span>

Maybe they should pull their head out and realize ther may have been a problem with the system they tested on. If you ask me they had nothing but the intention of giving Sup Com a bad score anyway.</span>

This game is increadibly addicting and great to play with friends. There seem to be bugs here and there, but it would be silly to let that compromise my rating when everything else is pretty much great. The game play is designed to let you truly strategize. Instead of just making the biggest army telling it to attack you can make many platoons and use queued movements to make them attack in just the right places at just the right time.

I&apos;ve been waiting for years and years for Total Annihilation 2 to come out and that&apos;s exactly what Supreme Commander is. Now, don&apos;t get me wrong, the Total War series is great and Company of Heroes is an excellent title, but THIS is the game that true RTS fans have been waiting for. It has the scale of a turn-based strategy game with the pace of a real-time strategy game. BEWARE, however - SupCom will put your brain to the test. Imagine a game of chess where each turn lasts no more than 2 seconds and there are approximately 700 pieces on a board the size of Rhode Island... then you&apos;ll begin to understand the breadth of this epic game. If you can put on your thinking cap for a few hours, you&apos;ll see the intricacies of the incredible build/orders queue system and you&apos;ll become giddy when you realize you&apos;ve mastered your own, completely unique build strategy to take you from measly scout bots to giant UFO&apos;s and Fusion Reactors before your opponent can say &quot;Spiritual Successor to Total Annihilation&quot; four times without messing up! Only reason it doesn&apos;t get a 10 is b/c they lied about system requirements. An Athlon XP 3000+ w/ 2gb RAM and a 256mb graphics card could NOT handle this game. Had to go upgrade to a 3.4ghz P4 and a new mobo to get the &quot;medium&quot; fidelity on relatively small 1v1 games. Go for a quad core if you want to play 4v4...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander/user-reviews?user_review_id=396807">Expand</a></span>
