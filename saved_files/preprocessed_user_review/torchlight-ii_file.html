This is a sword, this is a gun, these are monsters. It has an almost cartoony look to it but the gear still looks badass enough so that it doesn&apos;t get annoying. As far as the skills are concerned i think they both are tied. They have different styles but TL2 is more pleasing to the eye. It isn&apos;t bright to the point that it is annoying but enough so you can clearly tell what everything is and the action doesn&apos;t blur your vision to the point that everything kind of melts together. (as it feels like it does sometimes in D3). As far as physics are concerned Diablo 3 definately wins. Crumbling stone, Monster gibs are very satisfying, and the environments almost falling apart in some areas really adds immersion to the gameplay. The models in TL2 look like they had a little more love put into them. The swords aren&apos;t flat and dont look paper thin, And the wide variety of ranged weapons for mostly one class really impressed me.
<br>Monsters: The monsters in diablo felt generic, uninteresting, and just plain bland most of the time. Mostly borrowing from the previous games and adding a few from other games it really didn&apos;t bring any surprises. Even the bosses felt kind of boring with the butcher being the generic bad guy from about 10-20 different video games including previous diablo games. The champions in TL2 have been greatly improved from the first one but after playing d3 for so long they felt like pushovers. While some people may have been disappointed with how simplistic the champion design is i was actually thankful i didnt have to spend 30mins-1hour fighting one champion because my gear wasn&apos;t godly at the time. I was also thankful there were no invuln minions, reflect damage, mortars, desc, or the ice bombs. Because it meant i didnt have to hop around the map trying to sneak a shot in time from time while trying not to get killed in 1-2 hits. Overall TL2&apos;s champions were slightly not challenging enough (i played on veteran) and D3 was too unforgiving. Gear: Here is where TL2 truly shines. Gear is plentiful, and gear of all rarities are useful with uniques being rare enough and with good enough affixes that it would immediately replace the rare gear you had before without making you feel like you NEEDED it. It took me 3 uniques until i got one that i could actually use so i stuck the others in my shared stash for alts and didn&apos;t find myself disappointed that i didn&apos;t get more. The rare and uncommon drops had good enough affixes, and all useful for my class so i didn&apos;t mind not getting godly gear. In diablo 3 had i gotten gear with strength or intelligence (focus in tl2) i would have been pissed and vendored that !@#$, but in TL2 some strength or focus is actually useful for my mostly Dexterity class. They balanced the skills so that every class can benefit from bonuses in each of the 4 stats. And if you dont like certain affixes on your gear you can pay some gold and get them removed via enchanter, and also add in more enchantments depending on how good the enchanter is. This allows for great customization in gear and makes almost every rare or higher drop worth keeping. In diablo 3 getting gear feels like cycling through garbage for hours or even days to find 1 hidden diamond.
<br>I&apos;ve seen people complain about TL2 interface but honestly i found it to be much simpler and easier to understand than D3. It has no hidden modifiers, any additional information you want to know can be found in your arcane statistics (J). Plus you can load your pet up with any loot you dont want and he will go to town and sell it for you so you can spend more time actually playing the game.
<br>Basically if you love to grind and spend hours upon hours praying to find something godly, or even worth putting on the AH; then play D3. If you like to play ARPGs and kill monsters, get lots of loot, and have a ton of fun; then play TL2</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2644436">Expand</a></span>

<br>Everything you could want from an ARPG can be found in TL2 and then some.

<br>So, if Runic can deliver us this amazing game for 20$ why can&apos;t Blizzard make something remotely interesting for 60$?</span>

Even though you will inevitably find  some quirks they are not going to become a fundamental game-stopper. It runs smoothly in single-player mode, there is useful loot to be found without having to give a jealous glance at some item shop your game is balanced around, there is no need to bore yourself through three rounds of easy mode before finally meeting a challenge as you can pick your appropriate difficulty mode from start, there&apos;s modding support and lastly and most importantly the game sticks to the guns and doesn&apos;t try to marry with MMO mechanics. What this means is also that there are no silly balancing efforts as well as other deterrents not adding to gameplay. Matt Uelmen&apos;s soundtrack adds perfectly well to the atmosphere, the sound is crispy and if you don&apos;t mind comic-style graphics and nonsensical story which does at least not try to take itself as serious and impose itself on the player then you can&apos;t go wrong with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2635763">Expand</a></span>

Based on my experience on playing different games, I could say that TL2 truly shines among the lot. TL2 offers a good bit of variety to the fray (pleasant lighting, varying creatures, overall flow of the game), oftentimes I feel immersed as I grind through one single boss fight, not minding how long it took to beat, rather enjoying ever moment trying to do so. The developers have really taken the time and effort on &quot;listening&quot; to what its players had to say, and I am thankful towards this decision that they&apos;ve made. I believe the TL series still has so much untapped potential, and I&apos;m eager to find out what improvements the developers still have in mind, if any.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2646877">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Torchlight 2 is wonderful and deserves much praise, especially for only costing $20.  One would expect Diablo 3 to be three times the game as Torchlight 2 for the asking price but that isn&apos;t the case, at all.  If anything, Diablo 3 could learn quite a bit from Torchlight 2 (such as the awesome loot progression, offline play availability, LAN and mod support).
<br>
<br>Torchlight 2 has been an entirely bug-free experience for me thus far (unlike Diablo 3&apos;s launch-- which was one of the worst I&apos;ve ever experienced despite probably having one-thousand times the budget of Torchlight 2) and the game plays amazingly smooth.  The battles can be epic (unlike Diablo 3&apos;s battles which usually amounted to rock, paper, scissors excercises of frustration depending on RNG) and choices actually matter.
<br>
<br>If I had to make a complaint, I&apos;d say Torchlight 2&apos;s story is fairly weak (Diablo 3&apos;s was as well-- laughably so, actually).  About the only thing I can imagine that Diablo 3 has over Torchlight 2 that I noticed was the destructible environments.  The art style is kind of a matter of preference I&apos;ve found.  I personally like Torchlight 2&apos;s style but can understand if some people don&apos;t (probably the same people who would willing bypass a great game like Borderlands 2 because it doesn&apos;t look like Battlefield 3-- aka, &quot;their loss&quot;).
<br>
<br>I would fully recommend Torchlight 2 to anyone that loves ARPG&apos;s and even if you&apos;re kind of on the edge or not sure if you&apos;d like them or not, Torchlight 2 is probably the best, contemporary example of how one should be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2635720">Expand</a></span>

Ton&apos;s of content and a true skill point system with none of the DRM Crap and RMAH.  Thanks Runic for providing a game versus a new way to monetize gaming.</span>

Playing the beta really excited me because of the nostalgic feel of ARPGs and obvious features that made classic ARPGs a hit.  Torchlight 2 did not stop at the beta like some of these reviews suggest.  I doubt they have played the new release or the beta for that matter.  This game is fun, engaging, and challenging.  Equipment is almost a limitless toolbox of tweaks for your character, and skill building provides its own enjoyment with skill tiers and multiple skill trees.  Choose your skills, choose your equipment, and basically equip anything you&apos;d like provided you have the stats.  How amazing is that?  The multiplayer in beta was awesome, and once it is available on the official release I know the game will be a favorite with my friends and local LAN.  Very few games give the features and availability to play on slower systems.  Torchlight remains stylishly impressive as far as visuals are concerned while maintaining support for older and underpowered PCs.  $20?  Massive compatibility for smooth game-play? LAN?  These options and the options I have listed with respect to character progression are all reasons I give this game perfect marks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2635531">Expand</a></span>

The game is absolutely huge, has tons and tons of content, and can be played offline so no more lag deaths, or lag period. Graphics are beautiful and the amount of things to do are just shocking for such a modest price-point. Not to mention all the great features from pets to multi-player to extra difficulties to lv 100!! I can pay my deepest respect by stating one key fact, &quot;I will be playing this game for a great portion of my foreseeable future.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2631637">Expand</a></span>

By level 10 I was already completing a useful 3 piece set bonus, had a unique weapon that gained augments by killing spiders, and had actual unique useful items. Your characters can all be unique, even if they are the same class. I already made a hunter focused berserker, and now I can&apos;t wait to re-make another berserker to focus in the ice damage tree. Your decisions also hold weight, if you end up with a terrible build then you definitely won&apos;t be surviving in the harder difficulties. I love the fact that I can&apos;t just re-spec and be fine and dandy again. I feel more driven to have my character succeed because it was my own unique build and unique attributed stats, so my characters feel more personal. Pet system = amazing
<br>As many others have mentioned, the soundtrack is fantastic and the visuals look great. The fact that this game is only $20 makes me feel like I&apos;m robbing Runic of such a great piece of work. Any hack n&apos; slash fan will enjoy this game immensely.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2635013">Expand</a></span>

Character development is diverse and feels meaningful, and the frequent drops of good loot just make you want to play on and on.

<br>In a nutshell, it&apos;s a blizzard game designed by a blizzard team who just happen not to be at blizzard anymore :)</span>

And i can safely say this beats all of them. It has that constant feel like eveyrthing is so unique and some awesome equipment is gonna come up your next fight. And its great it still has all the skills to get and level up and the animations for everything are awesome. The graphics are alot more polished over torchlight 1 but still give the same feel. The game has a never ending variety to monsters. You never feel like you are ever fighting the same species of creature for too long. The environments are great. And i can&apos;t explain how much i love the random events and finds. One second you kill a creature and teleported to a new realm where you get a challenge like defending a crystal from hordes of goblins or just roaming the world and you come across a bandit camp holding prisoners and if you free the prisoners they give you a chocie of three items to pick from which are always good. Then there are some secret actions you can do but i wont reveal that aspect of the game. So overall the game is by far the best hack and slash loot em up game out right now and probably for a long time. I haven&apos;t had the full experience with spells and magic  as im more of a grab a hammer and smahs everytihng kinda player but from the looks of it it looks pretty sweet. And i also haven&apos;t tried co-op, but i mean if im having this much fun alone, having a buddy or two would just make it unreal. Final conclusion: Get the game, its 20 bucks. What do you have to lose?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2633219">Expand</a></span>

Great, detailed and rich world, awesome soundtrack and exquisite gameplay. Watching mobs explode as you attack is as satisfying as it can get. Even if the loot mechanics are a little overwhelming, this game is still, as of yet, the last bastion of PC Gaming&apos;s ARPGs.</span>

The greatest part is how random each game is and how each play through will be different from the last.  Making this the most valuable game in a long time.  What&apos;s more is once the Torchlight 2 editor drops then there will be a ton more content to be had especially if it is anywhere close to the original.  Graphics are very stylized but amazing and fun to watch.  The animation is really good as well.  This is by far one of the most addictive action RPGs in a long time, since D2 or even the first Torchlight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2634602">Expand</a></span>

Overall an amazing game that has MASSIVELY improved on the first one. For $20 this is a game that is a DEFINITE BUY.  PERFECT DUNGEON CRAWL
<br>
<br>With four different classes at your disposal and several pets to choose from, the replayability of this game is quite amazing. Each class has its own set spells and unlike Torchlight 1, the classes don&apos;t share any skills. What does this mean for you? A plethora of customization options! You could opt to play an Engineer as a unstoppable tank, or a support with many bots and gadgets at your disposal, or a hammer wielding hero that destroys anything in its path. The choices and builds you can make are endless. On the top of my head, I can already think of FIVE, yes FIVE, different builds for the Engineer that are not only viable but fun as well and I&apos;m sure there&apos;s other people who&apos;ve thought of builds I haven&apos;t consider yet. What can you expect from each class? You can expect no less than five different ways to play. The world is very open and beautiful. It rotates from grass levels, to snow, to desert and all around beautiful combined with great musical pieces. Another aspect of the game that is fantastic is the fact that the boss fights are VERY FUN and ENGAGING. Co-op is simply fantastic. You can play with 5 of your friends or random people and crawl through the toughest dungeons, with each person using their class in a different way, this is bound to be fun for everyone. The loot is fantastic, there&apos;s so much of it its great and you get a feel of SATISFACTION each time you get a piece. There&apos;s also mods mods mods. Really there&apos;s so much great about this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2631989">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>There isn&apos;t much to say here. Torchlight 2 is a true successor to the ARPG genre and warrants every piece of good criticism out there. The graphics are not in my taste but I&apos;d rather spend hours upon hours playing this than some stripped down game that moves the ARPG backwards. Great job Runic Games I look forward to playing this title in the coming future.</span>

The user interface is very clean, easy to read, and aesthetically pleasing to me. The graphics aren&apos;t cutting edge, but are very tastefully done, with a lot of charm and character. Performance is great and the game runs very smooth on my modest desktop. There is a TON of loot, but not just any loot: GOOD loot; meaning that there is a good mixture of hefty decisions on what to use. The different weapon types all have their own feel to them. Everything feels &quot;just right&quot;. Everything feels different and the &quot;crunch&quot; is there when killing monsters. The combat is perfect. I have never been more satisfied with combat. This game captures that perfect feeling you get when destroying things. It&apos;s awesome. The skill trees are much better done here than in the first Torchlight game, in my opinion. I haven&apos;t seen one skill shared between any of the 4 classes. There are plenty of skills to choose from when levelling up, and there are plenty of builds you can have in each class. It gives the player the freedom to have unconventional builds, and gives them plenty of tough choices without being overwhelming. Runic absolutely nailed it. Variety is handed out to the player like candy. There are a lot of different monster types, tons of new areas, both the overworld and dungeons, and a lot of armor and weapon models. The story is a little on the weak side, but the pacing is spot on. It picks up where the first Torchlight left off, and while weak, is more than adequate to give purpose on why you&apos;re making baddies go splat. You are not locked into the easier difficulty settings when starting a new character. If you want to start off on the hardest difficulty, you can. There is offline singleplayer, you can host or join internet games as well as lan games. I can honestly say that there is nothing about this game that irks me. It&apos;s the ARPG I feel most people have been waiting to get their hands on for what seems like an eternity. All of this at a price point that is unbelievable to me. I could go on and on. This game is an incredible value. Pick this up, you will not regret it one bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2633497">Expand</a></span>

Well, I am pleased to announce that Torchlight 2 is one of those games. Many call it  &quot;spiritual successor to Diablo series&quot;, &quot;the thing that should have been Diablo 3&quot; etc. ... I call it - a classic hack &amp; slash action RPG, tailored to the needs of the gamers (not the needs of corporate publisher fatcats), with extremely appealing art style, graphics, and most magnificent orchestral soundtrack composed by none other than Matt Uelemen, the genius behind the Diablo 1 &amp; 2 soundtracks. The gameplay in this game is smooth, the audio and visuals simply flow even on older machines, and you can play the game in multiplayer, either online via matchmaker lobby or offline in LAN! Oh LAN, how we all dearly missed you :) ... anyway, you owe yourself to buy this game, because at the extraordinarily low price of 20$ I cannot imagine anyone being able not to afford it. P.S: The game must have some bad traits, but I cannot seem to find them from all the fun I&apos;m currently having :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2632238">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First of all, graphics sound style charm blablabla we&apos;ve all heard it before. So let me instead say what stuck out to me.
<br>
<br>Somehow because of my own idiocy I lost 8-9 hours of progress on an elite DW berzerker I made. I was half way thru act 2. Needless to say this was frustrating, so I had an idea.
<br>I&apos;m only allowed to show act 1-2 and everyone saw 1 from the beta, so I decided to spend my second, returning 9 hour trainride rushing 5 characters to the end of act 1.
<br>
<br>Thanks to a 3 hour train delay I succeeded. I made a lvl 21 dualzerker which rocks, a lvl 21 tankgineer which rocks, a lvl 21 embermage that demolishes elite, a lvl 21 melee 2h engineer I need to work on, and a lvl 21 bowlander that&apos;s starting to rock.
<br>
<br>Here is the important reason why the game is a ten/ten. Alone, playing single player in a train, with a malfunctioning mouse, I didn&apos;t get bored playing 5 characters through the same act. To the contrary I really enjoyed seeing my builds come to life.
<br>
<br>you think the repetition would kill you, but the randomized chunks are magic. Honestly diablo 2 has it easier I realized, because part of the reason it captivates me is because the crap graphics let my imagination fill in the blanks. In TL2 everything looks so good, that it&apos;s easy to get tired of seeing the same urns over and over. So Runic ingeniously made randomized chunks and they keep the game super fresh. I&apos;d be just starting to grumble over doing the same quest, when I&apos;d run across a little scene, nook, or area I hadn&apos;t seen before and it just seemed so wonderful and alive. Like the world evolves with my character. It&apos;s hard to describe the feeling, but it just keeps the game from getting tedious if you appreciate exploration like I do.
<br>
<br>The skills are IMO not perfect, but they will never be as we all want different things. I&apos;ll do a skill change request thread later. Some buffs I thought could have lasted 3-5 seconds longer and some tier bonuses I thought could have been more generous given the mana cost. However each skill has purpose, and if you build correctly you could make many of the active skills your main. I&apos;m going to eventually make a fire bomb embermage instead of the cliche magma spear build.
<br>
<br>The difficulties are great now. Veteran becomes legitimately challenging and elite is freaking hard though I have conquered it with one build.
<br>
<br>Mainly I have to give a lot of points because I was doubtful about how far they&apos;d come from the beta and they went over my expectations. Every single change I&apos;ve noticed from the beta not only do I approve of but appreciate. They made dual wield claw berzerkers viable, they nerfed everything that trivialized elite yet unlike some companies nerfed the skills to &quot;viable&quot; instead of &quot;useless.&quot;
<br>
<br>They are true to their word that you can become OP for moments, only to find in the next 6-8 levels that your enemies have caught back up, or even become stronger than you again.
<br>
<br>There is the sweet pain of letting go of a piece of armor that boosted your damage because you are in sore need of more survival based affixes.
<br>
<br>The act changes are also great. I won&apos;t talk about act 3, but in act 2 I felt, rightly so, that engineers and berzerkers suffered from all the slowing ice damage. Lo in behold though in act 2&apos;s desert againt physical opponents my berzerker began to thrive like no other. The acts DO feel different from eachother, and this is very good.
<br>
<br>Monsters are fantastic, I find myself thinking, &quot;oh it&apos;s one of those types. I better avoid x and do y.&quot; Like when I see basilisks I keep my distance and hit and run to avoid being snared by their gaze. When I see hordes of small minions I dive in with AOE to make sure I kill them before their fast damage kills me. Some of my classes handle projectile enemies better, some handle mages better, and some handle melee better. Each play through feels different.
<br>
<br>The item game is super sweet. I love the new affixes. Life and mana regen are helpful. The new &quot;cast on hits&quot; are cool. But specifically a lot of uniques were changed since beta. Now every class specific unique has 1-2 affixes that specifically help one or 2 builds for that class. Whenever I find a class unique I get excited and can easily imagine how to best utilize it.
<br>
<br>The boss fights were good but I am still a little dissapointed in act 1&apos;s. Act 1 feels too fast for me. You meet the wise guy for all of 2 seconds and then he becomes [spoiler]    . I was hoping to get more attached to him first.
<br>
<br>Every act felt different, the difficulty got progressively harder, the loot and randomization were utterly superb.
<br>
<br>All and all, I&apos;m going to waste my life playing this game. I&apos;m adoomgod on steam, feel free to add me, I&apos;ll help you min-max your character if you want. I enjoy all modes of difficulty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2631398">Expand</a></span>

I will most likely be playing it off and on for the next few years.  While there are some things I would prefer were different (that is what mods are for),  Here are eight things I absolutely love about it. ###1: The Loot:  Items to make a build around###
<br>I love the Torchlight 2 loot.  Sometimes it is hard to immediately tell whether an item is strictly better than another, but I find the stats easy to read and the abilities exciting.  The most impressive things is that several of the weapons are impressive enough to make me want to create builds just to use them...
<br>
<br>###2: The New Skill Tree:  Anticipating the Next Level###
<br>The updated skill system is a great change from the standard skill trees we saw at beta (and light-years ahead of TL 1).  I find myself looking forward to each level combination and striving to get the next tier bonus.  I also find myself hovering over the other skills in my character and planning out new and exciting builds as I play the game.  Even with 150 skill points, I find that there is just too much for one play through of each character.  I think Torchlight 2 may be the first game since Diablo 2 that I create character after character to try out new combinations.
<br>
<br>###3: The World:  Gameplay that Stays Fresh###
<br>Torchlight 2 has the best randomization of any 3D ARPG ever made.  In addition to randomness, there is a massive variety in the areas I go to.  About every five minutes (unless I am doing a complete full clear of one of the bigger areas), I experience a complete scenery change.  There are multiple dungeon themes and layouts for every large area and they all feel unique.  Overall I don&apos;t experience the fatigue from extended play that I get in other games.  ###4: The Monsters:  Interesting Combinations to Fight###
<br>Monsters in Torchlight 2 are interesting to fight (which is good, because the game revolves around fighting them).  For instance, one Act 2 dungeon I recently went into had the following mix of monsters Including: 1Mobile towers that spawned high damage lighting copters, 2 Walking machine gun turrets, 3 Lightning mages that casted high damage but easily dodged lightning orbs, 4 Shielded warriors that hindered me from getting to the artillery in the back, 5 A series of deadly blade traps on the ground that further limited movement.  I found myself having to dodge in and out of the room while prioritizing targets and trying to avoid getting focused by the mini-copters and artillery.  Honestly, this room felt like a gigantic puzzle in Elite Mode and I felt a serious sense of accomplishment for killing them all without dying.  This makes the game fun and made me want to keep going deeper to see what tactics the next area would require.
<br>
<br>####5: Variable Difficulty:  Neither Insulting nor Frustrating###
<br>As I get older, I am running out of patience with one-size-fits-all game content.  Many games start out so easy that they are not challenging at all and then try to compensate for that fact by tacking on some ridiculously unfair mode so that they can claim that they have something for everything.  Torchlight 2 lets me adjust my difficulty on the fly so I am always hitting my sweet spot.
<br>
<br>####6: Fluid Gameplay:  Good Enough I Barely Notice It###
<br>Targeting and skill queuing in beta were rough.  Sometimes I felt like I was wrestling against the UI more than the individual monsters.  These has been improved so much that I often find myself forgetting about gameplay and the UI altogether and just focus on the game as I play.   I think that a game has arrived when the gameplay is so smooth and transparent that it ceases to be visible.  While I still have occasional issues, I think Torchlight 2 is approaching that point.
<br>
<br>####7: Unobtrusive Lore:  Perfect for Multiple Playthroughs###
<br>ARPGs are designed to be played through multiple times.  Cut scenes and forced dialog may be great the first time, but they are eventually just a test in how fast I can hit the excape button.  Torchlight 2 does lore right.  It is there if I want it, but I can mainly ignore it if I want to also.  This is great, because I don&apos;t want to listen to the same dialog fifty times.  It is there when I want it, which is perfect.
<br>
<br>####8: In and Out Multiplayer:  A Seamless Experience###

Graphics may look crapy on a screenshot but after playing the game I appreciate it as it just fits in and contributes to the unique athmosphere of the game. Music, fast paced combat, great items, world rich in events complete the masterpiece. Playing a game is fun again! It&apos;s not going to be boring farming anymore as end game may focus on mods created by players.

This is not a Diablo wanna be, every member of the team that designed Diablo 1 and 2 left Blizzard and created Runic. Not a single person who created Diablo works for Blizzard, they just own the name. Diablo 3 is the wanna be now, it is a 100% Blizzard game. Torchlight is made by the original team. $60 for Diablo, beat it in 10 hours, just to go back through until you beat inferno, what a boring waste. This game is by far superior to Diablo 3, and its $20. Graphics are good, gameplay is smooth, 0 crashes or bugs so far. I like the talent tree system way better than Diablo. They also don&apos;t severely cripple how many skills you can use. Characters can be far more unique and not just another &quot;barbarian&quot; like Diablo 3 was. I am having way more fun with this. Too bad it won&apos;t get the publicity that Blizzard can afford to shove with their releases.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2634385">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>H&#xE2;te de retourner sur le jeu, les loots sont coh&#xE9;rents (hein Blizzard), plusieurs items de set r&#xE9;cup&#xE9;r&#xE9;s (dont un en p&#xE9;chant ^^), 1 set complet (le Runemaster), 2 uniques pour mon perso et moultes bleus, un phase portal, et un parchemin pour faire apparaitre le vendeur de set (pas encore activ&#xE9;) je suis combl&#xE9; :)
<br>
<br>Les diff&#xE9;rents boss rencontr&#xE9;s (ainsi que pas mal de pack) offrent vraiment un vrai challenge avec ce mode de difficult&#xE9;s, juste un regret sur le faite que les popos soient spammables &#xE0; volont&#xE9;s.

In five or ten years this game will still be pleasing to the eye, while other more realistic games of this era will not hold up so well. I do wish there was more to the character/pet creation and a pet skill tree would be great.</span>

This game is about the player, and having fun, and is not burdened by a childishly simple, boring, and depressing storyline that kills everything likable (like D3; I got to level 39 and just couldn&apos;t play anymore because the story is so bad I just couldn&apos;t bear to go through it all again). Blizzard makes you use their AH and designed the game around the AH instead of the player. The only point that Blizzard surpassed T2 is in the graphics (I also prefer the darker tone). I amazed that the developers got this so right, when Blizzard fumbled SO bad, in 1/6 the development time (2 years vs 12). Blizzard should hire these guys back to make the XP for D3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2635621">Expand</a></span>

In D3 i never got excited over an item, ever. But in torchlight I find one after another better armor piece. Don&apos;t get the idea that this makes your character overpowered, because it doesn&apos;t: the pacing keeps a gear check. The game play is great and the graphics are wonderful. If cartoon isn&apos;t your style then your sol. If you don&apos;t like something about the game you can mod it. (THIS DOES NOT MEAN HACKS). Runic games plan to release software to help the modding community. This hasn&apos;t been done in many large games like torchlight. So I&apos;m excited to see where this goes. All of this is only 20$. Please check this game out it is worth it no doubt.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2633232">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What TL2 does so well is it was able to address what the fans want. Runic took the customer-centric approach in designing this game and it paid off. LAN support, multiplayer support, a $20 price tag and a level editor collaboratively makes this game shine.
<br>
<br>I gave this game a 10 not because of the graphics (pretty but not great) but because its addicting and I know I will be playing this game for months. than If you buy this game,  I&apos;m pretty sure most of you will also.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2633332">Expand</a></span>

And Runic did it in a fraction of the time with a fraction of the money charging only a fraction of the retail price.
<br>
<br>My favorite thing about TL2 is how much it looks, feels, sounds, and plays like an old school Blizzard game.  I felt more nostalgic about the good old days in the first 5 minutes of TL2 than I did in my entire run of playing SC2, D3, Cata, etc COMBINED.
<br>
<br>So, thank you Blizzard North-- I mean, Runic-- for doing what you do best.  This game is a classic in the making, and it&apos;s only going to get better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2633047">Expand</a></span>

The game is absolutely huge, has tons and tons of content, and can be played offline so no more lag deaths, or lag period.</span>

I was indeed jumping for joy this week after such a long wait!
<br>
<br>Started off without looking at any materials beforehand as I wanted to save all of the surprises and there are certainly are a few. Runic has instilled a sense of wonder and excitement instead of the bland norm in other popular ARPGs.
<br>
<br>The action feels great, there is a challenge in the higher difficulties for those that need it and there is finally a sense of permanency in your choices. Have fun creating your first characters and try different things out. I know my shielded tank engineer is how I want to play and after every point invested I can see a pay-off. Slowly my character is falling into place and my enjoyment is going up as a result.
<br>
<br>This is what Diablo 2 felt like. Watching your character take shape and planning what you want them to be.
<br>
<br>However, there are a few problems. The camera angles can be blocked off with enemies sitting in the &apos;blind spot&apos;. The problems with Runic&apos;s account system (albeit this is nothing in comparison to Diablo 3&apos;s Error 37) although I must point out that you can still play single player, unlike some other games, with no internet connection.
<br>
<br>Overall, this is a triumph and a breath of fresh air. With its satisfying formula combined this with a low price, mod-ability, free updates and open multiplayer there is very little not to like. Any other bumps will be ironed out in patches very soon.
<br>
<br>Get this game. Enjoy it by yourself. Enjoy it with friends. Mod it when the tools are released. I highly recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2634012">Expand</a></span>

I am constantly being blown away by this game at ever turn. To this review off I simply must talk about the character classes and items. I have played with each class and they are each unique and fun in their own way. The skill tier system and the skills themselves are fun. One embermage passive allows you to randomly call down meteors, spawn vortexes, acid rain, firestorms, and confusion ALL WITH ONE SKILL. The item system is great and allows you to truly customize your characters. Unique items do unique things I recently found a ring that summons a floating skull that zaps enemies around me. The pet system is fantastic and keep you in the action by going back to town to sell your gear. Pets can also learn spells so mine currently summons skeletons and heals me while shooting fireballs. There are several pets to chose from and each can be transformed using fish into new monsters with new abilities.
<br>
<br>The overworld is MASSIVE, filled with tons of surprises at each turn. Random dungeons are huge and have their own bosses (boss fights are hectic and a ton of fun). The art style is unique and the dynamic day/night and weather system really add to the atmosphere. It is also important to note that the game is fully moddable so expect tons of community created content.
<br>
<br>To put it simply Runic games has created the best ARPG on the market and it doesn&apos;t even come close. You owe it to yourself to spend the $20 and enjoy the hours and hours of fun this game will provide for you and your friends (the game supports up to 6 players in one game online) the game also has an offline mode so you can play without internet.
<br>
<br>Once again: BUY THIS GAME NOW</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2632599">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s a well polished game where the loot is actually viable to use.  You are not just selling everything to the vendor but you find stuff that you can use and come up with different combinations for your characters like maybe an embermage that carries a gun and a shield or a traditional weapon like a staff or even two wands.  Simple put: the itemization in the game is enormous! There are skill trees available that offer numerous different builds.  For example, I started with an embermage and went all +Ice damage.  But then I added some fire gear and spells and now I have a completely unique spell build that just makes me want to create another embermage to try out different combinations.
<br>
<br>As far as the D3 comparisons go, this is what D3 should of been.  It makes me wonder what this team could of done if the Diablo IP was still under their control.  It&apos;s a shame on Blizzard.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless the only thing that I am not a big fan of is the art work and bright colour scheme of the game.  At first it wasn&apos;t my cup of tea per say but it actually does work well for the style of story they are presenting the customers/gamers.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s extremely well done.  The game only costs 20 bucks.  There is no Auction House or Real Money Auction House.  It is the standard for an ARPG and what a game should be.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t listen to the negative reviews.  Honestly, don&apos;t.  They are just hurt Blizzard employees or fan boys that are putting the game down.  The number of positive reviews speaks for itself.  Excellent job Runic Games!  Excellent Job!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2634544">Expand</a></span>

<br>Together, we can take a humongous collective dump on ActiBli$$ard&apos;s chest by making sure Torchlight II outsells that crappy crapfest Diablow III by leaps and bounds.

With TL2, I couldn&apos;t get through the first  five. I just couldn&apos;t find any reason, any motivation to play on. The story and characters are just nonexistent. Sure, a good ARPG doesn&apos;t have to be a Witcher-type masterpiece of a videogame novel. But TL2 takes the ordinariness and simplicity of the story and characters to the absolute extreme. Diablo 2 had a simple story and characters but they were interesting and fun. In Diablo 3 the story and characters are dumb and trite but well crafted...like a Disney movie. With TL2 I felt like playing some kind of Atari game from the 80s or something. Moreover I just for the life of me couldn&apos;t stand the infantile WoW-ish art style. I just couldn&apos;t stop feeling like I&apos;m playing my 6 years old niece&apos;s game. Sure, most games nowadays are childish to some degree but TL2&apos;s art style is just too much. I read some guys from Runic saying they chose it to stand out, to be different - well I&apos;m sure you can be different without looking completely silly. But I really loved the way this game just oozed with enthusiasm and gusto, the core gameplay mechanics was fantastic and puts stupid D3 in shame. Unlike with D3 you won&apos;t be spending weeks on empty, frustrating farming, collecting nothing but dull and boring garbage. In TL2 the loot is plentiful (maybe a bit too much), interesting and fun. The character development system is not something to be excited witless about but it gets the job done quite nicely. And most importantly - all the monsters die spectacularly and violently, bursting and exploding with satisfying meaty effects. Despite all that I can&apos;t give this game better than five stars. Unlike with most other modern games it&apos;s a great triumph of substance over style. But the end result is the same - overall averageness.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2652209">Expand</a></span>

Summary of my experience with this game in 3-player-coop (~12 hours) on veteran difficulty: Most of the time, mindlessly clicking the left mouse button works just as well if not better than spamming the screen with overlapping, unrecognizable fireworks. Don&apos;t know if my eyes get old or what, but with only 3 characters simultaneously using their skills, I  wasn&apos;t able to comprehend what was going on on the screen anymore: Total chaos and seemingly random flashing with colors that looked way too similar to me. Hats off to those who can make out where the monsters are they try to click (if theyre not HUGE) or what sparks of the fireworks are damaging them or you or are just for show. After ~3 hours we settled to 1 of us using skills, while the other 2 just used left clicks. And even then it was straining to the eyes if you wanted to follow what was going on. Thus we were rushing through the levels, on the edge between shallow instant gratification and wondering about why we waste our time with this. Torchlight 2, just like Diablo 3, feels like its trying to feed &quot;target groups&quot; instead of being something that the devs really tried to be personal and fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2649149">Expand</a></span>

Looking at my Steam history, I played the original Torchlight for a slightly embarrassing number of hours, and it seems I&apos;m headed that way with this one too. There&apos;s nothing very original about Torchlight II but Runic have consistently shown that they take pride in their work, and can actually feel the developers&apos; delight as you play this game. Their care for detail and dedication to the genre is evident throughout. For some of us that&apos;s a huge relief from big game houses that shove out shoddy ports of PS3 or XBox games with horrible DRM that comes over as an insult to their customers. Not to mention Blizzard turning Diablo 3 into a marketplace instead of a game.
<br>
<br>The game itself is the same thing as the last one, but with better graphics, larger worlds and more variety of quests, monsters and loot. And with some atmospheric music, thank goodness, to replace the desperately bland sountrack to the first Torchlight.
<br>
<br>I feel a bit silly for liking this game because there really is very little skill involved. The loot is random, to kill the monsters you just have to keep bashing, and the level ups come without too much effort. But it&apos;s so attractively done and we humans are suckers for exploring, and for repetitive activities with intermittent rewards, and I&apos;m tired of games by the big, arrogant game houses that ultimately leave you feeling insulted. This is a delightful bit of seductive, harmless fun, which is what video games really should be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2642377">Expand</a></span>

Story is lacking, but since when has anybody ever played an action-rpg/ lootfest for its story? I have only two complaints. The first is that movement is poorly done. It is nice being able to move and attack with one hand, but it&apos;s infuriating as hell when I&apos;m trying to run away from *insert unnaturaly big and scary monster here* and I accidently click on a minion, causing me to stop and attack. Shift makes your character stay still no matter what, and control makes your character move only when a target is highlighted. They need a button to overide attacking completely so I can move without worry of accidentally attacking. My second complaint are the bosses. This may just be a  personal preference, but my view is that if a boss needs minions to fight me, then he wasn&apos;t cool enough to be in the game. Every boss in this game is surrounded by minons. It pisses me off to no end when I see a vicious looking boss and think &quot;Oh man, this guy is going to rock my **** I wonder what his special power is... Oh he runs away and calls for help. That&apos;s cool...&quot; Almost every boss in this game does that. Come to think of it, there&apos;s just kind of a lacking of boss creativity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2643586">Expand</a></span>

Exploration is enjoyable and rewarded, the enemies look great and are fun to fight, and the environments are gorgeous and SO HUGE. They are filled with all sorts of secrets and mysteries to be revealed. There is always another quest or elite mob around the corner. Every second of this game has been well worth the modest $20 dollar price tag. These developers have listened to player feedback on the forums every step through the beta and the result as been a game that delivers near euphoric amounts of fun. I&apos;ll be playing this game for years to come. Can&apos;t wait for the first bit of free DLC they put out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2638741">Expand</a></span>

<br>So why did I choose a score of 9? It is the story which bothers me. While other games have some epic moments or have sudden twists the story of Torchlight 2 is just an excuse to get the player through three acts which is not that bad because everything else in the game is really well made and you soon forget about the weak story as soon as you enter the next dungeon to get more loot and experience points.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2638819">Expand</a></span>

It has so much more to offer than Diablo III. It actually has end game content with new game+, never ending REAL map randomizations, item enchantments, a real open world with a lot to explore, toooons of side quests, an awesome pet system, a better and more creative skill system similar to the past Diablo title, better champion/boss fights, better item stats, endless content with the usage of game mods to create even more content for the game such as new quests, classes, items, UI enhancements, more pets, and so on! And there is just so much more that could be talked about too! Diablo III&apos;s main problem: Boooooring! I quit after about a month after launch when I got 3 level 60s because there was nothing to do. It&apos;s so straightforward: follow the path, look for the blinking icon on the map, no adventuring, no side questing, no fun. Quit for nearly 3 months total, came back when I saw the 1.0.4 patch, played for about a week, then quit again... now I am gone for good since TL2 is out! I have no regrets about leaving Diablo III behind even though I put a lot of hours into the game. Thank you Runic Games for making the ARPG that makes perfect sense!!! I will be playing Torchlight II for a long time, and I am excited to play it every single time!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/torchlight-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2639888">Expand</a></span>
