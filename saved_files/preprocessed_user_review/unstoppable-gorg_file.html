Although it looks much different, the gameplay feels very much like Plants Vs. Zombies. If you liked PvZ I don&apos;t know how you won&apos;t like this one. I&apos;ve never been a big fan of the tower defense genre, but I loved PvZ and I love Unstoppable Gorg. Like PvZ it has a good sense of humor but the overall look is more polished with hilarious but appropriately cheesy acting and the music is outstanding (I find the Gorg King to be particularly hilarious at mime). Good replay value in the form of Challenges and Arcade mode. Instead of PvZ&apos;s seed packets you have satellites to choose from, and instead of zombies you have aliens to combat, but otherwise it&apos;s the same strategy in that you must weigh the strengths and weaknesses of your defenses against the strengths and weaknesses of their offense BEFORE the round begins, and much of your victory depends on how well you choose. Instead of the enemies coming at you linearly from the right to the left, your &quot;house&quot; is in the center of the screen and baddies come at you in random spirals. Imagine a circular PvZ playing field, but you can actually move the plants around instead of leaving them in a static position. The best way I can describe it is like circular foosball.  Foosball has you moving each man in a row at the same time. Now pretend you bent that row into a circle and spinned it around like a steering wheel to bring the maximum amount of firepower to bear on your intended target.  This evolves the gameplay just enough to make it a worthy brain-bending extension of the genre but without making it too hard for a casual game.  Like other people I too found certain aspects of it hard at first, but after all was said &amp; done I realized I never had to replay a level more than three times to beat it _and_ get 5/5 completion of each level&apos;s 5 objectives, so it turned out to be just hard enough to make you feel like you accomplished something without ever making you tear your hair out or stop having fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unstoppable-gorg/user-reviews?user_review_id=2113093">Expand</a></span>

The game can get a bit hard to beat, but somehow that doesn&apos;t annoy me. It&apos;s steamplay, so I can play it on my mac as well, which is very nice.<br><br>The videos are awesome!

It&apos;s great to see that recently there have been new titles which introduce new aspects to the already boring &quot;build and wait&quot; mechanics.<br><br>In my books Unstoppable Gorg is a 9. The main story could be a bit longer and as a PC game it could be a little bit flashier. Overlapping enemies are also sometimes a bit annoying, as a bigger creep might hide something else under it. However for me the pro&apos;s outweigh the cons. I love the presentation and the oldies sci-fi. There&apos;s also a huge amount of replayability, ensuring that even if I get bored after a long session, there&apos;s still alot to come back to. The game keeps introducing new interesting stuff as the story goes and especially the last couple of weapons are extremely fun to use.<br>I love that the game isn&apos;t too casual and offers a real challenge although it&apos;s very easy to get into.<br><br>I wish there was a multiplayer mode, like a co-op or something though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unstoppable-gorg/user-reviews?user_review_id=2109694">Expand</a></span>

Its a very neat game in some aspects: The graphics and style of the game with the 40&apos;s inspired cutscenes and general laoyt are fun. The dynamic aspect of the game is a great idea and i bet alot of people will applaud the game for just that. But well, i dont like it that much to be honest. You see i hate juggling in TDs, i hate when the game forces me to always replace towers to make it optimal for just that wave, i much more prefer to build a solid defense and watch if kill everything. The dynamic mechanic here where you move around the towers all the time is sorta like juggling, and i just feel stressed and annoyed when i have to &quot;kite&quot; an enemy with my towers. And since i dont like that part, its kinda hard to like the game since its such an major part of the game. I guess i will play thru it, but im not having as much fun as i thought i would.

Sad truth be told, if I had opportunity to play the demo first, i would never buy it, not for the full price.

Repeat until you beat... or in the case of this game, don&apos;t bother. Because it&apos;s not even worth it. The orbit gimmick is stupid and never should have left the drawing board. Forcing players to memorize sequences and deal with RNG on top of that nonsense (to say nothing of the glitches and gotchas that ruin round after round) is just lazy tower defense design and a luminary like Futuremark should be ashamed of themselves. With the gameplay removed this would be a great screensaver, but a great game it is not.
<br>
<br>I love tower defense games, but man do I hate tower defense games like Unstoppable Gorg. The music, art, and presentation are all top notch -- I especially love the bad sci-fi movietone reel feel. But the gameplay is just atrociously designed spew. Even many flash TDs and war3 maps were far better.
<br>
<br>Unstoppable Gorg isn&apos;t just a bad game, it&apos;s gameplay is actively annoying, irritating, and head shaking.

<br>
<br>The game offers you to approach each mission with the difficulty level of your choice (I rarely went beyond the first two levels, among four) ; and once you&apos;ve finished them, you are awarded medals depending on your efficiency in different fields - like Anomaly Warzone Earth does - plus Science Bonus to spend into your towers to level them up before battle.
<br>
<br>Different enemies and towers are introduced all along the storyline, so each mission feels like novel.
<br>
<br>In spite of these nice elements, the game puzzled me to the point of giving up. I expected some level of careful planning for both the tower type and placement but the later missions mostly felt like unforgiving. Any wrong choice could sentence the planet you&apos;re trying to protect to a general abduction -  even if you can reposition you towers at frantic speed.
<br>
<br>Even if I was initially enticed by the idea of orbital towers, the game felt like too hard to beat even in easy mode. Eventually this drained the potential fun out of it so I never finished it. Sadly, I cannot recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/unstoppable-gorg/user-reviews?user_review_id=4954967">Expand</a></span>
