The world is massive and open with lots of reactivity. It&apos;s filled with interesting places to see and things to do. You can do just about anything you want, in which order you want. No level scaling here, thankfully.
<br>
<br>The writing is typical of Larian with lots of smart jokes. The tactical turn based combat is much more interesting than today&apos;s hack&apos;n slash-rpg&apos;s. The elemental magic is a great system, for example cast a lightning spell towards a bunch of enemies standing in a water puddle has a chance of electrifying the puddle and stunning all the enemies. If you cast an ice-spell, you can freeze them solid etc.
<br>
<br>Coop-mode is also a welcome addition, which works great. The character creation and leveling up is deep, and allows for a customized character without being limited by class. You can have a mage wielding a greatsword, or a rogue with expertice in healing. Almost any object in the world can be lifted, used, combined and crafted. You can make potions, weapons, armour and other objects from just about anything. Wear a bucket on your head like a helmet? Sure!
<br>
<br>If you have never tried the previous Divinity-games, it&apos;s easy to write this of as a Diablo-clone based on the looks. However, this is so much better and deeper. Imagine Ultima 7 combined with Baldurs Gate 2, with 2014-technology and graphics/sound.  If you like rpg&apos;s you NEED this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4322380">Expand</a></span>

The game rewards creative players and encourage exploration which is very uncommon in modern games. Its definitely one of the best RPG in this decade taking inspiration from games like Ultima and in my opinion holds up against the classics.</span>

It&apos;s a no-nonsense classic CRPG that actually has the cojones to challenge its players. Combat is turn-based and requires strategy (it might not quite be XCOM, but it&apos;s closer to that than hack and slash-RPGs like Diablo), quests require you to pay attention and think for yourself, and if you do something really stupid, chances are you&apos;re punished with swift death. All positive things as far as I&apos;m concerned. The writing is solid, sound quality is decent, graphics are a bit cartoony but fit the game.
<br>
<br>There are some technical glitches that can occasionally be annoying, like some background chatter that gets a bit repetitive, and some items/characters can be hard to target (or easy to misclick). But that&apos;s minor nuisances at best.
<br>
<br>In the end, I think anyone who grew up playing classic CRPGs like Baldur&apos;s Gate 2, or Fallout 1, will probably also enjoy this game. Hopefully it will also find new audiences.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4326375">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m only taking a break to write this review, go to sleep, and then I&apos;m going back to the game again. It&apos;s just that addictive, especially if you enjoy isometric RPGs with a modern look. The character creation and development is detailed but accessible and not at all frustrating (thanks also to the slick user interface), the dialogue is superb (humorous and snarky), and the amount of things you can do with the environment is just crazy! Teleporting, talking to animals, setting things on fire and putting out the fire with a rain spell, freezing a surface or making it slippery, cooking food from ingredients, stacking things on top of each other or rearranging them in other ways, etc. - it&apos;s all here! That alone can take you hours, not to mention the interesting quests and character interaction. The amount and variety of loot is staggering, too. The game is very easy to get into, as it thankfully has a lot of modern conveniences like the item highlight or the global chat. I&apos;m positive that Larian has created a new RPG classic, and I hope it becomes successful enough for them to do a sequel, too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4322118">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Story-wise it is definitely a Larian game. Quirky humor and general lightheartedness give a very different experience than the traditional RPG epics do. While some may be left longing for a more serious and thought-provoking writing, most will still find the story and it&apos;s intrigue immersive enough, especially with the world constantly reacting to your actions.
<br>
<br>While Divinity: Original Sin is certainly not a game for everyone, I have high hopes that the gorgeous audiovisual trappings and accessible modern UI elements and helper systems will introduce a new generation of gamers to a more complex kind of games.
<br>
<br>For the few of us who grew up with Ultimas, this game is that rare 10/10 &quot;game of the decade&quot;. No doubt about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4320184">Expand</a></span>

<br>The answer is finally here. Here we have a game with a big world and MANY ways to interact with it. A game where it is FUN to evolve your character. A game where it is FUN to play around, not running a scripted treadmill, but exploring the environments, and approaching encounters as a way to tell your own story!
<br>
<br>The good news is that Larian have put most of their effort in to refining the engine and the underlying rule set. In the pipeline there will be a creation kit which will allow the player base to create adventures, the best thing to happen in RPG gaming since Neverwinter Nights.
<br>
<br>Larian are putting RPG gaming back on track. Let&apos;s not forget that Oblivion is also hard at work on Pillars of Eternity, and Bioware is looking to redeem itself with a (finally) worthy Dragon Age Game. Looks like 2014 maybe the year of the great RPG restoration! praise the RPG gods!

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been busy with gaming for almost 25 years now and i can safely say that this is the first time in a long while i felt the way i did since back in late 90 &apos;s.
<br>
<br>Brilliant depth of story, level of design, soundtrack and turn based combat at its best. Just perfect.
<br>
<br>Support Larian, they truly deserve it. 10/10</span>

<br>
<br>- Great interactions with the world and the characters (good randomisation in conversations, items that you can actually pick up and not just look at);
<br>- Deep customisation of your party (from visuals to stats and skills);
<br>- Lot of choices to level up your character (lots of spells, armor, weapons, skills - both passives and actives);
<br>- Spells that interact with the world around you: you can cast a rain spell and make everyone around you wet, so they become less resistant to shock spells and more resistant to fire spells; poison clouds explode in contact with fire spells, etc.
<br>
<br>Two things I did not liked so far: camera (a little clunky sometimes, requires getting used to) and te repetitiveness in conversations around you (almost every time you engage in conversation with some NPC, the others around you start talking the same thing over and over again, without stop).
<br>
<br>All things considered, this is a great RPG to play both singleplayer or with another person. Worth the time and the money!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4325835">Expand</a></span>

Yes, that&apos;s the game for nostalgic fans of isometric RPGs from the early 2000s, but it&apos;s beautiful, it&apos;s polished, optimized and absolutely gorgeous.
<br>
<br>While it is not &quot;perfect&quot; in my eyes - it&apos;s more of the Baldur&apos;s Gate reincarnation than that of the Planescape, but it features tons of monsters, quests, dialogues, jokes and battles, with very few bugs and stunning music. So for me it&apos;s 10 out of 10, a big classic-feeling fantasy role-playing game where you can be witch, rogue, ranger, mage, warrior, you pursue one big main quest while fulfilling dozens of others.
<br>
<br>Attention to details is a strong selling point here. Cats that give you quests. Manipulating the weather to actually make spells like Rain useful. Tactic options in battles. A bit of humor here and there. Exploration. Loot. Crafting, oh, need to try it more.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played it in beta, I will go and play it now, I am going to replay it after I finish and I totally recommend it to all RPG fans. I&apos;ve been following Larian games since the very first Divinity and I am very happy to see their evolution and growth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4325834">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is the most I&apos;ve been impressed by this type of game in years. It&apos;s gives me the same sort of feeling I got when I first played Baldur&apos;s Gate and Neverwinter. It&apos;s got more depth than either of those games and the sheer scope of it is amazing. This is a huge game and is as close to a pen and paper RPG as I&apos;ve ever played in a video game.
<br>
<br>The level of detail is great, the dialogue options are varied and you&apos;ve got two characters that you create yourself that can converse with each other if you wish. The levels and objects are extremely interactive, and there are a ton of spells and skills.
<br>
<br>I seriously haven&apos;t been impressed by this type of RPG since the 90&apos;s. That&apos;s saying a lot as this is probably the biggest leap forward in this type of game since then. Well worth the money and time to play and has a lot of replay value.
<br>
<br>On top of all that, there&apos;s an editor that allows players to create their own adventures. I&apos;ve only poked at it a little and haven&apos;t gotten into it yet, but it&apos;s an impressive addition to an already great game. There will be tons of replayability for this game.
<br>
<br>This is a serious contender for the best RPG of 2014 without a doubt.
<br>
<br>That said, it&apos;s not Skyrim. I&apos;m not going to say it&apos;s better or worse than Skyrim, just that it&apos;s different. It&apos;s also not Diablo despite the similar perspective. It&apos;s turn based combat with an overhead view and party management. Combat is similar to the recent X-com games in some ways. That&apos;s not for everyone. It&apos;s also a bit more involved than the Final Fantasy menu based turn based combat. However, if you&apos;re into old school top down RPGs like the top down D&amp;D games or ShadowRun, you should not miss this game. It hits every note right and is well worth playing.
<br>
<br>RPG fans should not miss this game. It&apos;s one of the best of it&apos;s type ever made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4316640">Expand</a></span>

When stories were genuine and experience were crafted with love and care.
<br>This applies to much more than the writing, and Original Sin has some damn good writing, it&apos;s turn based gameplay is easy to get into, but offers a lot of intricacies and interactions to learn and exploit, while providing a challenge to players of all skill levels.
<br>The environmental interactions and innovative co-op play put much bigger games to shame. Truly it&apos;s a wonder that a small European developer like Larian were able to make a game that dwarfs major productions from EA and the like. It just goes to show you, when you LOVE doing what you do, and don&apos;t just do it to turn a profit and support some stupid agenda, it will shine through in your work.
<br>
<br>Original Sin is a must for any cRPG fan and considering it&apos;s modern look and easy to pick up nature, I am certain that it will bring a lot of newcomers to the genre.
<br>
<br>My only gripe with it is that due to budget management or whatever, Larian weren&apos;t able to add NPC reactions to the day/night cycle and weather system, but it&apos;s such a small thing in such a massive, uniquely enjoyable game that it doesn&apos;t matter.
<br>
<br>Truly an adventure worth experiencing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4318565">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>So far a highly enjoyable if a bit buggy RPG. What is available of the game world at the moment seems vast and detailed, especially the dialogue options. Even when moving items nearby NPC&apos;s will question your actions making the whole experience feel more real than some. Many of the bugs however actually add to the games humour and the stealth is definitely the funniest thing. 10/10</span>

Original Sin a game that is engaging, challenging, fun, and lovingly crafted, with tons of detail and world reactivity.
<br>
<br>The seamless co-op makes the experience even more fun, as your partner will be able to challenge many of your decisions through separate dialogues - or distract a shopkeeper with idle chat while you might rob the store behind his back. Toss in a really easy to use editor with a huge range of options and scripting capability and you might just end up with hundreds of additional user modules like those made for Neverwinter Nights.
<br>
<br>The story is fun and interesting and serves as an excellent excuse to set the party loose upon the huge areas in search of treasure, secrets, side-quests, exploration and puzzle-solving. The writing is often light-hearted but certainly knows how to pull off dramatic moments - a pleasant change from loads of the recent &quot;grimdark&quot; stories.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s combat mechanics are just as great - it&apos;s possible to spill oil on the ground to make ground slippery, set it on fire, put the fire out with water, turn the water into an electrocuting deathtrap and then boil out the water with a fireball to turn it into a wall of fog - or freeze it to have everything entering it slip and fall. Melee and bow-based combat is also full of various options, and the classless system permits mixing up skills in any way you&apos;ll like. There&apos;s even a skill that lets you talk to animals. And a spell that lets you throw people off a cliff.
<br>
<br>The game is also very pleasing graphically, everything is distinct, stylized and detailed - and the music is fantastic. Connecting for co-op is easy and quick enough, though the initial loading time may be a little lengthy.
<br>
<br>Overall, having followed Original Sin&apos;s development closely, I can&apos;t say it&apos;s a &quot;pleasant surprise&quot; - it&apos;s the solid dream game that the developers have envisioned, worked on, collected feedback on, and finally delivered. Fantastic and inspirational work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4321075">Expand</a></span>

<br>Age 40 and played to death all the CRPG/RPG classics. This is as close to Planescape I&apos;ve ever seen. A few hours in and regret missing Larian&apos;s Kickstarter. I&apos;d have loved to have played the A/B versions and watch this classic evolve.
<br>
<br>A damn fine game for anyone who loves to stretch their brain and click and test and die and laugh just like back in the day.
<br>It&apos;s a game that that demands you think and forces you to try various battle approaches as you progress due to it&apos;s balancing. The battles count. It&apos;s not an XP hunt.
<br>
<br>After a wonderfully hand drawn intro sequence we&apos;re shown an Old School 2D isometric view with up to date visuals and given a brief explanation of you and your companions arrival at a beach. Then, with voice acting and dialogue from 90% of characters being worthy of any past or present classic HBO series, both characters you have created (Yup, you you create two characters of your choice and control them both, or play the whole game in Co-Op with a friend), you argue and lie and attack and trick and each other as well as NPC&apos;s.....if you want them to. My two characters currently hate each other and bicker all the time and always start a fight. Typical Battlemages.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s freedom of creation. But you can also go solo with MASSIVE stat boosts if you want, but I&apos;ll do that on the second run me thinks. As the game will clock in around 100 hours, that&apos;s 200 hours of constant gameplay for &#xA3;30, or 15p per hour.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s also a magnificent story telling opportunity for millions of budding scriptwriters to create their own quests via the extensive Mod Toolkit included to add to the already interesting and challenging storyline quests.
<br>I&apos;ll be doing one based on a story from years back if we&apos;re able to destroy parts of the environment throughout. We shall see.....
<br>
<br>Not everyone will get this, but Quicksave is king again.
<br>That moment when the enemy appear on screen and you Quicksave...crap, forgot to check that new unidentified thing...then you&apos;re half way through a battle aaaaaaaand your dead. F8. Right.... It&apos;s a huge one use fire bomb. Cool......I&apos;ll attack THAT Demon first then!
<br>I really miss this it in games. And talking to chickens.
<br>
<br>I hope the modding community blow our socks off with their tweaks, stories and Dungeons full of the Shiny Shiny to keep us enjoying this exceptional roll based CRPG. An instant Classic.
<br>Best &#xA3;30 I&apos;ve spent on a game in a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4327592">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The time detail and attention that has gone into this game is amazing it puts to shame the pretty but sadly mass produced rpgs we have be fed the last few years.</span>

It has all the virtues of this RPG classics combined with SUPERB graphics, voice acting (not 100% of course), modern handing and a great UI. Even ppl that didnt know tactical and deep RPG&#xB4;s should give it a try!</span>

The combat is beautiful, all the skills are so varied and amazing to use. The customization is intense. You can just pick and choose whatever you want. Want to start out with a fire mage/ranger? Sure! Witchcraft/Rogue/Water mage? Why not? The only thing I have to say negative is it is a bit glitchy and buggy, and the way to get skills is a bit annoying, buying the skillbooks from merchants. Also wish the 2 other companions were in the game currently, but there are tons of henchmen of all different classes. This is a party game mostly, you control at least 2-4 members. Highly recommended, you will be totally immersed and won&apos;t have your hand held at all!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4326040">Expand</a></span>

<br>Think a game like ultima 7 done today with modern graphics and humor and much better tactical combat.Theres an incredible attention to details, and although  they ran out of time and couldnt a ddd everything they wanted to , its very polished and full of surprises.
<br>Cant go wrong with this one seriously, if they arent getting 90+ all over the place its because its a small studio who cant bribe like AAA publishers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4322830">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The world of Cyseal is large and diverse, built on top of years and years of Divinity lore. We get to combine items (sometimes in the most hilarious ways), actually role-play PCs (for instance, the dialog let&apos;s you take on different perspectives), wield elements and make them work together (water + lightning = pain ^^)... The list goes on.
<br>
<br>Tactical combat is a nice addition, one that I craved for quite some time now. Worth mentioning is the music, composed by veteran musician and metalhead for life (XD), Kirill Pokrovsky. The man has experience and it shows! Also, throughout the game you&apos;ll be accompanied by Larian&apos;s own trademark humor, which more often than not hits all the right notes.
<br>
<br>The one thing Larian needs to do now is to work on the bugs - but that&apos;s why betas exist. Recent feedback from Larian shows they are putting a lot of effort into dealing with problems and I have no doubts they will succeed.
<br>
<br>All in all, I heartily recommend buying and playing D:OS!
<br>
<br>P.S.: user Joebreeze690 commented in his review that &quot;[i]f you enjoyed Dragon Age, you&apos;ll be as disappointed as I was.&quot; I don&apos;t get this sentence. What has my enjoyment of Dragon Age to do with how I enjoy D:OS? You could as well write &quot;If you enjoyed Metroid: Fusion...&quot; or any other game. Fact is that Dragon Age, while still being an RPG, falls into a very different basket than D:OS. If we&apos;re really going to compare D:OS to other games, than I&apos;d say it&apos;s a lot closer to Ultima series; a spiritual successor, if you will. And for the record, I liked the first DA ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4133172">Expand</a></span>

The game is awesome, and deserve all the praise it&apos;s getting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4327230">Expand</a></span>

<br>Sure it has its limitation, like the game is not fully voiced, the animations/graphics arent top notch, the UI could use a little work and there are a few bugs, but i can look over all of those things and still give a perfect score, why?
<br>Because the game excedes in everything else it tries to do, it is so much like old schools RPGs ,like baldur&apos;s gate and the original Neverwinter nights. This style of game is missed by many, unforturnally bioware doesnt make like this since anymore, The last one was Dragon age: Origins.
<br>
<br>A few noteworthy featues:
<br>
<br>-A lot of exploration
<br>-Tons of dialogs with randoms NPCs,
<br>-Side quests, just in the first town there are already so much to do, that sometimes you forget the main quest.
<br>-The combat system is great, turn based done right
<br>-Two main characters which is something different, great when you are playing Coop
<br>-Party system, with interaction with companions Bioware style
<br>-Map/mod creator, if you played Neverwinter Nights back in the day, you remember how important that is. Endless possibilitys there.
<br>-Good character creator system(it is not as complex as D&amp;D but it is good enought)
<br>-
<br>
<br>In conclusion, if you are looking for a true RPG experience this is THE game to play right now, if you are looking for another AAA &quot;Action RPG&quot; that are all about combat and quick reward, stay away from this one</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4326870">Expand</a></span>

<br>Lots to do and explore, great deep crafting, quirky sense of humour.

<br>Really DOES feel a bit like Ultima 7 (Yes, I&apos;m old...) but that&apos;s a good thing.

Some of the graphics are ripped straight from the contents of that game. You can just move the camera now to different zoom levels above the default zoomed in view; which is important in the turn-based battles.
<br>
<br>Archetypes have progressed from Warrior, Wizard, Ranger to a whole host of options. You can still mix and match everything to match your playstyle. If you want to be a bow-wielding ranger with water (healing) magic and dabble in picking pockets, go right ahead. You&apos;re only limited by the number of skill points you get in the game. You start out with 5 at character creation and then 1/level to 5, 2/to 10 and then 3/level to the cap of 20, IIRC.
<br>
<br>Loot will sometimes contain skill raising modifiers, so you might find bracers that give +1 to your bow skill or boots that raise your barter skill, etc. Loot is randomly generated on opening a chest or clicking a corpse. There are common, rare, legendary, etc. types of ranges for loot descriptions. Basically white loot has no modifiers, just a character or attribute level to equip. Say a magic staff requires 8 Intelligence, for example. Blue has one modifier, green two or three, orange four or five and there is also some unique gear that is always the same from game to game.
<br>
<br>Crafting is in and you can craft hundreds of items. Much of it is unnecessary, but several recipes are vital to your success. If you want to craft metal items, you&apos;ll need some blacksmithing too. You can craft scrolls, spellbooks, armor, weapons, rings, food, and weapons and that&apos;s not all. If you have an archer, you might make him your crafter as special arrows are rare and expensive, so crafting your own will limit your out of pocket. Crafting ingredients are common loot.
<br>
<br>The economy is broken as in most loot-focused crpgs. You&apos;ll have 100,000 gold by the end of the demo area. You&apos;ll be able to buy anything you want before leaving the first town and merchants have cheap stuff that isn&apos;t worth buying, with skillbooks being the exception.
<br>
<br>There is no resting but there is also no mana so spells to restore health are free outside of combat and potions are extremely common. There are potions that raise stats temporarily, but they&apos;re useless and can be sold. You might keep potions that give resistance to fire, poison, etc because of terrain.
<br>
<br>Combat is turn-based and is very much about controlling the battlefield. Nearly every combat will have environmental hazards that you can use to your advantage and so can the enemy. If you&apos;re standing next to a barrel of oil when a fireball goes off, you&apos;re going to burn for several rounds. Lightning that hits blood or water will elecrtify the whole area where it is located causing little damage after the initial hit but potentially stunning everyone for multiple rounds. If you have two mages, having one cast rain and the next throw lightning or a freeze spell; this can eliminate the toughest creature(s) in a fight. They&apos;re stunned or frozen and won&apos;t be able to do anything on their turn. This isn&apos;t Blackguards level of planning, but you don&apos;t just go in willy-nilly.

The depth of this game is unparalleled - there are so many secrets and areas to find and explore, the quests are interesting and varied and the combat is challenging. While I was skeptical about turn-based combat at first, I am now really enjoying it. Each encounter is a challenge, with your party often going in outnumbered. Using the elements together (e.g. burning patches of oil or poison, or freezing water to make ice which characters will slip on) is intuitive and adds a great layer of tactics and positioning to the fights which would be impossible in a game with real time combat.
<br>
<br>Coop is also great fun - I have been playing through with a friend for around 20 hours as of this review, and have only just left the area surrounding the first town. The rock, paper, scissors minigame for arguing with your partner is a little clunky, but that is a minor complaint. The powerful editor which comes with the game, and is the same one used by the developers themselves, will hopefully give the game long-term appeal, and I&apos;m looking forward to seeing what custom made adventures people will come up with.
<br>
<br>All in all, if you are a fan of old-school RPGs, or RPGs in general, definitely give this game a go. It&apos;s the best &#xA3;25 I&apos;ve spent in a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4327429">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Divinity: Original Sin, is throwback to the golden era of the cRPG.  The age before Diablo&apos;s success spawned a new type of RPG with the most important element removed or given a back seat - THE STORY!  Not to mention a watered down version of RPG combat - the button mash.
<br>
<br>This game is nostalgic.  It leaves me with a good feeling just thinking about returning to the game, and experiencing it with the attention and thought that it was designed for.  There is great attention to detail, the writing is excellent and humor a fun diversion,  and the combat forces you to think instead of like pointing at a group of monsters and clicking them to death.
<br>
<br>This is what a real RPG game is all about!  Great job guys!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4328814">Expand</a></span>

Of course most of that is due to the fact that there aren&apos;t many anymore - unless you count the Japanese ones like Pokemon, which I don&apos;t enjoy.
<br>
<br>So, yes, the combat is fairly simple to get a hang of, but also very challenging. You have to have a strategy to succeed, but you do have the option to flee if things get too hairy. For me, the combat is the best part of the game - which is unusual because I don&apos;t normally enjoy combat. I guess it&apos;s because each encounter feels unique and because there&apos;s a variety of different enemies that require unique strategies to overcome. There are also a bunch of different classes and you can mix and match the skills to make your own blend of character - a fireball throwing thief for example.
<br>
<br>The magic system is awesome btw. You can light oil on fire, create a rainstorm to put it own, then electrify the water puddles to stun enemies, freeze the water to make them slip etc. Really creates some interesting situations. Mages aren&apos;t the only ones who can do this either. Archers can shoot flame, water, poison, ice etc arrows.
<br>
<br>Something to keep in mind though: this game was made on a tight budget compared to most modern releases. A lot of it of it is voiced, but most of it isn&apos;t. It&apos;s more like classic RPGs like Bauldur&apos;s Gate in terms of dialog. Don&apos;t expect Mass Effect cutscenes etc. Also, not a lot of options for character customization. There are some though and I&apos;m sure mods will add more. (Did I mention mods? It comes with the editor the used to make the game and it looks pretty nifty - though I haven&apos;t had the chance to play with it much.) The devs might make some additions too. They&apos;ve been updating it frequently and fixes every little bug that&apos;s cropped up.
<br>
<br>Back to dialog: there are dialog tree and some conversation skills. There&apos;s also a conversation mini-game for arguments that I don&apos;t enjoy too much, but it&apos;s tolerable as it is determined by stats as well as luck. It was probably included to solve disputes when you play multiplayer co-op - which, I haven&apos;t played, but most seem to enjoy it.
<br>
<br>The story is decent - same the universe and all that, but it does seem to be somewhat non-linear - as in it makes room for you to do things in an odd order should you choose. There are a few memorable characters and some unexpected plot twists etc. A lot of content too. The game is actually way longer than I expected. A ton of side quests as well.
<br>
<br>On the whole you can really tell the devs put their hearts into this and that&apos;s a rare thing too these days. 10/10. Great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4326646">Expand</a></span>

Pros: 1. Classical isomatric view with authentic art direction and neat graphic.
2. Depth in story, puzzle and mystery, the 1st murder case is complex and can be solved in multiple ways. A lot of intriguing side quests.

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve sinked 15 hours for early beta, and the final version is already a quite polished game since then.
<br>
<br>Pros: 1. Classical isomatric view with authentic art direction and neat graphic.
<br>2. Depth in story, puzzle and mystery, the 1st murder case is complex and can be solved in multiple ways. A lot of intriguing side quests.
<br>3. classic and smooth turn based combat using action points. Smart use of elemental magic that counters each other e.g. electrocute enemies if they stand on water, use ice or rain to put out fire.
<br>4. rich in loot, random status of loot, and a ton of ingredients.
<br>5. attention to detail, variety of skills to use, complex but not complicated, similar to fallout 1,2.
<br>6. Online COOP for the campaign!
<br>
<br>Cons: 1. still some bugs, such as by-stand NPC repeating just 1 dialog over and over while you are concentrating to read thru a real conversation.
<br>2. no dialog voice over (due to small budget)
<br>3. just 1 skill point after level up is not really useful after high level, because you need to save up more points for specialization. This is quite redundant.
<br>4. the quests can be very difficult and sometimes misleading with the clues, you might lose your orientation, I am afraid in later stages the quest gets overwhelming and some players just drop out of the game.
<br>
<br>Conclusion, if you enjoys BG1,2 fallout 1,2 you would love this game. totally worth the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4325729">Expand</a></span>

As you play new depths to the game are revealed. It&apos;s one of those games where not everything can be mentioned because there is just so much game. The first map alone can take 37 hours to complete then you still have 3 more big maps plus 6 smaller maps and that doesnt include dungeons. Combat is fun but challenging, interactivity with the world is incredible.

<br>More patches with new content is also coming. Comes with a mod kit (which is actually simple to use), so expect some crazy mods in the future on steamworks. Well done Larian you surpassed my expectations.

At first you may be put off but then you realize you have to think through what you are doing instead of smashing buttons as fast as you can.  This opens up a lot more enjoyment for the game.

Goes without saying that the game has a few minor bugs or loading issues, because as a matter of fact the game despite alfa and beta was RUSHED(they just couldn&apos;t postpone any longer). Larian on its part is working only on fixing those bugs for the moment, it doesn&apos;t have other open projects and the constant updating, although for some tedious, shows that they are doing their best to fix whatever needs fixing. The game is not completely voiced and for people used to full-voiced games and very few books that can be a drag immersion-wise; the lack of full voicing was due to the fact that the game was expanded till the last minute before release, and since the voicing is the last part of the game-making any further voicing would have delayed the game release by a huge deal. Around 25% of the musics comes from old Larian games and half of the remaining was not specifically made for the game. This happened cause the author fell ill during the production and it was thought best to maintain unity rather than hire somebody else. Since most of the low rate reviews was on these issues I thought I might shed some light on the matter, Larian isn&apos;t a big-time production house, 1/4 of their founding came from kickstarters while the rest was a huge leap of faith on their part, a make it or break it kind of effort if you will. They took a small sector game(in the last years) such as cRPGs and jumped through hoops to make it as main-stream as they could, single-handedly taking the genre forward about 10 years. It is not a casual gamer kind of game, it forces you to read often more than most are willing to do, and it&apos;s not completely polished. Some said that the graphic is good and as a matter of fact it is, although the textures are often low quality, they did a lot of managing with the money and time they had and they achieved what they strived for, the game has an overall good feeling with as little as possible. D:OS doesn&apos;t deserve a 10 because it&apos;s the pinnacle of RPGs or because it showed a new way of doing things. It deserves the maximum score because it took an old formula left on the shelf for too long and without aid managed to make it viable in the year 2014.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll leave you with a few numbers to make you understand why D:OS and Larian deserve 10/10 on this game:
<br>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim: production costs 85 million dollars.
<br>And although i have no numbers on the dragon age games one thing is for sure, their costs were well above 20 million dollars(i am keeping myself tight here)
<br>The witcher 2 10 million dollars(which was considered an insanely tight budget for the end result)
<br>Larian scraped up 3 million dollars plus 1 million of kickstarter during production for a total of 4 million dollars.
<br>
<br>They really outdid themselves with what they had, therefore this game sets a standard of quality for small houses and in my opinion the hiccups here and there can be forgiven. The 10 is not only for the game per-se that would still deserve a 9 as it is now but for how much was made with what little they had, I can but hope they&apos;ll make a **** of sales because I can&apos;t wait for their next game and I seriously hope the budget is gonna be less of an issue next time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4329326">Expand</a></span>

The game is brilliant, it has everything I&apos;ve always hoped for in an RPG and its the first game to achieve that. Even if &apos;all&apos; the parts doesn&apos;t live up to their full potential, the fact that it has -all- the parts is enough that this game stands not just on its own merit, but lifts the bar for other RPG&apos;s to follow!</span>

<br>
<br>When i started playing game just sucked me into beautiful world and interesting stories. Turn based combat is fun, smooth, challenging and amount of diversity in character creating offers many interesting builds to play with.
<br>
<br>Many thanks to Larian for what is till now a really awesome game! Needless to say it will most likely take place as my best RPG of 2014.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4328394">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Game is funny, full of exploration surprises, RPG elements realy interesting but not boring, combat is turned based but surprisingly fast and fun.
<br>
<br>I do believe that most (if not all) people complaining of negative ratings on this game must either have terribly optimized PC software/hardware or realy hate true RPGs not feeling them &quot;action&quot; enough.
<br>
<br>This game does not hand-hold you telling everytime where to go. There is no skyrim-like button you can press to know to way to go nor a mapmarker to tell you where to go next. There is no giant popups on screen telling you that an NPC wants to give you a quest on the next corner nor a glowing UI telling there is an object that needs to be picked up. Everything is done by exploring, conversating with NPCs, having &quot;feelings&quot; and &quot;suspicious&quot; that something is strange there and investigate.
<br>
<br>If you are used to games like diablo3 that is loot, loot, loot, kill, kill, kill, you will be disapointed with this game, it&apos;s more like older games that realy rewarded you for being inteligent, inquisitive, explorer and curious. In a sense it&apos;s not an interactive movie, but a treasure-finding game in every corner.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, this latest gamming generation of people is more about easy and quick satisfaction instead of working towards a hidden goal that needs to use the brain, so probably you will find a lot of negative people saying that its &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;non-intuitive&quot; or &quot;no quest markers, zomg!&quot; or &quot;no full voice textz, i need to readz, it&apos;s so 10 years ago, zomgz!&quot;.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t play this game as an easy hack-n-slash expecting to end the game in 10 hours and get over with it, this is a game that will probably take you over 40hours if you are new to the (real)RPG elements and if you enjoy exploring and experiencing most of the hidden stuff.
<br>
<br>Also, there is the toolkit for the game engine that the developer released with the game, basically meaning that fans can build free content, mods that will probably change anything you might not fully enjoy in the game, etc. At the launch price with all this stuff, it&apos;s a given good value.
<br>
<br>As of now, i&apos;m over 10 hours in the game, but i keep going back to see if i missed some corner unexplored and i still have some quests i&apos;, not sure how to proceed, but i&apos;m folowing &quot;gut-feelings&quot; of where they might be.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: For an RPGer, i believe this is probably the best game launched in the last 10 years, probably only Dragon Age: Origins might be close behind.
<br>For a non-RPGer, it&apos;s harder to predict if you&apos;ll like it. You might love it, you might not. But if you have cash i highly recomend you try it because it&apos;s a potential &quot;life-remembering&quot; game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4328546">Expand</a></span>

Environmental interactions: Best I&apos;ve ever seen. Water+lightning, fire+poison, water+ice, water+fire, lightning+blood, etc.; the way they interact is very fun, and makes the battles interesting, though cluttered at times (especially as the smoke created by your fire magic obstructs line of sight to your targets).
<br>
<br>Character customization is alright, but between 2-4 characters you can experience everything the game has to offer. Not very deep. Some talents are very fun, but most are extremely boring. Also no appearence customization.
<br>
<br>RPG elements are honestly very poor. The dialogue is weak; quirky, but the humor falls flat a lot of the time. Never sure if I&apos;m supposed to take what&apos;s happening seriously or as a joke; it&apos;s played straight and not over-the-top enough that it could go either way. In either case, I didn&apos;t find it especially funny or interesting, but that may be because of my personality.
<br>
<br>Game reacts very poorly to player actions. For example: Two guards attack you at the start: You can murder them and nobody cares. You can&apos;t tell the guard captain about what happened. Another example: You can find physical evidence as to the identify and actions of the early-game antagonist is by exploring, but you can&apos;t tell anybody about what you know (despite even having his journal in hand) because that&apos;s not a part of the quest. Another example: After you complete the first zone, nobody cares. Guard captain still calls you an obnoxious **** who&apos;s only there to get in his way, people of the city act if it&apos;s still in danger, etc. Many more examples, too many to list.
<br>
<br>Quest system is very bad. After the first zone, you get no clues about where to go. &quot;Find the white witch&quot;; white witch&apos;s cabin is protected by a force field. Remove it. How? Never explained, nobody knows. Hope you like exploring and have a character with high perception to detect the hidden main story quest items, or are happy with googling the solution. Not only example of this problem, but I&apos;m trying to be succinct.
<br>
<br>Puzzles: Very annoying. One puzzle, looks like you can throw your teleporting pyramid over a chasm, but you can&apos;t because there&apos;s an invisible wall there. Next room: the solution to the puzzle is to throw your teleporter pyramid across a chasm identical to the situation that was impossible just a few minutes ago. Many other examples of this: The rules of what&apos;s possible and what isn&apos;t change arbitrarily; are inconsistent. You cannot deduce the solution to a puzzle a lot of the time, it&apos;s just trial and failure, or pixelhunting. More frustrating than satisfying.
<br>
<br>Companion NPCs are nonexistant. Only two in game, other are voiceless henchmen.
<br>
<br>Other things... no day/night cycle. Camera is not very good. Can&apos;t zoom out far enough, gets stuck at strange zoom levels, foreground elements (like trees, big rocks, foliage, etc.) constantly obstruct vision. Dents in the terrain often impact camera strangely.
<br>
<br>Interface is overall poor. Many important features hidden with tiny icons; not designed for big monitors and high resolutions. Did not even know about &quot;delay turn&quot; button until someone told me.
<br>
<br>Skill bar: Too small. 10 skills, 3 bars, must be cycled through (with no hotkey) by clicking tiny arrows next to the bar. Very irritating; you will end up with 50+ skills on your mages, making you constantly click the tiny buttons or just opening your spellbook to cast them from there.
<br>
<br>Combat complaint: You need to click models to target them. Models continue playing idle animations in combat. Sometimes they will be obstructed by aforementioned doodads. Situation: You mouse-over your target. You wait 2 seconds to be 100% sure you can click it. You click. The model played its idle animation, which (somehow...) made its center of mass no longer act as a point it could be selected at. Your character spends action points walking up to the enemy instead of attacking it. Extremely irritating.
<br>
<br>Inventory management is cluttered; too much crap to pick up, which can&apos;t be ignore because some of the crap you pick up will be vital to have on-hand to solve puzzles - you can end up with 100 items in your inventory, often making it a nightmare to navigate until you can go through every single item and rule them out as important then get rid of them.
<br>
<br>ARPG/Diablo-style, but with no &quot;smart loot&quot;. You will probably not remember a single item in this game. You will not care. 99.9% of it is vendor trash. Vendors sell random loot, including random skill books required to learn skills, and only reset their inventory when your main character levels up. If unlucky, you may never get access to many of the skills in the game.
<br>
<br>TLDR: Combat is very good, most other aspects are alright but need a lot of polish, RPG aspects are very poor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4340392">Expand</a></span>

It has so much depth that the first town alone takes about 20 hrs if you want to complete that town area. People are quick to groan at Divinity Original Sin being a turn based RPG but my god the turn based in this game is fun and well in depth. You can experiment like drowsing enemies in water and then using electricity to electrocute them, so using elements plays a big role in the game.
<br>
<br>As for creating your character, you can customize their looks and also selects their stats and skills. On skill PetPal let&apos;s you talk to animals which will give you hints on your mission and also help you find hidden items.  The music in the game is incredible, very different from your usual RPG music, does not sound generic, really stands out.
<br>
<br>Story is not your usual generic &quot;must safe the world&quot; or &quot;you are the chosen one!&quot; type story, it starts off as a murder mystery which you are trying to solve. It&apos;s not all what it seems and it starts to build up throughout the game.
<br>
<br>As for length of the game, it&apos;s a very long game because of how much depth it has. First town alone can take 20 hours to complete and there&apos;s another town that takes that same amount, there are also other smaller towns so overall it&apos;s easily a 50+ hour RPG game.
<br>
<br>Having played Dark Souls 2, South Park: Stick of Truth and Shadowrun: Dragonfall, I gotta say Divinity Original Sin outshines every single of those games. And that is saying a lot because those were good to great games too.But Divinity: Original Sin really outdoes it with it&apos;s content and exploration, non of those games can match it in that regard. Do yourself a favor and get this game, you won&apos;t regret it.
<br>
<br>BTW You can play it with co-op online if you want. It surprising works very well, the host of the game is the one who saves the game and can continue to play it without the co-op partner if he/she isn&apos;t available. The co-op partner can drop in/out at anytime. When someone is in battle the partner if he/she is in another place the game doesn&apos;t pause, he/she can continue exploring the world, even getting into their own battles etc, so each person is free to do whatever they want without restrictions.
<br>
<br>While the game has some technical issues they have been continuing fixed by the developer on a daily basis. Other devs it would have taken weeks, so expect this game to have great support from Larian (dev).
<br>
<br>Giving it a 10 because it&apos;s one of those games that hasn&apos;t been made in years and it far exceeded my expectations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4327983">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Played solo this game is the best RPG we&apos;ve had in years. And then on top of that you can add the fun of playing it co-op with a friend.
<br>
<br>You can argue or agree with your friends over moral dilemmas either in real life or with the game persuasion system.
<br>You can let your friend empty the pocket of every merchants in town while you talk your way through a quest.
<br>You can think together to the best way to handle a battle.
<br>Or simply laugh together at silly dialogues, unexpected result of world interaction - &quot;Oh **** there was a small puddle of water on the ground&quot; - and marvel at the sheer amount of stuff to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4328512">Expand</a></span>

This game does not deserve a 0/10 and it certainly does not deserve a 10/10 either. Divinity: Original Sin is an homage to the top-down RPG&apos;s of old, taking major hints from the Bioware hits Baldur&apos;s Gate and Neverwinter Nights. But does it really measure up? If you ask me, it comes damn close but misses by a thread&apos;s hair.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s break it down:
<br>
<br>Maps. The maps are huge and there is no loading in between interior and exterior environs. The graphics, for this type of game, are great. Probably the best I have personally seen in this genre. They don&apos;t just look good, but they&apos;re really well designed as well. The terrain has a natural flow to it, it&apos;s up and down, not just flat surfaces like you would find in the previously mentioned RPG&apos;s.
<br>
<br>Music. Is great. It&apos;s thematic, it of high quality and all around just works. The sound effects are likewise done well.  That&apos;s all I really have to say about that.
<br>
<br>Story? Well, let&apos;s just say the story isn&apos;t winning any points in originality, the setting itself is your standard high fantasy fair. It actually sort of reminds me of the &quot;rift&quot; universe. In aesthetics, design and theme. As suggested by the title of the game there are underlying religious tones (it&apos;s got the typical Tolkien inspired &quot;good vs ultimate evil&quot; story) though I am not far enough in the game yet to make a real judgement.
<br>
<br>The writing is good, GOOD. But the game is not winning a Pulitzer (or even a Hugo). Dialogue is generally well written, if a little clich&#xE9;d. It&apos;s more or less what you&apos;d expect to find in a fantasy themed MMO (yes I realize this game is not an MMO, I&apos;m just comparing the dialogue). There are only voice-effects for ambient dialogue, entering into a conversation is text only, so I hope you like reading (luckily, I do!) or mashing &quot;1&quot; to get through the dialogue options as quickly as possible. Exploration is highly encouraged and rewarded, in both items and experience. Seeking out every lonely corner of the map to search for treasure and baddies to kill is a must if you want to find the gear to outfit your party.
<br>
<br>Gameplay - Generally, aside from a few nit picks, the game play  is decent. It doesn&apos;t really contain anything I haven&apos;t seen done (better, in some cases) in other games  but it&apos;s solid and pretty fun. The only real downside is the excessive &quot;difficulty&quot; and I put difficulty in quotations for a reason. It&apos;s difficulty stems largely from the fact that you are always at a disadvantage, and usually, it&apos;s an artificial disadvantage. Certainly the AI does not seem to have the same limits on action points and thus each &quot;unit&quot; tends to be capable of doing more / turn than your party. But generally the fights are exciting and you never really know which way they will go. There were many times I thought I had a fight in the bag only to be thwarted by having my healer focus fired and decimated. The AI doesn&apos;t seem fabulous, but it&apos;s not riding the short bus either (*cough* Rome2 *cough*).
<br>
<br>The game tries to develop relations between characters (a la Dragon Age), however, none of the characters - That I have found - really have much of a character and those that do are stunningly simplistic. The only real PC I have come across that seems to have much in the way of a personality is the Warrior Madora.... Who only stands out because of the illogical and excessive bigotry this character seems to have towards anything and everything for reasons that are so far completely unexplained. The party social interactions sort of miss the mark, in my opinion. Dragon Age was such that the characters were fully developed, each had their own idiosyncrasies and  background you could delve into through conversation. Personally, I grew attached to certain characters in Dragon Age and hate others. Dragon Age, in my opinion, was a break through in player immersion. The social/romance options and the fallout that came from them were, in a way, revolutionary. This was definitely helped by the fact that, true to Bioware standard, every line was voiced. You could hear the passion (or lackthereof), the cynicism and positivity of the characters according to their personalities. Divinity tries to accomplish this in various ways but falls disappointingly short. Anyone like me, who will take immersion over gameplay will feel this aspect of Divinity is a little lacking.
<br>
<br>Given that this is by an indie studio, however, this is perfectly understandable. They obviously don&apos;t have the resources of Bioware.
<br>
<br>Overall?
<br>
<br>I&apos;d recommend this game to any fans of NWN / BG. It&apos;s good, it&apos;s fun, it has a lot going for it... But it&apos;s not the epic perfection that the Metacritic reviews make it out to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4330742">Expand</a></span>

<br>It draws heavily from old masterpieces like Ultima or the Baldur&apos;s Gate serie, giving the player a world to explore and enjoy. It feels like a real, living world and there are a lot of quests and stories all around, dozens of things to do, from crafting to fighting to investigating a murder and so on, all interspersed with excellent dialogues and a nice enough backstory: you could spend hours just exploring and talking to NPCs and you&apos;ll always want more.
<br>It&apos;s a party based RPG, you&apos;ll make two characters - and can recruit two more or play coop with a friend - and they could have different personalities based on your liking, so they can end up bickering and bantering all throughout the game.
<br>The combat is awesome, very tactic, hard but not frustrating with a clever use of magic combinations which can turn the tide of a difficult fight.
<br>The classes are very customizable, you can decide to take every single skill or abilty with any character, leading to a very open game experience.
<br>Technically, it&apos;s good but not something jaw-dropping. The engine is light and runs well even on old computers, the graphics are good, clean and easy readable and the magic effects are appropriate but not too uselessly flashy so you rarely get confused in the action. The music is also good and it never gets annoying.
<br>
<br>The flaws:
<br>I really feel the need for a &quot;undo&quot; button, even if there&apos;s the problem that it could be abused (but you can also abuse save/load and the fleeing mechanic, so...). Too often I click on an enemy and get a misclick, moving my character where I don&apos;t want him to go. Also, finding the right spot for backstabbing is a tremendous pain.
<br>Another useful thing would have been more keybinds... the classic shift+1,+2,+3 for the quickbars and one for trading with the npcs... I would have mapped many more things.
<br>I don&apos;t really like the random loot. It&apos;s silly in a game with predefined encounters and no respawning enemies.
<br>Sometimes it&apos;s very slow. The wait times on save/quicksave/load/transition van be insanely long.
<br>Also I personally detest the rock/paper/scissor... it&apos;s a terrible way to handle the arguments and kills immersion (also it always looks like the PC is cheating which - true or false - it&apos;s annoying).
<br>And, more than everything, a full world like in the Ultima games would have been fantastic, instead of a series of maps like it is.
<br>
<br>But those are just minor flaws, and all in all, it&apos;s undoubtedly one of the best RPGs of the last years: it&apos;s an awesome game that is making hard to turn off my PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4332576">Expand</a></span>

<br>It does feel like an updated Baldur&apos;s Gate which has been missing in today&apos;s gaming genre, but this game is hardly the &quot;Masterpiece&quot; people are making it out to be. A perfect 10 means there is nothing wrong and nothing that needs to be changed. People are crazy to think there are no improvements needed. Larian knows this as well, hence they have been patching almost every day.
<br>
<br>If you belong to the gaming elitists who think that gaming is something that needs to consume you and all your time, then you&apos;ll probably like this game a lot. Divinity will certain consume a lot of your time. But if you just see gaming as a multimedia device, similar to movie, you&apos;ll find the pacing of divinity to be very slow -- even slower then your average RPG. Quests and story-lines are all over the place, you really need to keep track of them personally.
<br>
<br>Solid game. Value buy since you can get it less than mainstream games, some websites have it as low as 25$. But not the best game in the last 10 years as some people have called it... wtf.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4331804">Expand</a></span>

<br>But.
<br>It&apos;s actually one of the most linear rpg&apos;s I&apos;ve played.
<br>The real issue is that the game more or less forces you to play the game in THE way developpers thought. If you don&apos;t, bad things happen:
<br>Bad thing 1: Bugs. You suddenly get a quest about events you never noticed, or get additional entries to your main quest about items you never found.
<br>Bad thing 2: You can&apos;t go where you want. Either you are too low level to survive, or the game just plain prevents you (near the endgame) unless you go back and change your choices in order to get some McGuffin.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s sad, because I like the humor, some &apos;side&apos; quests are funny (but you need the xp at least early on, so do them - later you don&apos;t know it but you need stuff there so go for it too).
<br>
<br>There are other issues:
<br>You need a good eyesight, and your characters need good perception too, if you are to find the 4-pixel wide buttons somewhere on some walls. Unless you know where they are, you will spend hours watching at wall textures near the eye-level of your characters in close zoom, at different angles, with a poor camera.
<br>Companions are a joke. You have a choice of 2 with background or some others you can recruit much later with no incentive as they start level 1 - even if you can get them up to a decent level fast.
<br>Meaningless character dialogues. Most of them. Even when you manage to avoid saying something, the NPCs will still consider you said it. Long after you solved Mystery A, the corresponding dialogue options still show up.
<br>Unfinishable quests still show in your journal. Hey, that guy mentioned in the journal is dead, No use cluttering it with a quest I cannot finish. (Since I can&apos;t resurrect NPCs when they are not in my party despite the ubiquitous scrolls of resurrection)
<br>The end game is a chore. Really. Stop playing once you&apos;ve reached the last dungeon (you should know it). Everything afterwards is just painful/boring. The last battle took me an hour and a half of just lowering the hit points of that damn monster who wasn&apos;t even that threatening but oh, my, 1h30 of repeating the same winning moves over and over again? That&apos;s not fun in any way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4383644">Expand</a></span>

<br>Story - mediocre and predictable, but not terrible.  If you&apos;re able to willingly suspend your disbelief long enough to watch Revenge of the Fallen, you can probably turn off your brain enough to be entertained by this game&apos;s plot.  But that&apos;s the level the plot&apos;s on.  Summer action blockbuster level.
<br>
<br>Combat - Mediocre, with some impressive elements.  People have compared the combat to X-COM, and I have a one-word piece of advice.  Don&apos;t.  X-COM is a masterpiece of tactical squad-based combat, quite possibly the best made by anyone, to date (and I used to like Breach and the original X-Com) and this... well, this isn&apos;t.  It&apos;s not horrible, but it&apos;s not nearly as polished as a game where tactical combat *is* basically the whole game.  That&apos;s just foolishness.
<br>
<br>Gameplay - This is where it takes a bit of a bath.  Maybe once there are mods to deal with the finite random loot issue, or the inventory management hell which (despite the squares in inventory) is all too reminiscent of why I started to hate the Ultimas... but for now, gameplay is full of useless timesinks such as repair hammers and jumbled inventory with appallingly few sorting options.  I know many will excuse this by claiming the modding community will (or already has) start to address these issues, but the fact is that only a piss-poor release obligates the modding community to incorporate functionality the devs should have built in the first place.  I felt the same about Skyrim&apos;s UI out of the box too, so don&apos;t feel I&apos;m being unfair on D:OS.
<br>
<br>Vision - This is probably the single best thing about the game; while they didn&apos;t necessarily achieve all they set out to achieve, the dev team for D:OS has done some interesting work in the way their elemental interactions go together, and has done a reasonable job of fleshing out certain skills.  That said, there are balance issues with the interactions (wet/stun, wet/freeze and leech/bloodletting as examples) which have necessitated patches (since release) to adjust and will, I&apos;m sure, require more.  Also, I can&apos;t be the only person who realises that a path from electrified puddle to foot to ground doesn&apos;t pass through anything which would cause a stunning effect.  Other abilities could stand some work too - other than Pet Pal, there&apos;s very little in-context incentive to invest in anything but combat-centric abilities.  Certainly there&apos;s not much point in being charismatic when one can save-scum until rock-scissors-spacebar works.
<br>
<br>With the right mods to improve its faults and the right patches to adjust balance through means other than immunities (for example, let a boss be frozen but give him/her an explosive ability to break out and damage nearby characters when it happens), I could see this game achieving about a 6 or 7 rating; at present, as it is, and based on its quality at release, the 4 stands.
<br>
<br>One final note... old-school, this game is not.  Might and Magic 1-3, the SSI gold boxes, Bard&apos;s Tale, Wizardry 1-5 and Ultima 1-6 are old-school.  This is some johnny-come-lately stuff.  If it didn&apos;t come on a set of 360K-1.44Mb floppies, it&apos;s not old-school.

Even extremely average RPG&apos;s such as DA:O were more to my taste. I regret buying this game and should have waited for Torment and Pillars of Eternity to be released. The character creation is completely lack luster with a one size fits all body type for each of the character, I hope to hell that this is just because it is in early access, the skills are also lacking not including basic skill choices such as dual wielding. The story is average at best although it is one of the stronger points of the game. There are some innovative features for this genre such as combining different elements much like in games like Magika. All in all I wouldn&apos;t buy this game yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4337870">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Unfortunately, and with the benefit of hindsight, this purchase proved to be a poor choice.
<br>
<br>After 60+ hours, the game itself has been mostly entertaining. Fans of classic RPGs such as Baldur&apos;s Gate, Neverwinter Nights and Arcanum will feel right at home, and although Divinity: Original Sin doesn&apos;t bring a great deal of innovation to the table, there is a vast amount of well conceived content to explore and enjoy.
<br>
<br>The technical problems I have experienced with this game however, have been overwhelming.
<br>
<br>Crashes on both saving and loading (roughly 1 in 4) have made progress immensely tedious, and only dogged persistence has allowed me to progress as far as I have. In truth, the majority of the 60+ game hours I mentioned earlier have been spent re-playing the same areas over, and over, and over again.
<br>
<br>A short read through Steam forum &apos;sticky&apos; threads will confirm that I am by no means alone with this problem either.
<br>
<br>Much to the credit of the developers, they have been immensely proactive in releasing patches to try and correct both this problem, and other less crippling issues. At the time of writing however, they have not yet found a solution, and each time a new patch is released I start my journey from scratch all over again.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re seriously considering buying this game, don&apos;t be taken in by the &apos;old school&apos; posturing of a small, but very vocal group of self-appointed fanboys. As the number of players increases to include those with far less biased views, so too do the number of players struggling to get this game to work as intended.
<br>
<br>In short? The developer has released what is effectively a beta, yet is still charging top dollar for the privilege.
<br>

After about 50 hours in the game I can only find 1 flaw but its such a big deal it takes a 9/10 game to a 3/10. The game simply has no way of telling you where quests begin and where the quest wants you to go. Sure the NPC may say something like. &quot;you will find what your looking for at the old mill&quot; but where is the old mill you say? You could easily spend more then a few hours of real life time trying to find said mill. Thats where the game falls short BIG TIME. Every single quest you ever get is just like that. For people that have no lives and can waste countless hours of each play time session wasting time accomplishing nothing this game is a 9/10 for them. For people who have real lives and can only play 2 hours at a time this game gets boring very fast because you will never feel like you have accomplished anything. To please both crowds all that had to be done was a toggle button for quest paths/markers. Have it on if you like or get stuck or have it off if your the hardcore no real lifer. Shame on the devs for not including everyone to enjoy a game with such amazing potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4351326">Expand</a></span>

Camera is a joke and hides half of the things needed to proceed. The &quot;journal&quot; is really no help. No map markers giving you an inkling of where your supposed to head next....all in all...it&apos;s just a mess.

Rock paper scissors. Really?
<br>
<br>My biggest disappointment and at the same time, great laughter though, was that how my 2 hulking warriors could not take down a thin, wooden glass door with 3 greatswords and 2 halberd axes. Initially planning to break in and steal some stuff in a deserted house, the door got down to 40% before all of my weapons broke, leaving me with a slightly damaged nigh invulnerable door and huge expenses in weapon repairs and that&apos;s just pathetic for any RPG standard.
<br>
<br>Yes, I am well aware that you can pick locks but unfortunately, my character specialized in lockpicking did not deem it necessary to bring any lockpicks on his grand journey and nor did any of the 52 NPC&apos;s I&apos;ve traded with or the dozens of houses I robbed have any. These may seem like small complaints, and from some aspects of view, they are. But really, the biggest offense here was how I tried to derail from the generic path at the first city and was met with only opponents more than 3 times my level, which I either had to abuse-win by packing oil barrels and letting them explode in their faces or get instantly wiped out even with the best gear humanly possible.
<br>
<br>Long story short, this game has a long way to go and It&apos;s really quite the embarassment to be called a release with patch after patch after patch confirming this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4328704">Expand</a></span>

Because Larian studios is one of the few developers aiming to create great and classic RPG games, and generally will not scarifice a game&apos;s depth and quality in exchange for the taste of mass public. Also, there are so many average or even mediocre RPGs released in the recent years, so this game just shine like a diamond in a sea of sand.
<br>
<br>Although sticking to the formulas of old classic RPGs, let alone the plague of technical issues and quest related bugs, this rushed game still need more polishing before it can be a great game with good experience to most players.
<br>
<br>Here are the areas that need further polishing:
<br>- rock, paper, scissors argument system is just plain boring, it never comes close to the epic conversation of Bahdur&apos;s Gate
<br>- the self-talking mechanism between the main characters is just odd, it should have another ways to develop characters&apos; social skill
<br>- there should be a general direction hint of what players should go, just like Divinity 2, so players will not just move to areas they are not supposed to go yet
<br>- traveling and picking up items are just chore, as it takes too many time and clicks
<br>- no balance of combat difficulty and the use of enviornment, tacticial variety should be allowed for player to pick from, but not a death is guaranteed if not following particular direction
<br>- equipment and character models should have a greater diversity
<br>- imbalance between quest types, there are just too many puzzle solving quests, and if not followed in particular orders, player will just get stuck
<br>- there are still improvement areas for how those puzzles are presented and solved
<br>- combat accuracy is too unreliable, resulting in just a save or load attempts, since enemies are generally overpowered
<br>- there should be more adjustment available for font size and camera angles
<br>
<br>Overall, it can be a great game just like Divinity 2 in the past, once all the issues are sorted out, but again it may take around 2 years again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4338115">Expand</a></span>

But it&apos;s a game that shouldn&apos;t be compared to them, because it has a personality of its own.
<br>
<br>Major pros:
<br>
<br>+ Combat is deep, tactical, and highly addictive. While not quite balanced as the first 1/3 is much harder than the last 1/3, if nothing else there&apos;s a definite sense of progression.
<br>+ The story and setting don&apos;t have the heart of Bioware&apos;s best, but there&apos;s enough whimsy and intrigue to keep you engaged.
<br>+ Multiple ways to conclude quests.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>- The UI lacks polish. Endless floating windows that get in the way of each other, limited camera rotation makes finding the right perspective difficult sometimes, tiny buttons. Functional, but could be much better.
<br>- Obtuse puzzles. I get that the developer didn&apos;t want to hand hold players, but pixel searching for buttons, vague clues you may not even find if you approach quests out of order, just cause grief.
<br>- Cheap instadeath moments. For example, there&apos;s a boss whose corpse will kill your character instantly if you step on him. But there is no warning that will happen. Resurrect scrolls are common enough, but it still annoys me.
<br>
<br>Besides certain puzzles which I genuinely disliked, the cons are more nitpicking than anything else. Overall, this is a must play for any fan of the great isometric RPGs of the past.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4330270">Expand</a></span>

<br>the few dungeons are small, and the explodings traps just irritating
<br>
<br>zoom in is needless cause no tilting of the camera
<br>and many atmosphere things how missing animals, day and night are missing,
<br>
<br>u cant explore the map outside cause of the lvlcap of the monsters( to strong, 3 lvl difference u die after one hit from an orc), the map is too small for , so the game is very linear,
<br>i dont see the open world, u can only decide how u get some things(jack murder), if u break in or steal or talk with an animal
<br>maps look big, but isnt, u just move slow, there is not much
<br>decisions have no effect, just if u fight or not most time, but most not memorable
<br>if u are lvl 10 u saw almost all skills, the spellcasting is slow, especially summoning, but many spells too,
<br>the town is under attack, but u have not feeling for this
<br>looting many things after fight makes me tired, scroll in postion when moving the same,
<br>i dont know how people needed 30 hours for the first map, i have read all text, i have all quest, i played on hard after lvl 5 and needed 15hours, i wanted try more fights, so I killed all soldiers in the town, this was a nice, but short fun, know i stop playing, i have no motivation, i hoped i would be better, but after the fights were no challenging I see no reason, and i am afraid of another long boring text- and walk-quest with no surprises
<br>
<br>yes its a low budget production and it could be I`m to critical, but 10/10 is
<br>greatly exaggerated
<br>is think the 80% of the budget went into the editor and technique, the rest seems like a better mod
<br>who have fun with stealing and find chests could have fun, but who wants decisions which influence the charakter
<br>or story, or surpisings storyscripts or fights not only from one side, or an enemy which counter and debuff or stun u or focus ur mages, or want nice endbosses or great dungeons or explore the world or a nice story, then dont play the game, humor and small decisions are not enough, the game is nothing against bg2 or nwn 2(think about the potentiality these days)
<br>
<br>... i try the editor.......and wait for pillar of eternity</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin/user-reviews?user_review_id=4331496">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Therefore, the game is now nearly updated at a daily basis, but unfortunately there are more and more bugs discovered  by the community as the game is on sale now.
<br>
<br>This is unacceptable for such a long development cycle, and the tons of new bugs identified just make me doubt about if the game is actually tested before launch.
<br>
<br>At this rate, I wonder if the game will be at least free of game-breaking bugs one month after the launch.
