Fallout 3, as a game, is directionless and vague in all it does, poorly structured (you can skip out half the story if you&apos;re not careful), caters for gaming idiots and worst of all is anything but true to the Fallout name.
<br>
<br>Ok so I shall start with the positives, it&apos;s a good looking game as long as you remain in first person, apparently no one in Bethesda has ever seen a real person walking as evidenced by switching to third person. There are some truly great scripted moments that are only really effective because of the level of the graphics, anyone who&apos;s played it should know what moments I&apos;m talking about. Moving onto the world itself, it is big and there are a lot of places to go and visit, a lot of people to meet and a lot of items to collect (if you&apos;re a hoarder like me). The ambient sound is ok in most places and good in a few, it never gets annoying so I can&apos;t really fault it. Weapons sound as they should or probably should, the music sort of sets the scene but is relatively forgettable. That just about wraps up the good things.
<br>
<br>Ok so first of all this game suffers from all the faults Oblivion had and some. &quot;Dungeons&quot; or &quot;Vaults&quot; as Bethesda would have you believe all have that same rehashed feeling they had in Oblivion, as do buildings. As I already mentioned, third person character movement is appalling, though this is not too much of a problem as most people, as I did, for a bulk of the game will be playing in first person. You would have thought with the budget they had and the time they had they could at least get that right however. The other thing is that it can&apos;t be played as you would play a first person shooter, you can aim your cross hair over an enemy all you want but that doesn&apos;t make it any more likely you will hit; whilst this is true to the Fallout series it doesn&apos;t translate in their first person iteration of it, except for when enemies are firing at you; they don&apos;t seem to be bound by the same constraints. Neither does VATS for that matter, in the original if you specifically targeted and hit an enemy&apos;s body part it would have a noticeable affect on that enemy&apos;s ability to fight, in Fallout 3 it doesn&apos;t seem to make a blind bit of difference, for example, blinding an enemy would make it near impossible for them to attack you. As for the storyline, what there isn&apos;t of it that is, now I know that there is much more to a game in terms of its immersive-ness than the main storyline but it does have to provided direction and motivation to finish the game. The main storyline can be completed in five hours or less if you&apos;re skipping parts of it and is not once engaging or driving enough to want to continue. Not good by any standard. It doesn&apos;t help that the story is told by an incredibly lacklustre group of NPCs. In fact nearly every character in this game has a personality roughly equal to a shade of beige. They are an incredibly boring group and there is little diversity to them, in fact you will come across many with an overwhelming sense of familiarity, even though you may not have met them yet. Also the game is incredibly buggy, even after numerous patches.
<br>
<br>That covers all of the issues I see with it except for, what is for me, the biggest one of them all. Now then, if you&apos;re going to take up already established IP and expand on that you have to pay attention to what that originally stood for. Now I know Fallout has diverged in the past from it&apos;s roots but never has it strayed this far. The first two of the Fallout series had some intelligent and very witty writing, a varied, interesting and soulful group of NPCs and hugely interesting world full of sleaze and humour. This variation on the Fallout theme has stripped out all of this, there is never a funny moment, the writing is appalling, NPCs are bland and the sleaze has completely gone. No more can you take a job as a porn star or engage with the post-apocalyptic mob or score drugs from a shady character to fuel your addiction. This strips most of the realism and life out of the world and the fact of the matter is that by comparison to most of the rest of the series Fallout 3 has no soul, it&apos;s been stripped out in an attempt to bring it to all out commercial success (yes I know this sounds whiny and unrealistic as these companies are there to make money, but do that with their own IP not just off the back of a recognised and fondly loved and remembered franchise).
<br>
<br>Anyway in conclusion Fallout 3 is, as a game, a mildly above average game. However, as an addition to the Fallout series it is an incredibly poor and disappointing addition so far removed from what Fallout was that it is barely recognisable any more. I just hope that with some of the original Fallout team working on New Vegas they can get that amazingly lively, funny world that Fallout used to be back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1359990">Expand</a></span>

You have the right to love it, it&apos;s fair, but it seems that you either got spoiled by modern game industry or didn&apos;t know the beauty of TRUE Fallout universe. Bethesda needs to understand, that not every game that it does needs to be done in the same manner. In the end Fallout started to look like The Elder Scrolls after a while. Please, do not misunderstand me, I love TES, but it&apos;s design is unique and suitable only for itself. Bethesda seems to think otherwise. Fallout 3 turned out to be more of a shooter, than an RPG. And when I say that, I mean: 90% shooter, 10% RPG.  And in the end: it&apos;s certainly isn&apos;t the best of both world, but a bad example of adapting a series. The game may be enjoyable for new gamers, but for the old school type of gamers this will be a huge disappointment. I&apos;m still in shock trying to figure out why it&apos;s score is better than Fallout 2&apos;s...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3029322">Expand</a></span>

You manage to defeat Vault security despite being a Level 1 wimp, then proceed to destroy supermutants and the Enclave with no particular hardship. On your journey, you meet boring, shallow and two-dimensional characters with poor voice acting who give you just as boring and shallow quests. The UI can be a chore to use. The game has countless bugs and the animations do *not* resemble human beings. That&apos;s not to say, it contradicts the already established Fallout lore. It can be a fun game, but only for a little while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2555325">Expand</a></span>

Despite the terrific art-style and interesting setting, the game does a terrible job of storytelling, and what little story-content there is is spread out throughout approximately 60 hours of mind-numbingly repetitive combat and &quot;exploration.&quot; Soon, you realize that you are fighting the same bad-guys over and over, that the houses and assorted bits of rubble and trash you see lying all over the world all look more or less the same, and the whole experience is downhill from there.<br><br>Repetitive combat + copy-pasted rubble + no significant story = boring waste of time.<br><br>Don&apos;t buy into the hype about the game being &quot;open-world.&quot; Open world games aren&apos;t that great when everything you come across in the game looks bland, lifeless, and identical to 80% or more of everything else you&apos;ve already come across in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1941664">Expand</a></span>

Pros: - Large, persistent world to explore. - Plenty of little quirks and side quests to keep you entertained and personalise your gaming experience. - Atmosphere is great. - Good music. - VATS combat system is fun. - Terrain graphics are quite good. - Plenty of character customisation options. Cons: - Can&apos;t help but think of Oblivion when playing the game (It&apos;s just way to similar). - Voice acting is often cheesy. - AI sucks. - Characters models and animations are not up to todays standards. - Quests generally consist of &apos;do things the good way or the bad way&apos;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=419724">Expand</a></span>

Fallout is entirely different, than what this game is. This is just  a shooter, &quot;glorified&quot; with a terrible story, awkward voice acting, AND you have to buy a dlc to continue playing after you finished the main story. Not to mention, the game is really easy due to the fact that the player could just rush the story. Also, in the last mission, you can&apos;t even really kill anybody, and you actively have to hunt enemies so maybe you can get the kill. The only reason it&apos;s even playable is the atmosphere of a post apocalyptic DC, and wandering in the totally unbalanced wastes. If you want to play a fallout game, just go play FNV, you won&apos;t regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7519787">Expand</a></span>

It even involves some SIMS-type game play including the decorating of your own house, wherever that might be (see for yourself). The playing area is large and flexible, you&apos;ll find that restrictions are very few in number. The weapon/item arsenal is very large and what&apos;s more, you can make your own weapons or other stuff. The fact that the game is situated to happen in Washington DC area (and outside) adds to the excitement. This together with the Cold War-type of background story cooks up an amazing game atmosphere. I could go on for pages, enough spoiling though: the goodies are all there for you to find. Bad sides? That&apos;s a tough call. If I was forced to dig out one, that would be the fact that the main story is so short. Compared to how large the area is and how much there is to explore and try out, the main storyline seems inadequate. This combined with the fact that once you finish the final objective the game ends is disappointing. Nonetheless the game is wonderful and if you&apos;re not in a rush and like scouting around, you&apos;ll find tons of stuff to do and even if you only did the main story line there will be hours after hours of gaming to do. I have no regrets of making this purchase even if it cost me $30 :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=746382">Expand</a></span>

Feelings for seeing Bethesda pick up the license later on were mixed. Joyed to see that a long awaited third sequel was on the way, worried that it&apos;s artistic and mechanical direction would stray too far from the style and feel that made the first two games so gorgeous and in my opinion, the best Western CRPG&apos;s I&apos;ve had the pleasure to experience. The teaser trailer released a year ago was a good indicator of the new developers grasp of the atmosphere (in addition, the fact that they chose the original Inkspots piece intended for FO1 was a welcome tip-of-the-hat to the fans). But the indication that the same engine used for Oblivion was planned for this game resurfaced early fears. I have very much enjoyed Morrowind from Bethesda, despite a general dislike of the arche-typical fantasy-sword-and-sorcery genre of RPG&apos;s. Oblivion on the other hand, while possessing an engine that provided a vast, rich and colorful world setting and a character creation system that allowed intensely detailed tweaking when it came to physical looks, still overall disappointed me with a combat system that felt too clunky, voice acting that lacked enthusiasm, level-scaled enemies, and an NPC AI that acted far too awkwardly for me to suspend disbelief. Overall it only felt like a step-up from Morrowind and graphics and physics, with most other aspects feeling like a downgrade. Having played Fallout 3 for several days now, I would posit that the early fears were not entirely misplaced, but thankfully a little bit exaggerated as one would expect from an oversensitive fan base that was hyped up and let down one too many times over the past few years ;) The landscape, colors and settings definetely reflect the feel of the previous games; Desolate, hopeless with death and decay everywhere, no signs of life or motion other than the occasional dust winds. The soundtrack is very fitting to this atmosphere, with pieces that are either soft and slow that induce a sense of solitude, or louder scores that emphasize the vastness of the wasteland, and thus just how hopeless the prognosis of this new world is. As it was with Oblivion, detail is not spared from observation. Whether the player is traversing the wasteland or walking about in the few makeshift towns of surviving communities, they will notice the gritty look of decaying or rotting structures, the various amount of junk material sprawled around and about, perforated or covered with dirt and rust where applicable. The visual and aural setting, certainly does not disappoint. The behaviour of the NPC AI however, is still on the awkward side as it was in Oblivion, though perhaps not as painful to watch. For example, NPC&apos;s converse with each other as it was in Oblivion. And while it still looks stiff and artificial, their conversations seem to be more coherent, much unlike the almost completely random lines spouted by their Oblivion counterparts. The voice acting, while not convincing enough to be heralded as an industry example, has definetely improved enough to be considered satisfactory. Different characters sound more apart, and emotion in their tones is easier to pick up. Some textures and models in the game feel a little dated, possibly implying that the game engine has not improved since Oblivion. The first gun you procure in the game (the classic 10mm) looked and felt disturbingly clunky in my hands, although this is partly due to the fact that the pre-rendered drawings and illustrations on the previous games had given the same gun a nicer, smoother look. Fortunately such issues are not numerous, and can be ignored in time, for the most part. Combat has left me with mixed impressions. The game certainly does not play like a typical shooter for obvious reasons; The condition of the weapon as well as your skill in utilizing it directly affects your performance. Still, after previous FPS-RPG&apos;s such as System Shock 2 or Deus Ex, the glaring hopelessness of trying to shoot or snipe an enemy from afar, or even middle-range is slightly irritating, more so when said enemy doesn&apos;t seem to be having much trouble perforating you with burst fire from the same distance. Still, this is somewhat an early observation. I&apos;m currently Level 5 with a Small Weapons skill of 55 to 60, and all my weapons are at about 55% condition at best. So the challenge, while irritating, is perhaps understandable. The transition from turn-based combat to real-time is disorienting for Fallout veterans like I, who are used to taking their time to plan their moves and spend AP&apos;s as efficiently as possible. The paused combat option of VATS compensates for this, but only up to a point. It allows time to think about your next series of moves, and of course, allows for called shots directly influenced by the usual RPG mechanics of the game. The slow-motion cinematic play out of your commands is definetely satisfying to watch, more so when you score a critical hit. However, perhaps due to the shifting camera angles during this cinematic phase, the player is disoriented for a split-second when it ends and combat continues onward. Even if only for a split second, its still typically enough for a speedy AI enemy to fire off a few more shots at you as you regain your senses and move on. For the most part, my combat style has consisted of taking some calculated shots with VATS, then taking cover while my AP&apos;s regenerate for the next attempt. The pace feels too slow for an FPS, and perhaps a bit fast for an RPG. Nevertheless, the cinematic phase entertains me enough to overall enjoy combat. Plot wise, I have not made much progress with the main quest, seeking out side quests where I can to extend gameplay. However it looks interesting so far, and I will eventually move onwards. The missions offered from various NPC&apos;s so far have not felt boring or tedious. Some are tied to the main quest, others are enjoyable distractions. The amount of solution choices and the feel of the quests are in line with the Fallout spirit. I am once again the diplomat I used to be in the West Coast of post-apocalypse USA, looking for peaceful solutions, but sometimes just going with the flow of my rifle barrel :p Overall, I am enjoying Fallout 3 with great gusto. Yes, I would have very much loved to see the Van Buren project of Black Isle succeed. Having tried out its released alpha form a year or so ago, I have little doubt that the original Fallout 3 that was supposed to happen several years earlier would have been fantastic, probably much better than what we have in our hands today. But sadly that project is buried in history now. I don&apos;t subscribe to the belief that &quot;Any X is better than no X.&quot; In my opinion, the Fallout 3 delivered by Bethesda is not a cheapened form of Fallout, nor a fundamentally different form of Fallout. It is a Fallout that fully delivers the retro-futuristic, dark-humored setting its fans have come adore. The changes in gameplay, while understandably troubling for some veterans, are not major enough to dismiss this game as a failed Fallout by any means. Still, I would urge Bethesda to either drop this Oblivion engine, or fix those stiff movements for the next installment ;) .....there will be a fourth installment, right?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=419036">Expand</a></span>

In games like TES3, when you finished something, there was always something more to do - always. In Fallout 3, there is an end, and it seems to quick to come. Don&apos;t get me wrong, though.

To give some context on my views, I have not played any of the previous Fallout games, however I am a big RPG fan and have completed many great games in the genre, including Oblivion. For the first 15 hours or so Fallout 3 is a 10/10 game, great story good visuals and sound and a really immersive RPG experience. However, I maxed out at level 20 depressingly early, with huge amounts of cash and ammunition and there was nothing I couldn&apos;t kill with my Chinese Assault Rifle, in short the last third of the main plot was an unchallenging procession. I can&apos;t believe that Bethesda went to all this effort of making a superficially great game and got the play balance so wrong. MAJOR SPOILER - I also have major issues with the plot at the end. You are given a choice of sacrificing yourself or a character that you met all of five minutes ago for whom you have limited emotional investment. Surely it should have been choice between your own life and your father&apos;s for which your whole quest has been about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=421364">Expand</a></span>

Alot of players have had alot of issues with this game including me. I got the game working in about 20 minutes after installation. The game has been developed very well and for Fallout fans its like a dream come true.</span>

I loved both oblivion and fallout 2, but I have to agree with some of the other comments that this is more oblivion than fallout. Its a pretty good game, but it lost that strategic element that was so critical in the fallout 2 game. This is essentially a game that is impossible to loose. You could assign skills randomly and still have a playable character. Unlike oblivion, there is no weather effects, in the PC version there is no button to holster your weapon(assuming because they ran out of buttons on the xbox controller), there is no sound when you reload, there is some serious issues with continuity, and there are some really lame bugs in the game. Not bugs that crash the game, just bugs that make you say &quot;that&apos;s dumb&quot;. I&apos;ve played it for about 20hrs now, and its becoming a little repetitive, there is no creature or situation that I can get knocked down below 1/2 health. This is a game that is better than most games on the market currently, but it really is not much of an RPG, it belongs with in the basket with Bioshock and half-life 2. So if you like those FPS, you&apos;ll love this, it will be a challenge and a change. This may become an more intensive RPG game in the future, IF the release the editor so modders can get a hold of it and make some improvements/corrections. I&apos;d like to congratulate Bethesda for making the transition from 2D to 3D, that had to happen. But it would have been nice if more effort had been made to retrain the strategic elements that made the previous fallouts famous, and not simply modded Oblivion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=419108">Expand</a></span>

Definitely not &apos;Oblivion with guns&apos; - they&apos;ve learned a little since Oblivion. There&apos;s some brilliant moments - they&apos;ve nailed the feeling of exiting the vault perfectly, and some action sequences are amazingly good fun, such as the behemoths. I haven&apos;t really come across any &quot;go halfway across the land and collect 5 [item]&quot; to complete a quest. There is some running around to do, but these have interesting story lines. The scale of the game feels right, and I&apos;m happy to see there isn&apos;t duplication in dungeons. It isn&apos;t perfect through, there&apos;s quite a few minor problems, most of which you&apos;ve probably already read about. None of these issues really effect the fun to had though. The 8-rating reflects these weaknesses and a couple of poor design decisions - e.g. the first town being 2min stroll from the vault. Don&apos;t pay attention to the 10/10 reviews - the reviewers must have been intoxicated. I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s wrong with some Fallout veterans and Bethesda haters - the game really isn&apos;t bad at all. The weaknesses in voice acting etc. aren&apos;t really noticable unless you&apos;re looking for them. I&apos;m hoping that a series of mods will improve the game - if so you can safely jack up my score to a 9 or 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=419080">Expand</a></span>

I know some of you out there were looking for a second re-hash of the original Fallout, and you will be disappointed (but hey, given the open nature of the original games, you can always go play them again). Sadly, Black Isle (and Troika too) is dead and gone forever, and Van Buren died with it. Fallout 3 IS a beautiful realization of a portion of the Fallout universe in the Gamebryo engine (and incidentally is superior to Oblivion in every possible way, though it still suffers from a few of the same pitfalls, and I wish for once my headshot-kill would result in something other than the head flying from the body, though F1/2 used the same sprite animations for each model&apos;s death). The modified SPECIAL system used lacks a certain RPG depth, but it still stands above every first-person &quot;RPG&quot; I&apos;ve played since Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. The dialogue options are almost universally of the form Good, Bad, Neutral, but well-written within that framework, and they often have real consequences beyond a simple Karma shift. The plot is much more developed than those of previous Bethesda games, and a number of the characters have enough dimension to motivate emotional involvement. Finally, I think VATS may be my favorite feature. Though combat becomes repetitive over time, the cinematic presentation (while occasionally utilizing bizzare camera angles) goes a long way to keep it satisfying. I may never get sick of seeing a slow-motion tracking of the railway spike I fired flying to a Feral Ghoul&apos;s head and pinning it to the wall. The game is still a bit buggy (random crashes in Vista x64), so I recommend saving often. Overall, it turned out much better than I had hoped: so much so that, though I had originally planned to simply steal the game once it had been cracked, I wound up buying a copy at 6pm on the 28th after watching my friend play for a while. Fallout 3 isn&apos;t perfect, but it&apos;s easily worth $50 if you have the cash. Now if only someone would come out with a Child-Killer mod.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=419182">Expand</a></span>

Other reviews cover the pros pretty well, I will focus on cons. Combat is fun enough, but not very challenging. I wish there were more actual cities- Unlike the original Fallouts which had plenty of interesting places, this world feels somewhat empty. It is, however, fun to explore. The biggest problem is definitely the main storyline. I was honestly amazed anyone even took this one beyond the brainstorming phase. Incredibly uninteresting. An immersive world is not enough, I want a story that makes me feel some sort of emotion and/or sparks my imagination. And don&apos;t tell me I have to make my own stories, that argument only goes so far. Oh, also plot holes do not constitute interesting developments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=420447">Expand</a></span>

As with Oblivion, Bethesda&apos;s last major RPG, the game is too watered-down to be truly engaging, and it is difficult to look past the ineptly designed controls and user interface, which, contrary to Bethesda&apos;s statements, do not appear to be designed with the PC in mind. All things considered, it&apos;s a step up from Oblivion, and it&apos;s generally true to the Fallout franchise, though it&apos;s hard to judge that when you consider that Fallout 3 is being made with a different style of play by a different developer in a different century. I recommend this game, but only inasmuch as it is on par with the quality and enjoyment of most games these days. Compared to previous games, both by Bethesda and Black Isle, Fallout 3 has lost its charm.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=418891">Expand</a></span>

We were promised a game with &quot;hundreds of endings&quot;, and ended up with only ten or so (which really aren&apos;t that differant from eachother). And while there are some consiquences for your actions, they&apos;re not as major as Bethesda would like you to think. In Megaton, I murdered the doctor, and no one ever noticed. I would have been happy if occasionally one of them mentioned his death. And if you think having a follower changes anything, it doesn&apos;t. They become your backup and your pack mule. No one else notices them. If you can ignore major flaws like that, it is a very fun game with some replay value (you always tend to miss something when you play the game the first time). I recommend it, but don&apos;t expect it to be revolutionary. Maybe Fallout 4 will be free of these issues?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=425887">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;ve ever played Oblivion, than you&apos;ll pretty much know what to expect with Fallout 3. Aside from the setting and story, almost everything is similar to Bethesda&apos;s fantasy RPG; from the menu system and mechanics to the graphics engine and playstyle (the VATS targeting system notwithstanding), there&apos;s nothing you haven&apos;t seen before. It seems like Bethesda took the easy road and decided &quot;if it ain&apos;t broke, don&apos;t fix it&quot;. That&apos;s not necessarily bad, but it&apos;s not necessarily good either. The good: the main storyline is sweet, but short; tons of locations to explore along with tons of quests; VATS kicks butt; lots of weapons and items to find; unique characters and situations; good variety of NPC voices. The bad: Bethesda is still using the archaic menu system they implemented with Oblivion, which means there&apos;s no weapon cycle mapping allowed, and there&apos;s only one key to access your entire character menu; the graphics engine is starting to show its age; the many locations all start to look the same after a while (pure laziness on Bethesda&apos;s part); the main quest is waaaay too short; not enough character and creature variety; gameplay doesn&apos;t seem to change much when higher stats and new skills are added to your character. Certainly not a terrible game, but it&apos;s not &quot;the best game of our generation&quot; as many critics are claiming. I have a feeling that, as was the case with Oblivion, the excitement will wear off after a couple years and people will see Fallout 3 for what it really is: a fun game, but nothing groundbreaking or life changing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=34507">Expand</a></span>

I also agree they couldve put more effort into the speech arm movements ect. but it wasnt my main concern. the quest also could use some work but they do have a bit diversety of the old kill and fetch (while there are many) there are a few that are unmarked that are interesting such as saving a girl from a perverted man. But the main reson i love this game is you do whatever you want in your little box of wastleland you can kill almost everyone except kids of course or decide to save someones life you can sell people off as slaves blow their pants off set offf a nuke or do common repairs whatever you like you can do it. this was my first fallout game and i enjoyed it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=743918">Expand</a></span>

OK Short version yes it needs some fixing up but its still one realy cool game. Keep up the good work Bathesda, improved what you have and add to it ill keep buying the extras.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=744524">Expand</a></span>

This influenced me to give it a try. I have to say I really enjoy this game, and have got sucked into the storyline. Yes, I agree, this is not the Fallout I was expecting, and frustrations I had from previous Bethesda works have bled onto the page here which is why I withheld two stars. But, that standing, I think Bethesda did a tremendous job with this project. I think Bethesda is getting better, and maturing with its offerings. As a standalone game, for me, Fallout3 has been much more immersive and enjoyable than Oblivion. Yes, there are still some kinks that come from Bethesda, and yes some irritation that what I enjoyed from the previous Fallout series was seriously missing in this game. This game sucks you into a world of nuclear fallout and about survival. At the end of the day I have a smile on my face while playing this game, blowing up super mutants, saving the damsel in distress and surveying the shattered world. it is an enjoyable and immersive experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=419544">Expand</a></span>

Maybe a 5 at the minimum but not 0. I just finished the game and although I&apos;m a bit disappointed (the ending sucked bad) I did enjoy many moments in the game, I played on the good side I tried to do good things and so thats where my game lead me. Pros: - A truly large and expansive world - Models, textures, and overall look of the world is good - Locations are many and varied (with the exception of vaults) - Combat is fun, challenging, and engrossing when enemies die in viscous ways - Weapons have a nice &apos;punch&apos; like shotguns or missile launchers - Side quests, although lacking in complexity and immersion, are somewhat interesting - Main quest is good with many unexpected (thus pleasant) surprises - The lock pick system is by far the most well done of any I&apos;ve seen in a game before. - Hacking was enjoyable at the start, but gets boring later. - Has the same comedy as the original Fallout Cons: - Although early on combat is quick and fun later I found it to lack tactics. It quickly become *pew pew* *heal* and repeat - The handy radar system tells you the direction of enemies and allies when your close to them (within a hundred feet or so) This is a bad thing because it makes adventuring less exciting when all you need to do is look down to check if you in danger, no one can sneak up on you. - Its stupid how you can eat dozens of things and use dozens of stimpacks instantly to heal at anytime. - Often controls are unresponsive, such as going to your inventory or opening doors while being shot at - The conversations, quests, and A.I all have the same problems they did in Oblivion The conversations lacked any interesting dialogue, choices were limited and many times made no sense. The quests were semi interesting but could have been much much better The A.I. is horrible, both in combat and not. Ex. The sheriff of a town was killed, the sheriff was an incredibly important person in the town yet no one reacted at all to his death except for his son which only changed his dialogue choices. - Combat becomes boring and annoying later when it might take a few clips to kill one person. I had 100 small guns and It still took me multiple clips to kill someone. - The game had many errors, like leather jackets in the vault, and the errors pertaining to the Fallout universe. - Karma made no big difference. - Enclave shoots you on sight though they really have no reason to attack you. In Conclusion: It&apos;s worth playing but it isn&apos;t all that great. Graphics are good. Combat is fun at the start, stale at the end. Quests are sub-par. A.I. and immersion is horrible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=419686">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m a big fan of Bethesda. Not just for the Elder Scrolls, but also for some of the games they&apos;ve published like Call of Cthulhu. When I figured out they were remaking Fallout, I thought it would be a good time to get in on the Franchise. Now, I can see the comparisons with Oblivion. The MELEE combat is almost identical. The way you interact with the world is pretty spot on as well. But in my opinion, the engine is where the similarities end. For one, Fallout 3&apos;s world doesn&apos;t even have a flavor of Oblivion. It&apos;s dark. It&apos;s gritty. And in places like Downtown DC, it is pretty obvious that there&apos;s few safe havens. There&apos;s alot of scrounging early on, though I will admit that it does get easier to find mid ranged equipment and ammunition, but stuff like Mini Guns and Mini Nukes stay relatively rare. As for combat, melee, like I said, is very similar to Oblivion. However, I went with guns, more specifically energy weapons. Let me say that it operated NOTHING like Oblivion&apos;s bow and arrow, or even spells. Each weapon felt considerably different. Firing my pea shooting 10mm was far and away different than the gatling gun or missile launcher. Now, the game could have easily gotten a 9 out of 10 or even a perfect score, but I did have a few complaints: First, the characters were pretty bland. The only characters I really cared for at all were Fawkes, Butch, and Amata, but even these characters didn&apos;t have enough depth or related quests. You couldn&apos;t even ask much about their past, or how they felt about certain things. Dogmeat, one of the only announced followers. was awful. Yea, he could be sent to go get stuff, but he acted very little like a real dog, which I guess is kind of biased after playing fable ii. I mean it just followed behind me and alot of the time I had to look behind me to make sure he was following. In fable ii the dog would bark, run ahead of you, and interact with other people. Which will kind of fit into my last complaint. Second, the different factions don&apos;t really feel that alive. The Enclave felt like it had field operations going on, but you almost never saw the Brotherhood of Steel doing anything important save for a few instances. And last, in the 4 years since Oblivion, they weren&apos;t able to add any kind of dynamic content to the world. Roving bands, yea sure, people who talk to one another, ok, shops that close, alright. But come on. You never have more than 2 people talking to each other. Those roving bands are just that. Roving bands; they never interact with anything. And you can learn very little from the people themselves. You talk to them, get all the information they have initially, and then you never have to go back to them. They have nothing to reveal about current events, or the past. Still, small complaints from a game that accomplishes so much. Much more than alot of the other games that have come out. And to the people who DID play Fallout who don&apos;t believe it stays true: Despair, black humour, and violence. That&apos;s what I understand made the series. Well it&apos;s all there. If you&apos;re complaints are about leaving the turn based system, or the non isometric view: That&apos;s evolution of technology. I don&apos;t want strategy. I want immersion, story, graphics, AND strategy. All of these are in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=419107">Expand</a></span>

There were some nights playing where it would crash, I would start it up again. It was crash. I would restart. It would crash. Inconsistent Difficulty. I found myself &quot;tweaking&quot; the difficulty level up and down as things either became too hard or too easy. This really becomes annoying in the final act of the main quest where no mater how high you set the difficulty, you can&apos;t lose. Bad Performance on lowest setting. I have a Dell 670 with a Geforce 7800. There is no reason a game at 800x600 with AA off should chug. Ever. The story. It&apos;s quite simply underwhelming when you finish the game and ask yourself. That&apos;s it? I spend the entire game wondering when the grand, epic story was going to kick in. In the end I ended up fixing a *drumroll* water purification plat. wow. And the worst thing is, they never explained why the forces of bad didn&apos;t want it fixed and they never showed me the end results. I&apos;m not sure why anyone in their right mind would get from the start of this game to the end of it if it were not a video game, but a story for a movie. What&apos;s my motivation, people? There really is only one character class. That&apos;s called the action hero. In Fallout 1 and 2 it was nearly possible to talk your way through the entire game. It was possible to be a melee character. Here there is one. Shoot stuff. gain levels. Shoot stuff. Unconvincely convince people of pointless things. So I hate to say it but they have put out a wonderful looking but unrepentantly boring game with a lot of bugs. In the end I don&apos;t k now why I played through the whole thing and can&apos;t quite remember what it was all about. Compare that to Fallout 1, where almost a decade later and I still rememeber.. The Master and his creepy base, or the first time i saw ghouls or when I first broke into the &quot;Military Base&quot; to see the mutated inhabitants. There are all of the pieces of a great game here, but unconvincely placed into an ill thought out and uninspired story. I have to admit fighting my way through the subway with ghouls popping out every corner was thrilling but I have to ask myself. WTF was I even doing down there in the first place? I think I was looking for the story for a game that has none.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=420256">Expand</a></span>

The AI opponents run at you very fast, but not in a very intelligent manner. Great look and feel. Good implementation of several game devices. I agree that the thing that will make this game an 8 or 9 will be the Mod community as BS did not spend enough time with the plot of the vanilla box.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=420551">Expand</a></span>

Can&apos;t see how it got 92% though. Anyway, it was pretty fun playing this game. You got all these customization you can do - facial features (but somehow you can&apos;t change your body shape - you could do it in Van Buren), skills, decisions, etc. Then you get to explore a huge world with awesome graphics, an excellent wastelandish atmosphere (ghostly abandoned vaults were good). And it&apos;s really easy to learn how to play this game too. The VATS was interesting for a while and it helps you get through tight spots. Some side quests are good, e.g. Moira&apos;s. And oh, I love the music. The radio station is a darn good concept. But as usual there are flaws. First of all, it&apos;s really easy to get stuck - so save often, or just use the console. It&apos;s really frustrating when you spent 15 minutes killing off a horde of super mutants then get stuck when you were exploring in some rubbles. Then there is the poor AI (I&apos;m not sure if higher difficulties fixes that). For example, enemies tend to get stuck with obstacles and that gives you infinite time to finish them off. Another example is extremely aggressive allies that will attack high level enemies with bare hand. Walking around in the wasteland can be pretty tiresome. Yeah running speed is too slow - could have had a sprint button or something like that. NPCs can be a bit bland - they are not as fleshed out as in Fallout e.g. not as emotional or as sarcastic. Facial animations are really bad haha. I was playing Half-Life 2 and I was surprised with the facial animation - and that was released at the end of 2004... hm. Games too easy - you can be a jack of all trades and be the master of everything. Takes a lot of traps to kill you too. Yeah that&apos;s right, everything. Strategy and smart allocation of skill/char points/ perks doesn&apos;t seem as vital now since they don&apos;t really critically affect what you can do and poor management doesn&apos;t seem to cripple you as much as in Fallout. Main quest is not that interesting imo - in the end it seems like a chore and no better than some of the better side quests. One thing I sorely missed was the element of randomness. E.g. in Fallout, sometimes when you attack you critically miss and drop your weapon, or you hit so hard that the enemy passes out, etc. In Fallout 3 eventually everything becomes kinda routine. And one thing that baffles me is the disappearance of the ability to retrieve ammo from a gun (or maybe I missed it). Again it&apos;s a decent game. I would say it&apos;s a watered down, adapted-to-casual-gamers version of Fallout. An analogy would be those non-technical scientific books written for the mass rather than for intellectuals in that field, you get what I mean?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=420760">Expand</a></span>

Definitely needed the patches and dlc to be a good experience, which should not be something that is necessary in a commercially released game. Overall, above average, but nothing spectacular.</span>

While it has things like a vault, and Enclave, everything else about it is a pure watered down Bethesda hack job. As a romp around a nuclear wasteland, it&apos;s fine, but as far as feeling like your character has any choice in anything, it&apos;s far from what came before. No matter what character you build, you can do anything, so role playing is pretty much gutted. Though there are some interesting side areas, the main quest is terribly bland with little choice involved. Combat is dull, requiring little tactics since VATS is god mode, and so long as you&apos;re smart enough to click Target&gt; Head, you&apos;ll win every time and never take damage. It&apos;s a cheap knock off of the series. Get New Vegas, if you want a better next gen Fallout experience. Or better yet, play the old games, to understand just how far off the mark Bethesda was when they tried to make an actual RPG. Terrible game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4232432">Expand</a></span>

It is an absolute joke of an RPG, and a huge slap in the face to everyone who enjoyed Fallout 1 and 2. Instead of a top tier RPG, they gave us a generic open world game made by and for middle schoolers, and middle schoolers are by and large the only people who liked it.
<br>
<br>The performance is inexcusably bad. Tons of crashes, tons of glitches, the works.
<br>
<br>The graphics are horrible, even for the time. I can&apos;t recall seeing something that wasn&apos;t grey in the entire game.
<br>
<br>In contrast to everything looking grey, all choices are pure black and white. They took a **** all over the worldbuilding of the first games, and now the Brotherhood of Steel are the hollywood good guys while the Enclave are the hollywood bad guys. Every choice in the game is either 1. I&apos;m a hollywood bad guy 2. I&apos;m a moustache twirling villain 3. I&apos;ll do it for money 3. [Intelligence check to even further explain the plot in case you have a mental disorder]. None of the choices matter at all, either. I won&apos;t go into spoilers, but the game even at the end explicitly prevents you from making a choice that has no downsides for absolutely no reason other than **** you for trying to get out of our cinematic storytelling and make your own path&quot;
<br>
<br>Megaton for example, one of the earliest quests: 1. I&apos;m gonna save the town 2. I&apos;m gonna nuke the town for no apparent reason 3. No involvement. And that&apos;s not to mention that it makes absolutely no sense for them to have built a town around an active nuke.
<br>
<br>I could talk forever about the plot, but suffice it to say that I think they stole a 12 year old&apos;s fanfiction.
<br>
<br>They shifted the game to a first person shooter, because middle schoolers don&apos;t like isometric RPGs, but they kept in VATS to try to keep a semblance of turn based combat where it doesn&apos;t belong.
<br>
<br>The shooting mechanics are simply not well implemented and not fun. There are no iron sights, and gunplay is based off of stats, which of course doesn&apos;t work well.
<br>
<br>They introduce difficulty by giving enemies a lot of health and severely restricting your healing items, ammo, and weapons. The way durability and combat works generally is this: It takes 5 shots from a hunting rifle to kill a super mutant. I have 100 bullets and there are around 30 super mutants here, all better armed and more dangerous than I am. I shoot my hunting rifle 8 times and kill a super mutant, missing 3 shots due to the ****ty aiming. Now my gun is broken and I need to go find 3 more hunting rifles to make it usable again. Note that I say usable, because not a single weapon in the game feels truly strong.
<br>
<br>Another obvious change they made to dumb down the game, the introduction of quest markers. Gone are the days of paying attention, reading dialogue, and figuring things out and finding your own way. Now you just choose your generic good or bad guy options, and mindlessly follow quest markers until you get to go shoot more enemies and break all your weapons.
<br>
<br>All effort in the game clearly went towards sheer amount of content, because literally everything else in the entire game is bad in every way. I cannot think of a single redeeming quality for this game. **** Bethesda for making this absolute joke of a game, and destroying the Fallout series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=7527332">Expand</a></span>

Combat is interesting, dialogue is great, but is hinderd by bad voice acting, i love the fiction, lots of content, but not half as much as oblivion, which makes sense because the fallout isnt bethesdas series, and too remain faithfull to the series, they have to stay with the established fiction.</span>

Only faults are poor AI, a fair amount of bugs (but considering the scope of the game it&apos;s hard to fault them) and VATS glitching sometimes. Otherwise, between this game and the DLC I&apos;ve spent well over 100 hours in and around the Wasteland. Loved every minute of it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=36857">Expand</a></span>

The &quot;turn based&quot; combat is excellent and visually stunning, the storyline is captivating. Its one of if not THEE best game out at the moment. The folks here who have rated this game &quot;0&quot; clearly have no idea what they are talking about!</span>

I think this statement best expresses this great RPG that is Fallout 3. The game&apos;s story is set in Washington and the surrounding areas. If you like a post-apocalyptic atmosphere, a lot of exploring, shooting, lots of side quests and advanced character leveling, then you are going to love this game. The completion of all main and side quests, finding all the locations and exploring them takes more than 80h (GOTY Edition). This can be done in either first or third person perspective.

Almost all the NPCs have something to say when you interact, just like other Bethesda games like Skyrim.  Fallout 3 also has a good and reliable modding community so you will never get bored.  For a game, made in 2008 and still popular today is incredible.

Day/Night cycles are impressive, however would have loved to see much more changing weather... V.A.T.S should be a buyable upgrade... it makes for very easy killing. I must say im very impressed so far, and hopefully look forward to fallout 4 if it is planned.</span>

                                        <span>When Bethesda announced new Fallout game i was really excited. In the end fallout 3 was one of the biggest disappointments. Game play is inferior to both Oblivion and original fallout. The main story line is short and boring. I expected much more from Bethesda.</span>

<br>It&apos;s bug riddled, even with the patches, the ending is shoddy, and it isn&apos;t much better with DLC. All in all fairly mediocre, it does have scale on it&apos;s side, it&apos;s one of the larger games I&apos;ve played, and the atmosphere is rather nice, otherwise don&apos;t bother with this game, it certainly doesn&apos;t stand the test of time, and likely only garnered universal acclaim because of it&apos;s sheer scale at the time of it&apos;s release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3998841">Expand</a></span>

And a lesser rant: for people that refuse to give a 10 because that would mean a perfect game... umm... then you really have a scale of 9. 10 means &quot;as perfect as any game you will buy at present.&quot; The industry and technology are advancing, and will always advance. Ratings on video games are on a curve, not an absolute. You know, by that logic, why give things 9... surely the 9&apos;s of the future will make current games look like a 5, maybe we should reserve more than just 10 for the future? Yeah, let&apos;s rate all current games a maximum of 5 so that the future has room for 6,7,8,9, and 10s. D&apos;oh!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=421020">Expand</a></span>

Do these people know the fallout universe? do they even try to convey the hilarious parallel universe? Hell yeah! Bethesda created a perfect game to go along with the fallout series mostly because they went away from where the other fallouts took place. They created their own world using the rules of fallout and it does not fail. VATs is the most satisfying way of killing anything. Combine the weapons, carnage, choices, and spectacular graphics, this game steals best game of 08. Well worth the $50+, Oh yeah, fuck you BethesdaSUX.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=418887">Expand</a></span>

It is indeed quite a bit different. But different isn&apos;t bad. I&apos;m really thoroughly enjoying this gaming experience. It is predominantly a first-person/third person shooter with a stronger (but not pure) RPG element. Despite all that, it&apos;s really just well put together. Most people downvoting Fallout 3 are basically cult-loyal to the original 2 games. I don&apos;t really think anything could have been done to appease these people. I really enjoyed 1 &amp; 2, and 3 does feel incredibly different, and at times, it&apos;s hard to take it seriously as a &apos;true&apos; addition to the series.. but it&apos;s definitely addictive, immersive, vast, detailed, beautiful and enjoyable. I think that deserves a 10 in itself. There&apos;s really nothing that I don&apos;t like about this game. As far as action-RPGs are concerned, this totally blows Far Cry 2 and Clear Sky out of the water. Get it. The people complaining are really being way too anal for their own good. They&apos;re just upset that this game isn&apos;t Fallout 1 or 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=419033">Expand</a></span>

The only things I found wrong was: 1. the game crashed on numerous occasions (looked up online and got a codec fix) 2. The main story is EXTREMELY short. The first time I played I went straight through the story...got about 12 hours of gameplay. I started the game over and did the sidequests...I&apos;m still playing and I&apos;ve gotten 33 hours.</span>

This game has compatibility of hamster. 10 year old games are perfectly playable even now on modern systems, but game made in times of Windows Vista has issues on Windows 7! So, basically, this (s)flip is crashing, playing it is a pure deprival.

You can do most things your own way.. if someones talking down to you.. you don&apos;t have to take it, just hit the foolish sucker with your super sledge then rob his dead body blind haha. I won&apos;t go to much into the specifics of the game as people should just try this game and learn for their selves. Best game i have played in years and quite possibly the best game i have ever played.. and that is really saying something since im a multiplayer fiend. The other realy great thing about this is that it is built on the Oblivion Engine, Oblivion is one of the most modded games in history by fans. What this means is that fallout 3 is going to get a whole heap more content in the near future for us to play around with. The Modders already are very talented and practiced with Oblivion engine so we can expect the same on Fallout. The last thing i have to say is shame on you to the hardcore fans of fallout that gave this game a Zero. Even if this game had nothing to do with fallout it would still be one of the best games ever made. The fact you gave it a zero just shows that your reviews should not even be posted on this site. It makes me quite sick to be honest. I have played both Fallout and Fallout 2 and this game absolutley reeks of fallout and does the game justice. In fact this game makes fallout probably my favourite series of all time. Bethesda well done you really are the masters of Single Player RPG.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=419317">Expand</a></span>

There are definitely similarities to Oblivion, but they are quickly forgotten due to the strong atmosphere. As for the complaints about color...Did you guys even play Fallout 1 or 2? It&apos;s a barren, desolate world that is devoid of color because the world has been destroyed. It&apos;s not supposed to be bright shiny rainbow land. I&apos;m sorry, but after so many years after a nuclear holocaust, paint is probably going to have faded away. Fallout 3 does a fantastic job painting a bleak, dangerous world where you start out struggling to survive against the odds and slowly develop skills to become king of the wastes. The game also allows you to develop a character that works best with your style. Your choices really do matter outside of the main narrative. Blow up Megaton early on and you&apos;ll struggle through the rest of the game because you&apos;ve lost the ability to gain the experience and bonuses from the quests obtained there. Stab the people who want to blow it up in the back and you&apos;ll be dogged by assassins for the rest of the game. All in all, the game is superbly done with an atmosphere that expounds on the foundation created with Fallout 1 and 2. If you want a game experience that is exactly like the first two games, you won&apos;t get it. But you will get an enjoyable romp through a desolate, dangerous, and expansive world that feels familiar and foreign at the same time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=418959">Expand</a></span>

Fallout 3 is a near perfect genre meld, borrowing the best virtues of First Person Shooters and RPGs. This game creates a stunningly immersive and incredibly detailed world that combines action, storytelling, and player choice into an unrivaled masterpiece. I have largely steered away from RPGs, due to a dislike for both the fantasy genre and stats based gameplay, as well as a love of the first person perspective. Immersion is key to me. Half-Life 2 had previously been the bar for the &quot;perfect game&quot;, but Fallout 3 may have vaulted over it. The attention to detail is unbelievable. Bethesda has created a magnificently realistic post-apocalyptic world that defies belief with it&apos;s plausibility. It is a testament to their work that you quickly stop marveling at the world and forget that the crumbling world around you had to be painstakingly created. It feels like the developers built a city, nuked it, then traveled 200 years in the future to see what it was like. I just &quot;beat&quot; the game, in terms of finishing the main storyline and being kicked to the main menu. I have not, however, experienced a large quantity of what this game has to offer. Depending on your choices, you create the &quot;game&quot; as you see fit. My decisions led me down a path that my friends did not go, and thus we experienced different things. I visited places they didn&apos;t even know about, and vice versus. We did different quests, and completed some in different ways. All of this blends seamlessly with the immersion and storyline to create a living world that is nothing I have ever seen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=419115">Expand</a></span>

This game is HUGE. Not only is it huge but it is a world worth exploring. This game is a Post Apocalyptic RPG and depicts the Future in Downtown Washington DC after WWIII. The charm of this game comes from the Retro 50&apos;s  style the game has. The game does have a few problems.While it truly shines in Exploration, Memorable Sidequests and an unforgettable soundtrack you will sing along to in the entirety of your journey in the Wasteland. The game does not have a Sprint Button which makes it more difficult to traverse this huge Game World. It also suffers from Clunky Combat and Animations like plenty of Bethesda games have in the past. The community in this game is still pretty alive thanks to plenty of mods adding content and keeping the game up to date. This game is truly a MUST HAVE Action RPG for PC Gamers and Console Gamers alike. I must say this is my Favorite Game Of All Time despite some of its glaring problems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=5411996">Expand</a></span>

Anything would be considered a steaming pile if approached in this way. F2 was considered a steaming pile by many players of F1 because they approached it in this way. Think about that before venting your nerd rage.</span>

I was going to give it a lower score however the GECK (the SDK) was actually released. I&apos;m sure by using the GECK the Fallout 3 community will be able to fix Bethesda&apos;s mistakes and turn this into a true Fallout sequel instead of Oblivion with guns.</span>

A great modding community has provided FO3 with a range of high fidelity face lifts as well as tonnes of new custom animations, quests and items. Since its an older game the GOTY edition can be picked up for a low price and you get great value for money with the amount of time you can spend in it.
<br>
<br>It is great fun to explore the post apocalyptic DC and finding all the unique and bizarre characters that live there. Lots of entertaining quests, characters and items to use with great voice acting and story.  The vanilla game does have its issues with it being quite easy for experienced players and the animations messing up slightly but for those who like a challenge there are lots of mods available like FO3 Wanderers Edition which provide a gritty hardcore experience for this game.
<br>
<br>Without the modding community this title atm would be around an 8 given whats available at a similar price but there is no excuse not to pick up a few staple mods like MMM and a HQ texture pack if you PC can handle it - all made considerably easier with Fallout Mod manager.
<br>
<br>You will struggle to find as much entertainment and Hardcore RPG gameplay for as good a price as you can at the moment with a Modded FO3  a must buy if you haven&apos;t already picked it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2855273">Expand</a></span>

That&apos;s my main complaint about the game and it takes me out of it. There are a few glitches here and there that can cause a system to crash but no big deal. Also a few strange things that don&apos;t really fit realistically with the story they present. But it&apos;s a game. Enjoy it!

I thought that the game was too open, it didn&apos;t tell me where i needed to go. I&apos;ve played a lot of single-player games and most of them tell you exactly what to do, always. Fallout didn&apos;t, and it scared me to have so much freedom. It took me a somewhere between 8-10 of hours of gameplay to completely grasp the Capital Wasteland and it&apos;s sheer size. It is enormous. When i finally realized how fantastic Fallout 3 was, it had me in it&apos;s claws. And it hasn&apos;t let me go since. Fallout 3 has a pretty good main story, but the side missions are better. The RPG-elements are more than satisfying but the game&apos;s strong side is it&apos;s atmosphere. I think everybody should at least try Fallout. It is a beautiful game set in a horrifying world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2541584">Expand</a></span>
