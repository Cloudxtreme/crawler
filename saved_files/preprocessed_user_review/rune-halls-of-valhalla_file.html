I remember playing it on LAN at the gaming club with my friends, I remember playing in from home on 30kbps Dial Up all weekend nights with pings around 300. This is by far the best multiplayer melee game I have played. These days there are great alternatives like Chivalry, but this 3rd person game mechanics are just so well done that I can&apos;t help but compare everything else to it. The dodging coming from it&apos;s Unreal Engine coupled with precise hit detection makes it the most skill based melee combat I&apos;ve seen, without crazy combos you have to remember and be quick enough to perform - you just need to swing your weapon through your opponent&apos;s body and try to avoid their blade. And you can also throw a huge hammer at their heads. This multiplayer expansion changes the fight mechanics a bit and I like the new pace more, some people prefer classic gameplay. Recent re-release of Rune Classic on Steam has both modes easily switchable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rune-halls-of-valhalla/user-reviews?user_review_id=5921857">Expand</a></span>
