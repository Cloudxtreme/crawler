It is so full of bugs it makes you wonder if the development team even played it , I have upgraded to v1.3 and it is even worse. The original games were superb a fine balance of action and strategy , this is a poorly watered down version of the original. AVOID this piece of sh.t!</span>

Means you have to abort every mission with reticulans and thus lose the game. CRAP!!! There is no challenge in being anihilated. Why is it that when you down UFO&apos;S they have 20 guards outside and another 20 inside? Do they not take casualties from dropping 35 thousand feet+? All in all this game is not balanced at all and players will find it frustrating...this is a very poor stand alone game and a dreadful ending to the first XCOM series.....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ufo-aftermath/user-reviews?user_review_id=59579">Expand</a></span>

<br>overwhelming majority of life on earth, UFO Aftermath was supposed to be a mix of strategy via a global
<br>view central command with real time tactical missions and a somewhat crpg element in regard to control of tactical teams. In addition to this if you had played this title you would have been required to do research to advance your cause against the aliens. A seemingly interesting balance of game elements right? Wrong.
<br>
<br>So what went wrong? The game was also to advance via the tactical missions. However,  poor game balance blamed partly on an impossible learning curve left this aspect of the title unappealing. Except, perhaps, to those with nothing else to do, at all. What was leftover for those who did not free themselves from UFO Aftermath after a mission or so was a tedious and repetitive rut in an unoriginal game with unappealing graphics, amateurish voice acting and no sense of any real point to it.
<br>
<br>In addition, a frustrating optional hybrid system could auto-pause the game allowing the player to plan their next &apos;&apos;move&apos;&apos; before unpausing the game. Perhaps as an attempt to appease or appeal to the legions of fans of the venerable turn-based X-Com, some of whom were lead to believe that this clunker was some sort of &apos;&apos;spiritual&apos;&apos; successor to the X-Com series. A retro isometric style presentation would have been a better tribute to X-Com instead of the low grade 3D graphics that look so tediously similar to dozens of other Jim Crack RTS games. However, not even that would have saved this pot boiler from sub-mediocrity. Furthermore the old 1024x768 resolution leaves wide screens half empty. So please, do yourself a favor today  choose the easy option and just avoid it.

<br>As the commander of Earth&apos;s Remaining forces you fight to take earth back from the Aliens known as the Reticulans. Aftermath has a quasi-real time battle mechanic with an active pause and the ability to queue up multiple orders. On the global map you can do research, manage your troops, with a pretty well fleshed out leveling system and intercept UFOs.
<br>It&apos;s definately not as good as XCOM or it&apos;s 2011 re-imagining  but it&apos;s an interesting position to try out. Altar Games went on to create two more installments of the game and good on them, since Aftershock and Afterlight were noticeably superior to this one. Unfortunately mechanics here are clunky, the game gets unfairly difficult WAY too fast and longer sittings can turn into boring chores.  With all that in mind Aftermath is a decent albeit flawed first attempt at an XCOM successor. It&apos;s definately worth a playthrough as the music, the atmosphere and the overall feeling of the game give it more of an X-Files vibe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ufo-aftermath/user-reviews?user_review_id=4457995">Expand</a></span>

This game makes me filling that they think that people living in now are so stupid that it is difficult to think economicly. 2) camera control isn&apos;t good enought, You can&apos;t zoom enought and see what you want. 3) You can&apos;t place your bases wher you want, you can&apos;t build them by yourself (also because (1) there is no economy as in &quot;UFO: enemy unknow&quot;) 4) You can&apos;t manage what to build inside the bases. 5) You can&apos;t penetrate inside the buildings on the scenery 6)The interface isn&apos;t intuitive. It is hard to do anything by firt time. Changeing the weapons and equipment is very coarse 7)Controling the units is also strange. You can&apos;t rotate the soldier (for example if you want soldier to watch in specific direction) If you want soldier kneel always when he reach the target position you must firt plan it, there should be something like locking function. You can&apos;t grovel, too. 8) Saving the game is also difficult, there should be same short cut for save the game. 9)The graphic engine isn&apos;t so impressive. 10) The music don&apos;t keep the XCOM series climat. 11)The game isn&apos;t make me scare. 12)After some hours the game makes me bored. We don&apos;t understand peaple exciting that remake of XCOM, they may be forgot the oryginal series. So that&apos;s why we have rated UFO aftermath to 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ufo-aftermath/user-reviews?user_review_id=378132">Expand</a></span>

It would be difficult for any modern game to beat the original, but this games comes fairly close to equaling it. Strategy players will enjoy it, but most RTS guys probably won&apos;t as UFO takes some planning and isn&apos;t one of those mindless &quot;clickfest&quot; games. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ufo-aftermath/user-reviews?user_review_id=371996">Expand</a></span>

Compared to previous XCom games, some of the micro-management features are missing such as base design &amp; hiring scientists &amp; engineers. Personally, I don&apos;t miss these absent management features for it lets you concentrate on your squad members, missions, and trying to find out what the Aliens are up to. Also, I found the real-time combat (with pausing capabilities) used in this game very beneficial for completing missions quickly and speeding up game play. Furthermore, the rotating 3D camera angles was a nice addition to the game as well as some decent background music soundtracks. Lastly, I would like to mention that during the game you will have an opportunity to add a few &apos;good&apos; aliens to your squad roster that can be sent on missions! If you like playing the previous XCom games, you should enjoy playing this new incarnation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ufo-aftermath/user-reviews?user_review_id=371688">Expand</a></span>

There is no micromanagement, no money, and no base design. Only some minor macro management on a global scale exists. The combat system is improved and yet lack-luster. The map is not fully destructible, and buildings are not accessible. I miss launching missiles through a window, door, and stairs to rest in the belly of an extraterrestrial bastard thus spraying his alien guts on the faces of my soldiers. Taste victory yet? However, there are loads of weapons and research available, a good sound track, nice graphics, and plenty of aliens. Also, soldier experience and training have been improved. For what it is, a stand-alone game, I give it a 7, enjoyable, yet not a worthy XCOM successor. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ufo-aftermath/user-reviews?user_review_id=374628">Expand</a></span>

<br>UFO Aftermath has this unique atmosphere of impending doom and, strangely, alienation - not only did i feel hopeless (especially when the alien biomass starts to spread throughout the planet), but all throughout the campaign i felt like i was alone on the planet, abandoned, forgotten, forsaken. Might seem funny, but this mood was precisely what i loved about the game, and none of the sequels were able to capture it so well.
<br>
<br>Other than that - the cities are very well done - European style. Love it. Although some complain about tactical aspect of the combat - i enjoyed it for its smoothness. Perhaps i enjoyed it more because i was not expecting a sequel to X-COM, but evaluated the game on its own.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ufo-aftermath/user-reviews?user_review_id=5865356">Expand</a></span>

Also, bad design of maps and especially the maze-like alien base layouts spoil it.
<br>Unlike in other turn-based games, there is no &quot;turns&quot; here. Instead, you give queues of orders to soldiers, and until a queue is complete or an enemy is seen, the game proceeds in real time, and then pauses until you give a new order to a soldier. In practice, this means that after you see an enemy alien (and it sees your soldier), both you and the alien start firing their weapon at each other non-stop. And since most aliens are bigger, have more hitpoints and do more damage than your soldiers, you can&apos;t defeat them in close combat, no matter from what side you approach them. The only tactics which works best is to make all soldiers snipers, and equip sniper rifles, to shoot enemies from afar while they run towards you to get into their firing range. Also, the auto-pause becomes annoying while you run around seeking for enemies. The real-time/turn-based blend works much better in Jagged Alliance 2 (the game runs in turn-based mode only when you are in combat, and in real-time while out of combat).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ufo-aftermath/user-reviews?user_review_id=5880609">Expand</a></span>
