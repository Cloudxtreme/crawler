<br>The game is very clunky with most commands being counter-intuitive.  Still the strategic game seemed fun once I got the hang of it.  Still clunky like MOO 3.  Drill down and do &quot;x&quot; and you can only create groups of ships that are computer approved and so on.
<br>
<br>Combat, I was hoping was like TF 1942 the old Microprose game.  Not quite, graphics were sub par but that was not a big deal for me.  What most disappointed me was trying to get your ships and aircraft to do much of anything was terrible and the game always started the two sides facing each other at a distance of about 4 km or so.  Now an Iowa should be able to blow a Jap cruiser out of the water with ease.  The range on the guns is 25 miles or something.  I could never get them to shoot the big guns. And when I got frustrated and let the computer run the game, I end up hearing that my carrier TF with 2 or 3 carriers 3 Iowas and so on was destroyed, to a ship, by some DDs and 2 cruisers that sunk the game for me.
