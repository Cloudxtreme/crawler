<br>Metro Last Light looks almost identical to the original save for slightly better textures and light effects. What you&apos;re paying for is the remake of Metro 2033.
<br>Here&apos;s the funny bit. It doesn&apos;t look as good as the original on first impression. Less particle and shader effects, but the animation and character models is where the money is at.
<br>The original Metro 2033 was, and still is, a monster. You need a really powerful rig to run. Redux is lighter and runs better. Additionally it also adds gameplay improvements which fixes the clunky gun mechanics of the original.
<br>
<br>Metro is an experience. An awesome experience, and if you&apos;re new to the series, this is the best way to be introduced.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-redux/user-reviews?user_review_id=4546769">Expand</a></span>

The only things that I&apos;am unsatisfied with are the monster skins they just don&apos;t look as scary as they did in in the original Metro 2033. Prototype 2 had a similar problem with the hunter skins. Just wanted to point that out DEVELOPERS! it ruins the immersion.</span>

<br>
<br>That&#x2019;s the set-up for the first game; Metro 2033. Of the two titles it&#x2019;s the one that has gained the most from 4A Games&#x2019; revisit. Where the original was muddy and blurry, the Redux version is quite dramatically lighter and more detailed, helping players to feel as if they&#x2019;re inhabiting this bleak dystopia.
<br>
<br>Similarly, the four year-old game has also gained from a bunch of new gameplay additions. The control scheme has been brought into line with Last Light, the UI has been revised and weapon customisation has been added, along with a few other major changes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-redux/user-reviews?user_review_id=4433431">Expand</a></span>

The redux version links 2 of them together into 1 game is fantastic. The game have a lot of significant graphical improvement, (This part refers to 2033 only). Many features from Last Light is added to 2033, like stealth kill etc., many new locations, less loading screen too. There is also some new gameplay modes, adding different experience to the entire game. The game is not overpriced. $25 for each or $50 for both and even 50% off if you already own the original version of 2033 and Last Light (even though I want a free upgrade), way cheaper than other remastered game currently out in the market. If you are new to the franchise, or are a fan of single player first-person shooter and post-apocalypse setting, it is a must buy, if you have already played the 2 game already, it deserves you to purchase again. But why this game only scored a 8/10 is because that the world are currently overflowing with remastered game. I don&apos;t like that and I don&apos;t encourage that. Even though I enjoy Metro Redux, this situation needs to stop or slow down. And also, changes is Metro Last Light is not really significant. Therefore, I recommend you to buy 2033 only.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-redux/user-reviews?user_review_id=4433423">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you haven&#x2019;t played Metro 2033 before, this will now be the best place to start. It&#x2019;s post-apocalyptic FPSing at its finest, with a uniquely grim backdrop and appropriately negative portrayal of mankind in the midst of that. The premise of Metro is that the surface of Earth is scorched and irradiated, so the people of Moscow live within the tunnels of the metro (hey, that&#x2019;s the name of the game!) while the Dark Ones above their heads plot against them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-redux/user-reviews?user_review_id=4433435">Expand</a></span>

Last Light was one of my fav games of the year so it came as&#xA0;quite the surprise when I get it plus the original all for under a regular game price.

<br>But the game is boring. AI is braindead, half the game is a walking simulator. You just walk and walk, while listening to dialog or reading stuff, then this is interrupted by mediocre shooting sequences. It is like Final Fantasy, you just suffer the random encounters so you can go on with the story. But Final Fantasy at least lasts for many hours and gives you more choices, this is just a tedious run of the mill shooter that and in a few hours.
<br>
<br>The story is also nothing special, despite depending on books. I don&apos;t want to say that the books are bad and i have never read them, but i suppose most of the allure of the books is about the world and the setting, and not about the adventures of Artyom.
<br>
<br>In the end, it is worth a playthrough if you can find it on a low price, but you will never touch this again after you finish it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-redux/user-reviews?user_review_id=6689715">Expand</a></span>

This means no &quot;peeking&quot; around objects to get perfect shots. Stealth is the best way to take out as many as you can when they have guns, and crazy fleeing-for-your-life tactics are the best when faced with lots of mutants.
<br>
<br>The Bad: The story is completely trivial. Weird stuff happens, I thought it was building to some ultimate choice I&apos;d have to make, but that never happened. Overall, the story didn&apos;t do anything for me. The enemies often made stupid mistakes like taking cover on my side of an object, thus giving me a perfect shot. Ammo is too scarce on the higher difficulties that I always play on. I&apos;m not Rambo, preferring one-shot, one-kill tactics over spraying lead everywhere, and I still found myself running out against the mutant groups. Too many times I was forced to run for my life and reach the end of the zone. That happened twice, but only after dozens and dozens of deaths from simply being unable to fend off the amount of mutants with the ammo I had.
<br>
<br>This game is definitely worth a play-through if you can get it for cheap. I only paid a few dollars for it, so I don&apos;t regret it. Had I spent even $20 on it, I would be pretty annoyed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-redux/user-reviews?user_review_id=4664066">Expand</a></span>

However, for newcomers to the Metro series, Metro Redux will make for a much more enticing offer, as it gives roughly 20-30 hours of entertainment (including DLC) that comes with the same oppressive atmosphere and intriguing story that Metro is known for.
<br>
<br>As for the variations between the original and Redux versions, LL Redux as far as I could see when playing was almost identical to the original. However, Metro 2033 Redux offers noticeably greater visual fidelity and the gameplay has been overhauled, providing a similar user interface and mechanics as Last Light, and in doing so removing the somewhat broken stealth system in the original 2033. There are also some minor changes to the level design, voice acting, AI, cutscenes etc. that I thought were mostly improved from the original 2033, though some aspects such as quality of voice acting/character models are more subjective and you might&apos;ve preferred the original version more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-redux/user-reviews?user_review_id=4561652">Expand</a></span>

Die Spielwelt ist durchwegs ansprechend gestaltet und die Entwickler haben auch das Auge f&#xFC;r das Detail nicht vernachl&#xE4;ssigt.

<br>
<br>Story
<br>
<br>Russia was targeted with atomic bombs, causing death &amp; destruction which produced severe radiation across Moscow. This tragic event forced the survivors to live underground in the metro stations away from the deadly effects of radiation. Various species of the local wildlife were heavily mutated into aggressive beasts, resulting in any form of travel becoming a dangerous endeavour.
<br>
<br>20 years later, the year 2033 when the northern metro station known as &quot;Exhibition&quot; is attacked by mysterious creatures known as &quot;Dark Ones&quot;, at only 20 years-old Artyom is persuaded to leave his home and attempt to solve the problem and discover why the mysterious creature attack happened and ultimately attempt to save the Metro.
<br>
<br>You are Artyom, moving through post-nuclear-apocalyptic Russia killing mutants with a varied arsenal of both fictitious &amp; real weaponry. Various hostilities are present here, such as two opposing factions Stalinist Red Line and a Fourth Reich, mutants and of course the environment itself (e.g. Radiation / Weather effects), featuring radiation both underground and above ground plus the intense weather effects which have a great effect on the player if not approached with caution.
<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise it boils down too good first person action shooter with survival horror elements, features include the likes of; preserving ammo, utilizing stealth, observing your surroundings, gas mark wipes when your mask is either wet or dirty, Artyom will change the filter when breathing becomes troublesome as long as you have gas mask filters to spare!
<br>
<br>You have to scavenge around for ammunition, which not only acts as...well ammo for you&apos;re gun...(really!?) but also currency for buying pretty things. Vendors in the game are reached at the games &quot;hub&quot; areas and you can upgrade, buy new weapons and other useful supplies.
<br>
<br>Stealth plays a core mechanic too, so utilizing the dark can be advantageous to your overall survival. Some areas demand a stealth approach which can be irritating if it&apos;s not your thing (myself included) but also makes sense seeing as ammo is rather scarce and not to mention very beneficial to you for the sake of item preservation, so going all out Rambo may not be advisable.
<br>
<br>Spartan mode and Survival mode the former is more of an action orientated experience with the former having the player do more damage but the enemies hit harder too. The latter of the two being a more difficult experience, with ammo being even more scarce and enemies a lot tougher with longer weapon reload times thrown into the mix.
<br>
<br>Presentation
<br>
<br>Atmospheric and eerie with great overall visuals honestly, this all combined makes for the Metro games to be one of the most immersive and engaging FPS experiences, at least for myself anyway. Not much else to say with the visuals, they are excellent and much better than reading all of this text...So come on, Why aren&apos;t you playing it yet!?
<br>
<br>Audio
<br>
<br>Sound design is definitely on par with how the overall feel of a post-nuclear-apocalyptic Russia should sound. If the visuals didn&apos;t already sell you then the sounds of Metro will further immerse you into the world.
<br>
<br>Saying that however I do have one complaint about the sound effects and that would be the actual gun sounds, personally they don&apos;t sound like they should do, I don&apos;t know I just didn&apos;t feel like I was shooting a sub-machine gun. Or firing off a shotgun with authority, it just wasn&apos;t satisfying for me compared to say the gun sounds of Doom but it&apos;s okay because the enemy &amp; environmental sounds are excellent indeed.
<br>
<br>Conclusion
<br>
<br>I suppose the question you&apos;re all asking yourself (well I&apos;m assuming this is it anyway) is that if I already own the first two original versions of these games, is it worth buying the Redux versions? ...Well you have a re-mastered version with improved performance, solid 60fps and Metro 2033 is completely rebuilt with the Last Light engine so now both games look and feel the same where else Last Light improvements are mainly general tweaks in performance tweaks.
<br>
<br>The games are bundled with all DLC included in the purchase and various level transition enhancements to space out loading times for Metro 2033 were done much like they were present in Last Light. Also they have support for both Linux and Steam OS if you play on a PC. All of that sounds great I know, but honestly if you already own both original versions and DLC and have played them to completion then it&apos;s just not worth it.
<br>
<br>However the Redux versions of these titles are definitely the definitive versions of the game, so for anyone who doesn&apos;t already own the originals, just stop reading this and go buy them right now!
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Immersive visuals
<br>Interesting plot, with books to back it up
<br>Challenging gameplay
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Weapon audio is a bit off
<br>Forced stealth areas
<br>Lacking replay value</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/metro-redux/user-reviews?user_review_id=5878690">Expand</a></span>
