I&#x2019;m not big on games that move over from the mobile platform to PC as nine times out of ten they just don&#x2019;t work for me. Dungelot has been a pleasant surprise in this respect, it&#x2019;s not all that bad.
<br>Dungelot is described as a hybrid between a dungeon crawler and minesweeper and it&#x2019;s a pretty accurate description, but it&#x2019;s far deeper than that. The game is played on a 5&#xD7;5 grid that&#x2019;s covered with rocks, as you uncover each square you might find one of a few things. Items, food, enemies or the dungeon key which is perhaps the most important thing, as opening the door to the dungeon takes you to the next floor. Enemies will restrict you from uncovering the squares around them until they are defeated but don&#x2019;t be tricked into taking on every enemy as this is a quick way to die, rather avoid it if you can. Food is needed for progression as moving to another floor with no food will give you a penalty to your health and items offer a range of benefits to the player like bombs to fight enemies or buff giving potions. Items used correctly can be a life saver and you quickly learn to manage your inventory to match your style of play.
<br>The game also has a selection of mini games and diversions to partake of which pop up as you quest, these are a nice little extra that keeps things fresh. All in all it&#x2019;s an enjoyable experience to play with a fair bit of humour in the narrative too and while I&#x2019;m not a huge fan of puzzle games which I would consider this to be I have found myself playing quite regularly. It also helps that the art is pretty good in its cutesy anime style, I&#x2019;m a sucker for good artwork.
<br>The heart of Dungelot is a mobile game no doubt, but it&#x2019;s not a mobile game that needs you to keep playing every hour to collect something or do something, there aren&#x2019;t even micro-transactions and this helps to make the experience a pleasurable one. I&#x2019;m not being forced to play or strong armed into spending money, I can hop in as and when I please and have a quick blast. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if I played an hour ago or a week, which probably makes me play it even more.
<br>It&#x2019;s not a hard game to understand, it&#x2019;s a simple puzzle game that&#x2019;s all about having a bit of fun. It&#x2019;s enjoyable and the fact it came out on mobile first really doesn&#x2019;t matter as this is just a puzzle game that happens to have been on mobile, it looks great and plays great on PC instead of being a bad port of a bad game which is what I&#x2019;ve come to think of when I talk about mobile ports. There&#x2019;s no earth shattering graphics or gameplay that reinvents the wheel, it&#x2019;s a colourful, bright and fun little game that I highly enjoyed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungelot-shattered-lands/user-reviews?user_review_id=6417951">Expand</a></span>
