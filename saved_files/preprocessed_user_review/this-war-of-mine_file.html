Been busy with it ever since! At first I took this game as a gimmick, knowing about a concept since maybe April I perceived it as a very nice twist with a huge question mark for gameplay, replayability and actual story. While I still think that the devs a bit exaggerate their &apos;grieve&apos; approach to war, casualties and such, I must say they have delivered an addictive game with strong mechanics. You&apos;ve got crafting here, you&apos;ve got exploring, time management, character developing so to speak, you&apos;ve got resource management and a bit of randomness that adds a nice spice to the mix. So after a while you tend to forget all this bleak and suffering, and just enjoy your achievements, make bonds with characters, just immerse in the world and enjoy it. Especially I liked how the story is told: not to fast, you really focus on details, sharpen your attention, and enjoy small carefully polished details of the concept. Well done 11 Bit!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4693375">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>How, exactly, with a simple metal working station did I make a shovel and crowbar? Think about it for a few minutes. It&apos;s not physically possible. I need forging equipment to do that.
<br>
<br>Tools don&apos;t last long enough and should be something you look for and find, not something you have to constantly make and replace. That makes zero sense. Has no one ever used a crowbar before? In my time as a renovator I met people that had bought crowbars thirty years ago that they were still using, and they were using them a hell of a lot more than what you do in this game.
<br>
<br>Why, exactly, does my rainwater - CLEAN WATER - need filters? Why would I need to set up the collector every time for this? You would just set it up once and let it collect as much as possible. This doesn&apos;t make sense. If the argument is that it is from a contaminated source, a filter doesn&apos;t do anything unless it is chemical contamination (which generally will not be a problem). The more pressing issue is biological contaminants, which means boiling, not filtering.
<br>
<br>Why can&apos;t I use a brick, piece of wood or rubble as makeshift weaponry?
<br>
<br>Are none of these books guides on how to make simple traps that don&apos;t require manufacturing?
<br>
<br>I could go on ENDLESSLY. I have yet to test to see how the hunger mechanics work, but in real life it takes THREE WEEKS before your body shuts down from lack of food. Vastly more important? Water; without which you will go into kidney failure in three days.
<br>
<br>The makers claim to have lived through a warzone? Sorry, I&apos;m not buying it. There is far too much that makes no sense for that to be true. I&apos;m a practiced survivalist and this game made zero sense to me.
<br>
<br>How is it that you can&apos;t go outside during the day, but some random idiot that wants to trade can?
<br>
<br>Why are people showing up at my door and NOT telling me what makes them useful in order to convince me it&apos;s a good idea to let them in?
<br>
<br>Why can only one guy go scavenging at a time, even though in real life that would be nearly suicidal?
<br>
<br>I just don&apos;t see it. I didn&apos;t feel like I was in a war zone: I felt like I was in a bad game made by people who have zero understanding of survival. The fact that this game gets a good score shows the ignorance of the gamers and the reviewers. This is not an immersive game nor even a good game. This is a bunch of pandering and nothing more. I read a claim that the makers had actually been in a warzone. I&apos;m calling BS. If they had been, they&apos;d know everything that I&apos;d just questioned over the immersion.
<br>
<br>This game is, like all other survival games I&apos;ve tried, absolutely terrible and a prime example of why I don&apos;t pay for video games until after I&apos;ve tried it. This game was so bad that I should have been paid money to play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4722129">Expand</a></span>

However, it is definitely an enjoyable game. It&apos;s a relatively simply survival game where you play a civilian trying to survive amid a war. By day you build up your base and deal with the issues among your group of survivors and by night you go out and scavenge what you need. It&apos;s one of the few times that I really felt like I was playing a survival game. You&apos;ll constantly be needing something and you won&apos;t find yourself coasting along easily at any point in the game. The gameplay is very basic, you just click on screen to where you want to go, click on items to loot them or upgrade and build things. There&apos;s nothing complex or no deep gameplay for you to get addicted to. This War of Mine&apos;s claim to fame is different. It adds an emotional state to the game. Your actions will affect your survivors. Stealing and killing will have cause your survivors to drop in to depression and there may be heartfelt dialogue that pops on screen about you just did. If this is something you don&apos;t really care for then you probably won&apos;t like this game no matter how big of a fan of survival games you are. If this sounds like something that appeals to you then you should definitely try this. The game however lacks replay value. There is a random element to the game; you can get different survivors with different traits. You safe house can look different and the places you go to scavenge may be different but that&apos;s it. After 1-2 playthroughs you will have seen most there is to do in the game and you&apos;ll become proficient at it. With that said, I did enjoy my time and feel like it&apos;s definitely worth a look for anyone looking for a moral side to their game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4988840">Expand</a></span>

I purchased this with absolutely no expectations; I saw it on Steam for $20, thought it was an interesting concept, and decided to give it a go. After playing it for probably 10 hours in the past 3 days, I have to say that it&apos;s probably the best $20 I&apos;ve ever spent!
<br>
<br>The first thing you notice when you start this game up is the very minimalistic design. The game plays out in very simple 2D environments that look almost like pages from a sketchbook. If you&apos;re anything like me, this might take you aback. Call me shallow, but graphics are important to me! They&apos;re not everything, but they go a long way in immersing you in the storyline. As the game unfolds, however, you realize that the simple, drab art actually matches the &quot;survivors in a war-torn city&quot; theme quite well. Before long, you&apos;re completely lost in this world.
<br>
<br>Like the art, the gameplay mechanics are simple to grasp but far deeper than they appear at first glance. You start out in your shelter--a dilapidated, abandoned house--and you notice icons over the various things you can interact with. Click on a pile of rubble, and you find some wood and nails. Open a cabinet and you find a few pieces of jewelry and a lockpick. You&apos;ll need all of these things. This isn&apos;t like Skyrim where half the stuff you find is junk, and it isn&apos;t like Fallout where you can beat the game without even dealing with the crafting components. Here, everything you find has a purpose that can save your life. Those old electrical components will be used to construct a radio that will clue you in to what&apos;s going on in the city; that empty pill casing can you be used to make critical medications later in the game. Even stuff like old books are useful. Your characters can read them to stay entertained and happy (more on that later), you can burn them for fuel to stave off the chill of winter, or you can trade them for things you need. The challenge comes in choosing what to take with you. As the game progresses, you must venture out into the city to scavenge supplies, and your squad members have very limited backpack space to carry things in. Do you bring back the the gunpowder to make the bullets you&apos;ll need to clear out the bad guys in another area, or do you pick up the food that&apos;s as scare as it is critical? Finding the right balance is essential, and you&apos;ll likely have to start over a couple times before you know what works best.
<br>
<br>No matter what style of play you choose, the game is always challenging. That&apos;s a good thing! In other games, you might just kill everyone you see and take their possessions until you build up enough wealth to coast through the game. Better them than you right? Not so here. Killing innocent characters or even stealing from them will cause your squad to suffer guilt. You&apos;ll see little thought bubbles appear of their head sharing their lament with you: &quot;Those patients at the hospital are probably going to die because of me.&quot; Kill too many non-bad guys and one of your squad members may even commit suicide. Most other reviewers are using the term &quot;pulls no punches&quot; a lot, and that&apos;s definitely true.
<br>
<br>The only drawbacks are in the minimalistic design. While it works well, you can&apos;t help but imagine how much better the game could have been with a little more depth. Since emotions play such a big role for your characters, it would be nice to have some kind of dialogue system you could use to cheer each other up, or maybe even ask for help from other non-team members. Also, there&apos;s a lot of room for the storyline to really develop and add to the emotional impact you feel. Even lacking this, however, this is still a great, challenging game. If you have $20 to spend and don&apos;t mind getting sucked into it for awhile, give it a shot!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4777290">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:Beautiful , choices really matter , hard ,makes you wonder about the suffering of civilians, stable game without bugs.
<br>
<br>Cons:Should be random.After 3 tries you know which house harbours what , the dangers , etc.. and it becomes predicable.
<br>
<br>Make room for mods!!This game has a lot of hidden potencial</span>

Not only is it an absolutely great survival game in and of itself, it is furthermore the one and only true anti-war game with a really strong message I have so far run into. It is really challenging too, different more or less every time you start a new game and does give you many options to play your save and not right out making you fail just cause the game was written in a way that certain stuff does not work. Granted, certain stuff DOES not work indeed ^^ but the fact is, that&apos;s just normal - there definitely is a thinking progress involved which adds a very nice touch to the overall experience.
<br>
<br>Personally, I so far sank around 50 hours into the game (lotsa failures, there is no tutorial by design  and I have np with that) and I can&apos;t get enough of it. All the various approaches to playing this game, one I only paid 17&#x20AC; in total for on an aside, are simply put amazing.
<br>
<br>What else can I say? The graphics suit the grittyness of the experience absolutely fine and the only little nitpick I would have is that the combat itself could be a little more fleshed out. That however is perhaps something to also think about again - while this is a war survival game, you&apos;re NOT controlling trained soldiers or so but civilians trying to survive in a war torn city. So even that can be overlooked for the most part (not that I&apos;d like this to get some more dev love down the line).
<br>
<br>Overall, like I said I can&apos;t get enough of the game and This War of Mine is simply a mature take on the topic war, no more, no less. This game is simply put amazingly fresh air to a very old game topic (war) and I hope we&apos;ll see more, much more of it down the line! I&apos;ll buy additional stuff in an instance!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4788922">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You begin with a small group of ordinary people, each having their own skills and weaknesses and try to survive through a civil war that has left you with barely no resources.  At it&apos;s core, the concept of the game is quite simple (yet innovative for all I know): during the day, you must make the best of what you have to organize your shelter in order to tend to the needs of your group while at night, you go scavenging for the resources you are in dire need of.
<br>
<br>Where all this really takes off, is how the game mechanics have been fine tuned so that each and every day, the stakes are to the max. As it is the case for any realistic survival situation, every bits of food and material is vital and must be carefully managed, every step you make while scavenging can be deadly and have irreversible consequences - this is a rogue-like game: you cannot save and everything you do generally have irreversible consequences.
<br>
<br>For instance: you must have water to cook food (per the game&apos;s mechanics, raw food is less nourishing) and given a group of four people, you hence might need a certain amount of water to feed them well. Let&apos;s say one day you forget to tend to your water collector, the raw food you have might then not be sufficient to nourish everyone in your group. Being malnourished, someone might get sick so that, on your scavenging night, instead of simply having to find a little amount of food, you now must find water, lots of food and some meds. Meds are usually rare and chances are you&apos;ll have to sneak your way in some dangerous place to find some (and perhaps even kill someone if you get caught stealing), all this because you forgot to tend to your water collector!
<br>
<br>Add to this mix a bunch of unexpected, random events such as kids begging for meds at your shelter, a friendly neighbor offering you a batch of vegetables, your well crafted survival plans can easily go south in the blinking of an eye. This is, in my opinion, what makes this game so addictive, intense, frustrating and yet deeply enjoyable.
<br>
<br>On the technical side, there are very few bugs. The graphics are a perfect fit to the game&apos;s spirit; the environments are diverse and not repetitive and while the music themes can be a bit repetitive they do create a very good atmosphere.
<br>
<br>In all, if you like survival games for the sense of vulnerability and intensity they provide, if you appreciate rogue-like games such as FTL, you will definitively love This War Of Mine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4845346">Expand</a></span>

<br>TWOM has you manage the survival of three people. At first, you&apos;ll only have very little amount of supplies in your base. But during night, you can go on a raid to loot crafting supplies, foods, medicine, etc. Some decision will be hard to make, mostly baed on humanity vs. your survival. For example, there was a one instance where i had to rob from old couple that wanted nothing but peace, and begged me to not take their stuffs. I decided to take only a little and leave a lot for them. Also, two children came knocking on our doors asking for the only bottle of medicine to help their sick mother. This was a tough decision for me, giving away the only bottle of medicine i had.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s also trading with other npcs, and you&apos;ll have to decide how much of your supplies will you trade for things you want.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4922789">Expand</a></span>

Not that violence is exclusive to our race, but its the scale and perversity have no match in the animal kingdom. So it feel always bizarre the way as mainstream games tend to paint it in such a frivolous way. Spec Ops: The Line previously made a somewhat successful attempt on dealing with the serious of the matter without digging too deep, or deep enough. This War of Mine takes things some steps further and put you in the most important, and conveniently ignored, role in a war - the civilian.
<br>
<br>Mechanically TWOM it&apos;s just your regular survival/strategy game, with a straightforward crafting system. With night and day distinctly separating the way you play. During the day you manage your base and after night falls you scavenge the city.
<br>
<br>What makes TWOM excel it&apos;s its heavy theme and the way as it makes your action relevant. There&apos;s no sugar-coating to war and the game implements brilliantly the repercussions of your actions. Murdering and robbing can apparently be the easy way out, but how will your characters emotionally react to that? And you? When you get into a situation where you have to decide between stopping a rape or face the risk of getting wounded or killed for doing so, how will you react after your decision? And if you enter a family house and after things get out of control you end up killing the family, how will you feel? In war there&apos;s the bad and the horrible... and TWON makes sure you understand that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4923121">Expand</a></span>

It gives a nice feeling of character growth but also the feeling that u are never overpowered so it keeps the tension intact. I would recommend it to any pc game fan.</span>

<br>There&apos;s something about it, when my last player commits suicide, depressed and alone, I still find myself  starting again immediately.  A sign of a great game.
<br>The game is in essence a war-time-&apos;The-sims&apos; with a great atmospheric design and very well scripted characters.  My first 5 - 10 play through s I didn&apos;t last long, choosing to instinctively steal &amp; fight, paying the heavy consequences as my people started to resent what they&apos;d become and especially those players that had murdered others.  It&apos;s war I figured, and it&apos;s a survival game - think of number 1.  In later play-through&apos;s I learnt the game plays on a fine line of balance and control.  Don&apos;t take what you don&apos;t need, and when your back is up against the wall, only then harm the status quo.
<br>Also, later run through&apos;s I pushed my crafting much further, and it&apos;s greatly rewarding.  But even with all the weapons and armour you can dream of, fighting soldiers still remains a decent challenge and tactical headspinner.
<br>The game has a few flaws, such as waiting for people to sleep off their tiredness can sometimes leave you watching 3 people in bed snoozing for 5 real-time minutes, but this seems a small price to pay for those fantastic nights of scavenging and stealing from under the enemies noses.
<br>If you see this game on sale - dont hesitate to buy it.  I&apos;d like to see an IOs and android release in the future as mentioned pre-release... as it&apos;s a game I could pick up for a train journey here n there</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4961256">Expand</a></span>

First when I downloaded, I didn&apos;t believe this game, but then this game has given me a lot of relaxation. Thanks to the developers.

<br>
<br>I did not expect the game to be so engaging and challenging ... very simple concept but very well design

<br>
<br>The game was inspired by the siege of Sarajevo during the Yogoslavian civil war during the 90&apos;s (1400+ days of siege, the worst in history) and as such you take control over a number of civilians who are trying to survive in this hellhole. That is the goal: survive. Forget trying to become rich or save a princess - getting out of it still breathing is your only priority.
<br>
<br>The game does an immense job of creating an immersion into this world, even if it just is a side-view game - the music, sounds and even pencil-scetch graphics makes the world look bleak, horrifying and washed out. It&apos;s perfect.
<br>
<br>So the game is about survival, and how you must send one person out each night to look for food and materials to increase your chances. And this is a pain, but a good pain, because anyone you send out can&apos;t carry everything. The people you have at home are hungry, cold, and one of them is sick, so what do you take? All the food? Any medicines you&apos;ve found? But if you do, will you be able to carry home any wood you need to make firewood so people won&apos;t freeze to death? It&apos;s a constant struggle to try to keep up with the demands of the people back at your shelter.
<br>
<br>Add to that that you can be raided, wounded or even killed. It&apos;s a hard life living in a war zone.
<br>
<br>It&apos;sa fantastic, amazing game, and it became even better after they included the possibility to add your own characters and in some way, make your own map from the premade locations. That added a lot of value.
<br>
<br>Now, the thing with the game is that it doesn&apos;t teach you anything. You have to discover everything yourself, and that is also something that adds to the first-time experience - even more so since you only have one save slot. And that is how it should be - if you leave all people asleep as you take one person out to find food, you might come back to a very nasty surprise, that you have been raided, things have been stolen and people been wounded. It can be a real gut-punch. And that goes for the characters as well, as they can become psychologically affected as well.
<br>
<br>I mentioned at the beginning of the review that this is a story, not a game. And it is. However, the only reason I can&apos;t give it a 10 is because the combat is too damn hard (it&apos;s fast and unforgiving) and dependant on that you can swing a mouse well and precisely - the slightest the mouse gets stuck, you&apos;ll pay for it. However, avoiding combat is encouraged and the best way to survive.
<br>
<br>All in all, I highly recommend this game, and also to give a few bucks to the charity War Child.
<br>
<br>Because even if this is a game for you, it&apos;s reality for a lot of people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=5249124">Expand</a></span>

As you play, day by day, helping your characters survive, you begin to grow close to them. You worry, because any of them might die from injury, the cold, or disease. Your characters can become depressed, suicidal, and can leave at any time. This game, called &quot;This War of Mine&quot; is by far one of the best games I&apos;ve laid my hands on. It puts you in the point of view of those affected by war- the civilians, not the military. It isn&apos;t action packed, it has no combat sequences or explosions. Instead, its the pure anxiety and emotional turmoil of trying to make these people survive for as long as you can. You scavenge for supplies by night, and by day, you make improvements to your house. You are constantly at risk for being robbed during the night, and have to put people on guard. When you venture out into the world, you can have the choice of robbing and killing people for supplies, making trade, or even  taking people in. Its kill or be killed sometimes. The fact that this game has a DLC that donates to the War Child charity makes it even all the more better. If you like story driven emotional games, grab yourself a copy of &quot;This War of Mine&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=6779345">Expand</a></span>

The game does a great job at guilt tripping you for robbing the innocent elderly couple living in a quiet cottage of all there food and medicine. Or turning those children away from your door step asking for your help to save there dying mother. Survival of the fittest is the theme and this game shows the consequences regular people get to experience in there country in times of civil conflict. Mechanics wise the game reminds me of the crafting of Terraria, character management similar to The Sims and a little but of Don&apos;t Starve meets State of Decay. I hope to see content updates and mods for sure!

You start as a group of civilians who only struggle to survive during the German and Russian oppression on Poland. I won&apos;t lie to you, the game is difficult, it will force you to make some decisions which you might regret ... first time I stole food from an old couple I started to feel awful but what made it worse is the feeling of guilt that our &quot;squad&quot; had. Hardly ever has any game moved my heart so much and I still remember that moment after you rescue &quot;the guy&quot; in the sniper place ...

<br>Personally, I believe this game deserves an award for the best indie game of this year hands down!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4728708">Expand</a></span>

Basically, you do the same things in these two games, with only three significant differences &#x2014; setting, camera and the way the characters act. Side-scrolling perspective instead of SoD&apos;s classic TPS view. You survive (fighting included), scavenge for supplies and build various things. The main difference for me is how the characters act, though. For example, during one of my scavenge runs I stumbled upon some girl, panicked and killed her with a shovel. Then my character suffered of severe depression, and his mates were very upset about it too, even to insomnia. Next time I&apos;ll meet someone, I&apos;ll try not to kill him, cause there&apos;s an opportunity to talk to strangers, or to hide from them, instead of killing.
<br>------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>And of course, the setting. I&apos;ll just say, it&apos;s making much more sense than zombie apocalypse of SoD. You can imagine this happening to you tomorrow, and that&apos;s why I give a solid 9 to this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4695321">Expand</a></span>

I find that countless have pointed out the &quot;lack of realism&quot; or &quot;quirky logic&quot; behind how the game is played and survival is achieved. The past two days have been entirely dedicated to This War of Mine; specifically whenever I had the free time to get on my laptop and give it a whirl. You&apos;ll be pleased to know that I do not regret a single minute spent. There are several things I would like to clarify regarding the game, specifically points made that I consider invalid in the negative reviews by fellow players. I&apos;ll also give my reasoning as to why (and why not) this is a worthwhile game I score at a solid 8.
<br>
<br>Having been a fan of survival-sandbox games even before they became an official genre, I have always fancied the idea of a post-apocalyptic hardcore survival game where decisions mattered. I often found myself looking towards The Walking Dead as a fix, since it gave me at least half of what I was craving, and even in games like Project Zomboid and State of Decay I found they were lacking everything I was looking for. TWoM, however, gives me what I wanted and more. While it is not in fact post-apocalyptic, it is a game which pioneers in a whole new theme: War. In my experience as a gamer, I have only ever stumbled upon survival games which either take place in the untamed wilderness, the ruins of a world ravaged by zombies, or as far back as the middle ages to the unknown future ahead of us. Instead, this game throws you into the perspective of survivors (who have feelings as normal human beings would) caught in the crossfire of a devastating war. It brings me back to learning about the siege of Leningrad in World War II, where people were boxed in by the military for years and suffered tremendously as a result. TWoM does a very good job at throwing your emotions into the mix, often pitting you against your own morals to make ends meet (it sure as hell did for me). In fact, my paranoia drove me to murder two innocent families, both of which included at least one elderly person in poor health that begged I let them go, to fetch supplies I thought I desperately needed (but in the end found out were unnecessary for my survival). That brings up another point: Unlike all other survival games I have played, there is an actual end-game goal to TWoM: You can survive the war. But it&apos;s not all that peachy, as the epilogue will find a way to make you feel just as bad for your characters as you did before (often sad stories as to their lives following the war) and giving you a sometimes painful recap of what decisions you&apos;ve made, negative or positive.
<br>Now, I have noticed a lot of people picking at the realism behind TWoM. One complaint was, &quot;Why would you need to filter rainwater? Can&apos;t you just boil it?&quot; To my understanding, this would be a yes and a no. Think about the rainwater: The city is under siege, the skies smoldering with smoke and shrapnel. The pollutants that are surely in the air, as well as the trace amounts of toxic substances in the rainwater as a result, would need to be processed to some extent before becoming truly clean. Another complaint was the &quot;constant need&quot; to produce tools that would, realistically, be readily available for a longer time than the game represents; a crowbar, for example. However, if you think about the fact that the crowbar, hatchet, and shovel are pieced together from common household goods (components: duct tape, nails, scrap, etc.), it&apos;s miraculous that these tools even last you as long as they do. If you want to talk about realism, it&apos;d make more sense that these tools broke somewhat sooner than they really do, because you&apos;d think a crowbar fashioned from these goods would snap under the stress of prying open only a single locker or two and not the generous eight or so uses you&apos;re given. Another complaint was the combat, which while generic is reasonably so. The lack of complexity almost makes it charming, and forces you to think on a more basic level as these people would. You&apos;re no commander from XCOM, you are a survivor. There are no flashbangs, overwatch shots, or variations of cover: There is life or death, fight or flight. Some have complained of crashing, but even on a low-end laptop I have not experienced this on the highest settings (which looks rather beautiful for what its worth).
<br>My only complaints regarding the game are how easy it is for NPC&apos;s to misjudge a move you make, such as the Central Square traders for some reason accusing me of a hostile action and shooting me the first time I entered, therefore banning me from those resources. Another complaint is how much ammo is wasted when you are raided and leave some behind back home: oftentimes 7-10 bullets a raid, more than you usually make from a single run. Aside from that and it&apos;s replay value (maybe 1-3 replays for me), it&apos;s a solid game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4739664">Expand</a></span>

The best and strongest part of this game as I believe I make a real connection with those virtual persons you control and try to keep alive. Well that alone is nothing groudnbreaking as already there are plenty of survival games but the emotional and moral narrative brought into the game is great. Well done 11bit studios! Well done!
<br>
<br>This game made me go sleep at 2:00 AM even though my alarm clock is set to 5:15 am. Great buy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4740876">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You can easily be guilt tripped in this game, it comes to something when the AI actually makes me feel really guilty because of what I have done.
<br>
<br>You start off with minimal supplies, a big part in this game is scavenging and obviously the key essential is survival of the fittest, people will leave you and die on you, this all will make an impact on your characters mental state (possibly even yourself).
<br>
<br>Make sure you have plenty of food, water and heat! It&apos;s not nice to die from hypothermia.
<br>
<br>Each playable character has their own unique &quot;trait&quot;, make good use of it! I completely recommend this game to anyone who likes survival games, this one is different from your usual &quot;survival&quot; genre.
<br>
<br>&quot;During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4777486">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now as your mouse moves toward that &quot;Helpful? NO&quot; button, wait. This game is not fun, but it *does not try to be fun*. In fact, it SHOULD NOT be fun. This game is about survival during a war, and survival is NOT fun. Anne Frank is not famous because her diary was a fascinating epic with interesting fleshed out characters, it is famous because it was a stark, unfiltered slice of World War II from a civilian standpoint. This War of Mine is a compelling experience for the same reason.
<br>
<br>You will be struggling for most of this game, and you will fail many times in your attempt to survive the war. Most will never succeed in actually &quot;completing&quot; the game. Food is a constant struggle, and moral quandaries abound. Stealing will upset most of your characters. Sacrificing time or supplies to help those who show up to you door appealing for help will make them more content, *sometimes*. Your survivors will constantly be hungry, tired, sick, and more. None of them are trained killers--having to kill someone has serious, serious consequences on their psyche, and they can even commit suicide if it gets to be too much.
<br>
<br>Ultimately this isn&apos;t a game I sit down to &quot;enjoy&quot;. It&apos;s not a game I pull up when I&apos;m looking to blow off some steam. It&apos;s a game that I play when I&apos;ve got time and energy set aside to have a simply memorable experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4779759">Expand</a></span>

The game begins with this quote from Hemmingway and perfectly sets the tone for this entertaining survivalist game. Made by 11 bit studios This war of mine gives the player a unique view of war, instead of running in guns blazing destroying everything in sight, you control a group of survivors in a war torn city struggling to survive amongst the damaged mess. Granted we&#x2019;ve seen more than a few survivalist/crafters lately but this war of mine has atmosphere, game play and storyline which sets it leagues apart from its competitors.
<br>
<br>Beginning the game you fade into your shelter, a partially destroyed multi level building and your 3 or 4 survivors. The atmosphere of the game is dark and has a cold feel to it as you would expect in such a situation. You begin to quickly realize time is of the essence and set your survivors to work scavenging amongst the rubble and searching rooms for supplies before night comes. When night does fall the snipers who make venturing out during daylight too dangerous sleep and you get your chance to explore beyond your shelter to broaden your search for more supplies and equipment. Wood and tools will help you build workbenches, beds and other furniture to improve your shelter while food and medical supplies will keep your survivors alive and kicking not to mention firearms and ammo for defense.
<br>
<br>The game encourages you to take care of your survivors because one wrong step while searching for supplies will leave you with a dead group member and having no save/load game option the choices you make are permanent and this adds a crucial dynamic that makes you take the game a bit more seriously, which after helplessly becoming a bit too much emotionally invested in my survivors and loosing a couple I began learning lessons very quickly, not to mention the negative morale effect this has on your other survivors as does most decisions you make, for instance your choice to rob people or turn away people seeking your help. Some will agree with your choices while others won&#x2019;t, it can be difficult pleasing everybody and managing depression amongst the group can be a time consuming task.
<br>
<br>My first attempt lasted around 9 days I&#x2019;ve found the game can become a touch repetitive after around my 20th day but it&#x2019;s usually broken up with a new survivor seeking shelter or gaining enough supplies to craft a new type of workbench opening up more options to create or build, for instance a certain type of workbench will allow your survivors to roll cigarettes which are valuable and can then be used for trade or smoked, depending on the smoking status on some of your group members. You also begin to realize at roughly this point the supplies you&#x2019;re looting may not last forever and try to make your shelter a bit more self-sustainable.
<br>
<br>Guiding my survivor in the stealth phase of night salvaging I loot what supplies I can carry, which is limited by the size of my backpack more often than not finding enough supplies to haul away my survivor. Marko is my professional scavenger so he is able to carry more supplies than others in my shelter. I click to the location I wish for him to move e.g. A doorway where I can peer through a keyhole, doing so will pierce the charcoal sketch effect which is the games fog of war, very artistic and refreshing compared to a simple black or greyed out area.
<br>In the distance I hear the familiar sound of war, the games ambient sound is spot on, gun shots an explosions ringing out in the background keeping me reminded of my situation, and music blends very well with the relevant situation you&#x2019;re in. The control interface is a point, click and scroll, which blends well with the 2D layout.
<br>
<br>I&#x2019;ve found that after 5 or 6 decent slogs at this war of mine you begin to get the feeling you may be too much of a master survivor for the game. However it is accomplishing and satisfying to see that after a few games your progress of achieving certain milestones improves, what used to take me 14 days to achieve now takes me 7.  Every new game seems to start you off with a randomly generated group of survivors although this doesn&#x2019;t really change the basic strategy of the game.
<br>
<br>Conclusion.
<br>
<br>This War of mine is an addictive game that will unsuspectingly bleed hours from your life However when the apocalypse does finally roll around you&#x2019;ll be glad you&#x2019;ve got some experience under your belt from this highly entertaining title.
<br>Although based around resource management the atmosphere of this war of mine makes the experience so much more. The game will place you in situations and force you to make decisions that almost make you feel as though you&#x2019;re in the situation yourself. Also 11 bit studios have teamed up with war child a charity that helps protect children from the effects of war together creating a fundraising partnership. A worthy cause, which gamers can get behind.

The problems - well it may feal unfair and harsh, but your a civilian cought in a war, this is how it is supposed to be. And you are supposed to die. I give it a 10 mainly because of its significance, pure gameplay score would be 8.</span>

<br>It also has some pretty solid AI. Rather, the AI is random, per say. There is no set currency, no set money system, no set value. It all depends on who you are trading with.
<br>How the AI reacts to you is based on logic. An old person didnt attack me while i was looting his house because i had a knife, while a dude blew my brains out because I was near his ill mother.
<br>The base building is solid,too. This is my base. There are many like it, but this is mine.
<br>I really dig the graphics. Some times its a bit hard to make out stuff, but i love it for this all the more.
<br>Anyway, this is the short version. Maybe i&apos;ll add a longer version, but if you take away nothing else from this review, take away this:This game is one of the best games to come out this year. I wouldn&apos;t doubt it&apos;ll overtake any number of GoTY canidates, and it sure as hell did overtake mine.

<br>
<br>Player controls 3-4 characters. The focus of the game is to fortify and upgrade your house, while striving to feed and keep your poor inhabitants healthy and unfrozen during the day. And survive and loot during the night. The game executes it&apos;s core mechanics rather well and is quite addictive. Art style and atmosphere of the game is very immersive.
<br>
<br>The game is rather hard until one figures out it&apos;s mechanics. When you know what to build, and what is valuable you basically cannot loose and don&apos;t have to take any risks. You don&apos;t have to steal or kill anybody. Therefore it doesn&apos;t have very good re-playability factor. It&apos;ll take player 20-30 hours to figure the game completely, after that it gets tedious and boring, especially during day time you start to question game design choices when you are done in few clicks, and can&apos;t skip to the night part (the choice is available), because you have to refill you water collecting machine. And you just have to watch and wait for 10 minutes for the day cycle to end. The combat system is very quirky and confusing. Because combat is very rare and you don&apos;t have the save/load option, it can be nerve wrecking experience. Luckily you can avoid this aspect of the game entirely.
<br>
<br>Otherwise the game is well executed and leaves the player wishing for sequel, with more content, and more choices including rpg char development etc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4708126">Expand</a></span>

<br>As a i read different reviews i see most of them focus on the sad outcome of the story. Characters who die, others that get depressed or ashamed for robbing. But that is not all there is. In my second experience i was able to make a comfortable refuge and the characters response is always about hope and escaping the horrors of war.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4747963">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Visuals:Not much to say.For me personally the artdesign is just great.Everything blends into one unique style.This is not a bad looking game i think.Its dark with some spots of colour here and there.The mood of the game is really well presented and you feel and see when something changes.Youll see snow falling or rain for example your characters react to the situation differently.For example you can see when they are really tired or sometimes youll see them reading a book and stuff.Great!Some of the backrounds are really great!
<br>
<br>Sound:Pretty nice!Not that much but i dont think thats because the developer is lazy.Its because it suits the situation.When there is music its always suitable and really nice.Nothing disturbs you from what is happening and the heavy things you are gonna have to do to survive.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:The gameplay is simplistic and maybe you can bring up some critic!First of all, the movement is nice.You sneak with a single click or run with a double click.Running makes more noises, attracts bandits and stuff.Nicely done.What is really nice is the fact you can choose different paths of actions.For example you could shoot your way through a bunch of bad guys, maybe sneak around them on various paths or you use stealth to kill them off one by one.Great!!!Unfortunately the close combat is a bit of a pain in the arse.You need to click on a icon and with the weaker weapons the enemy will be pushed around instead of being killed instantly.That makes is hard to hit this button sometimes.On my first playthrough i lost a character this way, simple missclick.Besides that there are some levels with nice ideas.For example a map  with a siper in the backround.You cant eliminate him as far as is know so you have to move from cover to cover and time your runnings to his (hopefully)missshots.Good ideas.
<br>I have some complaints about certain tools.Some are overpowered, others are useless.On 2 playthroughs i NEVER used a shovel really long.I tried the shovel, you safe time but for the materials you lose you could have build something usefull.The axe on the other hand is mighty as thors hammer!!
<br>You build the axe and you kill many opponents instantly while you can hack things to pieces and salvage wood and materials.I never run out of things to burn for the oven because of that.Another thing that i think should be rebalanced is the amount of things you need to upgrade you workstations.Sometimes its so expensive that the **** you can build after the upgrade will be less valuable than you think because you spend so much **** on the upgrade itself.On my playthroughs i never run out on things in the longterm.Every now and then youll find stuff that is useless for you, you can trade it in.Sometimes this is the better option.As far as i know many things are random when you start the game.Problem is, on my first playthrough i encountered some events in a quick succession and my characters were really sad in the early stages.There were kids that want medicine(i had none) and a beggar that wanted food(had non either).Both events had a really drastic impact on my team.On the second playthrough i was lucky, nearly nothing happened.So there is a bit of luck involed with these things.Its good for replayability but if you just want to play 1 or 2 times this can be frustraiting.
<br>
<br>Final verdict:Great game!!!The best i played in 2014 so far.The things i mentioned are more or less nitpicking, they dont have a great amount of impact on the fun youll have.Or, and maybe thats the point, youll have no fun at all!!!!This game is not really about fun.Its about surviving and harsh decisions.Will you rob an elderly couple and let them starve to death afterwards?Think about the possible consequences.Will i help the woman that is about to get raped by a military?Think about the possibe backlash.I like that, 8/10 because of the minor things i didnt like.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4778830">Expand</a></span>

I appreciate its intentions, but it ends being bland and not that realistic.
<br>Yes, the graphics are beautiful. And yes, the grittiness of war from a civilian&apos;s perspective (though lets not forget that there are places where wars are much worse) is sometimes present, in the stories and in some events. But the gameplay feels almost casual and severely breaks the immersivity and the overall tone. The crafting system is shallow. Time needs to be well managed but is presented in a weird way where your characters, even while running, can take up to 20 minutes to climb a couple of stairs. The save system straightforwardly sucks. If you try to leave the game while playing, nothing warns you that you&apos;ll lose everything you did during the day and will have to restart it, which is exactly what happens.
<br>And then there&apos;s all the stuff that breaks realism by itself. Like your group having psychic powers and knowing everything a single member does when on a scavenge mission, even if he was alone and far away. Like a guy asking me for medicines for his father, me trading with wood instead, and all the team (thanks to their psychic powers) thinking I gave him medicine and being happy for that. Like my group being composed of 4 healthy rested people that are very hungry, and only one member being able to go out to scavenge. Like interaction icons sometimes superimposing themselves and me clicking the wrong one (which was actually below the correct one, so bug) and ending up in a fight instead than a conversation, which in a game where choices matter is kind of a deal-breaker. Things like that.
<br>Oh, and the randomized world. It&apos;s not really randomized. Simply you&apos;ll get different characters if you restart, and sometimes some areas will be inhabited by different people.
<br>In short, again I appreciate the intentions, but This War of Mine ends up being one of those zombie survival games that we already saw tons of times. And this is not me ignoring the realistic intentions behind the operation: this is me being forced to ignore them by way the game was done. I&apos;d say that the devs put a lot of effort in making the graphics and the background atmospheric, and they did succeed there. But then the rest just falls short. Still, maybe it&apos;s just me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4703982">Expand</a></span>

Instead of portraying the military or even the rebels as an good force, This War of Mine portrays the people caught in between and views both sides of the conflict as equally bad. This game reminds me of State of decay mixed in with Mark of the Ninja. In the day time, you spend time building tools for night, feeding your people, responding to people knocking on your door, upgrading your base etc. In the night , one person in your party can go out and scavenge for supplies. The amount that one person can carry is extremely limited and the game doesn&apos;t hold back any punches.
<br>-Should you get bandages for one of your members injured in a raid or get wood to build an herbicide to make bandages?
<br>-Should you get food or get wood and hope that your people can go hungry one more night?
<br>-Should you waste 1 out of your 10 backpack slots for some sugar that you could use to make alcohol later or instead invest it in getting gun parts?
<br>This part is where the game shines, forcing you to make tough decisions. There are many tough decisions that tore me up such as choosing whether to kill an elderly couple for their food and medical supplies or risking another day without food. The combat is mediocre, it&apos;s essentially just clicking on the person your attacking. Eventually, you start to care more and more about your characters as they go through life changing decisions. An character you have murder an old couple might become sad, then depressed, causing the rest of your party to become sad as well. They might even kill themselves, depressing the party even more.
<br>The game holds no punches and constantly throws problems in your face, from your members always being sick to injuries that constantly get worse. It&apos;s hard to get supplies to upgrade and even harder to find food but when you do begin to thrive and survive, it feels amazing.
<br>
<br>An Solid 9/10- The score is lowered because of a bit of repetitiveness and an mediocre combat system.
<br>
<br>NOTE-Again, this game is not for the casual gamer, there is no save slots, just auto save. The game saves at the beginning of each day so if one of your party members die.....their dead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4705427">Expand</a></span>

Not DayZ, not H1Z1, This War of Mine.
<br>The game follows an almost roguelike story of a group of 3 survivors trapped in a ramshackle house. A civil war rages, threatening to tear the city apart by the seams. But, this isn&apos;t part of your little world. You focus only on the survival of your pieces of 1&apos;s and 0&apos;s called survivors and the status of other 1&apos;s and 0&apos;s called NPC&apos;s. One problem: The game lacks ambience. The only sounds are the occasional gunshot or mortar blast in the background, or the characters droning on and on about the same thing.
<br>It may be odd how I mention that the characters are all pieces of binary, but it&apos;s because the game makes you so damn attached to them. You&apos;ll develop stories about how your obese crackhead drunk killed off 5 bandits with a pistol and a broken bottle, or how you saved a skinny 10 year old from starvation. The game immerses you in its situation like a black hole in a mirror. This game is hard to describe, so I&apos;ll put it the way I understand it best. If you&apos;ve ever seen a player in DayZ, you know that there&apos;s a certain morality to the encounter. You think to yourself &quot;Should I kill this innocent survivor for his tin of beans,&quot; or &quot;Should I trade my spare medicine for a few precious Mosin rounds&quot; or even &quot;When should I shoot him and spend the day wiping the brain matter off his pack?&quot; This War of Mine takes this, and amplifies it. Since you take the roll of a group of civilians and not crack military soldiers, your survivors are prone to what I like to call &quot;PTSD Attacks&quot;. Say you kill a guy who notices you stealing his ganja. When you get back, your character will tell his friends &quot;I feel bad. I had to kill a guy&quot;. This causes almost all of your survivors to enter a state of sadness or even depression, constantly saying &quot;I know _____ HAD to kill him, but it still sucks&quot; or &quot;We&apos;re killing people now.. what have we become?&quot; When this happened, I almost smacked myself in the face for even thinking of stealing from the man trying to nurse his ill grandparents back to health.  This is everything about war except for war. It&apos;s like experiencing WWII from the perspective of a Russian civilian who has lost everything to the German offensive.
<br>Sometimes, your characters will be so deeply troubled by their actions that they&apos;ll resort to smoking or drinking to ease the pain. This game is subtly realistic with the consequences of these actions, and it never pulls any punches. I think the only problem with This War of Mine is on a personal standpoint where it literally hurt to play because I knew that one **** up could destroy that delicate stack of cards, and most would land in a fireplace and burn me house down. This is ESPECIALLY true if you lose a talented scavenger. The game can only get a 9/10 because it&apos;s TOO punishing. If you lose a Scavenger in the field, you might as well start save scumming or just reset, because you&apos;re **** You&apos;ll lose a member of the team who could work during the day, who could scavenge during the night, and the morale of your survivors will plummet. Most will become alcoholics or drug addicts, and you will almost NEVER recover from it. It isn&apos;t realistic, it&apos;s unfair. Beyond that, the rest of the game is nice. Combat&apos;s a **** the controls are clunky and stealth feels unusual. If this had used Mark of the Ninja&apos;s stealth system, it would be the renaissance of 2D stealth &apos;em ups. But, between the punishment for death and the high chance of death in the field, the game falls a bit short. You don&apos;t come for the gameplay, you come for the interactive story. It&apos;s like a book you can interact with, except the book will leave a permanent scar in your brain. Gameplay isn&apos;t bad, but the story is definitely the main man in this emo carnival of a depressing game.
<br>TL;DR A game of psychology where everything is out to damage your morality until you turn into a monster, physically, mentally and morally. One problem, though. The game lacks ambience, and the characters can get pretty stupid sometimes. I had a character put about 7 pieces of wood in the furnace to heat my guys up, and then he said &quot;You could catch a chill it&apos;s so damn cold in here&quot;. 2 seconds later, he says &quot;I&apos;m glad it&apos;s not cold in here.&quot; I laughed so hard, until it happened about 9 more times within the next 2 hours. These are only minor, and take away very slightly from the immersion. But, if you can&apos;t get immersed to Terraria, how are you going to get immersed to a 2D game? It draws you in well, but you always feel like a spectator or a little imp on your characters backs telling them what to do. Still, a grand game that shows a Video Game&apos;s potential to deliver emotion on a Shakespearian level. To quote GLaDOS from Portal, &quot;What have you become?

<br>Absolutely amazing art style and soundtrack (even if it can get slightly repetitive). Definitely a contender if not an early victor for the Indie game of the year! Absolutely astonishing.

This war of mine shows war uglier than many other games before.
<br>
<br>My problem with this game is - i am terrible at survival games. I would like to compare it to like - &quot;Don&apos;t Starve&quot; ... collecting stuff, making stuff, prioterizing - and always be in need for something.
<br>
<br>What this game shows very nicely is that no... food and water is not enough to live. It may be enough to survive, but not to make it through. - Soon the needs of the small band of survivers become complex, yet not fancy.
<br>
<br>But the game is not perfect ( well, no game really is ) - a very very essential part of survival misses. - the ability to really get into dialogue with others. A really &quot;good&quot; dialogue and diplomacy system would have been too much to expect of course, not even AAA titles manage to do that in even remote satisfaction. But a little more than what &quot;this war of mine&quot; offers may have been good.
<br>
<br>a good 7/10 from me - and the hope that a sequel can improve on this very exciting subject that this game touches - one day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4733438">Expand</a></span>

You must balance your group&apos;s very limited resources to survive, whether through violence, bartering, or stealing you need to do whatever you have to in order to keep going. Each group member brings a different skillset to contribute to the group and the random starting characters is a nice setup. It will take an initial play through to understand some of the mechanics, I wasted more than a few resources building an herb garden and a heater several weeks before I ever needed them. And some of the craft items are of very dubious usefulness, the cost of building an herb garden, plus the cost of fertilizer, and tons water will only yield a handful of herbs which then cost components to build junk cigarettes. So there&apos;s definitely a little bit of balancing improvements that could be made there. The game is easy to grasp and it lands the sweet spot, it&apos;s challenging but not aggravating (much unlike the brutal and similar title Gods Will Be Watching). The artwork is beautiful, but a little bit laggy, I had to lower the graphics setting even on my 2014 Mac desktop. This game is definitely worth the time and money. I hope to see more, and I think with a bit of extra work this could go from a solid game to a classic.
<br>
<br>Like most minimalist style games there are more than a few vague interactions and my characters have paid a price for several misclicks. It&apos;s not always clear why I can open some boarded doors with a crowbar, but not others. And it would help if the various scavenging locations were randomly generated, right now they seem to always have the same basic floor plan, which limits replay-ability.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4753395">Expand</a></span>

Music and atmosphere is great. Graphics are great too. You feel somehow attached to the characters after a while and their suffer will become part of yours during the journey which is good for a survival game. Its challenging, you&apos;ll have to deal with different situations and at a times make choices that will keep you thinking for a moment. Should you save the food or share? Would you steal? Would you kill a stranger to save one of your owns?
<br>
<br>Some mechanics should be reworked like getting water and tools endurance. Another aspect that needs balancing is the good/evil &quot;path&quot;. Taking one or the other could over-complicate things to the point where choices become more obvious.
<br>
<br>Overall a very good and solid survival game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4787822">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is unique. I had tons of fun for a while. My only issue with the game is that I wish they put a little more work into it. The buildings I could raid/explore were limited. Having to feed your party gets tedious. They might as well have made the gamer have to relieve the survivor&apos;s bladders. Waiting for the days to end was tedious. Having to start with three random party members was unnecessary as it just causes the gamer to have to create constant new games until they get the party they desired.
<br>
<br>In short. The game is fun but it felt kind of beta-ish. The devs need to add more options/items/locations. I&apos;d honestly value this game at $10 - $15 the way it currently stands.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4790310">Expand</a></span>

The game is challenging and the dark atmosphere really catches the point of what war does to people. I hope the developers add more things to the game like more random events and new places or just make an expansion.</span>

It&apos;s a very impressive title for what is a very simple concept.
<br>
<br>The game sees you taking control of a three-man team planted in a safehouse in the middle of a war-torn and depressing city. The house is your safe haven away from the dangerous outside world. In the daytime; you control your characters to craft, sleep, scavenge and protect the property but when the night arrives; the game comes alive as you will prepare and take one of your team into the world to loot for supplies and liase with fellow surviors of the war. The map contains several locations you can visit from other houses, schools, churches, warehouses, hostpitals and even brothels. On your travels, you must use your time wisely to search for essential items and make tough decisions on stealing and possibly having to harm fellow humans in the same position as you. Bandits also lurk in these vast locations so you have to approach each situation and location with considerable care for your character.
<br>
<br>If you survive your trip; you complete a &apos;day&apos; in the game and return home to distribute your collected loot including medicine, crafting items, food, drink and other goods. Your character may be extremely tired so you can put him/her to bed and take control of a different person to sift through your scavenged stuff and prepare for the next night&apos;s trip. This is just one typical day of an ongoing cycle in which you must scavenge, survive and maintain the well-being of your team physically and mentally. As the days pass; loot can be harder to find, your characters may become more and more disillusioned with the trials and tribulations of war and keeping them alive within the difficult conditions and in respect to bandits roaming can get tougher and tougher. It all makes for a truly absorbing and challenging title.
<br>
<br>This War of Mine isn&apos;t without it&apos;s problems though - there is no &apos;endless&apos; mode so on completion; you may not feel motivated to play again as you&apos;ve essentially beaten the game. The items available and crafting probably doesn&apos;t go deep enough either. The combat can be a bit cumbersome and in terms of the locations available to visit; there probably isn&apos;t quite enough. It is a big game that could keep you occupied for many hours but there is a chance you could have seen it all very early on in terms of everything on offer. Replayability is certainly questionable at this time.
<br>
<br>Overall; this is a fantastic game at a very generous price. It&apos;s a survival game that distances itself from the typical zombie-oriented titles that plague Steam these days. Not only is this centralised around war as opposed to an outbreak; the artistic 2D backdrop is a truly unique setting along with the basic but easy to use mechanics. Longevity and content may be an issue but even if you get 10 hours out of this game; it&apos;s a fantastic purchase and a great concept.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4874911">Expand</a></span>

Within this survival game, they force you to make tough decisions to survive. Like stealing from the elderly and killing people who were quite literally your neighbors before the war. It&apos;s a dark and depressing state of affairs within the game and, honestly, it sets itself apart from alot of other titles in the genre because of that. The game is not afraid to show you the absolute horrors of war and things that might be seen as taboo in other games. It can be difficult to play this game for more than a few hours because of that. However, the gameplay here is good. You have to scavenge for supplies at night, while defending your shelter from attack, then build up your shelter during the day with those supplies. All the while juggling eating, sleeping, and helping the people around you. The graphics are both good and bad in my opinion. It uses a pencil shading technique in places you haven&apos;t seen yet, which gives it a comic book feel to it. However, the graphics themselves are not that good. I wish the game had been given a little more polish in that department.
<br>In the end though, the game is very powerful and will make you want to play it again and again to see the endings and maybe try it again with a different set of survivors. The game is very slow, however, and that&apos;s probably the biggest knock against it. The pace is not one suited for your typical CoD fanboy or anyone who can&apos;t sit still for awhile. But it&apos;s still a great game and one I would definitely recommend people play at some point, just to see the atmosphere that the game establishes. Remember that this is definitely not a fun game though. It&apos;s more about the overall experience than anything else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4879143">Expand</a></span>

Combat is a little tricky without proper explanation on how stealth and combat works, I&apos;ve died a couple times just experimenting. Death of a character has a high penalty you will probably lose a good scavenger and all the items you collected and along with everything you sent with him, also all your other characters will cry about it forever and it will be a hard burden to overcome. Resources are hard to maintain as there is always a bigger trade-off to your disadvantage, once you clean out the easy places and you get desperate for the harder places you can start losing characters pretty easily. Once everything goes to the crapper, you then need to decide to start all over again, but the journey is long and the game is too repetitive to keep restarting over whilst keeping things &#x201C;fun&#x201D;. It would really have helped to have a save mode to allow players to backtrack and learn from their experiences then go ahead and play a &quot;hard mode&quot; version without saves in the future, but NOPE bad developer decisions again but every game has some...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4706390">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is challenging and surprisingly moving. The hard choices feel more real and much stronger compared to a zombie game, for obvious reasons. I found myself conflicted about whether i was planning to rob at gunpoint a helpless elderly couple for their food, or whether they were just a game&apos;s NPCs, and i was simply getting free virtual supplies in a virtual environment. I still decided against it. Feeling good for doing the right thing felt better than feeling good for &quot;winning&quot; the game. It&apos;s a shockingly valuable lesson no games has managed to provide so far, hence my high score for it.
<br>My only gripe with it is that character dynamics are unclear, which can cost the precious life and supplies of your scavenger. More than once, while simply exploring or attempting to trade with someone, i ended up being killed by them, apparently for &quot;trespassing&quot; on an invisible limit in their abodes. I wish the NPCs would warn you more clearly about when you are intruding on them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4702740">Expand</a></span>

I liked design , idea, music,some features, but gameplay ._.....It is so poor for 2014 , for 2d game...
<br>I know, everyone here sitting praising it lala... But there is so much **** Whole game I felt trolled. After many tries , more than 18-24 days I could not survive.  The so called &quot; balance&quot; system is **** you need wood  to survive cold (wooden door?nope ,cant touch this! mb those boxes or shelves or even just a **** tree outside? nope , cant touch dis!) why you are talking about survival when i&apos;m surrounded by **** wood ,but oh no game says i can only **** up my bed to survive, nothing else. Anything else demand just huge amount of resources (and i mean a ton),  just to get a **** garden for vegetables you spend almost same amount of stuff to create a **** mini cooper. You cant move beds, workbench and even a **** wooden chair!!!   Don&apos;t dare to fight , your people (except  Roman) are like teletubbes , slow stupid and weak, if you wont do backstab to kill someone you are dead or heavely wounded and probably will die. You cant survive being a good guy, nope , or **** or dead. All tries to beat this game I tried to be **** ass minimum as i can, steal from old , but give to children, give meds to father, kill rapist. And yet 20-24 is max I survived, so yea , to win this you need to be A **** GHOUL/VAMPIRE SS GENERAL. And there is a ton of more **** like this,Im not even talking about how game on purpose poisons someone, to make you loose ****.
<br>And yes , my biggest complain, A **** SCAVENGE, you can send only one person to only one location! This  was so much fire in my ass, okok you can send only one to guy to loot, because you have got 2 left ( 1 sleeps , other is on guard), I get it, but why you cant send 2 people when you have team of 4, whyyyyyy. And if you get all stuff you need from one location in 1 hour and you have spare 6-7 hours left, why cant you go to other location, maybe not to loot a lot , because you don&apos;t have time for it, but at least take the best or first you see and learn about it. Why ? Why you could not add it, it would make so much sense , Without it game becomes just a choice from what you will die off , cold ,lack of meds or food. Its not balance , its trolling. If one out of 3 dies, they all just die too , there is almost no chance to save situation, because both will get depressed and just whine no matter what (radio, food , music, guitar, meds) , nope , suicide,and surviving alone in this game has no chance.
<br>BUT WHY? Creators could do so much more with this,  I was left with just sadness, I wanted we could do more, more to change, have an actual impact, have choices and actual opinions of survivors, ability to become a loner and trade running around the place, get a gang and middle finger army and rebels, or join one of them , so war would end faster. create ally houses . This have endless potential, an actual survival, buy sadly It is just a little mini game on emotions, with borders on every movement . For example Dont starve is close to this mechanic, but It gives you exact explanation what you use, what you should use and fair amount  of how much,this game doesn&apos;t have balance, just making game hard on purpose so that everyone would just suffer to beat it and probably wont.
<br>In sum-up, Even with those minuses this game is good and I hope it will succeed ,so  they would create a sequel without my found problems</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4704291">Expand</a></span>

From the art to the game play to the music, &apos;grim&apos; was appropriately rehashed over and over throughout the game. I greatly appreciated the challenge the game presented through its game-play, especially if you&apos;re planning to be a moral paragon. Given the harsh reality of war, adherence to one&apos;s morals is no doubt difficult, thus creating the difficulty within the game.
<br>
<br>Furthermore, even if you do decide to abandon your morality in favour of the easy way out, your characters are &apos;real&apos;, &apos;ordinary&apos; people who WILL be impacted by your decisions. However, at the same time, deciding to stay true to your morals doesn&apos;t always bring you the food and materials you require to survive. So what do you do to make it to the end? That&apos;s what this game is about, and that&apos;s what makes it challenging.
<br>
<br>Personally, I love challenges, and I enjoyed the art and music, so even though I must confess the game got somewhat boring and repetitive by the later stages, I still deem it good overall.
<br>
<br>Additionally, there is some replayability, largely due to the randomised starting party and time period (Summer or Winter) and even a randomised map, all of which will have repercussions on how you will be playing (to some extent).
<br>
<br>--
<br>
<br>That said, I have several gripes about the game. The music. Unless I&apos;m mistaken, there are probably only about two distinctive tracks played and replayed throughout. While the grimness of the music and the art style is a wonderful fit, I don&apos;t approve of repeating the music over and over. There are events that characterize certain days, so why not make a different theme to fit those days rather than to simply reuse the same theme?
<br>
<br>I do believe more crafting options would be much appreciated. Perhaps, to be in keeping with reality, there could be a character that is some kind of handyman, and these new crafting options have to be discovered through design schematics, or something. Naturally that requires a new location, like a factory of some sort. A possibility that could have been explored, but too bad it didn&apos;t appear here.
<br>
<br>Also do note this about the &apos;randomized&apos; point above. As far as &apos;random&apos; goes, I don&apos;t think there are many possibilities, so after a few tries, you&apos;ll begin to recognize some of these events. I suppose there&apos;s a limit to how many possibilities they could create after all.
<br>
<br>All in all, this is something I would recommend, only if you&apos;re fine with the game play. As far as game play goes, it&apos;s largely the challenge of making the right decisions to make sure your characters survive. Other than that, it&apos;s point-and-click your way to victory (or death). I would strongly encourage you to check out gameplay videos before making any purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4735381">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Resource management, stealth, tactics and action all come together to make gameplay feel so good. There isn&apos;t explosions going off in every direction, there isn&apos;t flashy colours or shouting, it&apos;s a slow-paced game told at a pace to help tell the story and the characters in it, which I love. I think the most tense I&apos;ve ever found a game is this, when you&apos;re desperate for food, you&apos;ve gone to a dangerous place to find some meat and you&apos;re trying to quietly search a house without the crazy bandits hearing you and killing you. THAT. IS. TENSE. Buy this game, it&apos;s an experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4781760">Expand</a></span>

<br>Gathering resources</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Wow what a depressing limited game, the actual game play elements are ok but you need to gather so many mats to build items and doing this you need leave your home and scavenging with very limed carrying space  when you have filled your limited backpack you go home, this imo is where the game  falls down ever more as it becomes totally RNG, and out of your hands..,
<br>
<br>Gathering resources items from around the map, avoiding other scavengers and what you do with this items  is in your control
<br>but the night time change over isn&apos;t..
<br>
<br>Let me explain, each night a random thing will happen, sometime nothing, but mostly you get attacked, this can be reduced
<br>by boarding up windows and making weapons, basically using up stuff that you need to make other stuff with..
<br>
<br>Well that&apos;s fine and after a few times and resets you get the hang of it, but as the day go on and food, bandages etc get very limited the night time RNG get worse..
<br>
<br>on the second night one of my guy was slightly wounded, so I bound him and kept him in bed, he would never recover, just stayed ill an got worse and worse, I kept on trying to heal him, feed him, but nothing.
<br>
<br>And everyone was sad due to this.. The RNG night-time info screen told me the sick guy and some other guy had a fight, now the sick guy was already terminal , so this new outcome change everyone&apos;s mood from  sad to depressed and even with the radio, Cigs and Coffee, they just wouldn&apos;t stop being depressed, then on the next time, the terminally ill guy that everyone was worrying about, that couldn&apos;t barely walk, robbed us and took all the food and medical supplies, this was too much for the girl of the group and just become &quot; Broken &quot; and wouldn&apos;t move...
<br>
<br>This guy couldn&apos;t of ben stretchered out let alone rob us
<br>
<br>Games are meant to be fun, this is like sitting is an ice cold bath, slowly cutting your wrists with a rusty razor,
<br>
<br>-- Uninstalled-- terribly made game.

This War of Mine starts off sort of interesting but even after a few hours becomes really dull and flat. Just like being a survivor in a war torn town - it is a struggle and boring. The people in this game are really like old Sims (flat) and the game has so many limits to it. For example you can only send one guy out to scavenge even if others are ready to go. When you are at home others come to the door to trade but you can go out until night. The developers never really throw you a bone and let you &quot;discover&quot; or do anything other that just get by. So as the game drags on you seem to get caught (and killed) while you are out. If you kill someone then everyone is depressed and your characters even become broken. Just save your money and buy a game that is fun. I am old and boring and still I got way bored by this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4715960">Expand</a></span>

What you get is annoyed with how they move, the limited interaction options, a &apos;realistic&apos; side-scroller (and oxymoron itself), limited choices, and stupid decisions the characters make when left on their own.
<br>Rubble and rebar everywhere but don&apos;t expect to be smart enough to make good use of them.
<br>Again, a commendable idea but should have been executed using gameplay similar to State of Decay. I must admit the side-scroller idea alone knocked off 3 points for me.
<br>Give it a try if you don&apos;t care much about graphics and like games that are more like work than games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4726119">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>1. Can&apos;t relocate.  Player Characters come across obviously better homes with less damage &amp; safer areas.  The game needs a Relocate choice added to scavenge/guard/sleep menu.
<br>
<br>This option would select all player characters  at once for relocation (greys out all other choices).  Then they have the option of where to move too, and as a team attack &amp; take over a new building &amp; make that the home base.  The benefit is a new home base, the cost would be each player can only fill up their backpack.  Everything else is left behind and lost.  This is a huge flaw as it would be silly for player characters to stay in a bad building if better buildings can be taken.
<br>
<br>2. No attack ability on wandering traders.  No deception from traders just showing up and shooting your characters in the head.
<br>
<br>Lastly, having characters commit suicide too easily - if they are just &apos;hungry&apos; and &apos;tired&apos; - some consideration should be given to the character&apos;s total overall condition.
<br>
<br>I traded to finally get ahead of the hunger, having a character well fed, with a remaining food supply, well rested &amp; actually running a profitable still business - only to have him hang himself.  He was supposed to be fighting to be reunited with his wife &amp; children outside of the city !  I could understand how starving &amp; exhausted characters might randomly suicide.  But well fed &amp; rested characters should get a protection bonus against self termination.
<br>
<br>Fix these three problems &amp; add in 8 more houses... cities are very large - abandoned shops, banks, and other types of buildings are misding from the game and must be added in.  (And it would be great for characters to move into non-house buildings !)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4893988">Expand</a></span>

<br>Even leaving the game through normal methods (which is far more rare than the game just involuntarily crashing you out) the game NEVER properly saves your progress, I&apos;ll meet a new character and have them join my party, just to leave through voluntary menu actions, come back and I&apos;m on the entire day before.  It&apos;s a joke of game to be released and not still considered beta, or I would argue even alpha.
<br>
<br>Even if all the bugs were fixed, it&apos;s still a mediocre game with a good message.  Probably a 7/10 if the bugs ever get fixed.  It&apos;s just your run of the mill unoriginal crafting and trading system mixed with some elements of terraria and dwarf fortress.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4720750">Expand</a></span>

Over all a lot of thought seems to have gone into it. I know some say things may not be realistic (like why not scavenge with more than one person) but I think all the &quot;unrealities&quot; were in the spirit of balancing the game and making it make sense form a play mechanics point of view. Say what you will but the game does give you a real sense of desperation and barely survival. Played it first to 13 days (failed), then to 21 (failed), then to 42 (survived to end) by the skin of my teeth. It fun to play over and over to see how much more you can dominate and maybe eve take over that military base. Of the 25+ games I played this year, many of which are AAA titles, I think I enjoyed this the most so far. We&apos;ll see if Farcry 4 or Assassin&apos;s Creed Unity changes that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4758550">Expand</a></span>

<br>Things just takes too long to do. It&apos;s a bit slow. E.g. building things, gather materials, even running around in the house - are some of the things.

<br>With that said, this is by far a bad game.

This War of Mine is a fun little game where you need to gather supplies, help people out, try not to get killed, and just generally survive through the war. Things get hard when people get depressed, sick, or bandits come in during the night and take your stuff.</span>

As if that was not enough, the game has this art and music immersion that creates an atmosphere that locks you in. I can&apos;t recall another game where you can have the characters play guitars. The game literally sparkles with the human spirit! And, now they&apos;ve added custom scenarios.

I fell under the one-more-turn spell and couldn&apos;t stop. It&apos;s a grim game and that&apos;s what makes it so compelling. You are controlling a group of survivors, managing resources, and kinda building a little economy in this run down building. What is great is that the game won&apos;t play out the same for everyone. I used one of my characters to kill civilians to take their goods but he couldn&apos;t handle his emotions and ran away. Another one got shot and killed stealing from armed men. Then yet another died from disease. I was left with two characters, who I happened to have started with, and on what turned out to be the last day of the war my entire situation was bleak and they were massively depressed so I had them console each other. It was a randomly great way to end my playthrough. A lot of different things could have happened and there is definitely replay value in going back and choosing what characters to start with and approaching things differently but Idk if I want to replay this game. I really like my own story and I want to keep it at that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=6073074">Expand</a></span>

However the gameplay is very limited (too few actions available for characters) and frustrating. In the core there is &quot;Don&apos;t starve&quot;/&quot;Minecraft&quot;-like crafting system. You run around locations and loot items from containers, to produce stuff out of those items, then use the produced items to produce some more items, of which a few you need to consume regularly. Most of the time you need to sneak, and sometimes you fight. The GUI is optimized for iPads, not PC. What spoils the experience the most is the lack of consistency: some NPCs decide to let you loot all containers, some let you grab stuff only from those without a &quot;private&quot; label and attack you if you take items with such a label, some follow you around with a shotgun aimed at you without attacking, some attack you on sight even before you examine any container. In such an inconsistent game a proper save feature would be a must (if you didn&apos;t expect something or encounter a game bug, you reload), but there is no save/reload. I dropped this game after 2 attempts. After a while I read a walkthru somewhere, only to find out that the game is even more inconsistent than I thought (like &quot;this guy will attack you, that guy won&apos;t, oh wait there was a bug in an older version but now they fixed it&quot; and so on). Sorry guys, but I just don&apos;t have the time to play the whole game thru to just learn what each of your NPCs is scripted to do. I still give the game a 6/10 for its message and good aethetics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4779951">Expand</a></span>

Gritty, depressing, scary, generally hell on Earth. This game needs no &quot;Press F to feel&quot;, the art style combined with the atmosphere, the sounds, the depressing notes left behind by others, the comments from your survivors, makes this game an emotional and thought provoking trip, about what being in a war zone really looks and feels like.
<br>The game play itself is decent but does have flaws. This War of Mine punishes you for each hit you take, but then combat is just mashing the Left Mouse Button on the character you are attacking and is generally very clunky. If taking hits during combat will have such large consequences you need to make sure your combat is very precise. Overall it&apos;s a good game worth the asking price, i dropped at least 20 hours onto it but it definitely could have been better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4791340">Expand</a></span>

Everything from their promo vids explaining the rationale behind the game and the ingenious way they tackled pirates by offering 10 free keys to people as a good will measure, is excellent, and the bigger studios could learn bucketloads from this type of marketing and approach.
<br>
<br>So, that&apos;s out the way - the game itself... is OK. It nails the atmosphere really well, with the art style and minimalist score helping to create the perfect mood. It&apos;s a grim game in every way and, whilst not exactly fun to play, it challenges you to re-evaluate what you expect from a &quot;good&quot; video game.
<br>
<br>It falls short in certain aspects though. The crafting system is strange, with items breaking that shouldn&apos;t break, just to meet the gaming convention of resource management. The trade system is hit and miss, following no distinct pattern (I understand this is an attempt at an economy system, but it doesn&apos;t achieve what it set out to do). And combat is lacklustre to be honest - a point and click, stealth orientated affair but it doesn&apos;t get the heart racing or add positively to the overall experience. Worst of all, it seems either pre-programmed difficulty spikes or harsh RNG dictates how long you can survive - you can do everything right, and then be killed off inside 10 minutes.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a game worth trying for its&apos; unique aesthetics and atmosphere, and the ambition of the developer, but it&apos;s not going  to go down as a classic. That said, it&apos;s a great base, and I look forward to seeing what 11 bit do next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/this-war-of-mine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4794342">Expand</a></span>

You only can have up to 4 characters per play (it would be fun to have more people in the house), and the gameplay is only 45 &quot;days&quot; long. Real wars don&apos;t end that soon and can last for years. I was quite disappointed when it turned out that you can win by surviving 45 days, instead of conditions getting worse and worse day by day for a long time.
