I wanted to like this game, I really did. I was eagerly going through the tutorial with one squad and thinking how fun it was all going to be. Then, I started the regular campaign, and they threw in 4 or 5 squads. Movement and pathing for your troops is HORRIBLE! More than once, when I told a soldier to load up onto a truck which was a few feet away from him, he went around the block to get into the back of the truck. And when you select units, they stay in the exact formation they were in when you selected them in, so most of the time they will not &quot;fit&quot; into the spot where you send them. I also experienced 2-3 second lag freezes after unit selections, orders, and during movement. Also disappointing was the lack of any random mission generation, making this game somewhat limited on replay value. As it stands, I played the game for about an hour, and uninstalled. The only hope for it is probably some heavy-duty patching.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-war-ii-frontline-command/user-reviews?user_review_id=368226">Expand</a></span>
