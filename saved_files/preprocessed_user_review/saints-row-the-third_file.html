Other than that; this game is exactly what it said it would be from the trailer; goofy, raunchy, and action packed. This game is good to just escape for a few hours and drive some pimped out rides (any ride you want to pimp out you can) or fly, or just do side quests and fight other gangs. Really, what more were you expecting?

Having played every single GTA and Saints Row game, I can assure you that they aren&apos;t even close to competitors.
<br>
<br>The Saints Row series has really declined over the year, yet everyone hails this game as being a savior simply because GTA IV was too boring. Most of the people who are reviewing this game never played SR1, so they think Saints Row was always this ultra silly, casual alternative to the slightly more serious GTA. In the first game, the whole focus was the 3rd Street Saints. You weren&apos;t a Gary Stu, you were just a wild card in the gang. Most of the gameplay revolved around following your Lieutenant&apos;s orders. You actually had to use gang members, play the activities, and gain territory. It wasn&apos;t simple, nor was it easy. Level 8 Snatch activities, I rest my case. Those were infuriatingly impossible.
<br>
<br>In the first game, we had more clothing customization. We had more layers of clothes to choose from. We could zip and unzip outfits, turn hats, put up our hoods, lower our pants, and frankly do whatever the hell we wanted. There was more intricate jewelry, a wider variety of clothing stores, and most importantly of all, colors mattered. Nowadays, respect is nothing more than some **** equivalent of levels in your average RPG.
<br>
<br>In SR1, you could rob stores at different times of the day. If you burglarized stores at night, you broke in to the back, cracked the safe, and carried out boxes of goods. You then had to load them into trucks and drive them to a fence.
<br>
<br>In SR1, you could buy liquor and joints. Not that getting high or drunk was all that important, but it made you feel more like a gangster and it also allowed you to punch people ridiculous distances.
<br>
<br>In SR1, activities had 8 levels instead of 6. The final 2 levels of practically every activity were absurdly challenging, even on Normal.
<br>
<br>In SR1, respect and money didn&apos;t grow on trees. You couldn&apos;t just buy meaningless properties that sit there in a static environment and do nothing. You actually had to play the activities and contribute to the well being of your gang to continue to do missions. In SR3 respect is thrown at me for taking a piss on the sidewalk.
<br>
<br>In SR1, there was an actual story worth following. Los Carnales, the Rollers, and the Vice Kings put the SR2 and SR3 gangs to shame. Benjamin King alone is a better character than the combined cast of SR3. The narrative isn&apos;t limited to LOL SO RANDUMB kind of humor made for 12 year olds who are convinced that GTA is some ultra silly casual party game.
<br>
<br>In SR1, there were stronghold missions. Even these were kept in SR2. In SR3, a stronghold is some useless building with nothing to do in it that sits around and makes you more money to spend on absolutely nothing.
<br>
<br>In SR1, your phone was actually useful. There were phone numbers all throughout the game that made Stilwater feel much more alive and real. It wasn&apos;t limited to 911, taxis, and other dumb ****
<br>
<br>I could continue to go on about all the features that SR1 had that were stripped away in SR2 and further removed in SR3, but I&apos;ll end with this. I 100% completed Saints Row The Third in 17 hours and 40 minutes. If you actually think this game deserves anything more than a 6, you must have the lowest standards on the planet. There is no new content to this game. The more serious tone has been completely abandoned for stupid kiddie humor and bland characters with absolutely no development. The whole community is filled with idiots who want furries and ponies and random **** they find online. The quality of game was sacrificed for slightly improved graphics in a boring, static city with no exploration allowed. The worst part is that there is genuinely no content. Once you beat the missions, clear the activities, and get the collectibles, you&apos;re done. The activities are so short, I have 100% control of the city before the story even ends.
<br>
<br>Saints Row 3 is a bastardization of the previous two Saints Row games. The worst part is, this game is a pile of rubbish BEFORE the season pass bull**** I can only hope this was a product of mismanagement at THQ, and that Volition will do better in the future like we know they can.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=2548643">Expand</a></span>

Most of your actual story missions are activites, which for those who played SR2 know, are simple side games to earn money with and be silly, but about 25 of 47 missions are these activites.  This leads to an extrremely short story full of holes.  These also do nothing to tie in the plot of the game and can be downright absurd.  For example the first mayhem mission is givin to you under the guise of attaking one of Stealports gangs who is distributing bad software, which leads you to a random street with the goal of doing as much damage to anything as possible.  It dosent tie int the premise of the mission at all.  The entire story is so incredably horrible that many players have searched for &quot;missing cutscenes&quot; (as I did) in the though that a glitch may have made them miss something only to find out &quot;nope thats how it is&quot;.   Another complaint I have is HOW the story is handled.  In the second mission of the game a beloved key Saints charater is killed, however your never really sure hes dead, furthermore non of the charaters who were this guys best friends (except one) EVEN CARE that hes dead.  The one that does just gets an attitude and mean but it never goes anywhere the game never builds on it and thats the case with most aspects of the story.  Another instance in a scene on a bridge where the player has no idea whats going on and I had to find out on forums that it was the dead charaters funeral, the parts were all there there was a hearse and the charaters were all dressed up but no one was sad or hinted at a funeral AT ALL.  After searching all these things online, apperently the game went through alot of story changes and the writers had to rewrite alot of the game (to cut up content for DLC&apos;s is unknown but likely).  All thats fine but what were left with seems like a concept for a final story instead of o final product.  Hugly more disappointing after SR2</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=1944447">Expand</a></span>

Even excluding the pc version which I would objectively give a 1/10 due to being flatout broken. It never managed to be fun for me. And yeah, in this specific case it was a the sum of it&apos;s negative parts. The gunplay never felt good, the driving felt wrong somehow, the minigames, while creative felt like some poor budget game. The aesthetics where so bad they where flatout broken, nothing was lit, everything was sickening. Under all these elements that I hated about saints row 2, was some potential. It has a **** of side content, most of which was insane. And it has some great storyline missions. Saints row 3 reduces side content, one of the major draws of the average original. So does that make it worse then? Not at ALL. The game looks great, runs great, feels like a game, instead of cardboard boxes moving around. Now while the actual content is less diverse, and this is about 1/3rd the size and diversity of saints row 2 - it&apos;s a FAR better game. Mechanics, the feel of controls, all these things do matter. The presentation matters. And while I would certainly prefer saints row 3 to have the content of saints row 2 - I actually completed saints row 3. Whereas I feel phisically ill every time I play 2. These little details add up. It&apos;s also got more of a tone than saints row 2. It&apos;s own sense of style that separates it from everything else. It does insanity better, it takes that extra step towards being it&apos;s own entity. In the end, I think saints row 3 is a fantastic game that is too short. Whereas saints row 2 is a absolutely terrible game that is very long. Hopefully saints row 4 can have a lot of content, while keeping the style and feel of 3. That would be a 9/10 right there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=2143569">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is easy to enjoy. Missions are varied and at times somewhat challenging. Graphics are very sharp and with the over the top use of vibrant colours it looks amazing and has a lot of charm. Saints Row may not be the most realistic game but it certainly is one of the most fun.

Coop is fun, and sandbox is fun, but the story is just a turd sandwich. It would be like if mario, instead of getting stars in the new games, had to rescue the princess in every single level (Yah I know it almost used to be like that). Developers, if you are out there, just go post on any message board, anywhere on the net, and ask what the next plot should be for number 4. No one will suggest they lose city and have to take it back...yet again.&apos; I know what you all are thinking (talking to you gamers now) - &apos;it&apos;s saints row, the story doesn&apos;t matter!&apos; Well, then don&apos;t have one.

The best feature of this game is the comic story-line and characters and their behavior ! The game is such a delight for fun loving gamer&apos;s who like this free roam stuff and all !!

And this is just one example.
<br>
<br>HOWEVER, and I can&apos;t stress this enough, this game&apos;s little flaws much to my surprise were totally, TOTALLY redeemed by the multiplayer. It worked surprisingly well (with some lag when using cars, sure) and it&apos;s... just, it&apos;s tons of fun! Since I stopped playing GTA I always wished for something similar that would let me play a sandbox as it is, BUT with more people, and this did exactly that, and has everything from minigames to other modes to actual storyline missions, fixed in a neat way for multiplayer use. Saints Row 2 just had those awfully specific modes that allowed you to play online: those were still fun, but just imagine what you can do together in the actual game!
<br>
<br>Overall, the flaws I mentioned might be because of allowing the multiplayer to run smoothly, I&apos;m not sure about that actually, I think they could have just copy-pasted the stuff from SR2 and I would have been happy, and the flaw I found the most annoying (the &quot;you get overpowered things right away&quot; flaw) has its own reasons: the game is trying to skip the phase in which you farm/wait for the awesome stuff by trying and being &quot;awesome&quot; right from the start. I think this can be either liked or disliked by people as an approach, you can think &quot;cut to the chase&quot; or &quot;I don&apos;t want stuff like farming&quot; and still sound reasonable, however to me it just looks a lot like de-valuing things and not making me earn them, although again this flaw doesn&apos;t apply to everything: the good powerups take quite a lot of money to unlock. Speaking of which the powerup interface and some of the powerups look/sound confusing?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=3484933">Expand</a></span>

Fans of the previous two installments will also be disappointed to find out that Volition really didn&apos;t do much to advance the plot. That said, let&apos;s hope Saints Row 4 focuses more on the protagonist tracking down Dex.</span>

The story is one that no one would have expected to see and the new side missions are a great change to ones from previous games, although i&apos;ve got 100% of steelport owned and have completed every activity there is (besides the ones from the new dlc) there is nothing left to do as i&apos;ve also maxed out the respect metre at level 50. Certain weapons in the game show this off perfectly and the amount of customistaion available. while the customisation options have been reduced compared to the second game i find it to be a great extra to such and immerse game. This game along with Batman Arkham City made my top five games of the past 5 years and will remain there for a long time</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=2126407">Expand</a></span>

Saints Row on the other hand has much smarter AI and they get incapacitated first instead of dying so you get some time which can be extended with upgrades to get them back on their feet. GTA IV would have been a good game in terms of game play if it had upgrades like Saints Row because that would have made the game play a bit more enjoyable if not a bit less frustrating. Grand Theft Auto IV does have a better character development and a better open world but as you press on, it dies down to repetitive missions. Saints Row really has the unique set up for missions as many are quite different from each other and there are a lot while also containing a uniqueness to each one and the presentation is a lot better then most GTA IV missions. In conclusion, by itself it is not bigger then GTA IV but with the DLC it goes over it with quality over quantity and the game will provide a lot of laughs and a lot of memorable moments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=2434676">Expand</a></span>

You can&apos;t because, there is a ton of it. SRIV addresses the issue of getting to places faster. It&apos;s a wonderful mod, but once you complete it this is likely what you&apos;ll go back to.

I know it&apos;s not your fault as it&apos;s just nature and you are programmed that way, but seriously do us all a favor and get some type of counseling. We need to evolve as a species and your type causes us to hit the reset button on that over and over just so you can have your fun making everyone else suffer.

First of all, i got a medium-high resolution, and couldn&apos;t drive the cars very well, i don&apos;t know what happens about this, but the car doesn&apos;t respond to your command and you crash tons of times. The police and gang they ALWAYS makes you look like the weak of the game, because when they come, they come and just don&apos;t stop, there is no end until you enter inside a store, and almost finishing the game, the police becomes almost IMMORTAL, even with the higher skills for low damage from explosions or bullets. I know the game HAS to be hard sometimes, but its annoying how they can beat you fast. To kill them you need to head shot them or shoot until you lose the attention and more 3 guys come to kill you. You can also change the course of the history, choosing what to do with 2 options, the game will make the history as you choose your way to solve the problem. One thing they could change is the time your partner takes to get in a car, the AI becomes lazy and sometimes take too long to get away and find the next place. To finish, the price is totally high for a game like this, its suppose to be a better GTA, sure it IS, but the price is pretty hard to believe, if you like a better version of GTA, go ahead and buy SR, but finishing the game in less than 24 hours you can think is a low experience in single player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=2127291">Expand</a></span>

You can customize your vehicles, body, hairstyle, crew, clothes etc which is a load of fun. There are businesses and apartments that you can buy that accumulate money for you. You can drive cars, boats, helicopters and airplanes and there are a number of activities in the city that you can do.  Everything is not perfect though. The vehicle handling feels extremely arcady which might really piss off some people. The helicopters and airplanes in particularly feels a bit strange. The side missions are very limited and they get repetitive really fast. There are some cool ideas (i love the insurance scam idea) but the number of different side missions are just to few and some of them are not interesting at all. And there aren&apos;t any races in the game at all which is really disappointing. The combat in the game is alright. There are plenty of fun melee moves and the weapon variety is good enough. The lack of recoil makes the gunplay quite boring though and the enemies arent all that fun to fight because of the simple AI. Some larger enemies in the game are basically giant shooting bullet sponges and they aren&apos;t all that fun to fight.
<br>
<br>The main campaign  in the game is interesting. It is totally crazy and it never really settles down. The problem with this is that it loses the momentum of all the crazy  since they keep throwing it at you all the time. That it not to say that i didn&apos;t enjoy how crazy the campaign was and it is certainly varied enough. The story though is pretty bland and it lacks interesting and likable characters which is a shame. I might sound really negative here but i had an alright time with the game. It took me around 15 hours to beat the campaign and the majority of side missions in the game which is a bit on the short side for a sandbox game. Especially so since most of the content aint all that great. The game doesn&apos;t really excel at anything which i wouldn&apos;t have had a problem with if the game had a massive amount of varied content. That is not however the case and in the end Saints Row the third is a pretty average sandbox game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=3106762">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>A game that truly fulfills any ego to occasionally go out and smash around stuff with absolute impunity or speeding through traffic in total road rage without any hesitation of destroying anything or losing anything significant value.
<br>
<br>To get there, you&apos;d have to first earn your way up, but the gameplay is so laid back that you really don&apos;t have to take anything seriously, and that is true even in co-op with your friends. Even if a particular mission fails, there is no heavy penalty, everyone keeps all the guns and cars they&apos;ve collected and everyone can feel free to retry at their leisure. No pressure at all, which is a total refreshment for all the serious and heavy gaming expects everyone to heavily invest in a gamble to risk losing one thing or another. Not that it is a bad thing necessarily, but it really relieves the hassle of that in this casual environment.
<br>
<br>The story itself is relatively short, but that&apos;s only to provide an introduction into this sandbox world I believe. The main focus was never really the story, but the world itself. The story however, is just content to introduce all the game mechanics SR3 had to offer. Not to mention the wackiness and humor that you just won&apos;t get to see on a regular basis. Pimps riding on chariots? A giant ball of yarn wrecking havoc? A game show devoted to slaughter mascots? Not intended to humor children and mindful sticklers, but if you were, you wouldn&apos;t pick up a game about gangstas in the first place, unless your only intent is to patronize it.
<br>
<br>Overall, it is a game that&apos;s well deserved its full marks, simply just because it has managed to capture this player&apos;s undivided attention until all missions and almost all achievements (96%) have been completed for 252 hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=3901382">Expand</a></span>

<br>However the developers made this game more like a joke, filled with sexist jokes and not that much fun. it degenerated both in the humor part and in the serious approaches the second part had.
<br>The plot was also completely out of order, the opponent gangs seemed less interesting than before.
<br>
<br>I found myself smiling with the satire 3-4 times the whole game.
<br>
<br>Stillport is way inferior than Stillwater both in design and in the general feeling  except in the casinos district).
<br>
<br>Graphics and soundtrack are in good levels.
<br>
<br>The new mini boss battles with the brutes are also a quite good add.
<br>
<br>Customization is a little bit too much, yet still above the most opposition in the market.
<br>
<br>Saint&apos;s row 2 mini-games have now become part of the main mission. The biggest foul in my opinion.
<br>
<br>Shandy feels idiotic and less hot, Zimos was funny and the only character i liked in this game.
<br>
<br>Choices in game are vain and don&apos;t have actual impact on the story  except in the last mission ).
<br>In general while the game has its fun and cannot be considered bad in any case,to me it feels like a worse version of the second, that while it evolved in customization and graphics it went quite a few steps back in the story and satire sections.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=3176760">Expand</a></span>

I REALLY enjoyed the saints row series up-till this game. It was the wacky open-world sandbox game that i would play whenever i just wanted pure FUN. But the thing that made them differ from OK to AMAZING was their attention to detail. They shared this with Rockstar. There would be pedestrians jogging, eating burgers, reading newspapers, sleeping at benches in the park and puking after a hard night of alcohol. There was easter-eggs EVERYWHERE and you never felt you had explored it all. THIS was what made it so much fun to just make chaos in the city, it felt ALIVE and well put-together. The story was also AMAZING! It had all the wacky humor and over-the-top action that you would not see anywhere else but it also had HEART! And DEPHT. It wasn&apos;t all fart-jokes (alot, but not ALL OF IT). There were heart-stopping scenes that would make your hairs rise on your back. It was AWESOME and HAD to be replayed. The third on the other hand ABANDENS all of this! It has lost it&apos;s heart and depht in exchange for more fart-jokes and sex-jokes. It also lost all the easter-eggs and the varied world. There were also no longer any action amongst the pedestrians and if there were it was HIGHLY scripted and LOCKED to one spessific point making the world feel even more DEAD than it already feels. The crazy weapons are nice and makes the game fun FOR A WHILE but they are so OVERPOWERED and scripted that it looses it&apos;s fun quite fast. The story is also  and only serve as a way to take you from one over-the-top scene to the next. This makes it feel empty unlike it&apos;s predesessors witch actually wanted to tell a GREAT story amongst all the chaos. The action also looses it&apos;s touch after a while because when EVERYTHING is over-the-top then NOTHING is over-the-top. It&apos;s ALL normal inside the game. The first two games (especially the secound one) made sure to have little breaks in-between the over-the-top missions to make sure that when one of those popped up you REALLY felt it. The multiplayer was also gone witch I and quite a few other fans of the series REALLY enjoyed! They said they wanted to put more time into perfecting the co-op witch was  since there is nothing special about the co-op. No custom cut-scenes and no exclusive co-op features. It just single-player with a friend and since they CUT the muliplayer in change of this you would think it would be something more than that. So to conclude i will say i had fun playing the game. It WAS a fun experience for a while, but then i started to see how empty and mindless it realy was. When you reach max level you are invinible, have unlimited ammo and you never have to reload. It&apos;s STUPID easy and is not fun anymore. You can also avoid the cops by simple walking into ANY of your buisnisses witch makes the cops and gangs just a big JOKE. There is no THREAT you have to think about while shooting people. And that takes away ANY challange and later all the remaining FUN in the game. There is also so few enterable buildings in the game it&apos;s just pathetic compared to even the FIRST GAME! The open-world in a game like this is like it&apos;s own character and the one in saints row the third is empty and uninteresting. I played it for 35 hours and went back to saints row 2 for my fift playthrough, it&apos;s just as fun as the first unlike this game witch ends up being uninteresting in comparason even on a secound playtrough. And now it seems like the fourth will be THE SAME game with even more CRAZY stuff and moving EVEN FURTHER away from the charm and heart of the secound game. They  it up and is now destined to be a one-time playit and sellit game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=3186871">Expand</a></span>

<br>PROS: + True single-player sandbox with minimal story to get in the way + Several fast vehicles means you aren&apos;t stuck with one &quot;best&quot; vehicle all the time + Blowing stuff up (which is 98% of the game) is really fun

<br>PROS: + True single-player sandbox with minimal story to get in the way + Several fast vehicles means you aren&apos;t stuck with one &quot;best&quot; vehicle all the time + Blowing stuff up (which is 98% of the game) is really fun
<br>CONS: - Some weapons are weak and you&apos;ll never use - Some fight types are irritating (gang survival)
<br>
<br>REVIEW: Let&apos;s be absolutely clear: this game is not trying to be GTA. It is not trying to offer a story, or multiplayer (which is tacked on if you insist on trying), or a rich cultural experience, or any other pretentious thing you can think of. It is about doing what you want when you want to. You want to throw a fart-in-a-jar at a cop? Fine. Want to run over hookers on a motorcycle? That&apos;s fine too. The only limitation is that some event types only appear after a certain &quot;story mission&quot; type (these actually just introduce activity types with some well-voiced but stultifyingly dumb dialogue on the side). That&apos;s it. &quot;Finishing&quot; the game doesn&apos;t really reward you, because the whole thing is about the activities along the way, and SR3 does this magnificently. You can collect the best vehicles from game start and it is worth grabbing a few, because several of the best cars perform similarly well. Actually, hijacking pretty much any vehicle will make for a passable getaway car (though I wouldn&apos;t recommend a garbage truck). This actually works pretty well for the game, since you can experiment with several vehicles instead of being forced into a single best car. The best thing of all, however is the destruction factor--which is good, because the activities are just different variations on blowing stuff up. I said before that the ending isn&apos;t rewarding, but you know what? It doesn&apos;t matter because the stuff you&apos;ll remember are the fireballs along the way.
<br>
<br>Which is not to say the game is without flaw. In contrast to the variety of functional cars, there really are &quot;best&quot; weapons that you&apos;ll use exclusively (unless forced by a special activity). Ultimately, this doesn&apos;t hurt the game too much, because the best weapons are so fun to use, but it is still there. You may also find that certain activity types aren&apos;t up your alley. This really shouldn&apos;t pose a problem to anyone, though-you&apos;ll only be forced to do each activity once (story) and then you can ignore them. If you find the game too easy, you can simply not buy upgrades or call in swarms of allies. This game is all about choice, and it does it oh so well.
<br>
<br>Just don&apos;t expect to be able to stay away for long periods your first playthrough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=4212187">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are excellent, the choice of cars and weapons are very diverse, including the ability to customize each weapon and each car to perfection. In addition, weapons are totally ridiculous (like launcher sharks). In short, buy a game with his sequel !</span>

The characters are more entertaining, the third wall is constantly broken and it&apos;s a game that doesn&apos;t take itself seriously as a drama.  Also, the characters are likeable, and, having played GTA V with some of the least relatable characters in a video game ever, I think we can all agree that there is something to be said about this.  This is a satire on modern life, the glorification of hip hop culture, the media and action movies as a whole.  If you&apos;re 15 maybe this game isn&apos;t for you, if you&apos;re a 20 or early 30 something person who grew up with video games, the cultural references in here are designed for you.  A few things might have been nice, like a &apos;fast travel&apos; set of options to avoid some of the more annoying elements, more guns, more songs for driving, but the story, the humor and the brilliant satire more than makes up for it.  This is as close to perfection in video game entertainment as is possible, don&apos;t miss it, I nearly did dismissing it as a GTA clone, it isn&apos;t, it&apos;s somehow more and when it isn&apos;t, it makes fun of itself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=4384387">Expand</a></span>

I had almost no interest in the title, but it was selling well and I found it for a bargain price. Wow, what a joyful surprise. The main two enjoyable aspects were a very funny bunch of missions and dialogue, fun side side missions, and just a bunch of crazy things you need to do to grow your character and add new strengths, such as more health, more ammo, more &quot;homies&quot; to come help you.  The second, and probably best part of the game, is that is just keeps getting crazier and crazier. Just when you think you&apos;ve seen everything, they throw more and more stuff in -- and it all works beautifully. We&apos;re talking about V-TOLS, Jet Bikes, tanks and exotic weaponry.
<br>
<br>The plot is corny, but again it just keeps getting crazier. Think of the plot simply as an excuse to put you in crazy situations and offer opportunities for funny, sometimes hysterical dialogue.
<br>
<br>This game is NOT to be taken seriously on any level. Just expect it to be so totally over the top that you just can&apos;t help but a great time. If you can lighten up and don&apos;t feel the need to be &quot;cool and cold&quot; when you play games, this game is too fun too pass on, even with the minor flaws.
<br>
<br>That said, the DLC is incredibly weak. There isn&apos;t a single item worth your time, especially for the money they are asking while giving you something totally worthless. The Online pass is out of the question. A totaly waste of your money.  The graphics are passable, but no shiny surfaces and super advances per pixel shading. The focus is on the gameplay.
<br>
<br>Stick to the game that you got when you opened the box, and you will have one of the most fun experiences in a long time.  Especially if you enjoy the doing more than just getting it over with. I had around 100 hours in the game with all side missions, core missions, and about half of the side activities, like stealing specific cars or assassinating some strange character after drawing them out in some weird way. I experienced no bugs or freezes on my XBox 360. Do your funny bone a favor and check this game out. Definitely worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=2153557">Expand</a></span>

The writers handled this in a top-notch fashion. If you can create a powder keg like Saints Row The Third, and make it still packed in with tongue-in-cheek dirty humor, as well as giving the characters dialogue that makes every mission such as going through a cyber universe to take down a cyberlord geek who takes the form of a f***** dragon with swords as a normal day in the life of a Saint. Seriously, I want to congratulate these guys for bringing literally everything in the game to create this space of immersitivity; you feel like a bada**, you have homies that you actually care about, (or hate), and a great array customization (for an action game) that gears you up to take on any situation leaves me pleasantly surprised. So, looking for zombies to kill with a sonic blaster? Maybe riding a hoverbike through the streets searching for sex dolls? Calling your Saint army to take on a challenge, or just to piss off the law and gangs of Steelport? Either way, Saints Row: The Third delivers in the most outrageous ways possible, but it works, and that&apos;s the great thing about Volition&apos;s masterpiece...or travesty, depends on how you look at it...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=2256725">Expand</a></span>

What other game can you slap a prostitute with a 3 foot long **** This made my small list of &quot;purchase on release day&quot; games. Take note game devs we want something different and new! Amazing graphics is always a plus.</span>

Simply put, the game is just pure unadulterated fun boiling onto the point of sheer ridiculousness. Story: The story isn&apos;t really as good as GTA to be frank. It seems like a melting pot of various Hollywood cliches and sheer ridiculous moments. If you are looking for a story to be told, GTA would be a much better option.<br><br>Gameplay: An absolute blast. VTOLs with microwave lasers and plasma rockets, a rocket launcher which fires squealing octopi which mind control people and explode with the press of a button, hover jets, WACKY, AMUSING AND FUN CHEATS (Ahem, GTA IV) and more. There&apos;s almost unlimited things you can do in Steelport. And it sure won&apos;t get old soon. My only gripe is the overuse of the action button. Often, the game doesn&apos;t know what you want to do because the action button &quot;E&quot; has too many functions. The game might make your character hold someone hostage when you want to get in a car for example. Not really gamebreaking, but kinda annoying sometimes. I guess there are some bugs here and there. For example, there is one mission where you have to escort some chick from the passenger bay of a helicopter. In my first playthrough, the heli got stuck and crashed into some building. This caused the game to complete the mission prematurely and I missed out on the later part of the mission. Again, small annoyances.<br><br>Graphics: Many other games have done better in terms of graphics, but it seems reasonable to suit the game. Explosions are nicely detailed, character models are well done, and cars look quite cool. Steelport itself looks quite beautiful (not as well done as GTA IV&apos;s Liberty City though). Something that bugs me is how vehicles and pedestrians pop in constantly. This doesn&apos;t make Steelport look like a city, more of a crazy playground.<br><br>Sound: Voice acting is top notch, except for Zimos, whose autotune may either annoy or amuse you. (It annoyed me ): ) Guns, explosions, crashes sound powerful and fun, making your experience as enjoyable as ever. However, my only gripe is the radio. I just don&apos;t like the selection of songs and the lack of interesting stuff there.<br><br>In all, a polished game that should be worth a buy. Don&apos;t expect a GTA when you play Saints Row, you&apos;ll find a fun, crass, over the top and immature game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=1985371">Expand</a></span>

Despite its entertainment level, I can definitely complain about the size of the game, expecting a gta sized game, I was rather shocked to find myself at the end of the game in only about 30 hours.

While some people like changing every fraction of an inch of the bone structure in their character&apos;s face, I like a wide variety of presets to hit the ground running. I had to spend about fifteen minutes to make my character&apos;s face look different than my brother&apos;s character (they all start at the same default). This can be a pro or con depending on personal preference, so I won&apos;t judge either way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=1938009">Expand</a></span>

Driving is much improved and almost up to the level of GTA4 though I&apos;ve hit some glitches (eg vehicles going through guardrails and getting stuck in the pavement).  Missions are fun, story is fun, love the character designs.  My main disappointment is with the NPC civilians who are either slow to react or don&apos;t react to the mayhem around them.  When hijacking a motorcycle with a passenger on back I would expect some sort of reaction but he just sits there quiet as I kamikaze into a wall.  Fire a gun near a crowd and they just continue going about their conversations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=1937154">Expand</a></span>

Even though those 12 hours were mainly from playing the story missions, the story itself felt short. Quite a few missions are mainly there just to introduce you to activities. Customization is good but feels somewhat watered down from Saints row 2 and the fact that half of the clothing stores in the city are the same store with the same clothing seems a pointless. If your into over the top crazy fun, then this game is for you. Just try and space out the story missions more than I did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=1970361">Expand</a></span>

SR: TT, comes out swinging from the beginning with some great high concept missions and dialogue that could have very easily been overtly crude (a &apos;la Bulletstorm) but thankfully was closer to the biting wit of GTA of old.  If GTA and SR were old college buddies, GTA would be the one who got his Masters, started interning at big businesses while still partying on the side but after a few years, matured a bit and found himself the new company CEO, whereas SR would have the BFA in Fine Arts, who got a job as a tattoo artist or a stuntman, which may not be as glamorous as running a major company, but men like that do WHAT THEY WANT, WHEN THEY WANT, and SR is that &apos;man&apos;.  It takes maturity over its knee and spanks it with the biggest purple phallus you and I&apos;ve ever seen.  The character graphics and animations are a little dated, but the city is absolutely stunning, and brimming with hilarious ad work, radio stations (Adult Swim has it&apos;s own station).  The game functionality provides some of the smoothest shooting and driving I&apos;ve ever experienced.  The controls are fantastically responsive and the &apos;drifting&apos; system handles beautifully.   The story is fairly simple, Saints start on top, Saints get brought down a peg, Saints don&apos;t like that, Saints kill EVERYONE.  But in between are some genuinely likeable characters, my favorite among them is a pimp with a trach who speaks through an auto-tuner and a goliath named Oleg, both of who&apos;s intros alone you won&apos;t forget for some time, especially if you find yourself behind Oleg climbing stairs right after you save him (it&apos;ll make sense when you play it). The character customization system is out of this world.  I can&apos;t stress enough how much I love being able to create a character with a voice who interacts in cutscenes (Mass Effect is another great example of this)  And the ability to visit a plastic surgeon in game to change everything (sex included) means so far I&apos;ve been an a bi-special furry, Harley Quinn, Bruce Campbell, Marv from Sin City, and Macho Man Randy Savage, why... because I can, because Saint&apos;s Row allows it.  The few times this game ever &apos;disappointed&apos; me were when certain elements were presented that I unfairly compared to Just Cause 2, namely the fluidity of skydiving and parachuting, In SR the free falling feels a bit more like I&apos;m on rails but it&apos;s also not core gameplay so maybe it&apos;s not fair to compare the two.  Some of the Act 2 missions can get a bit repetitive, in fact most of Act 2&apos;s character missions merely introduce you to side missions that can be found anywhere, but there&apos;s not a moment of it that isn&apos;t fun, so I&apos;m not going to hold it against the game.  In short, if you&apos;ve been bouncing from one stone cold serious game to another the last few months, this is the light-hearted reprieve you&apos;ve needed, and they just so happened to sneak in flawless game mechanics and a fantastic character roster to sweeten the pot.  Can&apos;t recommend this game enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=1978004">Expand</a></span>

The animations however are extremely smooth, especially compared to the stiff animations from SR1+2. The engine change really paid off.<br>But the biggest selling points is the ability to actually play that game on the PC. It&apos;s not a crappy port SR2 was and runs smooth like butter, it also uses DX11.<br><br>Sound:<br>There are some mixing problems. The music in shops are really loud and the engine sounds are too quiet, however the Soundtrack is good with a good mix of mainstream and indie.<br>The game also fused the songs really well with the game. I don&apos;t want to spoil, so I&apos;ll just say, that some of the missions are so badass with those fitting music in the background, especially the last mission.<br>The voice acting is also very good (apart from Angel), the main character has 7 voices and all are well done.<br><br>Controls:<br>This game really excels here, I was surprised how well this game plays with keyboard and mouse, if you have an XBOX controller you can plug it in and play, though there&apos;s no option to play with a different joypad or to change the controls of it.<br>The vehicle controls in an arcade style, which means you have full control of a car even with high speed. This is good news for people who hated that realistic controls from GTAIV<br><br>I give this game a 10, for the one reason that I rarely had that much fun with a game in the last decade. I played it through 2 time and a 3rd time in Co-op.<br><br>If you are a fun loving human, then this game is for you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=2011228">Expand</a></span>

Some people might not like it due to it not being serious but for alot of people it will make you laugh for so long.  And it is sandbox type of game so it never gets boring.</span>

Unfortunately it just doesn&apos;t last long enough; the main story only takes about 10 hours and with 15 hours or so worth of side missions you&apos;re looking at 15-25 hours for a play through (getting 100% will take longer). The same can be said for some of the activities, while most of the them are fun, it seems that the most enjoyable ones (Tank Mayhem, Genkis&apos; S.E.R.C, etc) only last about 30 seconds to 2 minutes, and the better you do the shorter these activities become; you can repeat activities for fun and profit if you want though. Shortness aside the story has a good sense of humor and never over stays its welcome while at the same time providing you with ample motivation for your actions. Characters (including your own) are interesting, and well voiced, and while there is a &apos;zombie&apos; voice option I would advise going with one of the other two as the banter between your character and others is very well written. The city is fun enough to explore, and while certain areas do change as the story progresses ultimately there isn&apos;t a whole lot a variety in terms of scenery or places to go... kinda disappointing after what Rockstar did with GTA:SA on the last generation of hardware. Character customisation and progress are excellent, with running around and gun play both feeling natural and fluid. A few more weapons (melee especially) would have been nice, but you can upgrade most of them from standard pop guns into incendiary / armor piercing round firing things of beauty.<br><br>Vehicles, including planes and helicopters, all handle well and there is enough difference to make each one feel distinct; you can even mod and save your favorite rides and have them delivered to you in seconds :) Playing on the PC the game looks fairly good at max settings, runs well and apart from DX10/11 having some issues with my dual monitors I didn&apos;t experience any technical difficulties. Graphics and controls (including individual buttons for selecting each weapon) can be customized, and although the interface isn&apos;t great for a mouse and keyboard it works well enough and does what you need it to do. Control wise the only issue I had was that the action button (default E) is also used to get in and out of cars, which is fine 99% of the time, but can cause you get stuck in a car on the odd times that it is re-purposed (the most notable being when you drive into a Rim Jobs (auto shop) with notoriety (wanted level)). While it would have been nice to see more content and some longer lasting activities overall Saints Row The Third is just a damn good time and well worth checking out for anyone (like me) who was disappointed with the &apos;real life simulator&apos; that was GTA IV.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=1950977">Expand</a></span>

There are so many things you can do in this game, i&apos;ve had a hell of a lot of fun and epic laughs. :D<br>The storyline might not be the sharpest knife in the drawer, but it keeps you entertained.<br><br>My only complaint is the day 1 DLC that should have been included in the game for free, but well. That&apos;s business. I highly recommend this, its totally worth the money and it provides hundreds of hours of fun.<br>I also repeat for those doubting about the optimization. Its an excellent port and runs all maxed out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=2111475">Expand</a></span>

The main missions are over the top action and comedy packed fun, the protagonists are all unique and unlike GTA IV you don&apos;t want to shoot them in the face.  |||  Handling: I played Saints Row 2 on PC for about 20mins before I dropped it because the handling and movement was just godawful. Saints Row The Third on the other hand feels smooth and you can actually aim your weapons without annoying assistance. Driving cars is as easy as it gets. The steering is responsive and you can pretty much turn on a dime which is intended by the developers. It gives you an arcade like feeling. Planes and Helicopters on the other hand take some time to get used to. Especially if you come with a Battlefield background. ||| Graphics: It maybe doesn&apos;t look like Battlefield 3 or even GTA IV but the graphics are completely sufficient  for this Open World game. The town is stylized to match the craziness of the game and contains many well structured places. ||| Story: The story is where Saints Row The Third really shines. It&apos;s so over the top that you sometimes just can&apos;t stop laughing at the absurdity. It might be a bit short but you still need about 16-18 hours to complete the whole game. Some of these missions are introductions to diversions or activities though but they are few in numbers. ||| Protagonists: The customization of your own character is a game in itself. You can modify your character in any possible way you can think of. Also in this game your are constantly surrounded by the most colorful and unique characters gaming has seen. And as said in the excerpt they are simply not annoying you but actually contributing to the atmosphere with their comical catchphrases and cursing.  ||| Open World and Choices: Throughout the game you will be forced to take certain choices which give you either status bonuses or extra characters to call to your help. Except for a few they don&apos;t have a huge impact on the actual game. The world maybe not Just Cause 2 massive but it still takes some time to get around. There are a few collector items spread across the world but they only result in money and respect, the two currencies. ||| DLC: The game started with two DLC packages and a preorder bonus on the first day. These add weapons, vehicles and costumes to your arsenal but they are not game changing. The third &quot;preorder&quot; is a season pass to three future DLC mission packs. Which unlike stated in other reviews here are not yet completed and haven&apos;t been part of the game in the first place. ||| Conclusion: The only complaint I have about this game is that there is little to no value of playing after you have finished the missions. Completing the district takeovers doesn&apos;t really benefit you any further. There are no new crazy missions to unlock when you do and the missions resulting in the takeover may all be crazy as hell but they wear out fast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=1971919">Expand</a></span>

The game is so over the top and ridiculous that it is hilarious at times, and I never find video game humor to be funny. The weakness of the game comes from the graphics. They are not bad but just look pretty dated, it has the looks of a game that is 3-4 years old. The side missions are fun, some better than others (the insurance fraud one is just insane). Some people may be a little turned off by the crazy amount of DLC coming out right after the release, but there is enough solid game. It does not feel like they held back anything, the DLC is just a nice option to have for future playability. Multiplayer is pretty much what you would expect, nothing much to say about it. As usuay, playing the game co-op is a great time. Overall the game is just fun and does not take itself seriously, just play it and enjoy what Saints Row the Third has to offer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=2157012">Expand</a></span>

Playing similar to GTA, Saints Row 3 has worked the kinks out of its previous games to blow the GTA series out of the water. Action-packed, time and time again this game makes me laugh and feel like a total bad ass all at the same time. The game play was smooth, although sometimes choppy AI can cause your NPC teammates to move somewhat sporadically, they prove to usually be useless to you anyways and you will kick plenty of ass on your own. The games story often takes you into absolutely ludicrous situations, but it  makes it feel better that the game is willing to joke about itself, and that with a ok selection of weapons, cool vehicle and (often hilarious) character customization, Saints Row 3 proved to be well worth its cost, which surprised me for a game I had not even given a seconds notice until here. From Aerial assaults to bondage role play rickshaw gunfights (???) to bank heists, the game provides ass kicking action and comical moments in an open sandbox environment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=2534201">Expand</a></span>

Like it has its moments but if anything Saints Row the Third feels like a hollow attempt to kinda invent a dying franchise, Ill admit that it is fun in places and the soundtrack is fantastic as will as the driving mechanics and the story itself is so ridiculously silly that its a joy to play.

Where to start with this mess of a game? Okay, let&apos;s get it out of the way... if all you want is to run around making noise, blowing things up, stealing and tricking out cars... then this game will be an utter blast. The mechanics of the sandbox are wonderful, and the co-op is very functional. But if you&apos;re like me, and enjoyed the surprising depth that SR2 brought to the silly setting then... read on to find out what went wrong.<br><br>*Intro mission spoilers* Half of you probably know this from the sneak peak videos that hit youtube before release, but... Gat dies. Offscreen. No drama, no fuss, just *BANG* over an intercom and he&apos;s gone. That&apos;s it. The best character of the previous games, gone, and the rest of the game treats it with as much respect as if he&apos;d just taken a vacation or something. It just goes downhill from there. The story is disjointed, and feels like it went through several BAD rewrites, but half the developers never got the memo. You have disconnected story elements showing up that will have you searching for the missing cutscenes, and interesting characters just utterly destroyed. In the place of SR2&apos;s depth of character and legitimately dramatic storytelling, we have... *spoilers* zombies. The ending is a botched mishmash of horrible choices and character defilement. *SUPERSPOILERS* Either you sacrifice half your crew for the purpose of needless revenge against someone who isn&apos;t even a threat, or you undo everything you&apos;ve worked for and go back to being substance-less media whores. Saints Row: The Third is just a horrifyingly disappointing mess. The mayhem rapidly goes sour when there&apos;s no substance to back it up. It&apos;s not even the kind of mess you can fix with DLC, since most of it is in the middle of the existing game&apos;s storyline. I was chomping at the bit to give Volition my money for this one; preordering the instant it was possible. I will not be doing the same for the inevitable SR4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=2024502">Expand</a></span>

And like others have said before me, it&apos;s a great stress reliever :) I bought this game for Pc, because i wanted to play it at 60fps, which it does on my CG8250. Great game, great fun ! Just sit back, relax, and start slapping people with your purple ..... ;-)</span>

One of the major themes in the game is practically mirrored word for word from Power, a song by Kanye West; which happens to be used within the game as well.<br><br>I joined the Saints during Saints Row 2 and immediately fell in love the game game.  It was the most random, crazy, and insane fun I had, had in a game ever.  Even the GTA series cannot compete with SR for ridiculous shenanigans.<br><br>I have played the game for 23 hours now and have completed story with a 68% completion so there is still a lot to do.  The plot line is very reminiscent of SR2 except perhaps streamlined and more focused.<br><br>In SR2 you were just out to take Stillwater for the Saints and kill everyone else.  In SR3 it is more about exacting revenge and running the gangs out of Steelport; there is not as much emphasis on the gang warfare aspect, which I am sad to see.  The one thing I loved most about SR2 was the whole war going on between the Saints, Ronin, Brotherhood, and the green guys (forgot their weird ass name).  However SR3 makes up for that in mounds.<br><br>You start off the game playing as the MC along with Gat and Shaundi as you rob a bank as a publicity stunt for the Saints.  It all goes sideways when the tellers pull out gun s and start shooting at you.  The situation devolves even further then a massive Swat team shows up.  After ripping the vult out of the building you nearly escape but are foiled.<br><br>This is how you are introduced to the Syndicate, a shadowy organization who owned the bank you hit.  A man named Loren, a Belgian, offers to buy out the saints and let you three survive; after the predictable &quot;go f*** yourself&quot; from the MC he tries to kill you but Gat manages to break free and a gun fight ensues.<br><br>Oh, and I forgot to mention; we are on a plane at this point.  I won&apos;t go further then that, even for a spoiler review.<br><br>A lot of the stuff from SR2 is still present in SR3; specifically the ****  The voice actor this time around almost has a Captain Price kind of deep voice so at times the VO doesn&apos;t sound that good.  But it is still fairly bombastic, just like SR2&apos;s **** was.<br><br>There are a few new activities: Professor Genki&apos;s Super Ethical Reality Climax, Tank Mayhem, Guardian Angel, and several variations on the old activities.<br><br>My favorite has to be the PGSERC activities.  They are just too crazy most of the time and it is generally easy money until you get the Hunters swarming around you; then it gets dangerous.  You go around shooting mascots, evil panda signs, and Prof. Genki signs to get money.  The mazes you are placed into have traps as well and there are also Brute like enemies that appear in the higher difficulties.<br><br>Tank Mayhem is Mayhem but with a tank.  The original Mayhem activity is still around.  Guardian Angel is where you use a sniper scope and chopper to protect one of your homies from afar.  Similar to Gunship Assaults.<br><br>All of the original activities are present in SR3 however some are not done as activities anymore.  For example Fuzz is now like Streaking was in SR2, it is not an activity but kind of like a sub-activity.  You are given a list of goals to achieve in the Saints Book and from time to time the Fuzz producer calls you up and gives you a task to do so they can get footage.<br><br>There are random sub-missions that occur in the game at random.  These range from stuff like Fuzz, to territory defense.  All of the sub-activities are wave based battles where you have to survive a certain number of waves to complete the task.  Assassinations are still present as well.<br><br>There are new weapons to be found as well as new vehicles but I will not do into those, not enough room to discuss them.<br><br>Some things I hate about SR3:<br><br>Instead of having special icons for gang notoriety like in SR2 we now have pink stars.<br><br>Brutes can easily overwhelm you if there are two of them and keep you on the ground till you die.<br><br>Only strongholds are customizable and there are only three of them that can only be gotten through the story missions.  The old stronghold system from SR2 is gone.<br><br>Stag tanks do too much damage with their laser cannons, even upgraded with most of the health and damage upgrades they still can kill you in a matter of seconds.<br><br>Bike driving mechanics are too sensitive most of the time.<br><br>Can&apos;t customize aircraft, yet.<br><br><br>Things I like:<br><br>Giant purple **** sword/club<br><br>New awesome weapons and vehicles<br><br>Strongholds now give you bonuses to your Rep and monetary gain<br>
Upgrade System

Adult Swim radio channel

Massive amount of references to other movies, games, and TV shows

Funny as hell **** voice overs



This game is as much fun, if not more, as SR2 was to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=1958222">Expand</a></span>

It fully lived up to my expectations from playing Saints Row 2 previously. The game improves on several flaws from the last game. The driving mechanics are much better. Not exactly what I&apos;d call realistic, but I consider that a good thing as driving in SR3 allows you to easily weave through traffic and drift corners like a pro the first time you try. The streets are nice and wide and there are large gaps between cars in lanes as well, which makes for a great driving environment.<br>While I&apos;m on the subject of vehicles, SR3 has a very satisfying selection of cars, trucks, and commercial vehicles. When you store a vehicle in your garage (which so far as I can tell has infinite slots) you always have it, even if you take it out and blows it up, you can still go back and retrieve it. There is some car customization, and while it&apos;s not as much as a car nut like me would enjoy, it&apos;s nice, and includes durability and performance upgrades as well as looks. It is fairly easy to get access to special vehicles. Get your wanted level up high enough and it&apos;s easy to jack a tank, humvee with turret, and APC from the military and store them in your garage. Fairly early on in the game you get access to a gunship helicopter, and that&apos;s just a start.<br>Also, unlike SR2 in which you had to get &quot;respect&quot; by doing mini games/side activities to be allowed to complete missions, respect points now only unlock upgrades for you and your gang. No more having to spend an hour doing a mini game you&apos;ve spent hours on already just to get to the next mission!<br>The weapon selection is very good as well. It has the basics (pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, SMGs, sniper, RPGs), the somewhat odd (laser rifles, **** bats, gun that gives you remote control of any vehicle you shoot with it) and even some extremely odd ones, such as a Mollusk Launcher that shoots mind controlling octopuses at enemies to make them fight for you.<br>Guns are upgradable, usually starting off with predictable things such as larger clips, more shots per burst, with the last weapon upgrade usually being something more special, such as the SMG that shoots incendiary rounds.<br>The missions start off great, with lots of different combat environments and explosions. After that it enters a somewhat more dull period where you do a dozen missions or so that are really just introducing you to a mini game/ side activity. It does start to pick up again after that, however, so don&apos;t give up.<br><br>I have very few issues with the game, but here they are: As many others have said, the city doesn&apos;t feel as &quot;alive&quot; as GTA IV. Less people on the sidewalks, and less detail. Not a huge issue but worth noting.  DLC on day one pisses everyone off. If you have the content at launch it should be in the game, or at the least a pre-order bonus. Enemy AI is dumb. Really dumb. It&apos;s not like I bought the game for challenging combat, but it&apos;d be nice if they were at least a little more intelligent. All in all, a very fun game with a wacky sense of humor. Everything is upbeat and colorful, with amusing characters. Minor flaws but what game is truly perfect?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=1943172">Expand</a></span>

This is one of the most fun games you can play, because there are just no limits to its madness. Hit people with giant **** in place of a baseball bat. Shoot people while stark naked. The gameplay itself is good fun, but gets old a bit too quickly. Thankfully, the variety of missions mean that you are never bored while playing through the campaign. It&apos;s even got zombies in it. And Burt Reynolds. And zombies combined with Burt Reynolds.
<br>The customisation is done well, with a wide variety of clothes and car mods for all sorts of details, right up to the colour of your underwear and the wing mirror shape of a lorry.
<br>Voice acting is class, the shooting mechanics are decent enough (and good fun when you are given infinite ammo in missions) and the graphics are okay too.
<br>Where the game is let down, however, is the side missions. This is an open world game with hundreds of side missions, but they are boring as hell. The TRON one looks cool, then gets annoying after the first 20 seconds. The helicopter missions are too predictable, and the tiger escort ones are just plain nonsense. Having a tiger in your car is a fun concept no doubt, but it is hopelessly ruined when you have no idea what you&apos;re meant to be doing and the mechanics do not work.
<br>There is a serious lack of multiplayer where there is great potential, and Whored Mode is tiresome (though in fairness, that is the point of it).
<br>In one line, the game is absurdly fun and should be experienced by everyone because of its extremity, but it simply does not last.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/saints-row-the-third/user-reviews?user_review_id=2868146">Expand</a></span>
