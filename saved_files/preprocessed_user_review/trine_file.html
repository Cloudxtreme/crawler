Also another &apos;problem&apos; is the platforming. It isn&apos;t &apos;bad&apos;, but it&apos;s a little loose, perhaps a bit too easy? There is some challenge in the game, but it really isn&apos;t that difficult. I only played through the medium game, so I might be wrong and it would be more difficult in later levels. It&apos;s hard to tell. Anyways, the amazing aspects of the game far outweigh any problems with the game, and I think it is well worth the cost.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=741389">Expand</a></span>

Its gameplay is pretty good and I didn&apos;t even notice the issues Koos King is complaining about. The animation is very good and a lot of the action has a tangible quality to it. I never had any problem with precision jumping. In fact, Zoya the thief is very capable at jumping from one tiny ledge to another. I&apos;ve almost never been smacked around by heavy boxes, and the few times it happened it was actually quite hilarious and completely my own plan backfiring on me. It&apos;s true that the game is a bit of a one trick pony, though. This isn&apos;t Braid, but the game still manages to be very fun, especially in coop mode. (You&apos;ll need to go to the controller configuration to assign multiple gamepads.) The levels are gorgeous, although the voice acting ranges from mediocre to bad. In response to Koos King again, the resolutions the game offers are plenty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=83361">Expand</a></span>

Anyone who earned their wings playing through platformers in the nineties will feel instantly at home. The basic gameplay mechanics are rock solid. You progress through a traditional fairy-tale land thinking and jumping through physics laden levels choosing between a knight, wizard and thief to overcome obstacles. The character animations feel fluid, natural and appropriate to the character model whilst the level designs offer enough of a challenge for the game to roll on without making you feeling patronised or frustrated. You&apos;ll find yourself employing each of the three characters individual skills throughout each level but it&apos;s the Thief character that shines the brightest. The archery system is satisfying and intuitive. The in game graphics are wonderfully over the top; reminiscent of the first d3d games where colour and lighting were splashed around with gusto as the designers played with the nascent lighting tech. The consistency of the quality in the graphics is outstanding reflecting a sense the designers real enjoyed colouring each pixel. The game engine offers reasonable scalability (no doubt held back by the strain the physics processing lays down on the CPU) meaning even most laptop gamers will be able to enjoy Trine&apos;s charm albeit on a very low res. Disappointments are few but most notably the enemy AI could do with a re visit as they hone on your character often to their destruction by one of the numerous physics based environmental traps. Xbox controllers are fully supported but the game doesn&apos;t seem to save your preference for it, requiring a trip to the options screen at every start and I haven&apos;t decided whether the ropey cut-scenes and the shocking load screen add or detract from the overall charm of the experience. All in all one of the best simplest and most enjoyable games I&apos;ve ever played. Thoroughly recommendable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=82913">Expand</a></span>

Working with that, it also has a nice chunk of puzzles or situational moments that make you actually think, which yeah, I don&apos;t want to think all the time when I&apos;m blowing crap up but I like to work the ole noodle every now and again. Although it seemed short the different modes of play test your different skill levels and with steam you get the achievements which usually keep you occupied tying to get them all and keeping the point of playing the game open. I know I&apos;m being rather lenient with my score because I really enjoyed the game, the look, the puzzles and the different characters , the game just seems short enough to not score more than an 8 with me. I wish there would have been just ever so slightly more things to do but, I hope there are more games that take this approach in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=83620">Expand</a></span>

I find this game enjoyable, and I know a game doesn&apos;t have to be full of new stuff for it to be fun, but really it doesn&apos;t capture my imagination. The story is pretty much traditional claptrap with very heavily stereotyped and simple characters, and the biggest challenge in later levels is trying to platform while enemies repeatedly respawn in the same place, not very creative IMO. The physics does make for some slightly different puzzles from the usual, but it&apos;s nothing that hasn&apos;t been done before.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=1364341">Expand</a></span>

Graphically is just great for a platform game, cool sound, and cool characters, each one with his own specialties. Sadly, the games has many flaws that make&apos;s it really boring after just a couple of levels. First is the physic engine, which makes really hard to jump to small areas. The puzzle were just to easy to deserve that name. And the levels feels repetitive almost immediately. There is no sens of progression. The story is average, but you will hardly see any connection with the gameplay. And the worst part, what will make you want to quite the game after less than 30 minutes of playing THE COMBATS!! First of all, the enemies are EXTREMELY REPETITIVE. Basically bats and different kind of skeletons (knights, archers, flame throwers, etc) and I can&apos;t describe how boring is to fight them...  Avoiding them by jumping without being cut is really hard, and you will be in many situations were as soon as you kill a skeleton, a new one spawn. And fighting them is also terrible, the archer can&apos;t throw arrows in the air, and has no defense. Basically stay away and throw as many arrows as you can. The wizard only can crash skeletons by levitating stuffs, has no defense skill, and has no way to kill bats!!!. And finally the knight, the combative one, you basically stay cover with you shield, wait for the skeleton to hit you, and then just click many times until he is dead. Compare this with the old DOS prince of persia combat system, and this is just patetic.... So in the end, a boring, yet graphically beautiful platform game to soon be forget.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=3127295">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;ll want to risk exploring every bit just to not miss out on some beautiful hidden place (and don&apos;t be afraid of the water!). It plays a lot like those good old Castlevania games, but with some cool twists thrown in. Instant switching between characters sounds confusing, but it becomes second nature almost immediately, and adds fantastic creativity to the puzzle solving. There&apos;s even some RPG elements with upgrades and inventory. What a breath of fresh air for PC gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=82784">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately it&apos;s gameplay and programming where it falls flat. There&apos;s a few small issues that I&apos;ll mention first before I get to the real problem. There&apos;s no saving mid-way through a level. If you quit it&apos;s restart time. Controller configuration isn&apos;t saved so you&apos;ll need to reset that everytime too. You can&apos;t pick a resolution and aspect ratio. You must choose from the arbitrary ones offered. The voice acting ranges from good to really bad. Bad none of those are show stoppers. The problem is that using a physics engine to drive a character in a platform game is a BAD IDEA. There&apos;s a fair bit of precision jumping which you will fail time and again as your characters inertia slides them off the edge. Add to that that you&apos;re getting smacked around by heavy boxes etc... and you never really feel like you&apos;re controlling your character. The other issue with a physics based game is that it&apos;s a bit of a one trick pony. By the end of the second stage you&apos;ll have solved every puzzle varaint. The rest is tedium. Not even the enemies change.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=83238">Expand</a></span>

I loved doing every single puzzle in a different way each time I faced it, and had an amazing experience doing so. Combat was a very fun and well-executed addition to the game and I found myself loving the dynamic contrast between the three characters for all sorts of tasks. My only regret about the game is that I felt it was extremely short. I was really hoping I&apos;d be able to get an extra few hours out of it. I beat it the day I got it, which disappointed me a little bit. However, Frozenbyte is definitely on the right track. No doubt I&apos;d recommend trying the demo out (can&apos;t hurt, always a good idea), but just be wary, for $30, it may make your pocket a little lighter than you&apos;d like it to be. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=425922">Expand</a></span>

At the start puzzles are challenging because your limited by the amount of things you can do. Namely the Wizards boxes and later planks. At the start you get a few but later you have so many plus some more spells that make spells much too easy. You don&apos;t really need to think anymore just place boxes and you can get anywhere. Aside from that the game turns out really well with a nice slick story and an absolute perfect ending. The last level is incredible, very memorable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=83231">Expand</a></span>

Trine&apos;s highest points are it&apos;s amazingly well made narrative and the stunning visuals. Voice acting is top notch and the characters have very defined personalities, even the narrator feels like he&apos;s a part of it all.<br><br>The gameplay is solid and the physics engine is fun to mess around with. Many of the levels are semi-linear, allowing for multiple ways to cross gaps and beat down enemies. However, Trine does have it&apos;s low points. The length of the game is rather short, I would say 5 - 7 hours for anyone with any sort of gaming knowledge. I don&apos;t really expect much more form an indie game but it certainly isn&apos;t your Red Dead Redemption. Another is that it lacks any satisfying boss battles or climax points.<br><br>Really though, at the end of the day, it&apos;s a nice platformer that I would recommend to anybody with a couple bucks to spare.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=1460562">Expand</a></span>

The atmosphere and art style make it incredible easy for you to dive into this mystic, yet colorful and lovely fantasy world (that, by the way, looks astonishing thanks to the modern engine) and the storytelling makes you feel like you&apos;re in a Grimm fairytale. The typical platforming elements combined with the physics puzzles and hack&apos;n&apos;slash moments make for an amazing experience. What might be a downpoint to some is actually one of the best arguments FOR the game: it&apos;s as entertaining as you make it. Uncreative players will soon find themselves using the same techniques for every obstacle and puzzle over and over again. If you let your fantasy do the work you can make it an incredibly entertaining experience though. The only downpoint is that the end feels rather aprupt (which is, according to the developers, due to deadlines). Overall it&apos;s simply fantastic and, at least to me, one of the best games of 2009 at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=1467403">Expand</a></span>

Very gorgeous too look at and to sum up in one word the graphics are wonderful! Everything is put together so well and very pretty i might add. Music is great wonderful fantasy themed and is perfect for the atmosphere of the game. A downside is a not very long campaign, or very much variation. The puzzles are simple but yet there are at least 3 ways to solve each one depending on who is left alive in your party. If you can get this game for $10 or less, do it. Its a fun game that will give you around 5 hours of once-through game play :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=1696076">Expand</a></span>

I have always been a fan of these types of games so maybe my score is a little bias but i love it. 3 different characters with different skills, all well balanced. Good mixture of combat and puzzle solving. A masterpiece!</span>

Its reasonably short though so don&apos;t go into this expecting more than a few decent hours worth of gameplay, the lack of an end boss or real end challenge was a bit of a disappointment but it is a great ride whilst it lasts.</span>

An amazing narrator tells a story while you play, music really sets the mood and the challenges and obstacles are fun.  It&apos;s a perfect recipe I had never imaged before. Everything is amazing about this game. The voice over, the music, the story and the graphics pull this game together.   It&apos;s a breath of fresh air and a great change from all the other cookie cutter games out there.<br>I feel bad now only paying $1.99 for it, and feel I should send the creators another $18 dollars. It&apos;s worth it!<br><br>Get it and play it! You will love it! I don&apos;t give great rating to ANYONE unless I feel they deserve it.

However, a few things hold it back. It&apos;s based entirely on physics. Balancing on things, tipping planks around and such, but sometimes these physics fail. One of the characters, the wizard, can levitate things, but sometimes whenever you try to levitate and object, and make it float, say, down, or left or right, it simply floats upward. Also, once an enemy starts their attack animation, even if you hit them first, or kill them before they swing their weapon, you still get hurt. This makes it incredibly hard to play without getting damaged.<br><br>But it&apos;s still a great game, and definitely worth the 2$ I payed for it on steam. Had I payed the full 20 it normally costs, I would still be happy with my purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=1695748">Expand</a></span>

I was hooked on it until the end - which in my opinion came a little too fast (not that the game is short, but it is not long either: was done in 7-9 hours).  The gameplay is really addictive; the thought-through puzzles, physx engine, and pretty colors make this an awesome sidescroller :)</span>

There are no spoilers here, just know that the ending is very anti-climatic. The ending is what lead me to give Trine a 9 and not a 10. The path to the end, however, is very enjoyable and will keep you enthralled and frustrated at the same time. It took me 2 days or 12 hours to complete Trine and the whole time I just couldn&apos;t seem to force myself away from the PC. If you like puzzle platforming, then you will certainly love this game. Actually, if you just like games that require a bit of free thinking and puzzle solving then you will enjoy it. It can get frustrating at times, but remember: If at first you don&apos;t succeed, Trine, Trine again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=2527167">Expand</a></span>

The game has a lot of charm to it. Although its story is not anything too special, the game&apos;s main strengths lie in its absolutely beautiful graphics, very magical music, and incredibly fun puzzles. You get to play as three characters, that is as all three in one go with the option to swap between them during the game as each one is useful for different situations. You have a Thief who wields a bow to destroy enemies from a distance and also has a grappling hook for climbing purposes. You have a Wizard who can levitate various objects and also to create new ones and to drop them on enemies. And you also have a Knight who is the most action-oriented of the three and is mostly for the moments when you&apos;re swarmed by groups of enemies and need to go melee style. As a result of being able to control any of the three characters at any time, the gameplay has a lot of spice and variety to it. It never gets repetitive. Although you do encounter a lot of enemies throughout, the game is also filled with a huge variety of different puzzles and obstacles which you need to overcome by using the skills your characters possess. A lot of the time there are even multiple ways to solve a certain puzzle. Like you could build a bridge with a Wizard character, or you might wish to instead use the Thief and her grappling hook to swing across. A single playthrough only lasts about 5 or so hours in total, but those 5 hours are really great as you get to enjoy the visual, auditory, and intellectual beauty of the game, not to mention that the replayability is good too, so you&apos;re likely to come back to the game a lot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=2291623">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_2266340"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The premise of this game is similar to that of SNES game The Lost Vikings. You switch between three distinct characters and use their unique abilities to navigate through puzzle-filled action-platformer levels. Trine really kicks it up a notch though, with realistic physics interaction and gorgeous, fluid visuals. Although your character only moves along the 2D plane, there&apos;s a lot of stuff going on in the background. Huge blades will swing from the background, past your player and into the foreground, before slicing back again. It&apos;s a really special touch that is testimony to the level of visual detail in Trine. There&apos;s a huge amount of colour in the environments, which are extremely distinct from one another but all look beautiful. Characters move well for the most part, which is handy seeing as most of the puzzles involve jumping around on tiny platforms. Trine includes some light RPG elements; you can collect experience that allows you to upgrade your abilities when you level up. You can also find lots of unique items throughout the game, some of which are tailored for certain characters. Speaking of the characters; you&apos;ll definitely be using all of them. All three characters can solve most of the puzzles in the game, but you&apos;ll quickly learn which to use in certain situations. Because you shift between the three characters/classes so often, the RPG elements really come into play, and you&apos;ll want to spread out your items fairly evenly. Combat is fun, if a little repetitive, with enemies such as sword, bow and fire-wielding skeletons, ferocious ogres and smaller creatures like bats and spiders. Obviously the knight is the best character in close quarter combat situations, with his strong sword and hammer attacks and the ability to block.<br>The dialogue is pretty funny at times, especially thanks to the great voice acting. It makes you care for the characters a little more than if they had generic, similar voices. All in all Trine is a great game, taking about seven hours to finish and with a stack of replay value. Pick it up on Steam for $15 and you won&apos;t have many regrets.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=2266340">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>&#x2014; Characters are fleshed out in a very light way. You get a quick background on their reasons to do whatever they are/want to do and that&#x2019;s it. While this could be a negative point, you don&#x2019;t really need to know more than what is told to you, and from then on the plot develops over the course of the game and through their dialogue, which is pretty nice. You get just the right amount of information to be able to enjoy the characters and their misadventures.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Characters are rather overpowered in the first game, thanks to the inventory system, allowing you to equip up to 9 artefacts to each character, improving stats or giving them health boosts (or outright giving them a second life). There is also the fact that each character has 3 ranks on their spells, and Amadeus in particular can summon more than twice the number of objects in the first game when compared to the second, including floating platforms which make it easy to bypass obstacles or reach difficult places. In the second game you have to use several skills from the three characters in combination to achieve the same results, making it more enjoyable.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Oh my god, the visuals. Every plant, leaf, statue, EVERYTHING looks absolutely wonderful. And don&#x2019;t even get me started on some of the bosses or goblins in the second game. I don&#x2019;t think I ever took as many screenshots per minute as I did in the Trine games. Back when these games came out in 2009 and 2011 respectively, playing on Extreme settings with a good framerate required a pretty solid rig. But seeing as my four year old GTX670 can keep it capped pretty much all of the time, it&#x2019;s not a stretch anymore.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Occasional oddity in character physics, game has its quirks.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Amadeus is kind of useless in boss fights. He&apos;s a wizard that can summon boxes and move objects, meaning his offensive skills are non-existent.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Having to make movements with the cursor to summon different objects can be a headache and make the game unnecessarily hard on higher difficulties. It would have been easier to just press a specific button for each object (there are only 3 different objects anyways, 2 in the second game). Making said movements with a controller using the analog stick takes even longer than with a mouse and might get annoying after a while. In addition, the speed at which you can levitate certain objects (due to their weight) is painfully slow.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Everything is intuitive and makes sense, puzzles are relatively easy to solve by using simple logic or by just paying attention to your surroundings. Obviously, you&apos;ll have to solve them faster on harder difficulties if you don&#x2019;t want to get killed. It certainly wouldn&apos;t have hurt to have harder puzzles, though that would probably have made certain achievements close to impossible, such as completing levels using only one single character.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Voice acting is wonderful, for some reason I can&#x2019;t put my finger on. Characters seem genuinely friendly and trustful towards each other, except for the first couple of levels in the first game. Characters (especially Amadeus) have a lot of emotion behind them so it&#x2019;s easy for the player to empathize with them, and all dialogue sounds natural and flows well. The narrator is nice too.
<br>
<br>&#x2014; Music is very fitting and relaxing. Goes with the beautiful art and keeps you calm and focused.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: relaxing and fun gameplay, nice music, friendly characters and astounding visuals. If you want a nice co-op experience, go for it. If you want a good single-player experience, go for it too. Especially if you like platformers, puzzles, fantasy games and beautiful scenery.
<br>
<br>Final Gameplay Stats:
<br>
<br>Trine: 11 Hours played, 33 / 33 Achievements (100%)
<br>Trine 2: 55 Hours played, 97 / 97 Achievements (100%)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=5249105">Expand</a></span>

The developers have cleverly combined three unique and individual characters into the players hands that can be switched between to fulfil specific challenges and tasks though the player is never given a concrete solution to each obstacle and can complete each encounter in their own way.

The coop is one of its strengths, having completely different characters is one of its strengths, it&apos;s a shame you do not have online and there are some compatibility issues with the joysticks. The use of physical and 2.5D elements are very well made, the puzzles become very original. The items and system levels is very basic, and much depends on finding the secrets that are scattered on the map (which give rise to an interesting replay value), which sometimes results addictive have all the experience points level. The sound section is pretty basic, since its quite repetitive themes and sound effects with a decent level. The voices do not stand out much because the dialogue is almost nonexistent.

The most time you will spend solving average difficulty puzzles and the hard ones which will drive you mad, because a game physics are frustrating sometimes, so you make a mistakes. The biggest disappointing of characters skills, was that archer couldn&apos;t shoot in the air, so combat was less entertaining for me. The mage&apos;s problem was when you pull up box or a cage, it was keep spinning, so it was hard to manipulate object the way you want. Controls are very unresponsive, which is a very big problem for a game, where you have to jump a lot. Also there are skill system, where you can upgrade your characters abilities and after that solve puzzles easier. But these annoying skeletons!!! They spawned in a small number and were easy to kill, but it was annoying to wait till they all spawn, one after you kill one, - that&apos;s a biggest fail in the game. Music and game theme, atmosphere were ok. Graphics very average. The game could be better, if not all these fails in it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=2114996">Expand</a></span>

With stunning visuals, great music and excellent voice acting (the Knight is especially funny to listen to), Trine is no doubt a treat to your senses.  Three on-the-fly selectable characters, each with unique abilities, fills the thoughtless void typically native to the genre.  A leveling system linked with secret collectibles adds a satisfying, appropriate and very familiar element of replayability.  Trine could use some more diverse enemy models, as the Skeleton proved tiresome after the first encounter.  Trine&apos;s strongest weakness lies in the clumsy-feeling physics-based gameplay, often adding an element of frustrating uncertainty to the movement of your character - thankfully, Trine is not overly challenging (completed in 7 hours, and 100% Steam achievements in 16), but more challenging puzzles and co-op would have been most welcome.  Setting the controls for multiplayer, using a standard xbox gamepad, proved to be an unneeded headache.<br><br>Overall, Trine is a must-have for indie game fans and is highly recommended to platformer fans interested in something unique.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=2294838">Expand</a></span>

The music is absolutely beautiful and perfectly suited to the game and just for listening in general.

And i got less. the game offers too many solutions... So much you don&apos;t really have to think at all. The game is also too easy. The enemies are repetitive. The knight voice, and the jokes... OH MY GOOD... they are really really bad. To the point Im trying to be kind to that aspect.... But I CHOKED hearing so bad  jokes... The first problem... The Characters never interact  between them. That&apos;s lame... I understand during the first half of the game they just say some lines. But near the end they still don&apos;t have a normal Dialog... Example...<br><br>&quot;I smell something is burning&quot;<br><br>&quot;I wish it is not the woods&quot;<br><br>&quot; I wish is Turkey&quot; I made this by myself and I think i made a better joke that what I have in that game... But they interact like that.. Remember When a level started in Lost vikngs and the characters had actual conversations? Remember they INTERACTED talking to each other and playing pranks and jokes between themselves!? Ok here we have characters who constanly say something about something but never criticize each other or have some kind of interaction. And Is not like that is not possible, the knight is so terrible flatminded it deserves the thief play pranks on him and the wizard calms everybody, But no, they dont do anything ... the jokes are bad, the characters have little characterization and they don&apos;t even talk to each other (is like they talk to thin air)<br><br>Now the game itself. The physics are unaccurate, but not to the point is unplayable... But mark my words... If you die, Is because of the physics.<br><br>The enemies range from bats... to skeletons. to monsters. to skeletons... Add some skeletons, some bats, some skeletons, some more skeletons. and . Maybe some more bats... But don&apos;t forget the skeletons!<br><br>This is not the prince of persia times, where your only enemies where swordmen and skeletons. This game really needed difficulty. Voices, and depth...<br><br>Overall I think this game is really hollow and was made with little to no heart.<br><br>I Enjoyed the run... But not enough to play the game again. It just don&apos;t have replayability, this is the first platformer I probably will not play again. Is not bad or mediocre... But really average</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=2338885">Expand</a></span>

The game is fun to go through single-player, but it really shines when you can get one or two friends to play through it with you. Solving the puzzles together while making sure all of you can get through while fighting off bats and skeletons is great fun. The platforming is very solid and while the puzzles are not terrible complicated, getting all the characters through in 3 player can be harder than you think. Graphically the game is gorgeous, the backgrounds and character are incredibly well animated, colorful, and just fun to look at. The one area of the game that I feel could use a little improvement is the combat. The way the enemies spawned could get a bit tiresome at times. There were often only 1 or 2 spawn points in an area but you would have to fight a dozen or more skeletons. This would drag out the fights painfully with you waiting right by the spawn point to kill the same skeleton 5 or 6 times over the course of several minutes instead of just fighting them all at once and moving on. You would kill it for the 5th time and turn around to move to the next puzzle and *whoosh* another skeleton spawns behind you. Still a very fun, solid, and thoroughly enjoyable platform puzzle game. Recommended for anyone that enjoys a good platforming game. Play with friends for the full experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=2518689">Expand</a></span>

In theory each character has their strong points and should contribute to specific areas of the game. However in reality for the majority of the game you could pick which of the three you like the best and roll through levels with them. Compounding on this problem is the fact that the Knight character is mostly useless leaving you to use him to eat damage. The narrative is clever with good voice over work between levels but can&apos;t seem to figure out if it&apos;s trying to be humorous or quaint. The graphics are beautiful but many parts made me wish I had been able to walk into the back/foreground (like Bug 3D). If you enjoy platformers or RPGs this will be worth checking out since it combines elements of both well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=2820478">Expand</a></span>

The physics puzzles are interesting at some places, but sometimes they require precise timing and very accurate key presses which gets annoying. You may like it if you like arcade games but let&apos;s say Limbo is way way better than this one.</span>

<br>
<br>Still when I started the game and saw the story and the amazing visuals... felt so happy to have bought it. Not to mention the collaborative approach that makes you think that one skill is never enough but is team work what can make things really really work.
<br>
<br>I completely congratulate the company and developers for this game that gave me some really nice hours of fun. You can see in every aspect of the game that the people were putting their heart, from the visuals, to the gameplay, the story to the puzzles, its a game designed and developed with passion.
<br>
<br>The only downturn is that the &quot;Very Hard&quot; difficult only unlocks when you first beat the game and I am the kind of person who would like to play a game only once and in maximum difficulty, besides being only slight difference among them.
<br>
<br>Thumbs up for this amazing game!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=2884249">Expand</a></span>

The wizard in particular is enjoyable to play with- there is no jumping puzzle you can&apos;t get through with him. It was enjoyable to have a platformer reward you for thinking outside the box. Some parts can be extremely frustrating, but it might just have been me being an idiot.</span>

I read in credits that &apos;the game is different but totally entertaining&apos;. It would be so if not these broken mechanics. I hated that my plank would appeare not where I want it to, moving things was horrible and especially when I would draw a triangle and got a box. The tempo, a flow of a game was missing. Because of that it became really static and often annoying. But for the price of 0,74  it is really viable game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/trine/user-reviews?user_review_id=3888640">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Sharp and colourful visuals and a decent physics engine is what this game offers and not much more than that. The story and characters are so very cliche, and the gameplay is fairly unremarkable, just a stock standard puzzle platformer with nothing else going for it. Nothing particularly original, nothing hugely entertaining.

Combining platforming with puzzling and setting it in a beautiful fantasy world. It&apos;s a 2D platfomer where you can either play with friends in 3 player co-op or alone. You have a choice of 3 fairly unique characters that have their own set of skills that can also be leveled up, more on that later. There is the Pontius the knight who wields a sword and shield, who is probably the best character to use when fighting off the hordes of undead. Then there&apos;s Zoya the thief who has a bow and arrow, which can be used to both kill undead or shoot switches and buttons. Finally we have Amadeus the wizard who can conjure up boxes and platform and levitate them, alongside several other objects in the game. This trio of heroes are what you are given in order to solve puzzles and progress through the game.
<br>You can also level up these characters as you make your way through the story. Collecting experience orbs which will eventually grant you with a level up upon reaching 50 orbs, which grants you 1 point for use on a skill. Save the points up and you can afford my expensive, more valuable skills. The range from things like the knight&apos;s sword to set ablaze to things like Zoya being able to fire ice arrows or the wizard picking up and throwing enemies.
<br>Graphically the game looks fantastic. Beautifully detailled backgrounds, which lovingly sets the scene and along with the music that nicely sets the atmosphere.
<br>In my opinion it&apos;s a lot more fun to play with friends than by yourself. But overall a fantastic game that does so many things right and brings back memories of the classic platforming games of old. Worth a look if you want something co-op that&apos;s enjoyable and somewhat nostalgic.
