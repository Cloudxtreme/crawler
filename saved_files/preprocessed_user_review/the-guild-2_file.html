Plus, the bugs effectively make it completely unplayable. I wish I could give it a higher score.</span>

The bugs really really held the game back.  But at the same time, there&apos;s a game there that wants to be loved.  In its present state, as can be purchased on Steam, the game is well worth grabbing a copy of!</span>

<br>
<br>First of all, the game runs horribly on almost any machine. Not optimized at all. The concepts behind the game are great, but little can be said about the execution.
<br>
<br>Disregarding the terrible performance issues, characters actions are very clunky and rough. It&apos;s missing many mechanics that are needed to conform to it&apos;s structure, particularly RPG elements, in that respect it feels unfinished.
<br>
<br>The game is very suggestive about the type of game it wants to be, but has no content to back it up, which could leave you being frustrated with it.
<br>
<br>The already implimented mechanics behave randomly and you will be getting into trouble for no apparent reason. My main character was tending to his Farms when theives attacked, I retaliated and defended my property for which I was repremanded and taken to court for defending myself and my possessions.
<br>
<br>The only form of policing is some gaurds that do not bother with such issues, so without any security you must defend yourself and you will be punished for that. In fact the law system is so backwards that you will most likely spend half of the game in court or in jail, even if you are a model citizen, which just breaks the game in its entirety.
<br>
<br>Some fun to be had, but don&apos;t expect it to last long.

For example, want to expand your business to another town, but your carts keep getting attacked by bandits on the way? Attack the bandit camp with your mercenaries, or pay to have your carts escorted, or just buy the camp itself, then use those same bandits to attack competitors carts. It&apos;s a very deep game that, once you get into it, will make you realize what kind of person you would be if you had power. Will you be a benevolent leader of a city, or a bandit king controlling the local town through terror?
<br>
<br>In summary, it has its bugs, though it never crashed for me, but it&apos;s incredibly addicting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-guild-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4377059">Expand</a></span>
