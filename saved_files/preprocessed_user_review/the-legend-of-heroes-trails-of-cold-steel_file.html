I would say that in particular, this game even stands out from previous Trails titles with its level of characterization and overall lovableness of the main cast (helped in no small part by bonding events reminiscent of Persona). Not only is the lore deep and interesting, the game eases you into it masterfully, so that even series first-timers can get a solid grasp on the significance of certain plot events. The combat mechanics, a huge step up from past games, are incredibly fun and evolve a bit over the course of the game. The game overall just has a peculiar effect, a spirit to it that hooks you and forces you to form emotional attachments to main characters, locations, factions, and even NPCs - which makes it all the more effective when some of these attachments are tested in Trails of Cold Steel II.
<br>
<br>This new PC port comes out swinging with a ton of potential; the higher-end graphical enhancements more than rise to the challenge of adapting what is essentially a handheld title to meet the standards of PC gaming. However, while the largest flaw of the Vita version (long loading times), seems to have been resolved, there were a few graphical glitches in the game&apos;s initial release. It seems, though, that the developers immediately recognized these issues and jumped to work on fixing them, so I expect they should be patched up very soon. And of course, the anime-stylized 3D models that were at least passable in a 2014 handheld seem a little awkward in a 2017 title.
<br>
<br>All in all, Trails of Cold Steel is a high-tier and incredibly fun JRPG that will stick with you for a very long time (and at 70-90 hours per playthrough, it had better). As with most Nihon Falcom titles, the game&apos;s concept, story, and &quot;heart&quot; are a solid 10/10, while the execution unfortunately tends to waver at a 7/10. This is nonetheless an excellent game, and a must-play for all JRPG fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel/user-reviews?user_review_id=7447676">Expand</a></span>

Do we have to know every single feelings, every single though. Many, many sequence are very arduous...so be prepared to skip a lot of dialogues in the like you never seen before. The fighting is well done but again in the last chapter you are hit with an impossible boss to handle. The graphics are to the level of a PS3 game. The 3D models are quite basic. Overall it was a fun JRPG but the dialogues skipping can be a long exercise of patience. I give it a 70%.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel/user-reviews?user_review_id=7629372">Expand</a></span>
