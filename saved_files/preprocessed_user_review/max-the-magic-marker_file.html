The game play, platforming, and mechanics are simple and easy enough for a child to master in not very much time. The mechanic of drawing objects is implemented in a much better fashion in comparison to Crayon Physics Deluxe, for example, but that is still far from a compliment. The music is good, and fitting of the game world, but it does repeat quite often. The overall level design is bland, repetitive, and uninspired. The checkpoints are available throughout each level, and they are put to use for the benefit of the player, and not because of difficulty. Because of the game&apos;s overall limitation, it is better suited for short play times, as it does get boring very fast. Soon after progressing to the second world, the game has severe crashing to desktop problems with no errors. It simply quits the game and puts you back into the desktop. Other users have had the same exact problem and you can read further about it in the Steam forums. The developers have stayed silent about this game breaking issue, and have not responded in any way, nor corrected the problem with a patch. With an already extremely limited amount of content and bleak game play, Max &amp; the Magic Marker feels more like an attempt at making large amounts of money than actual care and attention to game craftsmanship. The asking price for this game is pure insanity. Do not feed their greed and achingly poor game design and programming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/max-the-magic-marker/user-reviews?user_review_id=2332737">Expand</a></span>
