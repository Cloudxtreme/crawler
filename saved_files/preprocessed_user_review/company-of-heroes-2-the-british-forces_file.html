The  emplacements are the key to this faction (in my opinion). Any other tactic I tried using ended in a complete loss but just seeing that bofurs chew up infantry was worth it. The anti-tank emplacement can take out many light vehicles w/ one shot! Would have loved to have seen more content given to current races along with this nickel+dime piece but not everyone can be like cdproject red! Hopefully, with mods, it balances out with current roster. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s just me but the A.I for Brits is actually extremely good and setup emplacements strategically.
<br>Would not pay more than $10 for this one race. Wait for steam sale unless relic adds more content to all existing forces.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/company-of-heroes-2-the-british-forces/user-reviews?user_review_id=5457756">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Brittish forces have ruined the entire multplayer experice. Forums are full of disscusions and it has split up the community. Im going to be honest. I liked the british forces at first. I won everything and as a hardcore player I saw the strenghts of the british forces. Until I noticed 1 thing. The OKW and the Whermacht are both in teamgames not able to counter them. The british are just too **** good. I have 500+ hours in Coh2 , sc2 , ruse and wargame. Though I ve never seen such an unbalaced faction. It forces the whermacht to play a certain type of game or they will lose. And don&apos;t try to convince me that the OKW has even a chance. The axis can only win if the enemy team is bad. The OKW is now compleetly USELESS. I hate this update I can only play allies now if I want an eazy win. And stats let us see that the british are the most dominant team players. In 1v1 they suck. But in 2v2 and above they are gods. Man do I hate them I cant play this game anymore the axis only win with luck and people call you a noob if you tell them that the british are op. Lets pjust look at the stats shall we. First of all the british have great stats comparable to the OKW but even better in cover. And as more of these fight play out behind cover (as the axis are mostly long ranged) the brittish have a minor adavtage cost /strenght compared. The OKW can outclass these with Obersoldaten but that&apos;s much later on. Second thing is that the bunkers of the brittish are nearly invunable tip use fire grenades. It is the only counter the only one as tanks can be quickly delth with. Still then the brits are dug in you lose. Deal with it. Mortars blow up al you inf tanks are useless art is outclassed and that is why I say Nerf or Remove.
<br>
<br>0/10 worst modern rts because of a **** faction and no there is no counter just look up a wiki for their stat they are just blately stronger thank you now stop playing brittan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/company-of-heroes-2-the-british-forces/user-reviews?user_review_id=5546237">Expand</a></span>

<br>All joking aside, I like this new faction. It takes a bit to set up, but late game, the British forces just roll in with churchills supported by fireflies and a couple engineers and you just steamroll everything. The only reason it&apos;s not perfect for me, is that I can definitely see this as being OP and will expect nerfs to happen. Especially to the Heavy engineers with the x2 repair time, and the Churchill tank in general. Firefly is pretty balanced though.
<br>
<br>This is a defensive faction. Be conservative setting up, guard choke points with anti tank emplacements, and machine guns and when you have the resources, unleash the mighty Churchill tanks (Those things are definitely gonna see a nerf.) and roll right over the enemy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/company-of-heroes-2-the-british-forces/user-reviews?user_review_id=5481992">Expand</a></span>

Prior to their release the game felt like it was headed in the right direction. the current match up of OKW vs Brits is comparable to the USF vs OKW, when WFA was first released. the Wehr Forces are able to put up a fight against the Brits, but it feels like you are forced to play a very certain way. Which after a few matches just feels boring. the forums are rife with allies finally telling axis players to L2P, though funny, not what i wanted to see from a new allied force. Hopefully with patching this content can be brought in line with the other armies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/company-of-heroes-2-the-british-forces/user-reviews?user_review_id=5470016">Expand</a></span>

Brits shine when you play the game defensively, so you better hope you have a Soviet player on your side or else you&apos;re pretty much scr*wed. Because if you do decide to play offensively, the Brits does not have 1 heavy tank that can take on a German heavy. Not one... Hmm... You&apos;ll have to risk a few medium tanks to flank it. So at the end of the day, the fact of the matter is, you can keep the Axis at bay, but for how long exactly?
<br>
<br>The Brits are a nice addition to the game as it breathes some fresh new air into this somewhat old game. But as it stands, when it comes to Allies, the Soviets are still more powerful and Brits as a faction is rather weak tbh.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/company-of-heroes-2-the-british-forces/user-reviews?user_review_id=6161481">Expand</a></span>
