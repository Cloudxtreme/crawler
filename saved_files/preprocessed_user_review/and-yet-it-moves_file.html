The game play mechanics are annoying, awkward, slow, and unintuitive. The repetitiveness in death is only a replacement for actual game content and game play. The puzzles are like chores, and not actually fun or entertaining. Within fifteen minutes you will grasp and understand the small amount of amusement this game offers, while at the same time growing tired of playing it with each passing minute. It is a lesson in poor game design and lack of creativity. There are barely any sounds nor music. There is no charm, fun, creativity, nor intrigue. And Yet It Moves is another independent showcasing of what game development should steer clear from. It is a cheap, short, flat, unexciting, unexceptional, deficient attempt at game design. There is nothing to see nor experience here. It is a freeware game disguised with an exorbitant asking price from developers who obviously lack shame and humility. And Yet It Moves is inadequate in every fathomable way, and it exemplifies everything that gaming should not be about. There is no actual game content and no game play. It is self-conceited to make up for all of its failures and shortcomings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/and-yet-it-moves/user-reviews?user_review_id=2319503">Expand</a></span>

The art style deserves points for being unique, but it&apos;s unfortunately also rather bland. Gameplay is extremely simple. You can walk left or right, jump, and rotate the direction of gravity (left, right, or 180). The ability to control gravity is not exactly innovate (just for one example, see Yoshi&apos;s Universal Gravitation from Nintendo, which came out years ago). The only innovation to the &quot;control gravity&quot; gameplay is that the camera rotates and fall damage is turned on, making the game a slightly dizzying physics puzzle. In addition to not feeling like anything particularly special, the gameplay just feels clunky and annoying. The player character walks like its trudging through a tar pit and the gravity control is just frustrating (not in a &quot;this game is challenging but rewarding&quot; kind of way, but in a &quot;this game often feels like a practical joke on the player&quot; sort of way). I kept playing it because I wanted to know if it got better, but the game eventually reached a point where I would rather stab myself in the eye with a sharpened pencil than play with its gravity gimmick for another minute. This is not on the list of the worst games I have ever played, by any means, but I do think it&apos;s a fairly mediocre game and not very deserving of most of the hype it got. I love indie games and want them to succeed as much as the next person, and I know indies gotta eat, but a spade is still a spade. Not a game I would recommend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/and-yet-it-moves/user-reviews?user_review_id=2064144">Expand</a></span>

GAMEPLAY: You will die quite often. It&apos;s a little bit frustrating, but that comes along with this genre. Some of the deaths however are a result of the controls: You can change the gravity-direction in 90 degrees only, the world is then animated by turning, which takes up some time. This feels slow and is simply annoying in a freefall, where you could use it best.<br>VISUALS: When I saw the trailer I thought this is some cool artistic style. It is not. The developers wanted to keep it TOO simple. Though there are cave-levels and tree-levels, both look quite similar and lack of variety. The addition of some Monty-Python-esque animals rather feels cheap than funny (as probably intended).<br>SOUND: Nothing spectacular. It does its job though. LEVELDESIGN: Some few interesting spots and a lot of &quot;seen before&quot; platforming. The Humble Bundle also includes the game VVVVVV, which is quite similar (instead of jumping you can change the gravity upside-down). That game has a far superior leveldesign and feels much more rewarding despite being much more frustrating and having minimal visuals.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/and-yet-it-moves/user-reviews?user_review_id=1712962">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>And Yet It Moves was a game I got from a Humble bundle a while ago. It was a game that I that I looked forward to and tried to enjoy but couldn&apos;t I had beaten this game once and have played it again and both times I have dislike this game due to it&apos;s design. The game was a great idea but the execution of it was bad. I will try to objectively as possible tell you why it&apos;s just bad game to avoid.
<br>
<br>Game play: The game is played as a 2D platformer with a twist where you can rotate the world. This changes how you navigate the worlds as you take into account of gravity and fall speed. It is a great idea but it isn&apos;t done well enough. In the first chapter and the first half of the second chapter, it works good as the game slowly introduces new elements. These levels are not frustrating and are fun. It&apos;s after the second half of chapter two is were it goes downhill. Levels become for frustrating where you need to do multiple rotations quickly along with avoiding death traps and bottomless pits. This is due to how gravity and fall speed affects your character. Once your character begins to flail, this means you will go splat after landing and it easy to do it as rotating speeds this up. Now you may think that as long as you take your time and not marathon this game then it should be enjoyable but this is not the case. It requires a lot of precision and there is a noticeable lag. Key presses can be ignored by the game if you rotate too quickly. You can easily notice this in time trial mode were your times can wildly vary from 3-7 seconds on one checkpoint along even when just about the same thing. I one got seven minutes when I felt I did worse getting to the checkpoint then the last one. Unfortunately I can&apos;t officially verify it as bad programing but it was frustrating. Later levels spread their check points out quite far where you have to re-due plenty of frustrating sections again. Now if your a completionist like I am and want to complete time trial mode then prepared to be frustrated. The third level speed run demonstrates this and I would hate to play the fourth one and navigate bats through the level. The ending is not worth it as it&apos;s just a simple thanks for playing message. I hated this game once I had beaten it.
<br>
<br>Graphics:
<br>
<br>The graphics are paper cut outlines of real world images. It basically a Paper Mario style except it doesn&apos;t blend well. It stands out a lot in not a good way. Only the last chapter looks good with it&apos;s trippy look. There are very few animations except for a few and the character&apos;s is the best. He looks like a very detailed stop motion animation that is very complete looking. Sound in the game is also lacking with only a few sound effects and one song that sounds like sound effects. It&apos;s gives the game a lonely and boring feel.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>
<br>This game is bad. The level design is okay in the first half of the game but the later half is frustrating due to the precision required.  Add time trial mode and the levels are just plain frustrating to play. That is not fun. It&apos;s graphically and audibly dull thought the game. Only the final chapter as some good art design. I can&apos;t recommend this game to anyone and would suggest avoiding it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/and-yet-it-moves/user-reviews?user_review_id=2491915">Expand</a></span>

I am all for indie games, and these days, they are my main source of entertainment. However, And Yet It Moves fails to entertain. It&apos;s a poor platformer with stiff controls. Dying repeatedly isn&apos;t the infuriating part of the game, oh no. The so called &quot;soundtrack&quot; is. It&apos;s a random assortment of poor attempts at beat boxing and other similar vocal noises. The game play honestly just feels stale. The whole point is to rotate the map, and unfortunately, that&apos;s as far from linear as the game gets. Every goal is simply start to finish. As a mainly retro gamer, this isn&apos;t a concept that I&apos;m unused to, but when the game makes no attempt to freshen this up, it creates a very boring experience. Rating this game on the same scale to other indie games is just unfortunate. The game&apos;s &quot;artstyle&quot; is very poor. I imagine that some people think that it&apos;s &quot;interesting&quot; and &quot;cool.&quot; But honestly, it isn&apos;t. It&apos;s a shoddy assortment of random google JPGs. The lead character looks especially bad. Quite honestly, just looking at him makes no sense. Everything in this game seems to be poised to just sell gimmick as a game. From one side of the coin, you could say that game is a platformer with unique elements, distinct artstyle and intriguing soundtrack. On the other side, you see a talentless game making a stale game because he has no artistic talent and musical skills. The ratings this game has been receiving are unfortunate because there are so many better indie games out there that are so overlooked.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/and-yet-it-moves/user-reviews?user_review_id=1440412">Expand</a></span>

The visual style is quite different and novel. the puzzles are quite good... it has a clever selection of puzzle elements that are combined in clever ways. The sounds and music are all right.. perhaps a bit lacking in variety? I didn&apos;t particularly like the control scheme (keys can&apos;t be customized). I would have preferred if movement was controlled by the right hand (just like how we played the early platformers). But eventually I got the hang of it (after a LOT of dying inadvertently). Thankfully, dying is not unpleasant due to the sheer number of checkpoints. I liked that i didn&apos;t have to bother with saving and loading manually. Anyway, buy it.. in my opinion it&apos;s quite good for the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/and-yet-it-moves/user-reviews?user_review_id=1715000">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Good: Sharp, beautiful art style; interesting concept.
<br>The Bad: Uninspired, repetitive and not that well executed.
<br>
<br>The premise behind And Yet It Moves is an interesting one: rotating a paper collage world around a also-paper character (instead of simply controlling the character directly) until he finds his place back in the landscape by the end of each level. And that premise is beautifully presented with a vivid, almost tactile environment that easily catches your eye from the very beginning. So what&apos;s wrong with AYIM?
<br>
<br>Well, unfortunately there&apos;s enough to break the spell. The game suffers from some repetitive level design, and even when new mechanics are added they aren&apos;t always well implemented: some, like the springboard, simply doesn&apos;t feel right; others, like using fire, aren&apos;t clear enough.
<br>
<br>Also, the paper guy is way too fragile--presumable, but much more than any other paper object around him--and he can&apos;t stand the slightest change of mind by the player without being squished (that&apos;s the sound he makes dying) by gravity. Aside being sluggish, which just adds to the feeling he ultimately denies any dynamics such a core mechanic could suggest.
<br>
<br>Even laying a bit on the short side (it can be beaten in less than 3 hours) AYIM can be a dragging experience due to the aforementioned issues. In a way the meat of the game defeats the purpose of some interesting alternative playmodes like Speed Run, Time Trial and Limited Rotations.
<br>
<br>Wrapping it up with a reference to indie darlings, And Yet It Moves is a Samorost that demands some platforming precision it wasn&apos;t built for in the first place.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/and-yet-it-moves/user-reviews?user_review_id=3392929">Expand</a></span>
