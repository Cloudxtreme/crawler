It looks better, sure, but that&apos;s about it. For HOI-veterans it&apos;s just too simplified, for the average newcomer it&apos;s still too demanding and unstructured. The simple truth is: You can&apos;t turn a game like HoI into a game that suits the needs of the average casual player. HOI 3 was demanding, true, but it was rewarding as well, once you found your way through the complexity. HOI4 however offers no such degree of complexity. Building your army, for instance, is nothing but assigning divisions to a commander. That&apos;s it. You command them by drawing lines on a map, a so called battle plan. Once you activate your plan, you have to wait till it&apos;s completed (or failed). Before that you cant do anything to react to changing situations. The game plays as boring as this review reads.
<br>
<br>Air combat, which was ok in HOI3, is now degraded to assigning randomly put together squadrons (size doesn&apos;t matter) to a region (like for instance &quot;Northern France&quot;, thats how big these regions are!) and wait for your enemies to be shot down. Nice idea, actually, but you don&apos;t get any feedback at all without clicking through three screens. And you can&apos;t demand air support for a specific part of the front where battle is at a critical point. Your bombers just fly over said region and bombard all enemy units in combat at the same rate.
<br>
<br>IN HOI4 you just don&apos;t get the level of immersion and presence which HOI3 offered. Everything feels detached and not really important. Your armies march according to pre-drawn lines, while your commanders make nonsensical decisions which you cannot undo before it&apos;s too late. Tech trees are apallingly linear and boring. The only good bit is the &quot;national achievement&quot; thing where you can unlock some bonuses for your country. But even they become boring after having it played twice.
<br>
<br>HOI4 should have been a milestone. Unfortunately, it&apos;s just a very expensive version of a free-to-play browser game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6477684">Expand</a></span>

<br>Veterans should not be afraid, since it&apos;s possible to micro if they want to.
<br>I would say this game combines the depth of the previous Paradox games, but with a welcome Interface and mechanics overhaul.
<br>If i should summarize, i would say it&apos;s easy to learn, hard to master.
<br>Everyone should try it, and they will like it !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6475602">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The army organization structure was simplified, compared to HoI3 and HoI2. Now you can just take few random division, assign commander to it, and call it an &apos;Army&apos;. It does not matter what&apos;s the distance between those divisions, even if one of them is in Siberia, and the other is fighting in southern Spain.
<br>You can now draw the fronts and battle plans. A good idea poorly implemented. AI will move army division around the front so much, they will never be &apos;ready&apos; for an offensive action. I guess the remedy is to use separate armies for a defence and offence, but what&apos;s the point then? Eventually, you&apos;ll end up doing good old microcontrol.
<br>I am not sure if it&apos;s a battle system, or just AI is so bad, but every, and I mean - every - nationalists failure in Spanish Civil war ended up with their division being pocketed - by an infantry - and destroyed.
<br>The combat is unnaturally long, a light tank division fought with infantry on plains for 40 days. It won, eventually.
<br>
<br>The political map was changed. Instead of painting maps with certain color, only borders are now colored. This looks cute, but it is absolutely useless, especially with large countries such as USSR.
<br>Division markers are very tiny, you can not really see what units are standing there.
<br>
<br>The research was dumbed down just as military structure was. Now you just research &apos;the next infantry division&apos;, &apos;the next fighter&apos;, &apos;the next tank&apos;, etc. The research time is always the same, there are no research teams like in HoI2, or country proficiency like in HoI3. It can be halved by national focus, though.
<br>
<br>National focus is pretty much old-fascioned national decisions - it takes some time and &apos;political points&apos; to get some research time reduced, or add factories, or ... get political points. Many of these focuses are just that - get political points. Other than attaining focuses, political points are used to change ministers or national policies. And initially, no ministers are hired.
<br>Only basic events are implemented, like in HoI3, I guess. For example, when Spanish Civil War breaks out, there is no event for USSR to help Republicans. You can, of cause, send volunteers and materiel to the country manually; but you won&apos;t get any rewards if Republicans win, like you did in HoI2.
<br>
<br>Production was improved, though. The annoying system of HoI2 and HoI3 where you distributed your production points between different needs were abandoned. Now you directly assign your factories to build military equipment, ships, or more factories.
<br>Apparently, you armies does not require upkeep/supplies anymore, or they are just masterfully hidden from player&apos;s sight. A big loss, I&apos;d say. Supplies was a big deal in HoI2, and a huge headache in HoI3.
<br>
<br>All in all, the game looks super casual. If you&apos;re looking for some in-depth strategy game, you should probably sit this out. If you&apos;re looking for a casual strategy game, you should probably look up something on facebook, I guess there are 3 or 4 lying around.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6476659">Expand</a></span>

<br>They took a wargaming franchise and turned it into something really confusing. Without things like counters or a well organized battle interface, the game strongly discourages you from playing without its built in strategic planning system. There&apos;s no loner any level of organization other than a vague &quot;army&quot;, which is incredibly unwieldy to play with unless you like the AI to play the entire game for you.
<br>
<br>The key difference between EU4 and HOI4 is that EU4 successfully modernized and streamlined gameplay without losing the essence of what Europa Universalis was. HOI4 is literally just EU4 without any consideration of the kind of game Hearts of Iron is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6474264">Expand</a></span>

Instead you will end up building up your prewar economy as USA and preparing for war only to discover that in 1941 Germany didn&apos;t even conquer Denmark yet and is getting overrun by Belgium, that SU doesn&apos;t guard their borders at all (so German divisions are slowly moving toward Moscow, while Berlin is occupied by 4 Belgium divisions and that Japan just sits on their island after conquering China in 6 months.

When you attempt the take control back, you&apos;ll find only the most basic options from the previous games are left.
<br>
<br>At the moment there are so many other issues. The AI is so terrible that it has no idea how to fight a war. It constantly gifts you victories by not defending vital provinces and allowing units to be cut off and destroyed without any attempt to rescue them. The simplified air combat and logistics, the reduced choice of using either AI control or direct control, the research options which take away a lot of the choices from HoI3 and which mean you can end up with nothing left to research by the early 1942. The completely unrealistic coups and civil wars which you can spark in other countries to distract them. That every major country in the world has the exact same research capacity, and the minor countries have almost as much.
<br>
<br>In previous HoI games, there were some rough patches at launch, but the core mechanics were there and it was immediately obvious that there was a good game underneath, despite the issues.  I&apos;m not seeing it yet for HoI4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6504447">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This unfortunately is the total opposite, every game feels the same even with different nation, there is nothing to do while in peace, with democratic or communist ideology you just sit there and wait for fascist to declare wars, with the latter you just invade a couple of small countries and it&apos;s World War time.
<br>
<br>The game lacks a lot of important informations about how to play, the tutorial doens&apos;t explain half of what you need to know and the first ours (assuming you aren&apos;t a veteran of the series) will be spent looking online how to do this? and how does that work? Yet when you understand these things the game become simple... far too much.
<br>
<br>-Diplomacy is ridicolously lacking.
<br>-Trade is just a couple of checkbox to tick and that&apos;s it, don&apos;t even know why they bother adding it.
<br>-Production is just: spam factories, spam weapons and spam troops.
<br>-Technology tree is underdeveloped, there aren&apos;t very many choices and most of them are useless anyway.
<br>-National focus same as technology tree.
<br>
<br>But this game is about combat right? Well you&apos;ll wonder how it is implemented? The answer is poorly, you have very little control over your forces as a whole, you send navy and airforce to patrol areas which are far too big, ex. France is divided in just 2 zones for planes and between Spain and USA there are 3 sea zones, you send your planes/ships on mission and thats it never worry about them again, they even come back to autorepair themselves.
<br>
<br>For ground combat there isn&apos;t much to say, except that the AI is outright broken and cannot perform it correctly (i hope this isn&apos;t working as intended) expecially against the player, playing as Italy i had my troops in Jugoslavia and conquered Bulgaria which independence was guaranteed by the allies so France and UK declares war on me, i had literally no one on the western fronts (alps) while France had a whole army they could have taken the entire northern Italy just by walking over there before i could have the chance to stop them and strike back yet they didn&apos;t lift a finger, while UK just kept sending small stack forces (1-2 divisions) with naval invasions to suicide without a chance of success.
<br>
<br>The AI is very easily exploited by players, you can always encircle enemies from the flanks and create pockets who quickly runs out of supplies and you then can attack easily thus decimating hostile armies, or you can send a motorized/light tanks division behind enemy lines and rush their capital or make a snake through their victory points with it making the enemy nation capitulate instantly, or even stage a coup which erupt in civil war in any country far too easily, even turn USA communist of Soviet Union fascist in a year of game time, even if you can conquer the world with a few divisions you need a giant army of MP to garrison the area you conquer and ensure them from resistance, it took me
<br>more MPS to secure France than soldiers to conquer it.
<br>
<br>As far as tactics go all it&apos;s very disappointing, you don&apos;t really need to modify the standard divisions maybe just add some artillery and you&apos;re good the rest you can make without it, to create an army just merge your divisions assign them a commander and you&apos;re done, assign them a front and give them an offensive plan, it may sound interesting but it really only means point an arrow in the direction you want them to go then click execute battle plan and that&apos;s it, now sit back and enjoy making the game run on speed five watching floating numbers painting the map of your color.
<br>
<br>Once you&apos;ve done it with all major nations you might just aswell uninstall the game because as i said it is very repetitive, every country feel the same and it gets boring real fast, unless you might want to wait for the multitude of DLCs that will no doubt come, i won&apos;t for sure buy them.
<br>
<br>Overall this title feels like a browser based free to play game, except it costs 40&#x20AC; and it&apos;s not worth the price it asks, it isn&apos;t the WWII strategy game that i was looking forward to, for now i&apos;ll stick to Company of Heroes 2 for the WWII part and maybe to civilization for the diplomacy/trade part.
<br>
<br>On a final note the game is incapable of providing a good challenge and unable to mantaining itself interesting for more than a few hours, it ages very fast, not suited for hardcore nor casual players, if it wasn&apos;t still clear it&apos;s to absolutely avoid, at least at the price it is proposed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6495820">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Although it really pissed me off that you cannot really control your troops manually without grouping them into many really small armies and assigning them really limited orders (which was stupid to me) or without losing massive planning bonuses, or that when you go and try to position your divisions on your own, the moment they reach their destination, AI will move them wherever it thinks it suits its plan best, but I was thoroughly shocked how many details were omitted, and to be honest, if you are not huge a fan of multiplayer, those were the things that kept you playing and enjoying the game for long weeks.
<br>
<br>I could write about many things that have stricken me at various moments during my gameplay, but I&apos;m too tired of being upset while playing to go into these details once again. I&apos;m going to restrict myself only to mention the very thing that made me stop playing this game. It was provinces, from naming to layout.
<br>
<br>I mean how come that although you have tons of tiny provinces on the map, the only thing that really matters are larger regions? And how come when you click at the biggest cities in your country, you cannot even see a picture of them and some brief description, rather than a vague terrain type name plus some combat modifiers&apos; descriptions? Did Paradox really think it would be enjoyable to conquer some unidentified, unnamed swaths of land? What for? The same stuff with the divisions. It is possible to assign an army leader, but what was wrong with the corps leaders? In HoI3 or (my favorite) HoI2 you had a chance to really get attached even to your single corps (German mechanized and panzer ones were my favorites), led by one of your favorite generals. Now? In such a big and historically rich country as III Reich or Japan you have merely 20 - 30 commanders to chose from, and I don&apos;t even want to bring up such nonsenses as Erwin Rommel being able to command 24 divisions in the beginning of war... I&apos;m sorry Paradox but you really **** this one up bad guys. You had ALL THE DAMN DATABASES with the names, photos and such, you could have made it easier, I don&apos;t care, but why making something so rich so shallow and dull?
<br>
<br>This game has really lost the feeling of reality and richness which ever EU4 or CK2 have (even though there is far less history in them). After what I have experienced with HoI4 I am really hoping someone someday will just make a remake of HoI2 with better graphics and maybe some modifications and not throw all the legacy straight to the trash can.
<br>
<br>I still think this game is playable, and comparing to other parodies of real games you can find on the market it is decent and somewhat enjoyable product, but I feel so disappointed that I can&apos;t force myself to rate HoI4 higher than 0, or in a word description: a huge misunderstanding. If I could wish for something right now, I would hope that somebody from Paradox sees this short lament and thinks about at least some of the things I&apos;ve mentioned here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6575233">Expand</a></span>

<br>-No jet 2D or 3D art
<br>-Nothing to do once war ends
<br>-Terrible Trade system
<br>-No fuel system for tanks or ships
<br>-Absolutely braindead AI
<br>-You can win a war by making tentacles to victory points
<br>-Focus trees run out way too fast
<br>-Peace system is broken
<br>
<br>Overall the game is a let down.  It is not a terrible do-not-buy game but it definitely does not live up to the hype.  It is way too casual.  In 2 years it will be good but only due to DLC.  Try playing EU4 without DLC, it&apos;s the paradox formula to flood us with DLC.  So it will be good if you&apos;re willing to shell out $200.  But no game should make you do that.

<br>This game is EU4 converted to WW2 rather than building on what they already had with HOI3. A lot of effort has clearly been made on the graphics and it does look a lot better but it&apos;s hard not to conclude that a lot of this is wasted effort especially when you see useless features such as the epilepsy inducing day / night cycle (that fortunately can be turned off ). This simply is not the type of game you play to see great graphics and when the game ships with a very weak AI you have to wonder who decided the priorities.
<br>In short this game is entertaining for the casual player who only wants to play it a couple of times but its not an in depth war game. The hot tip is to play as a smaller nation and try to conquer the world as playing as a large nation is simply too easy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6478784">Expand</a></span>

I have been a fan since the first HOI and I am not sure how Paradox messed HOI4 up so badly.  They took everything that was great and replaced it with a watered down version or just removed it all together.  Long story short, if you like grand strategy games or any of the previous HOI games, then don&apos;t buy this one.</span>

I am very disappointed with the last two Paradox games, Stellaris and Hearts of Iron IV.
<br>
<br>My problem with Hearts of Iron IV is that it&apos;s simply too easy. The AI is braindead. I usually end the Spanish Civil War early on by sending a single volunteer armored and motorized division and driving them straight into Madrid through an open gap in the Spanish lines. For warfare you just draw some lines and then you watch the front going, the question isn&apos;t if you will win, the question is when you will win.
<br>
<br>Paradox has been lazy with portraits and flags, meaning that once again, the big countries are much more fun that the small countries. For the Netherlands they just copied the Victoria II Holstein flag, thinking Holstein was the same as Holland.
<br>
<br>States are poorly shaped so you cant form the historical borders and you cant release historical countries such as Croatia during WW2.
<br>
<br>The game feels more arcadey and more cartoonish than the previous game, sacrificing historical realism for extra mainstream consumers that just want to fast-paced action. This effectively and sadly took away all the fun for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6502629">Expand</a></span>

What the game currently lacks is long-term entertainment, there are far too few diplomatic and economic options and playing it feels almost always the same, no matter what country you are playing. I really, really like the new battle plan system and the production. But there are so many details missing that you had for instance in EU4. I have to say, though, that most of them were added with a DLC and that in HoI4 they could do the same, but at the moment, it just gets boring after a day. Also huge performance issues. The game runs at the same framerates  with Intel and nVidia graphics and it doesn&apos;t change when setting everything to minimum so the CPU is the bottleneck, BUT I&apos;ve got a 4,5 GHz 6700K so I don&apos;t see where lag could be coming from, that really ought to be fixed as soon as possible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6539371">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Tech tree is maybe just a little too streamlined(why would I build Light Tanks when I can build Light Tank IIs just a few months later?).
<br>
<br>Honestly it&apos;s less immersive than HoI3. My guess is that the audience for HoI3&apos;s complexity was just too small, even by PDX standards, that they had to try and make this somehow more casual friendly. That doesn&apos;t necessarily make it a bad game, its just kind of meant to reach a different, bigger audience this time around.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6477844">Expand</a></span>

<br>AI is retarded. For instance Germany declared war on Poland (+UK, France), after a month it declared on USSR, yeah didn&apos;t work out very well. Why would you teach AI to evaluate national focuses, unnecessary! If you are at war with half the world and got focus to declare war on another country, you should immediately execute! On other hand, is France and UK loosing badly? Well let&apos;s guarantee Greece independence so we can get into more wars... In other words diplomacy is dumbed down to national focuses and insane behavior. Oh and it has &quot;improve relations&quot; option, so if you are in Axis, and anti communist treaty with Germany, you are fighting war together, got relations maxed out, it&apos;s still gonna make ultimatums to Czechoslovakia (cause national focus..), sadly it can&apos;t declare war, it would be nice finishing touch :)
<br>
<br>OOB gone, not much to talk about here, no HQ, no nothing. No division commanders either.
<br>
<br>Research gone, practical knowledge? Theoretical knowledge? Don&apos;t be ridiculous you just conquered your first ports, why couldn&apos;t you go into carriers with same speed as USA? There is no specialization you can get what you want.
<br>
<br>Buying licenses gone.
<br>
<br>Trading resources? Well remember that anti communist pact? You can still buy anything in USSR... When i say buy, i don&apos;t mean like there is a market and prices, don&apos;t be ridicules. You can&apos;t stockpile and plan for war either.
<br>
<br>Custom divisions, yeah put in there whatever you want, no combined arms or anything so have division full of infantry, or have many smaller ones with one infantry each, nobody cares. Let&apos;s not pretend like there are actual effective and non effective ways to wage war, since WWI it&apos;s common knowledge that modern war is about putting whatever you have on the front, and if your soldiers have enough courage you shall prevail! Upside is you can&apos;t really go wrong. A tank division with hospital and support (non self propelled) arty? Sure why not.
<br>
<br>On the upside equipment production and units training are done in more realistic and better way. But than again planes, tanks, civil factories don&apos;t consume fuel or any other resource now, so you can safely spam those.
<br>
<br>Air combat is better, but still not very impactfull. Wings don&apos;t have commanders or experience, i don&apos;t know why there is a button for day/night or both missions, since you don&apos;t care about any of that, your planes don&apos;t loose any organization flying non efficient night missions, so you should always have both day and night on.
<br>
<br>Battle plans and AI troop command that&apos;s a clear improvement. Not perfect but better in every way.
<br>
<br>Hadn&apos;t had any crushes or bugs of that sort. Graphics are better i guess, but there was nothing wrong with hoi3 graphics either. UI is OK. The game gives impression that it&apos;s not a successor to previous games but like it&apos;s a new game from different dev. It takes it&apos;s own approach on one or two mechanics, and makes them better, and it dumbs down and ignores everything we love. I heard on stream devs to say, that Vicky2 was perfect and they can&apos;t improve it, i actually start to believe it now. Will the game be fixed by DLC&apos;s? It&apos;ll be improved, but hardly fixed. Disappointment :(.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6478356">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ Great graphics, sound and streamlined interface. Focus on production is a clever idea. Love how Paradox took the time to add a national focus and alternate history information such as generic fascist/communist leaders
<br>
<br>- No budgets. Diplomacy is weak. No way to automate some more mundane tasks.
<br>
<br>I am having a wonderful time with this game, and already sunk in 30 hours. I can see lots of replyability with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6483526">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Really I think the only positive I can think of is the new production system,I love that aspect.</span>

<br>
<br>Do not under any circumstances buy this game until at minimum late December. The developers working on this are extremely lazy and have been dragging their feet nonstop throughout development and have only gotten lazier after release.
<br>
<br>The game is so beyond broken and yet they are going on a month long vacation! That means a month before these issues even BEGIN to get resolved.
<br>
<br>I know modders who have found and fixed more bugs in a couple weeks than podcat (team leader Daniel Lind) has fixed in TWO YEARS.
<br>
<br>Biggest disappointment since Hoi3, IMO its worse because it will take even longer to get fixed.
<br>
<br>Do not buy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6514330">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have to say this is a good game. This is also the first iteration of the IV release, and there are some things that will be improved. But overall it&apos;s an engaging and fund,  occasionally slow experience. If you&apos;ve never played HOI before. You&apos;ll be happy if you enjoy deep grand strategy games. With time this only get better.
<br>
<br>There is a bit of a loud minority who are also being very vocal, understandably die hard fans that each have there own vision of what the game should have been. I think they&apos;re being unfair.
<br>
<br>And screw the people saying they can&apos;t take a 1 month holiday after a very long development project spanning multiple years comes to fruition. Come on. Let them have their month. They&apos;ll come back with fresh eyes and restored hearts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6531326">Expand</a></span>

Fortunately I feel many of the choices they have made let the game focus on more important and fun parts of managing a country through a world war. It&#x2019;s nice being able to start up a game and quickly organize your armies. Gone are the days of spending hours reorganizing a Soviet order of battle before pressing unpause (a feature which I honestly enjoyed, but also haven&#x2019;t found myself missing).
<br>
<br>This game lets you focus on the big picture: what strategic moves are you going to make, how will they affect your position in the war? The battle plan system is a good example of this. Battle plans were useful in Hearts of Iron III, but you still found yourself giving hundreds of orders to divisions to just move forwards. Managing a few armies instead of hundreds of divisions lets you remember their commanders as well, something I always had difficulty with in previous titles.
<br>
<br>The interface in general is also much better. The logistics screen in particular is very well done, and production is easy to manage while also providing a really unique and interesting system compared with older versions. Unfortunately in some areas it can be difficult to get information, especially from battles (I definitely miss Darkest Hour&#x2019;s battle reports, but even HoI3&#x2019;s weren&#x2019;t as nice).
<br>
<br>I haven&#x2019;t encountered issues with the AI so far, but I could just be lucky.
<br>
<br>Overall, if you are a veteran of previous titles I would definitely recommend giving this entry a look, as it brings a lot to the table and most of what has been cut has been fluff that, when you get down to it, didn&#x2019;t really provide interesting strategic choices anyways. When I think of the best times I had in HoI3 I don&#x2019;t think of reorganizing my OoB, I think of my first punches back against the Germans in North Africa, the enormous encirclements in Barbarossa, the 3-pronged naval invasion of China. This game lets you focus on those moments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6476015">Expand</a></span>

<br>Love:

<br>- Trade is so much less annoying than in Hoi III
<br>- the focus tree
<br>- division planner
<br>- Spanish Civil war (was pretty tough)
<br>- Industrial part
<br>- Political Power thing - add supporters and stuff
<br>
<br>Undecided:
<br>
<br>- The Border / Plan klicky thing. I fail by fiddling around with that very often. Maybe I have to get used to it / maybe patches will improve this part ( If I attach an army to a border and add a Div. later - why do I have to order this division to this border?)
<br>- Tech trees. Still am undecided about that.
<br>- In combat I am usually the more microing type. So I do not know if I like the battle plans yet (Missing the bonus). Maybe I will continue microing the Mobile Divs and leave the foot inf to the battle planner.
<br>
<br>Not so good:
<br>
<br>- AI did strange things in the civil war. (Just walked around long time with inf div, not doing anything. )
<br>- if I change directions from an attack with a fully organized tank div. and run in an enemy Inf div with 5% Org that takes the province I am moving to a second before I arrive I really lose this tank Div as &quot;Overrun&quot; ??? Seriously?
<br>Summary:
<br>
<br>Great game that makes already lots of fun. Will get better with the next few patches, I am sure. Also there will be more depth in future with DLC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6475442">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I decided to ignore Western Europe and Africa, and instead focus my expansion in Eastern Europe. I started by lending support to the Yugoslavian Fascist Party, and eventually progressed to fomenting a fascist rebellion which began in Bosnia. When the civil war broke out, I immediately invaded Slovenia from the northwest, broke through the Yugoslav lines, and made a dash to secure coastal ports and open up a supply corridor to the besieged rebels in Sarajevo. Meanwhile, my navy maneuvered to cut off all Yugoslav shipping in the Adriatic, while my air wings (hastily rebased to captured Slovenian airfields near the front) flew round-the-clock CAS missions to help the rebels fend off Yugoslav counterattacks.
<br>
<br>You should buy this game because I basically played the Bosnian War in 1937.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6478500">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you like strategy/grand strat then do yourself a favor and get this game. $40 at RELEASE for a game worth much more.

The UI and your choices have been streamlined into a much more accessible game.  There are plenty of choices and those choices make a big difference, but the micromanagement has be reduced making play less of a chore (for me anyway).  The division designer is excellent and instantly makes sense, and the new army system is far simpler than before, but still allows you to build up a army and give it complex instructions.  I love the new army orders system, drawing front lines and arrows on the map makes you feel like a general in a command bunker.
<br>
<br>The new production and trade systems are a huge improvement over HOI3, civilian factories make trade goods and other factories and military factories produce war equipment.  You tell your military factories to produce equipment of various types, small arms, specific models of tanks and aircraft and each new unit you build requires various combination of this equipment and of course men.
<br>
<br>The research and national focus systems work like a tech tree, allowing you to customise your nation.
<br>
<br>Finally, yes it is less hardcore than HOI3, but that makes it more accessible to new players, whilst still offering lots of choices and less micromanagement.  But if you are turbo into that stuff you can pick up HOI3 on steam at a great price.  Me, I far prefer this more accessible version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6477768">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is 200% hardcore gaming.
<br>Strategy at its best. Nothing for the faint-hearted.
<br>Still it is somehow simplified compared to HO3.

The player is in control of many many things I mean much more that just making units. In this game the player have to observe many little details to be able to win. I have played as-well HOI3 and there is let&apos;s say an internal battle about, why this and what is that about. Let&apos;s not forgot this is just a game without dlcs, first version and with bugs, but the game, the game as a whole is 10/10.  This is not a RTS game, this is a complex game, maybe HOI3 was more complex but let&apos;s allow these guys Paradox to keep working on it. My most sincere view about the game is very extremely positive. A lot of hard work in this game, this is not a worthless game out of a papa-mama company.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6476937">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros
<br>-Much Improved Graphics
<br>-Vastly superior Naval and Aviation mechanics
<br>-Superior tech trees,better then just research the same technology 12 times then move on
<br>-Doctrines are far better,as now they are more like a actual decision,as you can&apos;t be the best of everything.Unlike Hoi3 which you could research them all and be the best at everything.
<br>-Focus tree is a much needed change,game now has goals and objectives to go for,which is needed in a historically based game
<br>-A.I is better,the fact in Hoi3 the US would always join the war in 1940 was pretty annoying.
<br>-Is far easier to get into then Hoi3
<br>-Creating battleplans actually has a effect on the gameplay,as the A.I will attempt to do those maneuvers and attacks you made in the plans.
<br>-The Theatre mechanic is gone,which I thought to be extremely annoying,especially since it was replaced with a far better system.
<br>-Alternate history is now far easier to pull off with the focus tree,being able to make everything from the Kiwi Empire,to the Neo-Ottoman Empire,to Fascist France,including your own factions.
<br>-New Peace Treaty system,where now each nation can make demands from the losers based on how much they contributed to the war effort,a much needed addition.
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-A.I is also slightly weaker in other areas,mainly just Germany,as often Germany will be extremely aggressive or extremely passive.Either attacking the USSR,Britain/France,the Low Countries and Yugoslavia all at the same time,or doesn&apos;t attack France till 1941.
<br>-Multiplayer connections are terrible,as in the majority of Paradox&apos;s strategy games,either have a very good connection,or don&apos;t play multiplayer.
<br>-Chain of Command is gone and replaced with a single leader per army,which is slightly disappointing though I somewhat understand why they did it.
<br>-Generic tech trees for any nation other then the major nations,it&apos;s really sad when your military consists of Medium Tank 1,and Naval Bomber 2
<br>
<br>A great game and for sure worth the buy,looking forward to the expansions and upcoming titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6493864">Expand</a></span>

Thing is you can plan battle plans and then delete the battle plan and controll your own units. And you STILL get the bonus from battle planning. This is the most effektive way to do it if your good at incircling with fast moving divisions. The focus in the game is on production and manuevering your units not R&amp;D or diplomacy. If you want a diplomacy deep game then play EU4. If you want just war and manuering and strategical decitions like taking out the enemies resources instead of his industries. Then that is up to you what you find most effective. Also the hole logistic for your forces is an intressting and realistic gameplay. It was the logistic that Hitler failed to understand when he choose to rather go for natural resources then to destroy USSRs logistics which his Generals wanted, and probebly made him lose the war. You need very little managment of the Air forces since it all is focused on the land battles below. I am fine with that. AI is very retarded but I am sure a patch will come out to fix that. But a retarded AI isn&apos;t a problem when you play it in MP as I intend to do. If you gonna play it in single player mode then I suggest you wait until the AI is working.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6497409">Expand</a></span>

<br>I did more than a thousand hours of modding for HoI 3 so I was very sceptical before the release of HoI4.
<br>But I easily beats it in every area.
<br>
<br>- depth (resource management (land/air) and better diplomacy makes this game much more complex)
<br>- graphics (way better)
<br>- handling (way better)
<br>
<br>The AI is still not able to beat a decent player but it&apos;s far better than 1 year ago and at least twice as good as the HoI3-AI.
<br>
<br>Game handling can be done in 2 different ways:
<br>A) let the AI do the micro for you in a war (good for fast/big MP games or if you are new to the series)
<br>B) micro every single division by yourself (for advanced players to fight each other or the AI in slow motion)
<br>
<br>600 hours played so far and still getting not bored.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=7487581">Expand</a></span>

I cannot think of a single redeeming quality to this game, not one single system was done well.  Everything, from the engine, to the graphics, to the absolutely terribly designed gameplay, this game fails on every level.

<br>I find myself quite liking it. It&apos;s great that you can select various a-historical scenarios to play out... What would happen if Italy re-created the Roman Empire, went democratic, and steered clear of the Axis? By all means find out. Want to find out what would have happened if the Axis powers had avoided war with both the Allies and Russia at once? Well if you can keep the peace yourself, now&apos;s your chance to see.
<br>
<br>Want to pick a random &quot;small&quot; power from the era and find out what it would take to make Brazil a South-American powerhouse? Go for it. The possibilities are all there and all fun to play with.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6650531">Expand</a></span>

There are some things that could be clearer and it&apos;s taken me an abandoned half a play through (I rage quit when my Panzers got over run, totally my fault) and a fair bit of you tube video watching (thank you Praetorian HiJynx ) but once you start to get to grips with it it completely draws you in. This is the best thing since Shogun 2. It would have got a 10 if
<br>
<br>1. The left click select, right click do had been more consistently adhered to
<br>2. Some of the error messages were more detailed when you try and do something that can&apos;t be done
<br>3. If the AI orders were a bit clearer.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t listen to the 0 score people, this is an excellent game!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6641408">Expand</a></span>

Hundreds of hours of potential, and even more in multiplayer. Absolutely recommended if you like strategy games. Graphics are great too, though the 32-bit single core engine is a bit of a letdown.</span>

<br>
<br>The worst offender is national focus/event trees this makes the game extremely arcade, dumb, detach from reality, bland and makes it harder to play historical because each of this &quot;events&quot; requires researching for 70 days ?? xD
<br>The HoI 3 Events especially on BlackIce mod were refreshing, taught history and immerse you in WW2
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>- Easier to plan paradrops, invasions for your own AI to execute and enemy AI is more capable as well.
<br>- Production of equipment offers a cool feature although it should had more depth
<br>- More manageable and impactful air war especially on ground support.
<br>- Generals can finally be generated and gain traits and experiences according to battles
<br>- 2D Art is great in most parts of the game but some icons are a miss like rocket engine and night equipment.
<br>- Naval and carrier Combat seems improved
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>- No way to know where there are battle going on or if the enemy nearly surrounded your units or if you lost a battle. ( The battle list on the top right screen has been completely removed)
<br>- Trade (or lack of anything)
<br>- Economy
<br>- Removal of resources and their stockpile, a big design mistake making the game very arcade
<br>- Airplanes can&apos;t attack ground units if these are not in a ground battle
<br>- no Faction cooperation like sharing technologies and blueprints
<br>- UI interface is not a evolution of HoI 3 so you will have to relearn how to interact with the game
<br>- No detail information or data , you can&apos;t know how much equipment you loose per battle or the enemy is losing, how many convoys did you destroy or how planes or tank are performing against the enemy
<br>- No air Supply
<br>- You can&apos;t no longer quickly understand the values of attack and defense of your units in battles
<br>- No way to see weather data and plan to avoid it.. it also seems not to affect the game.
<br>...
<br>
<br>Point is what was lacking on HoI was a more a immersive game with more meaningful events, seeing the impact of battles, conquer territories maybe even listen to radio segments or have a way to see or command units like in Total War, HoI III was going towards and ideal HoI just need some more polish and redesign of some of it&apos;s features this is more of a reinterpretation of a Hearts of Iron game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=7446234">Expand</a></span>

I got Mongolia out of the deal and made Greece a puppet.  Russian empire joined my war against china.  i have 174 top notch divisions.  When I quit to main, understand that I destroyed the Soviet army and captured most of the soviet union. The Russian empire took over all of the Soviet land including all that I had conquered and their army score is 3x mine.  I have also not been able to make the big army attacks.  every time I set a starting line ll of my troops just go to one Provence and sit there, the don&apos;t cover the starting line.  And I can never actually get them to jump off on the attach so I have to micromanage the sh it out of the battles which worked out well as I continually encircled the soviets and destroyed many divisions that way.

<br>Anyway the game needs much work but I do see promise.  The scoring is terrible though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=7228455">Expand</a></span>

I am not a fan of strategy of Paradox, and it is even less HOI series. But the 4th game came to new level. Yes it is still a game with the high level of occurrence, but it is the best strategy about WW2. National focuses and a tree of technologies are perfectly registered, it is a pity that only all this only for 6 largest countries. A game is very reigrabelny, for each top country it is possible to win back 3 various fractions. The only minus of a game are a graphic design and many things are made through &quot;one&quot; place, for example landing of troops. And yes the price policy of DLC Gearbox is simply disgusting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=7481309">Expand</a></span>

Firstly, I would like to mention that this has to be one of the most fun WWII strategy ever made and the choice of going historical or deviating off to more extreme alternate reality is exciting. I also cannot fault the wartime mechanics, even before the improvements it was fun. However once you hit around ~1942 or even after 1945 the border gore is horrendous and if the war is finally finished you will have some of the weirdest land distribution ever created - not to mention the land is essentially useless thanks to the non-core penalties. Clarity on how wars will work (ie. who will join wars and how they are merged as well as whether than country will insta-join Axis or Allies) would be a great improvements as lack of clarity can really ruin a play through, especially when playing as a neutral small nation trying to get big.
<br>Speaking of which, one of my personal favourite things of paradox games is getting a small nation and making them huge, however, in this game this is nearly impossible thanks to the penalties. The most notable one being the 99.8% penalty on manpower, which is not only unrealistic but also a tad harsh. Foreign conscription was a thing and although I do not disagree with a 99.8% penalty to begin with, I do think a monthly tick of -0.1% to the penalty would make the game feel more rewarding rather than playing a small county for 3 years before hitting the impassable wall of no manpower.
<br>Supply needs to be fixed or redesigned, perhaps even allow the player to customise their supply if the game picks an unusual or impassable route. When attacking Russia from the south I ran into an issue where supply simply would not reach my front lines despite having a clear passing from my capital to front lines simply because the game chose an odd supply route. Needless to say despite beating back Russia and Germany I had to abandon the campaign because my entire frontline was on the verge of collapsing. I still keep the save in case they fix this though.
<br>
<br>Overall, despite be being heavily critical of the game, it is really fun and I can imagine it to be even better with friends. However, attempting anything unorthodox such as world conquest with Saudi Arabia or forming your own faction as France and taking on everyone will make you run into a few of the issues I mentioned above. Clearly the game was meant to be played as the major countries in the historical way, this way you avoid the clarity of war issues, the manpower penalty becomes a historic challenge and supply in hotspot areas are more clear. I would still recommend the game to anyone, however I do hope for more improvements on the game - and the most recent expansion although an improvement does not feel like improvements in the right area, as well as this the features added are not worth the price, one of the few Paradox expansions I feel is overpriced since the features introduced are actually found in mods and are done better at times in those mods.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=6976056">Expand</a></span>

If you expect hard situations, rigorous historical aspects and an IA made only to face WW2 as it should be, then go back and return to Hearts of Iron III.
<br>
<br>The game itself is nice, beautifully made. The map is way more simple than what we have seen on HOI3, and the building system is very intuitive. There&apos;s no currency necessary to build, buy or craft. The system to build divisions has completely lost the meaning it had on HOI3. In this HOI game, you directly build a Division, you can&apos;t choose the composition of batalions, and the technologies are handled in a very deficient way. &#xA1;The Theatre system is an absolute failure compared to it&apos;s predecessor! Another negative aspect is that some interesting countries lack content. the generical names, no sprites for units, and the focus system is a completely mess for some very important countries that faced WWII.
<br>
<br>But not all of this game is a failure. The naval system is well implemented, maintaining some good aspects of HOI franchise. The new aviation system is not bad at all, making more easy to face the air missions. The way to prepare some battle plans is quite interesting and the possibility to create your own factions add some new possibilities to the game.
<br>
<br>I give a 6 to this game thanks to the modifications you may do to it. Thank&apos;s god that some mod&apos;s teams are modding it, and trying to revive the game to what it should have been.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv/user-reviews?user_review_id=7154851">Expand</a></span>
