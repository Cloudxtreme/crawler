But there is one thing that is a major downside. The Load Screens. I have a decent computer with an up to date graphics card and 4 gigs of ram. The game runs smoothly on all of the menus and the actual racing part. But it takes FOREVER to load ANYTHING. It takes me 4 minutes to get to the main menu. Another 4 minutes to load the map, and another 3 minutes just to leave the race and go to the main menu. It&apos;s riduclous. I enjoy playing this game, but I will uninstall it next week and throw it away if the load screens continue to take forever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pure/user-reviews?user_review_id=74936">Expand</a></span>
