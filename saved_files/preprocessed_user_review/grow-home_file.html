<br>Story</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Grow Home is a 3D platforming game which centers around being a small robot who slowly climbs up a vine, guiding its growth into crystals to allow it to grow yet higher, so he can get back to his space ship and go home. With extremely loose controls, a dodgy camera, tedious mechanics, and no depth, this is a game to avoid, feeling more like a school project than a finished game.
<br>
<br>Story
<br>
<br>There is very little story to the game; there are a few bits of flavor text here and there, and MOM &#x2013; either an AI of some sort, or a fellow being who is elsewhere in the universe &#x2013; occasionally gives you hints or makes &#x201C;wry&#x201D; (non-voice acted) remarks on your progress.
<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>
<br>The game centers about climbing around the game world, slowly growing your vine upwards. To grow the vine, you must crawl up the vine to various red flowers, which you can then command to grow outwards. Each of these will sprout bouncy leaves, to help you ascend a bit faster, and additional red flowers, to allow you to grow additional vines. There are 100 small crystals hidden around the various floating islands in the game, and collecting those power up your robot&#x2019;s jetpack; there are also large crystal islands, which you must direct the growth of the vines into in order to grow the main vine higher and burst through various barriers and reach the top of the map. There are also a number of things you can drag into your various telepods &#x2013; locations you can teleport back to when you die &#x2013; which unlock entries in a data bank.
<br>That is literally 100% of the gameplay, and it is very dull. The controls for your robot are terrible, and carrying things around is extremely tedious, as you can easily drop them while doing other tasks. Climbing is an arduous process of alternating clicks of the shoulder buttons, and is made all the worse when the surface is uneven. Jumping and using your jetpack feels a little better, but is still very awkward, and it is easy to miss jumps and fall to your doom. A few pick-upable items &#x2013; a flower which slows your descent, and a glide leaf which lets you glide around like on a hangglider &#x2013; do little to spruce up the gameplay.
<br>All in all, the game is a very tedious process of ascending the vine and growing it outwards, then upwards, then outwards again; less than half an hour into the game, you have seen everything it has to offer. If you don&#x2019;t bother to collect the collectables, you could easily beat the entire game in an hour, and you&#x2019;d still think it was too long. Collecting the collectables is tedious &#x2013; most of environmental items you collect for the databank aren&#x2019;t too bad, but a few have to be lugged large distances while suffering from the dodgy controls.
<br>The small crystals, on the other hand, are extremely tedious to find; the only hint to their presence is an audio cue when the camera is close to them, which means that at the end of the game, if you&#x2019;re missing any crystals, finding the rest of them is a matter of pure chance. Many are hidden in places which aren&#x2019;t readily visible while gliding around, making this primarily a job for consulting a FAQ &#x2013; if you were bothered to do it, which you really shouldn&#x2019;t bother to do.
<br>
<br>Graphics
<br>
<br>The game has graphics which would have been an embarrassment in the Playstation 1 era; they&#x2019;re ugly and unappealing, and the creatures in the game look terrible. The only thing which looks at all passable is the world from great elevation; it slowly becomes increasingly spherical around the horizon, and from a great distance, the vines and islands look somewhat visually appealing. Unfortunately, you will spend very little of the game admiring this, and most of the game looking at low-resolution textures and extremely blocky polygonal vines.
<br>
<br>Final Summary
<br>
<br>There is absolutely no reason whatsoever to spend your time, let alone your money, on this game. If it was a school project, I might be impressed, but as an actual commercial release, it is just not up to snuff. It is boring, tedious, repetitive, and yet manages to annoy you even though the entire game is likely to take no more than a few hours to complete.
<br>Save your money and your time and do other things.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grow-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=5375794">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-Climbing vertically can be intense as falling means another minute or two to get back to the same spot and try your luck again. This is a mild punishment that never feels defeating but only has you jovially cursing at your misfortune.
<br>-Cute. You&apos;re cute. The world is cute. The penis plants are cute. You can glide like Marry Poppins with leafs and flowers
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Feels like a good part of a game but missing any other gameplay elements that would give it more depth.
<br>-Lack of other gameplay elements makes climbing tiresome
<br>-Short game. 2 hours. 4 hours max.
<br>-Game length is augmented by backtracking for collectibles.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: A one dimensional game that is aesthetically begging to be loved but repetitive gameplay holds it back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grow-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=5058302">Expand</a></span>

The overall graphics style and feel to the game is great, especially that feeling when you lose your grip on a mountain way high up and fall down. Really wish there were more relaxing games like this.</span>

A true breath of fresh air grow home is a must play despite the few technical issues that bog it down, though not enough to hurt a truly lovely experience. If your looking for something a little different you won&apos;t go far wrong, the game is five hours and every minute is enjoyable.</span>

<br>I would give this game 10/10 if it had a first person mode. (Modding community, make that stuff happen!)
<br>I love games that are very vertical, so this one is bloody amazing. In Grow Home, the whole concept is growing a plant while gathering crystals. And no, it&apos;s not about drugs.</span>

<br>The first great climbing game since Shadow of the Colossus, except it&apos;s a short 2-hour tech demo.  I hope the company puts these mechanics into a full game with multiple levels.
<br>
<br>PRESENTATION - 7
<br>Simplistic untextured vector graphics, almost voxels except not boxy. It&apos;s colorful and it gets the job done, and there&apos;s a nice tradeoff of the day-night cycle where platforms are more visible in the day but the hidden collectibles glow so they&apos;re more visible at night.  It&apos;s also really cool to look down at the level and see the intersecting collections of vines in a shape you individually have drawn on your way up.  Audio is bleepy but fine.  The story is just a few dialogue boxes here and there, mostly your robotic ship &quot;mother&quot; praising you no matter how poorly you perform.  Lots of grabbable objects (including moving animals) have physics, and a few trees even bend on impact.  Animation is procedurally blended with your movement speed and collision with obstacles, which looks cool, but even with the floating limbs there are still errors where you collide through objects.
<br>
<br>CONTROL - 10
<br>Grow Home is a platformer, the goal of which is to ascend the level while collecting gems that upgrade your abilities.  You start out with just a jump, earn a little jet boost to slow landings, and eventually a functional jetpack.
<br>You also climb by holding down either shoulder button to &quot;grab&quot; with left and/or right hand.  While holding onto a surface (ANY surface in the game, including moving animals), the left joystick can hoist you up about the distance of your forearm.  So by alternating left and right hand-holds, you can climb anything.
<br>Other games have climbing, but it&apos;s always handled the way FPS games handle ladders:  attach-to-ledge-and-move-left-or-right or attach-to-climbable-wall-and-move-up-or-down.  Other than &quot;Shadow of the Colossus&quot; and &quot;I am Bread&quot;, I can&apos;t think of any other videogames where climbing is an actual gameplay mechanic (certainly not any of the Assassins Creed games, by the same company, which I don&apos;t feel qualify as platformers because they lack a dedicated non-context-sensitive Jump button).
<br>Bizarrely, there&apos;s no &quot;cost&quot; to climbing.  SotC and IaB both have &quot;grip gauges&quot; that deplete and refill when you&apos;re on level surface, but in &quot;Grow Home&quot; it&apos;s almost impossible to fall unless you have a brain fart and forget to hold down one of the grab buttons.  The motivation to take risks like make jumps is based around climbing simply being slower than other forms of travel.
<br>Additionally, you can collect either a flower (depleting parachute) or a leaf (a reuseable hang-glider that lasts until you crash), the latter of which controls incredibly well and speeds things up greatly.
<br>In the level are giant vines with sprouts. Once you climb on the sprout, you can activate it, at which point it will grow, and you direct the growth upwards towards more floating islands to get more gems or into glowing power sources which are necessary to grow the main tree trunk and complete the game.  Each new vine comes with leaf bounce-pads and more sprouts, so you can grow yourself a path essentially anywhere.  And once you master the gameplay mechanics, you can travel across the bounce pads much, much faster than running, or teleport to the top of the map and hang-glide down.
<br>
<br>DESIGN - 6
<br>The goal of the game is to activate the flower at the top.  You can die from un-slowed falls or the water at the very bottom, but there are checkpoints you can teleport between and an instant-respawn.  The problem with the game is that it feels like the first level of a much larger game that hasn&apos;t been released yet.  You have a ton of abilities, especially once you&apos;re halfway upgraded, but the game never becomes hard enough to really challenge you.  For example, you can land in the bending trees to slow your descent, or use the bendy tree recoil to launch you even higher, but you never actually need to.  It&apos;s as if the entirety of Mario 64 was limited to &quot;Bob-omb Battlefield.&quot;   You have to make your own fun to an extent, like trying to grow vines out to the limit of the map, or trying to make difficult jumps without using the hang glider.  If the purpose of &quot;Grow Home&quot; was to sell me on the gameplay mechanics as tech demo, then, congratulations, I love it, now where&apos;s the full game?  Where&apos;s the challenge?  The only real motivation to play well is either to find 100% of the hidden gems or to try and ascend as quickly as possible without making mistakes like accidentally running off a vine and falling.  And yes, that is fun, but I wanted more.  Admitedly, the game is very cheap.  You get much more than your money&apos;s worth, a truly excellent 2-3 hours.  What I&apos;m really saying is please, please, please, make a sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grow-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=5247366">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>WOW guys, what a superb game! i had a great time pressing L2 and R2 buttons. for me it was just a indie mediocre game nothing more nothing less. not bad but not good. just climd and collet cristals. no offence about the makers. good idea for a chill game but needs more for a too expansive to be just this game.
<br>another grate game to hate ubisoft.</span>

It&apos;s a fairly short game but offers a lot to do. Grow Home follows &quot;BUD&quot; (Botanical Utility Droid) and his journey to grow a plant that will oxygenate his home planet. The controls can feel very clunky and hard to learn at first because of BUD&apos;s physics and momentum, If you keep running in one direction on jump multiple times you will find it very hard to come to a complete stop without falling off of something. The main objective is to scale a giant bean stock type plant and find points on the plant you can use to grow further to reach food/energy that the plant needs to grow. This is where Grow Home really comes together, As you branch out with your plant and work towards the floating islands you can look back at your progress and see the beautiful mess of a plant you have grown. But at anytime it is possible to fall off and have to rather start climbing again or use a checkpoint that are placed. There are things like Flowers,Leafs and Packets to also help you get around and hopefully not fall back to the beginning. Finding Crystals that are placed throughout the game will increase BUD&apos;s jet-pack as well. Altogether Grow Home is a extremely fun light heated game suitable for almost anyone and for the 8$ Price tag or Free if you got it with PlayStation Plus it&apos;s a steal of a deal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grow-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=5480212">Expand</a></span>

<br>There&apos;s an issue on Linux (at least on my machine that even if not THAT powerful is able to run Bioshock Infinite at 60fps): the game wavers from 60 to even 20 fps and when it&apos;s not at 60 fps controls become extremely unreliable/faulty.
<br>Usually it&apos;s not a huge problem since you can just glider somewhere and be safe, but after you&apos;ve grown the huge plant and you&apos;re asked to take the seed back home, you have to make 2 jumps, failing either results in having to climb the last section of plant, again, grabbing the seed, again, and trying to jump, again, 2 times.
<br>Problem is that for no plausible reason, after I grab the seed, the fps go wild from 20 to 40 and controls are extremely unreliable. Again, this on a machine that was able to run Bioshock Infinite at 60 fps, just no.
<br>
<br>PS: Were those last jumps grabbing a seed really necessary (given the extremely relaxing spirit of the game)? For me it was like a game asking me to walk around and suddenly run and jump over deadly spikes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grow-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=6527587">Expand</a></span>

<br>a charming and floaty experience...
<br>Grow home is an open world platformer where you play as a robot named B.U.D.
<br>Your missions in this game is to grow this giant bean stock like star plant up to your home base in order to oxygenate the planet you&#x2019;re on..
<br>You grow this star planet by riding star shoots to energy rocks...
<br>Star shoots are buds that grow on the star plant as it grows&#x2026;
<br>And you get to controls these, which I didn&#x2019;t know I could do until the final stretch of the game...
<br>Needless to say I was frustrated with the seemingly meaningless and random star shoots going all over the place&#x2026;
<br>Only to find out I&#x2019;ve been playing the game wrong the whole time&#x2026;
<br>Once I figured this out this game became much less frustrating to me... but not completely unfrustrating&#x2026;
<br>The controls in this game are far too floaty...
<br>your robot character feels completely weightless&#x2026;
<br>You rely mostly on your grip by using any of the 4 shoulder buttons to control a separate arm&#x2026;.. and even that isn&#x2019;t all too reliable
<br>Bud would constantly slip when I jumped from stock to stock, leading me to fall to my death only to respawn at my most recently activated checkpoint and climb again. And again... and again...
<br>This weightless feeling needless to say greatly hinders your platforming experience as you have no idea where you&#x2019;re going to land after a jump and you seemingly have no control of your character once in air...
<br>Thankfully you do get a jet pack and are able to pick up leaves and flowers to float&#x2026; but these items don&#x2019;t equalize the floatyness of the platforming and can sometimes even add to the frustration of feeling no control&#x2026;
<br>The jet pack will  definitely become your best friend as you&#x2019;re screaming at the screen for constantly cheap feeling deaths due to the platforming and grip&#x2026;
<br>you can upgrade this jetpack by collecting crystals throughout the world..
<br>To eventually be able to completely fly around at no risk by the games end... making collectibles in this game actually worthwhile&#x2026; and the world is intriguing enough to want to explore in search of new caves and other secret areas&#x2026;
<br>you can also grab items and animals that inhabit the planet to work towards unlocking a special skin&#x2026;
<br>There are 2 special skins in this game that give an added perk beyond pure cosmetics
<br>One for collecting all of the creatures and plants... and one for doing the bonus mission after you complete the game&#x2026;
<br>&#x2026; The issues with this is the complete the game part&#x2026;
<br>What&#x2019;s the point in keeping special perk skins to when you&#x2019;ve already completed or nearly completed the game&#x2026;
<br>Why bother to collect everything and have the ability to make star shoots grow twice as long when I&#x2019;ve got a jet pack that never runs out of fueled by that time?
<br>It&#x2019;s pointless&#x2026;
<br>This is also one of those games that doesn&#x2019;t auto save and it did crash on me and I lost all progress...
<br>thankfully it happened after I collected everything and beat the game and not while I was on my way to doing so&#x2026;
<br>so be cautious.. save and quit frequently, which won&#x2019;t really cross your mind as this game is only about 5 hours long
<br>Grow Home is a charming game that I ultimately enjoyed.. But its floaty controls tried really hard to stop me&#x2026;
<br>I give grow home a

<br>3D platformer exploration, no fighting, just jumping, flying, climbing, all in bright, colourful surroundings with a distinctive graphic style. Sense of freedom, but most importantly - an amazing sense of vast space (the rocks you climb levitate in spae - any platformer fan would love that) and enormous distances to jump through and glide gives an exhilarating experience (though probably short) and almost a giddy feeling. What&apos;s more, the main objective is to feed a gigantic plant penetrating the entire planet you&apos;re on.

It has a simple story about a robot name&apos;s BUD and he&apos;s trying to plant a tree into space (sounds awesome right o_0?) while also trying to collect the plant&apos;s seed in order to analyze it. The game mechanics is fun at first, but then can be devastating at times, because if you fall down without having been to the nearest checkpoint you&apos;re gonna have to climb back and it takes time and it can be really boring.

<br>El principal problema que veo al juego es su simpleza, si, en ciertos juegos es mejor que sea as&#xED;, pero creo que le falta alg&#xFA;n a&#xF1;adido para que merezca la pena la exploraci&#xF3;n. El &#xFA;nico motivo para explorar, es encontrar bonitos lugares, recoger flora para analizarla y conseguir fragmentos de cristal para mejorar nuestras habilidades... y esto con el &#xFA;nico control de saltar y pulsar alternativamente joystick izquierdo y derecho para trepar o agarrar cosas.
<br>
<br>El &#xFA;nico objetivo del juego es hacer crecer una planta gigantesca, todo lo dem&#xE1;s se podr&#xED;a decir que es &quot;in&#xFA;til&quot; debido a que no tiene ninguna relevancia para avanzar.
<br>
<br>Respecto a la historia, no le han querido dar mucha importancia, y no lo veo mal, simplemente somos una avanzada para buscar planetas habitables.
<br>
<br>Quiz&#xE1;s si simplemente quieres pasar un rato tranquilo, y encuentras el juego rebajado, merezca la pena su compra, pero debido a lo vaci&#xF3; que esta, yo no lo recomiendo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grow-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=7082587">Expand</a></span>

The level design is based on a unique scenario (just one gigantic area surrounded by the sea) where secondary objectives are represented by crystals finding aimed to upgrade your jet pack power (that gives you just little jump-boosts) and flora/fauna collection to bring under scanning through the teleporter machines (placed as sort of checkpoints on different heights) that will enrich your computer database called M.O.M. (your spaceship). Plus, a final objective once you reach the very top and your plant has completely grown.
<br>
<br>Technically, is based on the simple gravity/physics basics but the originality comes out when you understand that your character have inertia speed (once it runs then suddenly stops or just jump+jet pack boosted) and hand grabbing technique (left hand- right hand) that allows you to climb rapidly (once you get it well) or slowly if you carry a specimen on the other hand (there is no inventory! And that&apos;s cool). Obviously, the game pad is strongly recommended as the right stick for camera view will be fundamental to add yourself an extra extended view (pressing the right stick) in order to catch all the things that might goes out of sight while you&apos;re climbing a rock, for example.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a fresh game play, no matter if the story is simple and short. It&apos;s a basic concept to play and enjoy and maybe it will be shaped into something more spectacular, who knows? The effort is considerable but it must be mentioned that is not the entire Ubisoft company that made this...just a little group of people under Ubisoft company, just a little seed, comparable to an indie work...exactly like the entire philosophy of this game!
<br>
<br>Well deserved, guys.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grow-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=7358981">Expand</a></span>
