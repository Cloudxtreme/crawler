<br>I was wrong.So damn wrong!! This game is amazing in every aspect.Finally a AAA shooter game remember to make a single player campaign.So much fun to play the campaign and eliminate the boss in the Co-op Campaign.Also the game has so many amazing characters,each one is unique and fantastic,and it has the humor too.PVP mode is even better,it is like Dota meets FPS game,create matches that are exciting and fun.Highly recommend  this game to anyone who loves Borderlands and Dota games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6342539">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is the perfect blend of Shooters and Mobas. The characters feel fun and creative, the maps are colorful and the whole style just makes me think of Saturday Morning Cartoons. Though there may be some more balancing needed (which will always be needed for these kinds of games) it&apos;s not as bad as other games that&apos;s been out for years.
<br>
<br>The game also brings PvE which has a feel to dungeons in MMOs. You select the chapter, fight mobs, fight boss, fight mobs, fight boss, then fight final boss. It&apos;s a good way to get gear to take back to PvP.
<br>
<br>The game isn&apos;t without issues, I feel that sometimes the screen can feel a little cluttered and it does take a little bit to get  use to it, but after that 5th match you no longer care, it&apos;s just chaotic fun. Hell I&apos;ve had so much fun playing Benedict that I didn&apos;t even care that my team was losing.
<br>
<br>Battleborn is probably the most unique game to come out this year so far and with it&apos;s fun cartoony style and it&apos;s Borderland&apos;s humor, it&apos;s a good pick.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6342123">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game has such an amazing roster with unique characters. Unique is probably a good term for the game once I&apos;ve never seen a shooter like this before. It&apos;s goofy, doesn&apos;t take itself seriously, and is just good old fashion fun.

<br>I didn&apos;t care for the PvE that much, but the PvP is amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6342389">Expand</a></span>

This is a AAA game developer with a good reputation not some shady, crapware shoveling studio. I was one of the first to post a review for this game, and yeah, it is my first review on metacritic, but did you ever stop to think that those of us who enjoy this game maybe wanted to get the word out about it and try to expand the player base because of the challenges it&apos;s facing due to surface comparisons to Overwatch? That was the reason I took the time to write my first review. I LOVE this game and I want other players to enjoy it with, and that means trying to educate people not to write it off because they just assume that Overwatch is the better game. Obviously, some people may have tried both or at least watched enough videos on Battleborn to have a clear understanding of the game and still like Overwatch better, I don&apos;t begrudge them that or think there&apos;s anything wrong with that opinion. The key here is that they really are two very different games and depending on what you&apos;re looking for one may appeal more to you than the other. For me, Battleborn had the greater appeal. So, maybe take a minute to think before throwing accusations around. I could just as easily accuse you of being a Blizzard employee trying to tank the reviews for this game, but I won&apos;t  do that, because I&apos;m not a moron, and I understand that, like Gearbox, Blizzard is a quality developer that doesn&apos;t need to sink to those kinds of tactics. So, post your rating, give your opinion, but don&apos;t try to trash the reputation of a quality game studio when you have no basis other than a users review count to base it on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6341673">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Battleborn isn&apos;t a bad game, it can be quite fun but overall it&apos;s a pretty bland and average. It&apos;s not worth the price tag, however it would be worth picking it up once it&apos;s under $10. This type of game I could see going Free 2 Play sometime in the near future. I think it will have to, to compete with huge popularity of Overwatch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6559589">Expand</a></span>

The art, music, voice acting though sometimes repetitive is great the actual game play not so much. A short story few multiplayer maps and  very little customization makes this game a boring letdown. With each of the many characters having to be played over and over and over to unlock anything. The worst part of the game is the item system,which is nothing like borderlands. You either pay cash to get packs or grind bosses in story mode. The result of which is you can only use 3 items at any one time for all characters which only effects your stats. No customizing the many different characters with weapons and armor to make them your own. just a big expensive let down, that made me join up to warn people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6352045">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. Unbalanced DLC overpowered characters
<br>2. Matchmaking is a joke
<br>3. NO anticheat whatsoever!(how did this happen)?

<br>What really pisses me off is the matchmaking system, takes so long to find someone and almost always must play solo which makes the game boring for me.</span>

<br>+For me, with at Geforce EVGA 660Ti, i5 blah, blah, blah, 16GB RAM it ran perfectly, when maxed out.. Dipping into the high 40&apos;s when the screen was exploding with effects!
<br>+The sound, and sound effects are great, crisp, and fit.. There is a lack of music however..
<br>+The graphcis are top notch.. WHile some people cant get over the fact that this is NOT Borderlands, and something different, by the same company.. It is beautiful.. It will feel chaotic at first, but after 2 or 3 matches, its all identifiable!
<br>+The controls are tight, crisp, responsive, and satisfying.. Long jumps like Borderlands (you will feel many similarities here, which is good) Firing a weapon, swinging a sword, using a staff, or throwing knives.. It all is awesome to play, and you really get that MOBA feel, with the different characters
<br>+Characters.. This is where the game shines.. Each and every character feels hand crafted.. They each fill their own role (for their respected factions, i believe there are 5 factions fo 5 players each).. They look great, have great humor, but lack back story.. They have many, MANy unlockables including oufits (simpyl color changes) and taunts.. I could care less about either of these, but many will appreciate them, and i appreciate the extr effort here..
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, thats where it starts to fall.. The game lacks serious content.. While i spent an entire weekend playing over and over 2 maps, there simply isnt enough content with 8 missions.. I have no interest in Multiplayer, and only play sp/co-op.. Even adding the 2 or 3 modes for Mp, this game has far too high a price tag, for how little you get.. I know, alot of effort was put on characters, but you need more to do with them.. Its like i bought a digital collection of Action figures..!?
<br>
<br>i for one, HATE this trend of releasing games, and then trickling the rest of it out over the coarse of a year (or 10.. Looking at you, Destiny!).. The Division is another example of not enough content at launch, and i think thats where Battleborn is going to lose many fans..
<br>
<br>In an already over saturated market (fps) which is where its going t fight for players, it just doesnt warrant the $60 price tag.. Even with minimal advertisement, you can see many people turned off by its price.. I myself, who LOVE the game, am also not buying it... Its only been a week or two, and theres really not a very impressive player base, and im thnkign i made the right decision.. Its an always online game, and once the players stop playing, and the servers go offline, you no longer own it anyway..
<br>
<br>Ill gladly purchase this game at $40.00, even with a small playerbase, but $60.00 (plus whatever DLC they decide to throw at you,, it IS Gearbox, afterall) youll be looking at yet another title that ends up being $80-150.00 when all is said and done!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6380664">Expand</a></span>

It isn&apos;t fun just because the two genres have been combined; it&apos;s fun because the mechanics of each genre are so well executed, and somehow, so well integrated.
<br>As far as comparisons with Overwatch, they are very different types of game that don&apos;t lend themselves well to a 1-1 type comparison. Overwatch is TF2 while Battleborn is Borderlands+League of Legends. If we are looking at them in terms of replay, I burned out fairly quickly with overwatch (it&apos;s a great, polished shooter though). As of my review Battleborn has a depth of content that Overwatch is nowhere near scratching, having played the crap out of both I found myself in Overwatch wishing I could customize my skills and gear as the match progressed as you do in Battleborn.
<br>This game is easily a 9/10, I gave it a 10/10 though to try and balance out what I felt were reviews from folks who were fans of either MOBA or FPS games but not both. If a team based shooter with tons of variety, crazy action and MOBA strategies (laning, farming creeps, team fighting) then this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6415945">Expand</a></span>

It is a First Person MOBA, no matter what people say. And it plays great like a MOBA.

<br>
<br>Pros
<br>It is a First Person MOBA, no matter what people say. And it plays great like a MOBA.
<br>The developer has said they will focus on balance a lot, and it shows.
<br>There aren&apos;t a lot of maps, so the few maps they have are very well designed.
<br>The game modes are all a lot of fun.
<br>Balanced teams make for excellent and challenging games.
<br>Plenty of room for skill curve, for people who want to play more advanced, but difficult characters.
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>When I wrote this review, team balance was a problem.
<br>Learning curve is real.
<br>Single player game mode is severely lacking - I often wonder why its there at all.
<br>Loot packs are all random - sometimes you get good stuff, most of the time you don&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Battleborn is essentially a fast paced, first person MOBA. It improves upon games like League of Legends, DOTA, and HOTS in areas like fast paced game play and better handling of your character. It improves upon games like COD, BF, and Overwatch by incorporating a slower time to kill, making fights less about twitch killing and random grenades, and more about coordinated and planned attacks using terrain, map knowledge, and positioning to secure kills or push enemies back. Keep in mind, this is an objective based game, meaning the objective will help you secure kills. You cannot just expect to come in guns blazing and kill someone; over extending will be the death of you, quite literally.
<br>
<br>If you like playing competitive multiplayer games check it out. If you like MOBA games, definitely check it out. And enjoy fast pace games with challenging MOBA elements this is the game for you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6408459">Expand</a></span>

<br>It might not be to everyones taste, because it values team play and objective based gameplay over lone gun action.

<br>+the fps mechanics are quite solid
<br>+knowing gearbox there will be a lot of updates, constantly new characters, and maps.
<br>
<br>some of the minuses
<br>-fps can drop during some games for no apparent reason, and i have the fastest possible rig you can get
<br>-unlocking characters seems a bit grindy.
<br>-since most of the characters are unlocked with achievments &amp; certain progress you can get shoehorned into playing modes you don&apos;t necessarily want to play.
<br>-co-op seems to be giving a disproportionated amount of gear to the pvp
<br>-knowing gearbox there will be a lot of updates, constantly new characters and maps... i put it as a minus as well since it will all be paid and there are people that do not like that.
<br>-a bit too expensive
<br>
<br>some balance concerns (might be invalid since i haven&apos;t played that much)
<br>buildables can be a little bit more durable and do more dmg/healing
<br>buildables can be in weird positions
<br>maybe a couple of more item slots since 3 items is kind a limiting + you can&apos;t do different builds in the same game
<br>
<br>Anyway, bottom line is, I had a hard time stopping playing tonight and this is rare novadays.
<br>
<br>p.s. also i&apos;ve been in overwatch beta and stuff, and i feel the fps mechanics are about equal between the two. characterwise i can&apos;t really say since i haven&apos;t tried that many characters here but from what I have seen they are equal altough maybe i&apos;ve enjoyed the ones here a bit more. gfx, sound, and art style are super similiar altough battleborn can be a bit more cluttered at times.
<br>
<br>however, battleborn completely blows overwatch out of the water in game modes department, co-op, item variety, in-match leveling choices and obviously sp &amp; co-op.
<br>
<br>personally i&apos;ve gotten both but if i had to choose right now i would go with battle born for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6342930">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There are issues currently, i.e no advanced difficulty matchmaking for story, path-ing issues for NPC&apos;s, skill based PVP matchmaking , ect. However these are all things that are easy to work out with a little time. I keep seeing performance issues coming up for people, personally I&apos;ve had 0 trouble and my machine is quite mediocre.
<br>
<br>At the end of the day this game is just simply put FUN. Worth the money, worth the time.
<br>
<br>Yes this is my first review, but only because I&apos;m not the type to usually care enough to write reviews.
<br>(someone mentioned that since quite a few people had never reviewed a game aside from this, that it was clear they were paid or had some inherit interest in positive scores, while that is always possible, it&apos;s certainly not always true.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6344040">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ Un Background soign&#xE9;
<br>+ D&#xE9;cors et ensembles inspir&#xE9;s de Borderlands
<br>+ La strat&#xE9;gie, la strat&#xE9;gie, la strat&#xE9;gie
<br>
<br>Les moins :
<br>
<br>- Un petit manque d&apos;&#xE9;quilibre entre les persos
<br>- L&apos;optimisation du jeu ( baisses de fps lors des missions solo et quelques fois en multi )
<br>- Seulement trois modes de jeu pour le multijoueur ( en attente des DLC )
<br>
<br>Pour moi Battleborn est l&apos;exemple type du jeu fun sans prise de t&#xEA;te et une communaut&#xE9; sympa.
<br>
<br>Du haut de mes 30 ans j&apos;ai retrouv&#xE9; le plaisir de jou&#xE9; &#xE0; un jeu vid&#xE9;o est &#xE7;a me fait plaisir !
<br>
<br>Par contre je tiens juste &#xE0; dire une chose , ne pas confondre overwatch et Battleborn c&apos;est deux jeux compl&#xE9;tement diff&#xE9;rents. Car battleborm se rapproche d&apos;un Moba pour son multi et destiny pour son PvE et Overwatch c&apos;est un team Fortress 2.
<br>
<br>Pour moi Battleborn et mon petit coup de coeur :) je lui donne une note final ( et personnel ) de 4,5/5.
<br>
<br>Je vous souhaite &#xE0; tous un bon jeu !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6343432">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The PvE campaign is stellar(although a group is a necessity if you want to nab any medals north of silver without farming) and the PvP is a surprisingly deep and tactical bridge between FPS and MOBAs. That being said, I feel like many folks who approach the game from a pure FPS standpoint will have a bit more trouble appreciating the game, as its PvP favors the kind of diverse, role-fulfilling setup you would find in your average MOBA or WoW Arena team(tank, healer, DPS, support). Lone gunmen are glass cannons here, and you get cut down crazy fast if you don&apos;t have a good squad at your back.
<br>
<br>Given the inevitable Overwatch comparisons, I can say after playing both that, while Overwatch is a solid example of a good, polished FPS game, a good, polished FPS game is all that it is. The gameplay is solid, the graphics are fantastic, the characters are interesting in that Blizzard fashion, but it doesn&apos;t do anything I haven&apos;t seen before. Battleborn, on the other hand, is a fun, hilarious breath of fresh air. And I intend to take in as much of it as I can.
<br>
<br>To be fair, though, please take my opinion with a grain of salt, as I am now a fervent worshiper of Arachnis the Spider King.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6355999">Expand</a></span>

You will notice I don&apos;t have any other reviews, but I fully intended on leaving a review for this game because I highly enjoy it. Is it a perfect 10, no, but neither are 95% of the games that gets 10&apos;s in the game industry. Ratings are horrible and the only way to see if you like a game is to play it. I have given this a 10 to counter the reviews given because people think developers bombard review sites with 10&apos;s, as if they have nothing better to do. This game has a strong community of die-hard fans and it&apos;s very possible that they, like me have never left a review for a game before. Big deal, get over it.
<br>
<br>That being said, Review Time! I would give this game an 8.5 counting in the campaign and a 9.5 on multiplayer alone. I think the campaign is fun at times, boring at times, frustrating at times, and definitely fun with the right group of friends! Dying in the last phase of Advanced Heliophage is one of the most epic moments in video games for me as well as one of the most frustrating due to the 66 minutes we sunk into it! But going back and trying it 3 more times (dropping if we wasted lives early) and demolishing it on the 4th try with the right team composition and strategy exemplifies what video games are supposed to be about. When you beat that extremely difficult fight and feel like you actually achieved something, that feeling drives the best moments in video games.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, the same feeling isn&apos;t there when there are literally too many enemies to save whatever it is you are supposed to protect for an obscure amount of time. The game, sadly, provides more of those moments than the above Heliophage example with numerous unique thought out bosses testing your teamwork, group composition strategy, and capabilities. It&apos;s not that the levels aren&apos;t fun, but they just end up feeling like a weak Sanctum level with limited buildables to hold back the waves.
<br>
<br>Then you get into the multiplayer. Someone else in a review stated that underneath the in-game leveling system and gear system that the multiplayer is shallow followed by &quot;Overwatch it ain&apos;t!&quot; which I find very amusing because the depth of Overwatch is akin to a puddle you can&apos;t even make a decent splash in. Things that make Battleborn multiplayer competitive:
<br>
<br>Character Lock (You can&apos;t change your character mid-match making team composition extremely important)
<br>In-Match Leveling (Allows you to customize your build as you play a match to fit the team you are up against and fill in potential weaknesses in your party)
<br>In-Match Gear Purchases (Take in a loadout of 3 items you can buy throughout the match to give yourself advantages as the match goes on forcing the other team to stay on their toes)
<br>On Map Buildables (Turrets, Supply Stations, and Speed Boosters which can be built in-match to give your minions and your team an advantage towards the objectives)
<br>Resource Management (Shards which are spawned on the map which can be contested, giving an advantage for buying gear and buildables and providing a new side-objective key to shutting your opponents down)
<br>On Map AI Enemies (Minions on Meltdown which you have to escort, Minions and Mercenaries you can hire in Incursion, and Thralls you can kill for experience in Capture Point for a level advantage)
<br>
<br>All of these add to the need to watch the map, know when to be where, work as a group, and be coordinated to defeat the opponents. Overwatch is fun, but Battleborn it ain&apos;t! If you like the strategy and teamwork required in a MOBA but the pace of an FPS, Battleborn is your only option.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6359797">Expand</a></span>

First of all, I don&apos;t usually play hyper-active shooters like this or multi-player games so was not experienced enough probably, but I loved most of the Borderlands games so thought I would give it a try.   There was absolutely no explanation of anything or tutorials when I played so I&apos;m sure I missed a lot.  They just threw you into the game after picking your character so I was running blind.  Did not know about collecting spheres, etc. until dying about a million times, or what my objectives were.  I felt like a chicken running around with my head cut off just shooting randomly at enemies.  When I got stuck in a room and couldn&apos;t move (glitch) I gave up and quit playing.  Obviously I&apos;m not the only one who had problems or disliked the game (see the ratings) but this game does not deserve a 10.  Can&apos;t believe that - must be the developers or they paid somebody off.  There&apos;s plenty of better games out there than to waste your money on this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6399677">Expand</a></span>

This game might be the biggest flop in recent history. Below are some of the biggest reasons I, a preorder customer, am rating this game a zero.
<br>
<br>-Frenetic, unbalanced, and ultimately unsatisfying gameplay
<br>-Ugly art and &quot;what were they thinking?&quot; character design
<br>-Poorly optimized resulting in bad performance even on good computers
<br>-Launched with an overpowered pay2win DLC character
<br>-Very poor &quot;story mode&quot; content, nowhere near Borderlands in quality
<br>-Completely broken matchmaking (putting lvl 100 premades against random lvl 5s)
<br>
<br>None of the above can be blamed on Overwatch. It&apos;s just a poorly thought out game trying to cash in on the FPSMOBA genre and failing spectacularly. Due to the issues mentioned above, if you still decide to purchase this game you can expect the following:
<br>
<br>-30m to 1h+ matchmaking wait times (seriously, there are less than 3000 total players at peak)
<br>-To get stomped by a paid DLC character that they admit won&apos;t be fixed for weeks
<br>-When you do find a match, it will be against level 100 premade groups
<br>-If you play PvE, you&apos;ll be bored of the brainless straight-lining AI in half an hour

It&apos;s a cross between MOBAs, team shooters and, well, Borderlands. It is not Overwatch, and if you&apos;re comparing it to that game then you&apos;re in the wrong place.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re new to this game you might be put off by the depth of the characters you&apos;ll have to learn, and the finer points of the online gameplay...because there is a lot to learn and the whole levels and gear system behind the gameplay. However, don&apos;t be. Many think the game is just far too busy, but perhaps they&apos;re the ones just shooting the heroes. If you see something in red; shoot it. In Batlleborn you want to be shooting everything on the enemy team; heroes, minions, turrets. Just take your time, ask for help and, above all, enjoy yourself. The Battleborn community is extremely friendly and very quick to help; so don&apos;t be afraid to ask for tips.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve put 35 hours in to Battleborn, so far, and I really can&apos;t see a time when I&apos;ll be bored of the game. There&apos;s 25 characters, for one thing, and I&apos;ve only really explored two of them. The game also has the two different modes; PvE and PvP. How many team shooters have that? People complained when Battlefront had no single player campaign. Well here&apos;s one, and you get a competitive and ball of fun PvP mode to go with it.
<br>
<br>Gearbox have bought the standard to which they make Borderlands games to the writing and characterisation of Battleborn. Each hero has a unique script, all beautifully voice acted, and I promise you you&apos;ll laugh your **** off at some of the lines...not to mention the taunts.
<br>
<br>I feel I wouldn&apos;t be complete if I didn&apos;t list some of the game&apos;s faults. There are known to be some technical problems for some people, depending on their computer specifications, But Gearbox are on top of that. In fact, they&apos;re so active at listening to the community that they&apos;re really on top of everything. One issue that does annoy me is that you can often get caught up on scenery (steps are a particular nuisance). Again, Gearbox are right there and are making a pass of the maps to find and improve these areas. They&apos;re certainly doing their best to make a great game even greater. They&apos;ve already made some good changes this past week, and have a list of what&apos;s upcoming in the immediate future.
<br>
<br>This is one of the games of the year for me, and such a pity that it&apos;s so misunderstood, because it really is. There&apos;s so much misinformation out there about Battleborn, so do yourself a favour, listen to me, and go buy it. You won&apos;t regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6394259">Expand</a></span>

Tons and tons of things to unlock including new playable characters, outfits, power modifications, taunts, lore, etc.  The amount of things you can unlock is incredible and for me is a driving force.  There is a fun single player or coop campaign.  The graphics look fantastic, and sound design including speech are top notch.  Definitely recommend this one!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6343828">Expand</a></span>

Must have for those who like first-person shooters.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is standard first-person shooter, but you also have 3 abilities that you can cast. Every character has their own skillset. Every character also has their own unique &quot;skill tree&quot;, as you level up you get points to upgrade your character; these are not persistent and will reset every match.
<br>
<br>Each player can equip 3 different items. These items contain various stats that you can bring into each match to help boost your power. Items come in selected rarities, all the way up to legendary, and the stats are random in the amounts they give, so not one is the same.
<br>
<br>The bread and butter of this game is the diverse amount of characters that you can unlock and play as, each and every one of them are unique; not one plays the same. Second thing is the amount of customization you can have, various skins, taunts, and titles that you can equip.
<br>
<br>One gripe I have with this game, there is no offline (no internet) play, always have to be connected to the internet. Which is ok with me, i&apos;m &quot;meh&quot; about it although I would prefer having the option to play offline.
<br>
<br>From a hours to price ratio, you will get your money&apos;s worth and more. With the amount of characters that you can play combined with finding that perfect piece of gear, you&apos;ll be saying &quot;just one more round...&quot; all day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6343449">Expand</a></span>

With the storm of &quot;hero shooters&quot; flooding the game market (which this was the first one to be announced, just sayin&apos;) Battleborn has gotten the short end of the stick.
<br>
<br>Just what is Battleborn though? As mentioned before, Battleborn is of the new genre of games coming out recently, a hero shooter. Battleborn has 25 playable heroes (5 more DLC characters to come post launch, completely free) that you can play in three different competitive multiplayer gamemodes (two maps per mode) or in a full length co-op story campaign (up to 5 players).
<br>
<br>Story- In Battleborn, you&apos;re in a war against Rendain with his Jennerit Empire and Varelsi allies to save the last star in the universe: Solus. There are eight story missions that can be played on Normal or Advanced difficulty with the added option of enabling hardcode mode (only one life per player). Each mission will take you about 30-60 minutes to complete depending on what difficulty you are on and how many people are playing. Additional lore about the game can be unlocked by completing character lore challenges- specific tasks you have to perform with various different characters.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer- If the story mode doesn&apos;t tickle your fancy, there&apos;s also the competitive multiplayer. In Incursion, the mode that makes everyone think Battleborn is a MOBA (it&apos;s not), you are fighting to destroy the two enemy spider sentry bots. You&apos;ll have to escort your own minions to their sentry to disable the shields- but that&apos;s far easier said than done. Or you could play in Meltdown, where you need to feed your own minions into a robotic grinder that thinks it commands the universe. Lastly, if you just want to get some quick action you can play in Capture, which is pretty much just domination from COD.
<br>
<br>Progression- Don&apos;t think that&apos;s all, though. In each multiplayer match and story mission, you will level up your character and select different augments that power up your abilities. By playing matches you will also level up your character rank which will unlock skins and more augments for your character. In addition by simply playing the game you will level up your command rank which unlocks loot packs, loadouts, gear, and more.
<br>
<br>Gear-What&apos;s that? Gear? There&apos;s still more?! That&apos;s right- you can also take gear into battle that powers up your character. However, your gear will be unactivated at the beginning of each match. To activate it you must collect &quot;shards&quot;, the currency of the universe. But there&apos;s a catch-- those shards are also used to build tactical battle structures on the map, so choose what you buy wisely. Gear comes in various rarities and can be gained by buying loot packs (with in-game credits only, no microtransactions), by getting loot drops in the story mode, by completing challenges, or by leveling up any of your various ranks.
<br>
<br>Conclusion- If you couldn&apos;t tell already, this game has incredible depth. This is the factor that distinguishes Battleborn from every other game on the block. Battleborn is a COMPLETE package, worth the $60 in full. Battleborn has NO microtransactions or DLC that will affect the competitive scene (the only DLC will be story missions and cosmetics). If you wish to see how different the game is gameplay-wise from every other MOBA or hero-shooter out there, you should perhaps look at TotalBiscuit&apos;s overview of the game. That&apos;s about all for my review though. Battleborn? 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6343435">Expand</a></span>

I like the concept of RPG elements in a shooter, but the game is not fun and you are forced to watch story elements you can skip which soured the experience from the start. The story is just all over the place.</span>

SImilar to SMITE, the community doesn&apos;t seem as bad for a MOBA. It&apos;s no where near LoL or DoTA, but that might have something to do with the $60 price tag.</span>

<br>Most fun I&apos;ve had in an online shooter for years. Despite what many people think; Battleborn does not play like your traditional MOBA at all. Most people also won&apos;t understand what the game is about without playing it first. It may look like a generic F2P game to those judging the game purely from appearance or gameplay footage, but I assure you it&apos;s much more to it than that (there&apos;s not even a single sign of paid for content in game).
<br>
<br>It plays very similarly to a good first person action/shooter. Imagine Borderlands on steroids, throw in Bioshock Infinite&apos;s plasmids too for each hero&apos;s power. All the character&apos;s I&apos;ve played so far have unique skills and require learning their skill tree which is basically most of the MOBA resemblance over and done with. There&apos;s an interesting blend of competitive modes which take a couple concepts from many different games but nonetheless feels new and refreshing. It&apos;s an incredibly addictive game with a lot of depth to each character; not to mention how each has a strong personality.
<br>
<br>If Borderlands humour is your humor, then you will absolutely love the comic book style presentation of the co-op campaign! Yes I said campaign, and it really feels like one given how the missions are fully fleshed out unlike some other games (Titanfall).
<br>
<br>I really look forward to the future of Battleborn with this well polished superhero comic book feel Gearbox have gone with. It&apos;s the only multiplayer focused action shooter I can think of with story and characters I actually care about being primarily a single-player kind of gamer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6342675">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;ve got many minor enemies to slaughter guarded by their bigger counterparts who can kick your ass right back at you - armed with impenetrable arm-held shields as well as energy shields on top of that. They dodge out of your way, charge at you in melee, shoot mortars, sniper laser beams, rockets, bullets, plasma bolts and whatnot. All enemies got weak spots for you to shoot for critical damage, so aim wisely - whether with a rifle or a rapier. Place traps and turrets for strategic defence, purchase repair drones to keep them up. Strive for gold medals on the mission completion and brave the higher difficulty modes with even harder enemies and just one &quot;life&quot; to back you up. Oh yeah, and fight the mission boss at the end of a mission. Which can be tricky. Also please unlock Phoebe, she&apos;s so cute.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6352880">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I first heard of this game from a video by Totalbiscuit on Youtube in which he painted it in a positive light. I played the beta a few weeks ago and was hooked. In the past few weeks there have been a lot of betas, like for Overwatch and Paragon, both of which I played. Battleborn is the one of the three that I liked the most, with Overwatch being the most disappointing.
<br>
<br>People say you can&apos;t compare Overwatch with Battleborn but to me that&apos;s disingenuous and an argument that Overwatch fanboys like to use to discredit unfavorable comparisons by saying they are not the same genre, so therefore comparisons aren&apos;t valid. This is nonsense because they are actually extremely similar, apparent to anyone who plays them both and who has any amount of common sense and impartiality.
<br>
<br>The games at their core are shooters revolving around heroes which are working on a team to kill the other team&apos;s heroes. Now granted in Battleborn, killing of other players is not the main focus, but the fact is, killing of the other players is a huge part of the game, and there&apos;s no way around it.
<br>
<br>Battleborn tosses in more objectives other than just player killing. However these additions in now way make it so much further from what Overwatch is, not by a long shot.
<br>
<br>Battleborn is fast and fun. There is loads of character development being that you can equip your characters with gear to augment their skills and you have two ability trees when leveling up. It plays much faster than Paragon. Paragon is decent in its own right, but I personally need the faster pacing which Paragon just doesn&apos;t have. Paragon gives you a card system to further augment your characters but they really don&apos;t feel like they do all that much. There&apos;s no character improvements you can make in Overwatch, and sadly what you experience of a character within playing for a couple games is as deep as the character will ever be.
<br>
<br>Battleborn also has a low time to kill meaning you get to spend more time on the field playing instead of waiting to respawn. You also get back tot he action a lot faster than you do in Paragon or Overwatch.
<br>
<br>In general, Battleborn just feels like there&apos;s more going on and I just have a much funner time playing than I had with Overwatch or Paragon. I also love the game&apos;s art direction and low brow humor.
<br>
<br>Definitely recommend! This game pulled me off of Dark Souls 3 for now, so that should say something.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6353286">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s great for people who don&apos;t really enjoy the more traditional MOBA titles available. The singleplayer is fun and interesting, combining the MOBA style of starting fresh of abilities every match or mission with the fun shooting style of Borderlands and Borderlands 2. I highly recommend this game to anyone whom enjoys MOBAs, or enjoyed the Borderlands series but is looking for something somewhat similar with new mechanics.
<br>
<br>The campaign is fun both solo and co-op. It has enough interesting characters to hold your interest. It&apos;s story is told very much like Borderlands 2, with someone talking in your ear most of the time. It has Borderlands-esque boss intros with a freeze-frame and title card. The loot in the game has been changed significantly from any BL title, now coming in &quot;Packs.&quot; You open these to create a loadout of three gear pieces which you can then purchase using &quot;shards&quot; once in a mission or multiplayer match. This fits the multiplayer focus of the game, and makes it fun to plan your purchases to be more effective throughout the mission.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer is the real gem of the game. It&apos;s phenomenal. It does everything right. With a whopping 25 &quot;Heroes&quot; to choose from, it won&apos;t be hard to find something new to try if you tire of one hero. Three gamemodes, each with two maps makes for a variety of fun to be had. Incursion, which is the most MOBA-like of the game modes is super fun and satisfying when played with a good team. You must push with your minion waves to destroy the two Sentry-Bots in the enemy&apos;s base before they do the same to you. In Meltdown you must send your minions to be sacrificed, earning points for each one that walks to their death. This gamemode features a more open map with a wider span of space to maneuver. The third is Capture. It&apos;s the only gamemode I have yet to play. You must defend your points while capturing the enemy&apos;s. Fairly self explainatory.
<br>
<br>Overall, I really enjoy this game so far and highly recommend it to anyone thinking about picking up a good multiplayer game that you can get competitive with or just chill out and play some campaign missions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6343452">Expand</a></span>

<br>And then I met ISIC and I know this is the game I will be playing all summer.

<br>The only main issue I really see at the moment is that people tend to dc every now and then and that might be a small bug, hopefully will get fixed soon.</span>

<br>Around the time of Alani they changed the balancing to make everything more difficult (they want hardcore players only). It&apos;s much more stressful and competitive in PvE, now. The balancing is all off. It&apos;s punishing, it&apos;s annoying, it&apos;s overly difficult, pointlessly punishing, and it incites animosity amongst PuGs and even friends. This is NOT a good PvE game. It has time limits that are almost impossible to meet, you get instant mission failures for failing an objective (rather than just losing a life), it&apos;s ridiculous. I thought Mega Man 2 was punishing. It has nothing on this game. I&apos;d rather have root canal than play it again.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s worse because... The writing? Amazing. Funny, clever, and occasionally insightful. The cast? One of the most diverse I&apos;ve ever seen. And it just feels good. I love those characters and I love hearing their chatter. It&apos;s just... It&apos;s not fun. I don&apos;t know what they&apos;re doing to the game, but for 99 per cent of the people who might play it? They won&apos;t enjoy it. It&apos;s H4RDC0R3 ONLY.
<br>
<br>That kind of attitude I think will destroy Gearbox. So... I have to regrettably tell PvE players to avoid this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6353793">Expand</a></span>

<br>And it&apos;s from my favorite developers, GEARBOX who have made some of my favorite games like BORDERLANDS, BORDERLANDS 2, BORDERLANDS PRE-SEQUEL, and COLONIAL MARINES!
<br>
<br>My brothers and I played the crap out of GEARBOX&apos;s other titles, they just make gem after gem.
<br>
<br>And recently my favorite character was released in this game, ALANI. She&apos;s so cool, she can heal, she can CC, she can kill anyone, and she is HOT to boot! I&apos;m glad they gave us some eye candy after getting all the other cool designs out of the way!
<br>
<br>I play this game for hours everyday, and never have I experienced any bad matchmaking like so many detractors will claim. The longest queue I had to do was just 2 minutes. Anyone saying they have endured longer are just trolls, or have bad computers... OR BOTH!
<br>
<br>So get BATTLEBORN! We need more peopl to play and keep it alive while we wait on GEARBOX to do more for us!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6455742">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re tired of the old chase around death match, this brings another level of co-op and intensity to the game due to all the different things you can do and being able to customize your character differently every match! The moba aspects aren&apos;t overwhelming at all unless you play the meltdown mode, where you follow minions to try and lead them to the other goal, or defend your goal. All in all though, it plays very easily, you just have actual goals instead of blind killing. Theres so much store and lore with an amazing raid-like campaign that I&apos;ve already played through a good couple times! The characters are so interesting and you can unlock more of their backstory through completing certain challenges. It&apos;s been a blast and I highly recommend it. It&apos;s definitely more enjoyable with friends, but don&apos;t fear because it was super easy to make and add new friends due to the integrated steam friend list! Don&apos;t be afraid to dust off that mic and talk! The motto is fight together or die alone and they mean it! It&apos;s about playing your role right!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6441510">Expand</a></span>

<br>more like battle embryo
<br>because this game is lifeless&#x2026;
<br>Battleborn is a borderlands meets moba styled first person shooter with none of the charm
<br>Battleborn features 2 modes, a story mode and a competitive mode&#x2026;
<br>Both modes can be played with any of the 25 available characters or 26 on PlayStation after you&#x2019;ve successfully completed the requirements to unlock them&#x2026;
<br>And every single one of these characters are fleshed out, feeling completely unique&#x2026;
<br>guaranteeing a playstyle match for anyone&#x2026;
<br>it&#x2019;s just a shame that the rest of the game isn&#x2019;t as well thought out as these characters are&#x2026;
<br>Battleborn is unique from most first person shooters in that, every story mission or competitive multiplayer match your character starts at level 1... And as you level up to a maximum of 10 you are given a choice in a perk to enhance your shield, cool down rates, health, damage, or to enhance one of your 3 special moves... the third being unlocked once you reach level 5&#x2026;
<br>The story mode consists of 9 episodes and depending on whether you go in alone or play with 4 other people for a total 5, these 9 episodes will take you anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour, making this story mode a hefty 6-9 hours long&#x2026;
<br>I definitely recommend you play with friends though, as I found these missions to be insanely challenging playing on your own..
<br>And while there are checkpoints, there is no saving so you must play through these 1 hour missions in 1 go&#x2026;
<br>You also have limited lives... so if you lose all of your lives you fail the mission and have to start all the way from the beginning&#x2026;
<br>These lives are frustratingly shared when you play co-op,
<br>so it&#x2019;s very possible for 1 bad player to cost you a final boss fight win... but thankfully you can revive fallen players&#x2026;
<br>This story mode is the best part of battleborn, aside from the characters..
<br>and that&#x2019;s not saying much as it all feels so uninspired&#x2026;
<br>Every mission has a self-contained story that leads to a final conclusion but all 9 feel exactly the same&#x2026;
<br>Kill these bad guys, get to the next checkpoint, kill a mini boss, do this 2 more times, get to the main boss.. Get close to defeating him but oh no he has an annoying shield... disable it&#x2026;defeat him for real, oh wait a surprise 2nd shield that you totally didn&#x2019;t expect because every boss before this one totaly didn&#x2019;t also have a surprise shield&#x2026;
<br>just kidding, they did.
<br>needless to say, this story mode quickly becomes a grind&#x2026;
<br>There are a few good jokes from the characters... but after a few hours, it&#x2019;s just not cute anymore&#x2026;
<br>They&#x2019;re background noise in a grind fest&#x2026;
<br>And there really is no payoff for grinding rather than ranking your character up for a new skin, or to unlock another character...
<br>There&#x2019;s no real loot here, so there&#x2019;s no incentive to explore these levels or grind these levels&#x2026;
<br>you&#x2019;re literally just playing until you unlock a different character to do it all over again&#x2026;
<br>or of course to play in competitive multiplayer&#x2026;
<br>And remember how I said story mode was the best part?
<br>I meant it.
<br>Competitive multiplayer consists of 3 modes&#x2026;
<br>A capture, incursion, and meltdown mode...
<br>These are capture and hold 3 different points on the map, get to the enemies sentries and destroy them, or an escort battle, where you try to stop the other team from getting their robots from one spot to another&#x2026;
<br>Each mode has only 2 maps, and these modes are even more lifeless and filler feeling than the campaign..
<br>Your standard boring stuff...
<br>id say its fun for a little bit, but id be lying to you.
<br>No team death match, which I think would&#x2019;ve been insanely fun with the leveling up systems, and the different character feels&#x2026;
<br>but it&#x2019;s not here... the mode that would be the most fun and makes the most sense is not here&#x2026;
<br>While the story mode does have its moments of fun, and the characters are a blast to play around with and figure out..
<br>There&#x2019;s ultimately not much here to keep you entertained for more than a few days.
<br>A deep system of characters, with a shallow arena to play in.
<br>I give battleborn a

<br>
<br>So far I&apos;ve done a few of the story missions, it does indeed seem possible to fail and it&apos;s not a snooze fest at all, there is elements of positional strategy at play though it is not a tightly tuned endeavour that novices will have trouble picking up quickly which is refreshing.
<br>
<br>The various characters are all very different in play style and function and the helix and loadout systems allow you to fine tune the way you play.
<br>
<br>So far it&apos;s an enjoyable co-op gun-show that facilitates team play without any high end co-ordination required making it, so far, very light on toxic attitude.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve not touched the pvp yet but I would be inclined to think that it&apos;s going to be a blast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6343450">Expand</a></span>

<br>There few things that Gearbox needs to improve like the confusion that the gamer get when all minions and heroes are together fighting, too difficult to know what is happening. The other thing is that there are no enough heroes at the beginning.

<br>I have had play just 5 hours to this game, but enough time to see that Gearbox made a amazing game. Now the gamers are whom should understand that this game is a MOBA FPS and not a COD</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6352504">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Firstly, the game&apos;s population and matchmaking. On PC, the game&apos;s community is fairly small at the moment. Averaging around 3000 players at any given moment, with slight peaks and dips. It&apos;s best to play it at peak hours. Due to this, you may wish to consider the PS4 copy of the game if you have the system, as the community is said to be bigger there.
<br>
<br>Second, there are some strange design choices, both in visuals and audio. Whether it is issues with the contrast, with many bright colors and particle effects, or the fact many key sound effects and music are either too quiet or missing.
<br>
<br>Third, there is a lot of grinding to be had in this game. This is not necessarily a negative, simply something subjective. The game has a lot of things behind grind walls, like characters and loot.
<br>
<br>Fourth, to me the story mode is rather lackluster. It is mostly just repetitive mob shooting, with some dry spells. But since I got this mostly for the multiplayer anyway, this doesn&apos;t really effect me much at all.
<br>
<br>I would also like to note that this game is a MOBA more than it is an FPS. Due to the marketing of the game by Gearbox, this was not entirely clear to many people. Just make sure you or anyone you know who is interested in the game.
<br>
<br>With that all in mind, this is still a decent game and worth checking out if you are into MOBA&apos;s or want to try something a little unique. The character designs are varied and most are pretty cool, the gameplay is pretty fun, and it is certainly a game that escalates in enjoyment the more friends you have playing with you. It&apos;s a flawed game, but a fun one. And I just hope Gearbox can address some of these issues down the road.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6441144">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is a game that provides so much depth in strategy for a first-person game, I haven&apos;t played anything like it. The combination of gear and helix choices make for adaptive play that keeps the game fresh every time.
<br>
<br>The one thing that&apos;s nice with mixed reviews, is that Gearbox is adapting to the pressure. They&apos;ve dropped the price (I paid $60, I&apos;m not bitter) have performed numerous hotfixes, and have already released one character. I would like to see a better rank system and penalties for quitting.

If you have played MOBA games (Dota, LoL, etc.) and you like the 2vs2, 5vs5 or somewhere between battles you will love Battleborn. It&apos;s re-play value comes from (1) finding gear, that is well balanced in PvP since you need shards to unlock those items, where as you can use the same shards to recruit elite minions etc. and (2) unlocking characters and lore&apos;s true numerous of challenges and tasks.
<br>
<br>PvP is awesome in Battleborn, but since it&apos;s a MOBA like gamestyle it&apos;s not comparable to games like CS:GO or COD or BF. You need to have good map awareness, good positioning, good team play and objective based mindset to win the matches. If you go solo (yolo), you can easily find yourself between the enemy team and enemy creeps alone, which will lead to your certain death and you end up giving enemies more experience and therefore advance through out the leveling system.
<br>
<br>First con in this game is that the learning curve might be really big for someone stepping in from outside of the MOBA -genre (example, FPS). Second con is that this is a multiplayer game and it is not intended to be played as solo, so either you have to  queue up with randoms or have to have friends playing this game also. I recommend dearly playing with friends using the VOIP system, so much fun. Third, and last con for me is that this game needs at the moment more PvE content. Gearbox has said they are working for more content for the overall game (pvp and pve), but the current state has only 8 maps in PvE. Even though you can play these on different difficulties, and the hardest difficulty reminds me somewhat of WoW heroic dungeons.

<br>My final verdict for this game is 9/10 for it&apos;s big content for its price, that is now ~20&#x20AC; and it&apos;s super fun multiplayer system (Pve and PvP). When the extra content comes in to the game (5 campaigns promised!), I&apos;m sure this game will be mine GOTY -game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleborn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6463158">Expand</a></span>
