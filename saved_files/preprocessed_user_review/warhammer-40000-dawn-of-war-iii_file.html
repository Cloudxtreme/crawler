Comeback is non-existence. Lose your first engagement&gt; slow grind to inevitable doom, win your engagement&gt;slow grind to victory. The story is half ass as well it&apos;s nothing more than a glorified tutorial which is a huge disappointment.</span>

If they wanted a MOBA they should of went full MOBA, not forced MOBA elements into an RTS just because its the trendy thing to do.
<br>
<br>WTAF? I have been a DOW fan long before the games!  I Loved the first one , still occasionally play it, Its depth and customization is amazing.  A Pure RTS .   I wasnt a big fan of the second one at First but ended up really like the RPG and RTT elements add to it.  The Hero units were much stronger then normal units but not by an insane amount.
<br>
<br>DOW 3 however makes most the little guys useless , there feels like there is no character or depth to the other units anymore , their upgrades barely seem all that different or unique and their impact is no where near as significant as other games  , they are just meat for the grinders that are the Elites .  They made the game almost like all units are just these extra guys there to assist the Elites , which was never what DOW was about.   Its more like a MOBA now where the game centers around an Elite and all the units are just puked out to help your Elite kill there Elite or building just a tiny bit faster.
<br>
<br>Everything is dumbed down for normal units , their skills their actions , even the graphics and their skins , seriously compare the tactical marines in 3 to either 2 or 1 and there is no comparison , all units are like afterthoughts to the game with the bare minimal effort put it.  Relic normally hits it out of the park but they were catering to much to the trendy crowd so much im half surprised they didn&apos;t try to put some sorta overwatch mechanic into the game
<br>
<br>They removed all the depth and usefulness of regular units , the only thing i use them for it to take down buildings and to guard a Elite while he heals .
<br>
<br>The games feels so simple and so empty and soulless and the draw of the game at least for me has always been its tactical depth and the feel that every squad was important , not only that the whole game seem so much slower.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7263083">Expand</a></span>

Dawn of War III was a Corporate Cash-In to try and pander to the StarCraft II fanbase and MOBA fanatics. Do not buy this game, and show Relic &amp; SEGA that they are capable of doing better than this.&#xFEFF;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7261564">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>-For the first 1 - 5 minutes, its a desperate rush for resource points and hero point generation, slow build of army and technologies (feels like a good solid RTS)
<br>-The next 5 minutes is re-enforcing positions and generating armies
<br>-Then end game when you can afford your epic unit. At this point, all the amazing design work for the buildings and minor units is forgotten. You march your epic unit down a lane and destroy their towers (ignoring everything else)
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Voice acting for units and factions is good
<br>Vocal prompts for locations of skirmishes and information is useful and fun
<br>Animation is good. Unit design is good
<br>The faction specific mechanics are brilliant (scrap, warp, drop)
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-General flow of combat and game pace
<br>-Epic units, because they are so game changing, it becomes a rush to get them, stopping any appreciation of the other parts of the game that look and sound awesome
<br>-The MOBA style objectives. Because they are placed so far out, building defenses is close to pointless. They are generic so look and feel out of place compared to the brilliant faction buildings. You know where they are each map so rushing is made super easy.
<br>-The maps seem like they are the forgotten beta maps from every MOBA ever. Lanes, towers, patches of grass for cover. Jungle camps have been replaced with resource generators.
<br>-No exp generation for units for offline skirmish maps.
<br>-The AI and overall game intelligence seems poor. Attack move is needed for everything, if not then your troops just end up having chats with the enemy.
<br>-The tutorial
<br>-Music is forgettable</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7264258">Expand</a></span>

So this should be a game for me, no? Sadly, it is not.
<br>
<br>Combat is not interesting and is quite mechanical, economy is outdated returnig to version before CoH1, turrets and power nodes are a blatant steal from MOBA&apos;s and completely unnecessary. Elites are badly designed, being able to kill entire armies while costing nothing (so most combats will be around Elite point in the game and whoever holds it, almost certainly wins) and are completely not customisable taking away a strategy layer.
<br>
<br>Raiding is completely out of the picture cause of listening posts so there are only big blobs running around, and cause there is no retreat the blob which gets the first win will continue winning and return mechanics are completely not working cause instead of pop cap regulated req it is economy regulated, so if you have map control your army is gonna be bigger, period. Super weapons also cost nothing so can be spammed and whoever wipes more with his power, wins engagents without the need to strategise. Also Elites will almost certainly become micro transactions with best ones locked behind mounds of ingame currency or a couple of Euro&apos;s, so if you want to win in a tournament you better have the newest Elite (pay cash).
<br>
<br>And I am not even touching strange art style, lore unfriendly abilities and animations and bad responsiveness ... Simply put, this game is gaming disappointment of a decade for me</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7261291">Expand</a></span>

<br>Sadly, I must say DoW 3 is a Huge miss here (and I worry my 4/10 rating is too much generous?).
<br>First off, the gameplay simply isn&apos;t there.
<br>The mix they tried to do between the two previous DoW doesnt work; it just isn&apos;t balanced and the epicness isn&apos;t there. The worst is the small maps which are heavily restricted (corridors) and nullify all aspect of strategy which you want in a RTS.
<br>While there are positive like the graphics, audio, voice acting and the overall 40k universe;
<br>The worst is the content. If you dont care about multiplayer, the campaign is short and dull and again, very restricted (Feels like a never ending tutorial with never any freedom to play the mission like you want).
<br>Only 3 races and no game mode... (I mean the potential was there, they could have made another Last Stand mode with the heroes, which was a BLAST in DoW 2!)
<br>You will basically pay the highest AAA price, play the 10h-ish campaign, forget its dull story and never open the game again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7264458">Expand</a></span>

<br>Base construction is minimal and not interesting.
<br>I waited this game for years, and this is a big dissapointement. And this comes from a both of relic and warhammer.
<br>IDK what happened, this is just sad, sad and boring.
<br>
<br>If at least it would have advanced the story and background of the bloodravens... but it did not even do that.
<br>
<br>The only, little interest, is in the multiplayer, wich is acceptable. But i think most of the persons that plays dawn of war don&apos;t do it for the multiplayer. do they?
<br>
<br>I am just sad for this game, this studio, and this license...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7267232">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are not that bad but cartoonish style simply doesn&apos;t cut it. There is no real tactical options, mostly because regular units on all sides die so quickly that you don&apos;t have time or need to manage them.  Its total chaos and meat grinder all around. Elites are on one side overpowered MOBA heroes with MOBA specials, yet need to micromanage couple of them at same time makes loosing focus and momentum easy. Relic tried to make hybrid of MOBA and light RTS and that is mistake from the start. Even worst mistake was to do away with anything that makes tactical combat an option. DOW1 had cover system  way better and more intuitive. In MOBAs you control one hero, mobs come by themselves and you don&apos;t have to produce them like here, chaos is expected and welcomed. In DOW game it shouldn&apos;t be so but Relic did it in worst way possible with clear idea of making a game to try to lure players of MOBAs and simplified tank rush RTS games both. Game looks lot like StarCraft  in level design (space platforms/space forts look almost identical)  and even some race mechanics ( elder focus, unit shielding etc.) or story bits with MOBA twist. Campaign is somewhat interesting but it is in essence training for MP and they do not even hide it. Forcing you to play each mission with different race makes patching something lot simpler  in a way of story and selling it.  DOW1 Winter assault even had better solution for telling a simple but effective story and Dark Crusade or Soulstorm made it with almost no  story but good competitive drive. I don&apos;t even want to comment Pok&#xE9;mon/Power rangers like flipping Chapter masters and Terminators, or Spiderman like antics of Orc Warlords and so on. You got that but no combat animations of slashing, crushing and dashing, sure sign who was target audience. Even MP is very rudimentary, in truth just somewhat more developed hybrid of MOBA and Clash Royal (lots of Giants and Skeleton/ Minion horde stuff)  . Yes it can be light fun but it simply isn&apos;t  good DOW game
<br>
<br>PS: I see that some reviewers are giving 10 to this game &quot; to balance haters&quot; even when they also think that lot went wrong with this one and because they expect that game  will be patched and improved with  DLC-s. I really honestly hope so but that&apos;s not the state of the game now and only that can be taken in account for review and scoring.  Right now that&apos;s very low.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7263367">Expand</a></span>

<br>The community only asked for a game like the first DOW with new and better graphic/ textures, and you released  a RTS-MOBA abortion.
<br>Even DOW 2 is 100 times better than this.
<br>Dow3 is like C&amp;C4 : an EPIC FAIL.</span>

They started to dumb downs their games with COH2, with DOW3 they are clearly leaving the fans behind and trying to seduce a younger audience ... I think that they could loose everyone in the process. I hope they can get back in business after this Epic failure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7265240">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics on max setting isn&#x2019;t jaw dropping or even good. It&#x2019;s just average. And that&#x2019;s what this game really is, average. It doesn&#x2019;t shine at any moment. It&#x2019;s like relic didn&#x2019;t know what they wanted to do with this game.

If you were going to play only Skirmish vs AI - bad news: you won&apos;t get any aftermatch experience for matches vs AI!
<br>[Long version]:
<br>MOBA. No damage types and armour types like in previous games, no suppression and cover system, no unit moral system, no sync-kills. The only difference between tank and infantry is HP, infantry literally can shoot the tank (because there are no armour types).. with rifles.. the tank! with rifles! using usual bullets! no rockets need anymore! Nobody cares about casualties anymore you just spamming Space Marines squads and they die like creeps in Dota 2. Their only purpose is making &quot;meat shield&quot; for your Heroes.
<br>[Elites or Heroes system] (did I mention that this is MOBA?) very primitive and much, much worse than it was in WarCraft 3 in 2002.
<br>[Animation and visualisation] makes this circus even worse - units are very poorly animated, art-style is terrible for Warhammer 40K.
<br>[MP] contains only 8 maps and 1 Dota2-like MOBA mode.
<br>[Singleplayer &quot;campaign&quot;] is just glorified tutorial nothing more. You can earn experience for campaign but it contains only 17 easy boring missions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7264428">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I still feel like the gameplay is sloppy, but I am also realizing that the &quot;ultimate control&quot; I desire when playing an RTS is unreasonable.  I used to save scum DoW 1 and 2 if I ever lost a unit in DoW1 or had a team member go down in DoW 2.  This game is more about war being brutal and units are dying rapidly on all sides.

<br>Fact of the matter is, I came on here and gave a 0, got a Steam refund, but just couldn&apos;t resist buying it again and I am now having fun.  It isn&apos;t the game I had hoped for, but I do encourage people to avoid a knee jerk reaction and missing out on a fun game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7262976">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It fails on so many levels that it&apos;s actually hard for me to explain, suffice to say that the epic feel of battles and engagements with your favorite warhammer 40K races and units is simply not there anymore.
<br>There is no customization of your troops who feel like worthless fodder to be thrown away at a whim in contrast to DoW II where losing a veteran squad or two was a serious blow to your forces. Cover has been removed from the game and many tactical options with it, flanking is gone as is hitting vehicles in rear armour, facing of heavy weapons and the retreat button. Also gone is the great musical score and voice acting that would accompany your victory&apos;s and defeats replaced with inept and sometimes laughable dialogue, &quot;die you commoners&quot;...this was yelled by the imperial knight pilot when engaging a squad of orks..........
<br>There are also various other lore-defying immersion breaking things like a terminator doing backflips entire squads of tactical marines armed with plasma guns  or flamers.
<br>The new game mode &quot;power core&quot; is a bad joke which often leads to oneside battles being drawn out and favors almost a passive Blob up your forces and/or &quot;camping&quot; type approach, hugely different to the fast aggressive tactical gameplay of point control which featured in DoW II.
<br>
<br>I believe DoW II was/is a far superior game to the original dawn of war which was good in it&apos;s time but by todays standards is a muddled chaotic mess. It&apos;s gameplay was rendered obsolete once the mechanics of company of heroes were developed.
<br>And so here we have the problem, all the nostalgia sick fools that were calling for DoW to be taken back to the originals gameplay style have had a hand in this ABOMINATION of a game, it has far more in common with the first game than it does with DoW II. This is the devs attempt to make a Dawn of war 1-like game for the current times yet they even fail at that as a DoW1 reskin would have been better.
<br>Now we wait and see if the series dies with this game which it probably will or if it does survive somehow, will the next game we get be a continuation of the excellence that was found in Dawn of war II? Will we ever have....RETREBUTION!?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7264434">Expand</a></span>

I even liked Retribution (slightly less than Chaos Rising and DoW 2 Vanilla). I think the commando-type Gameplay is what hooked me, alongisde the universe. I played all campaigns in the most difficult setting possible multiple times, because I enjoyed the challenge it provided. I Played a little DoW 1 but not nearly as much. So I had high expectations for DoW 3 but I wasn&apos;t expecting the same thing, because of this whole THQ bankrupt thing.
<br>
<br>DoW 3 is not to be compared to DoW 2. It is a modern RTS that is very similar to Starcraft 2, far too similar imo. When I see replays or when I play against the IA, it feels like Starcraft. So DoW 3 is closer to DoW 1 than DoW 2. You liked DoW2 ? Then you might not like DoW 3.
<br>
<br>I was bored during the campaigns. I found myself struggling to get the motivation to finish the campaign. The heroic units from DoW 2 have been switched by Elite units. The difference is that these units have no progression. No experience, no equipement. Just 2 &quot;army&quot; abilities to unlock, which have sometimes a meaningful impact on the experience. The idea ot have a lot of different elite units seemed great and If I had the opportunity to customize them like in DoW 2, it would have been awesome (Did I mention i loved this game ? I also played a lot of the Last Stand..).
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not a MOBA because of its heroes, because in a moba your hero progress as the battle unfolds. Even in Warcraft 3 your hero had progression. In DoW 2 too. So actually Elite units are exactly this, units. They are not heroes, they are just powerful units you have to micromanage more. I felt very disappointed by this. Except for the Titans and some classic units (terminators, I see you), I felt most of the Elite units to be, well... useful but not really enjoyable. The main Ork Big Boss seems ridiculous to me, when you compare to other Big Bosses from the Warhammer universe. Of course, you might not even see your Elite unit depending on the game, since for some of them it&apos;s incredibly hard to get them if you&apos;re losing (which I am, often).
<br>
<br>Actually the maps look like what you would find in a MOBA game, with lanes, turrets and power core... Maybe that&apos;s why the term has been used recently. The maps are uninteresting and very small, making for very nervous skirmishes if you&apos;re okay with that. But since objectives are fixed (Shield -&gt; Turret -&gt; Power core), it can be very quickly boring.
<br>
<br>Dawn of War 3&apos;s main impact on my life is that I reinstalled Dawn of War 2 and remade all the campaigns. And even in some of the silliest Retribution campaigns I found more fun than in the entire solo experience of DoW 3.
<br>
<br>I wished I could love this game... This it not a bad game, this is just not the game I wanted it to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7326355">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>All I can say... multi-laser cannons...
<br>
<br>I have played some really trash RTS games, but I could still find them fun.
<br>The art and sound teams did an extraordinary job and I really wish I could give them a rating independent of the game; the game is so godawful I can only liken it to Final Fantasy XIII. Just with worse voice acting. No matter how pretty you make this look, you can&apos;t disguise the fact that this is a Fukushima level dumpster fire.
<br>
<br>Lore:
<br>-BIG ORK follow ....little Ork?
<br>WHAT?
<br>
<br>-Shootas being able to kill a squad of space marines.... no.
<br>This violates even the table top&apos;s rules, let alone any form of cannon in any book series.
<br>
<br>-The Eldar are incredibly poorly portrayed with almost zero loyalty to how they should act regarding source material.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, if I took the time to pidgeonhole every lore discrepancy, this would be a small novel. These are just some of the most glaring transgressions.
<br>
<br>-Overview and context:
<br>
<br>What happens when you try to turn a beautiful, flushed-out, respected, and revered RTS legacy into Dota 2.
<br>
<br>DoW was everything an RTS could hope to be and more.
<br>
<br>DoW II took everything DoW did and expanded into a different genre while retaining enough of DoW&apos;s RTS strengths and built a very personal world. It combined elements of the table top, and some minor rpg elements; this truly made it about &apos;YOUR GUYS.&apos; It was Chaos Gate made manifest with better plot and an awesome community. Was it completely an RTS? No. It was more, it was DoW II. There wasn&apos;t a term for it, but it was at it&apos;s very core Warhammer 40k. It was about your guys.
<br>
<br>There is no legitimate cover mechanic. No more epic showdowns while being pinned down behind a tank. The map is literally divided into lanes. All mechanics from both the table top and former DoW games forsaken. No true unit customization or specialization with three types of armor.
<br>
<br>Greatest betrayal and heresy present:
<br>The game and every single encounter boils down to split second skill activation... there is no real form of strategy present. Just rush in and use your skills fast. This is an enormous betrayal to both RTS and the DoW legacy. There is no strategy, just mindless bum rushing and ... multi-laser cannons.
<br>
<br>DoW III is a disaster in every sense of the word, it is Relic&apos;s death knell.
<br>
<br>By the Grace of the Golden Throne, I declare Exterminatus upon Dawn of War III.
<br>I hereby sign the death warrant of an entire title and consign the whole of the  work to oblivion.
<br>
<br>May Imperial Justice account in all balance; the Emperor protects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7477839">Expand</a></span>

It lacks many basic quality of life features and there is a distinct lack of content and a busted meta that obviously wasn&apos;t tested enough. I know it&apos;s only been out for a little bit but the state this game launched in was simply unacceptable
<br>
<br>It essentially acts like an early access title without saying it is, and it was blatantly rushed out of the door. It was missing a damn fullscreen option for emperor&apos;s sake and a surrender button in multiplayer! Give me a break! It STILL has framerate issues several months after release and general performance problems abound.
<br>
<br>The campaign was the definition of playing it safe. It wasn&apos;t bad per say but it wasn&apos;t very good either. Most mission are basically just tutorials. The jumping between different factions was very disorienting and was overall very forgettable. I wasn&apos;t asking for much here but I somehow got even less. I&apos;ll sum up the whole story really quick: gabe, macha and gorgutz fight each other a bunch then team up to fight a demon at the end, that&apos;s it. That&apos;s literally all the happens throughout the course of the campaign (minus the teaser at the end which ironically is more memorable than the entire game).
<br>
<br>What the game excels at in atmosphere and sound effects it fails in gameplay and polish. Units are far, far too fragile and 1 click army wipes are very common. Comeback mechanics do exist but the overall feel of the game revolves around cheesy tactics like backdoor dreadnaughts, spamming units en masse, and hiding knight sized units in grass (yes you read that right). I can look past the hiding knights thing, I can look past Gabriel somersaulting around in terminator armor, I can look past nit picky things like that but the gameplay overall is so volatile with how punishing it is for mistakes it really doesn&apos;t even matter. I recall particular low point heroes able to basically 1 shot entire legions of units it was that unbalanced. Isn&apos;t this what that beta test was for?
<br>
<br>The UI is sloppy. Nobody likes interfaces that fade in and fade out. It feels sluggish and unresponsive that way, this is basic design and they inexplicably chose to have the menus work this way. It&apos;s not cool! Nobody likes an unresponsive UI! The in-game UI is all over the place. I do like seeing my heroes on the side ala Warcraft 3 and it is customizable like you can have your map on either side and your command card on either side which is good. I know there are a lot of units to deal with. The battles get huge in this game, but the little cards that pop up at the bottom for each individual unit sucks. Not saying I know of a better way but there has to be a more user friendly way to view your selected units than having them all clustered up at the bottom like that.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a currency system. You collect skulls to unlock hero units and doctrines for multiplayer. The problem is that it&apos;s unfair to newcomers who don&apos;t have access to these units and doctrines until they either get stomped a bunch of times by players who DO have these things, or slog through that boring singleplayer. The other problem is there really isn&apos;t anything to buy with these skulls, after you unlock all the hero units and some choice doctrines you like there isn&apos;t anything to buy. You just keep accumulating them for no reason. It&apos;s almost as if they wanted to implement a cash shop of some kind but didn&apos;t have time to do it or something!
<br>
<br>This game isn&apos;t bad because its a MOBA, it&apos;s bad because it&apos;s just plain unfinished and overall not very fun. What is there is high quality stuff don&apos;t get me wrong, but there&apos;s not nearly enough of it and there&apos;s just so many bugs and untested things it generally feels very bare bones and experimental and certainly not worth 60 dollars or hell, not even 30, not in its launch state and certainly not now. I simply can&apos;t recommend this game. It breaks my heart to do it but I can&apos;t recommend it. It&apos;s just not very good.
<br>
<br>And that&apos;s surprising, baffling even, that Relic would release Dawn of War III in this state after their previous titles had so much polish and were great! Why would they waste their time if they weren&apos;t going to put any effort into it? What the heck happened? Player numbers are very low (like 600 max) and that&apos;s because the game isn&apos;t very well thought out or polished. You can&apos;t tell me after how much polish their previous titles had, and after a trailer like that the game would come out in this state?
<br>
<br>There isn&apos;t much hope for this game, it needed about another year of development but at this point I would say Relic really blew it with this title. Bottom line: don&apos;t rush your damn games out before their finished. Go early access if you have to but don&apos;t release it barely working and certainly don&apos;t charge 60 dollars for an incomplete mes</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7513078">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I could really overslook all these problems if the campaign mode was at least &quot;ok&quot;, since im not really into MP competitive stuff (and in that perspective, this game had a HUGE downgrade in comparison to DoW II) but the campaign was mediocre at best.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played some skirmishes with my friends against the AI and it is full of bugs, enemy units sometimes just stop and do nothing, or some times they keep attacking you with their mediocre ranged damage (i.e howling banshee&apos;s ranged attack).
<br>
<br>If this game is to be something good in the future it will be because of the community doing mods and maps. Hope relic staff sees this and dont make this mistake again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7288207">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Why change a formula works? I would&apos;ve zero problem paying the msrp price for a remastered Dark Crusade. Just imagine how amazing Dark Crusade would be with HD HDR/4k texture and added features.
<br>
<br>A Dota style game will only sell to Dota fans. I have bought every single warhammer RTS games since the first one ( The amazing Gabriel angelos vs. Isador Akios story). I bought into the idea of warhammer two even if I did not like the lack of base building.
<br>
<br>But this evolved warhammer 3? I played the beta for a few days and was so disappointed. If I wanted to play Dota or Heroes of the Storm I can play those cause they are best at it. there is no need for a dota style dawn of war if the old formula works and sell guys.
<br>
<br>I did not and will not buy Dawn of War 3. A Dark Crusade with new graphics? I will pre-order now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7289643">Expand</a></span>

Non-elite units are squishy as f**k...
<br>
<br>One of the reasons I hated playing the imperial guard in DoW for the longest time was how easily your units died. You&apos;d have these large squads spec&apos;d out with cool laser pointers and noob tubes and then stare in despair as they all got mowed down by heavy bolters, But I came to appreciating that that was the gaurdsmen signature. Lots and lots of eager yet easily broken cannon fodder. And that was great, because it made them unique and accentuated the awesomeness of their artillery and vehicles.
<br>
<br>In DoW 3 all your units are weak. Yes, they&apos;re necessary and have a significant impact on the game, but they die to most things in seconds.  I&apos;ve always been a big fan of the space marines. Their look, their weapons and their unwavering love of combat combined with fearless devotion to victory in the name of the emperor is what make them bad a$$ as f**king hell. They are pure awesome.
<br>
<br>But in DoW 3 they are mere cannon fodder. Forget their crazy heavy armor or their genetic enhancements. They drop like flies, literally. They seemed a bit weak in DoW 1 as well, but I came to appreciate their strength in relation to what they were up against. But in DoW 3 they&apos;re plain and simply weak against everything. And this applies to any unit, of any faction that isn&apos;t an elite unit.
<br>
<br>Vehicles were incredibly strong in the original. Dreadnoughts would tear through entire armies. Predators were tanky as f**k, which makes sense being as they&apos;re a friggen tank. And land raiders, avatars, blood thirsters and squiggoths were an insane force to be reckoned with. You were not putting those monstrosities down quickly.
<br>
<br>In DoW 3 a predator misplaced for even a split second will explode instantly to even a couple anti-vehicle infantry squads. It&apos;ll die in a few seconds to regular infantry weapons. This applies to any non-elite vehicle. They just die incredibly fast and this is how the game has been designed. When I built my first predator playing DoW 3 I felt really excited thinking it was going to wreck all these sh1tt3r infantry units only to be disappointed to my core when it exploded in seconds to what might as well have been a couple of snow balls.
<br>
<br>Elite units are godly and satisfying to use. But they&apos;re strong to the point of making regular units seem like mundane, mass produced, mindless creeps. 3 elite units can easily erase an entire army. And while I enjoyed using the crazy strong elites I unfortunately still had to use my sad, frail sh1t tier units instead of being able to just enjoy bashing all the side show tin foil wannabe tanks with my over 9000 hammer.
<br>
<br>Regular tac marines are especially pathetic, to the point that they quickly become irrelevant as the game goes on. They can no longer wield rocket launchers or bolters and are frequently out ranged and out damaged by the majority of units. Against melee units they get sliced like butter. They don&apos;t even remotely compare to the guardsmen of the first DoW in their strength or damage output. And in the end they just don&apos;t feel satisfying to use, because when I use them I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;m using incredibly strong, armored up heavy hitting super soldiers. I feel like I&apos;m using animatronic target dummies composed of butter, paper mache, tin foil and match sticks. And that&apos;s being generous. There are no appropriate words for their air particle destructed frailty.
<br>
<br>Also, there are army decimating super weapons. I mean sure, an orbital bombardment annihilating an entire army of anything seems perfectly plausible. In fact, it feels like the entire game was built around the strength of super weapons. But in all honesty, I&apos;d rather weapons of that strength not even be available. So much so, that not only did I not enjoy using them, I actually felt guilty as hell when I used them on someone. The whole time I&apos;m sitting there, sadly moving my cursor along, watching my opponent&apos;s units helplessly hovering in the air getting mushed to pulp, all I can think is, &apos;I&apos;m sorry man. I&apos;m so, so **** sorry. I am so, wholeheartedly sorry for making you watch as I slide a cursor across your screen decimating every unit you&apos;ve built in seconds. I&apos;m only doing this because I have to, and because I know you will do the same to me. Thanks to the devs, the cycle will forever continue. No unit shall be spared.&apos;
<br>
<br>I can appreciate the kind of gameplay the devs were aiming for, and I think they nailed their intentions, but it&apos;s not what I was expecting from a DoW game and it doesn&apos;t really line up with what I know of the Warhammer universe. Because of the unit fragility it&apos;s a very hyper micro, zero macro, heavy hero kind of game.
<br>
<br>In a sentence, the game is no longer &apos;HOLD THE LINE BROTHERS FOR THE GLORY OF THE EMPEROR!&apos;, but instead just, &apos;Man, look at allllll the space pulp on my screen right now...&apos;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7329896">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The campaign is the worst DOW campaign in the franchise and honestly multiplayer games are just boaring  (15 mission campaign to cover the 3 classes). The game is so flawed the mechanics are counterintuitive and you really need a very high APM to get things done in this game. Really not a game for the casual crowd and the multiplayer is so un-dynamic i don&apos;t see serious players getting involved either.
<br>
<br>I love 40k but in this case I should of kept my money.

<br>
<br>I threw away money because I didn&apos;t want to believe the negative campaigning. I could see past the somewhat different take on base building and &apos;lanes&apos;. It seemed like these guys were just taking a risk to finally try to bring the Dawn of War games to the limelight.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately the troubles begin pretty early. Starting up the tutorial you can already tell that the screen is really too cluttered and I can&apos;t tell exactly what style of art they were going for with the aesthetic -- it&apos;s a little murky. After you finish the tutorial, which explains basically nothing of &apos;doctrines&apos; or the skull &apos;currency&apos; to BUY them, you go into the first mission of the campaign.
<br>
<br>Before I start on the campaign, I want to mention that I think it&apos;s a terrible, terrible design choice to gate your content behind ridiculous like a currency. Want to jump right into multiplayer? Nope. You better have your doctrines ready and to get them is going to take some tedious grinding.
<br>
<br>The campaign starts you off as Space Marines, or at least as Gabriel Angelos. Sure it&apos;s pretty evident when you should use your abilities -- he is one of the easier heroes in the game. But the first mission is INCREDIBLY boring and unwelcoming for newer players of the genre. That style of play has nothing to do with what you probably bought the game for in addition to a good single player game -- the multiplayer.
<br>
<br>Most of the game you DO NOT build any kind of bases or structures, or you&apos;re purposefully limited.
<br>
<br>The story is mediocre, not bad -- which is one of the reasons I&apos;m not giving this a lower score. But come on, we know the motif for these games, don&apos;t we?
<br>
<br>After finishing the the eleventh mission of the game, I decided that I just couldn&apos;t take it. running a rat maze while one elite hits an alarm and stealths while your other two stand at a point is lazy design. There&apos;s no reason to play multiplayer at the moment without a ladder and who knows if this game is going to try to scam even more money from you. Why are doctrines gated behind this skull currency? Why couldn&apos;t I just decide to take a break and play a multiplayer game? Then again, why would I want to. Want to make changes on the fly to control groups? Nope - reselect everything you want and rebind it.
<br>
<br>The races feel almost identical with maybe an exception to orks.
<br>
<br>The game was rushed and every second after the first eleven missions I just wanted to play DOW1. I suggest that relic/CA whoever takes this game back like Final Fantasy fix the broken, unfinished garbage they rushed out and apologize to the fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7296665">Expand</a></span>

<br>Dawn of war had quite big armies and variety of units/abilities/heroes and fun multiplayer as well as campaign.
<br>Dawn of war II had smaller armies and and less variety of units but much more and stronger abilities which made it much more tactical. This wouldn&apos;t have been possible to play with big armies like in DoW but was also as much fun in a quite different way. Also the Last stand mode was fun big times.
<br>
<br>THIS is just terrible. It tries to bring big armies like in Dow but units got even blunter than in DoW(less abilities, no equipable weapons, no progress for your units)
<br>No buildable defensive structures. Neither Moral nor suppression system. The graphic totally switched the direction, now it became catoonish(terrible for a universe that tries to be serious). The animation of movement looks silly, which leads to an essencial part of DoW franchise:
<br>They removed the executions! With a terrible argument of how they couldn&apos;t balance the &quot;make a unit take damage, or not take damage while it executes another&quot; their lazy asses just removed them completly. The campaign of DoW II was better though it was boring as watching tar drip.
<br>There are only 3 factions with not enough variety to make them interesting.
<br>Actually considering that you could give most units on average 3 upgrades/weapons, even that had more variety.
<br>Some argue that the workshop appendex could improve the game through gamers over time, like skyrim was improven through mods by players BUT IT&apos;S NOT THE JOB OF THE PLAYERS TO MAKE THE GAME PLAYABLE IF THE DEVELOPERS GET PAYED.
<br>I just hope that someday a miracle happens and somebody takes this over and forges DoW IV as good as ther first two.

<br>
<br>I personally was hoping for something that had the gameplay and basebuilding of DOW1 combined with the Garisonable buildings, cover system, Leader choices and wargear of DOW2, with new and great graphics and ragdoll physics.
<br>
<br>What we got was none of that, instead..
<br>
<br>Sync Kills got removed
<br>Garisonable buildings removed
<br>Intelligent cover removed. Replaced by a mindless bubble shields.
<br>Cartoony graphics replaced grimdark of old.
<br>No ability to rotate camera.
<br>No risk style campaign like we loved in DOW1
<br>No game speed setting like in DOW1
<br>No Co-op style campaign i loved from DOW2
<br>No last stand mode like we loved in DOW2
<br>Only 3 races
<br>Only 9 maps
<br>A Gabriel angelos doing frontflips in terminator armor.
<br>
<br>Watch this video and around 8 min in you will see the interviewer throw out a bait statement saying &quot;warhammer lore is stupid and over the top&quot; Phils response was to laugh, nod and agree repeatedly.
<br>
<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_QBkq1uMs4
<br>
<br>Its no wonder it missed on so many levels when that is the lead designer and how he responds to someone criticizing the game. Even his response to Gabriel Angelos flipping in term armor was made up by players on development forums and just regurgitated in mass by phil to say &quot;yeah he can jump&quot;. Which proves he heard everyones complaints/suggestions during development and just ignored them since he didnt care.
<br>
<br>Another reason game ended up in this state is the moderation. During development me and many of my friends spent time in the official forums critiquing losing the things stated above and the direction of the game. All we got in response was argued with by the mod of all people. Each and every thing listed above the mod would show up and just argue with you til you felt you were wasting your time and we all eventually left and quit wasting our time.
<br>
<br>Once the game released, they let the same mod police the steam forums. Now to go along with arguing with the users, he bans them left and right and then sanitizes the forums to make it look like everyone is happy. Over and over anyone who spoke out about the game found themselves banned and their posts deleted, while people who attacked those that criticized the game were given free reign to say as they pleased, mod would just show up and sanitize their ignorant remarks or remove them IF any action was taken.
<br>
<br>Here is a link to where steam users talk about that issue.

<br>They even went so far as to plant people who spend all day every day arguing with people who say anything negative about game, I have even seen these people slip up and instead of mention things like &quot;they are releasing&quot; they slip into first person and say we are releasing showing that they work for or are affiliated with the company and are hiding that fact.
<br>
<br>Dont get this game, you will regret it. There is very good reason it is mostly negative status last 30 days and has such a poor population. Look at it compared to COH or even Dow1, less than soulstorm made a decade ago and less by far than all DOW1 games added together. This is after less than 3 monts, and since no effort was put into singleplayer, multiplayer is all you will be left with after doing a campaign that even the people who defend this game didnt like, since you will be forced to constantly switch between all three races.
<br>
<br>Multi and ghostown populations is all you will have left for your money, sitting in ques til you log off.  Just buy DOW 1 and DL the free titanium mod! You will end up with 50 or so unique units to use with each army, which is about as many as all 3 factions in dow 3 combined.

<br>If you&apos;re really passionate about W40k, and you can&apos;t stand the idea of divergence from the lore and atmosphere, then I&apos;d say give it a pass. I&apos;d also advise giving the game a miss if you&apos;re very much into the established gameplay from either the first or second game, as this game diverges quite a lot from its predecessors in ways which seems to have the community mostly angry about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7283322">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The strategy is weird, even more skill usages than in DOW 2, with no micro for cover/flanking. With the exisitng defending structures and those bushes, you end up with more a moba-like impressions than a RTS.
<br>
<br>In the end, it&apos;s like they wanted to make a strategy game with the same competitive elements and designs you can find in a Moba. The result is &quot;original&quot; in the same way peanut-butter flavored yogurt is original. It aims to attract to more people, claims to be the new sensation while being just a mix that no one wanted, will end up with its fanbase, but most people will only taste it once or twice and never eat some again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7285565">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is over simplistic, the devs have a horrendous disregard for the fluff (terminators can&apos;t do backflips) and the campaign is dull and unimaginative. Not to mention the fact that we only get three races to play with a hint at a fourth in the end cutscene. This from a setting that has over a dozen different factions is simply not acceptable. Sadly this has fallen into the same trap that EA did with battlefront. Relic could have easily made something incredible, and instead they made something tragic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7347300">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is a great disappointment compared to the previous titles in the series and an even greater let down if you enjoyed any of the Company of Heroes games.  It is closer to a regression to Starcraft merging with Dawn of War I than an advance on Relic&apos;s previous titles.  There are few animations (and the ones there look like a cartoon), no sync-kills, a very restricted camera, poor voice acting (in comparison to the previous titles), less strategic depth, more of an arcade RTS, and general lack of immersion.  They went from a work of art to a game that tries to win over the e-sports crowd and fail to deliver even there.
<br>
<br>The game becomes boring after a few games, and as an RTS, judged apart from previous Relic games it deserves something around a 6 if you ignore the downgrade from the previous titles and that it is supposed to take place in the 40k universe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7276830">Expand</a></span>

All the things that made Company of Heroes and Dawn of War awesome and unique aren&apos;t there.
<br>
<br>Units have no persistence, there&apos;s no per unit retreat function only a mass callback. Not that it matters because the combat is spamming unit blobs and micromanaging hero&apos;s.
<br>
<br>There is no tactical use of terrain, no cover mechanics to speak of, no destructible buildings like in CoH. Just some barricades, that seemingly got tossed in as an aside. The maps, all 8 of them (as of this writing) are flat non interactive clearly divided into MOBA style lanes, which if the game had interesting hero mechanics like say DoW II would be serviceable....but it doesn&apos;t so they serve to highlight the lack of gameplay in both depth and variety.
<br>
<br>The camera is awful, if your going to have mass blobby combat at least let us see the action. Instead we get a tiny keyhole camera view. You&apos;ll never see anything like the cut scenes except during a cut scene.
<br>
<br>The art direction is equally bad, it looks like it should be for another game not a DoW. Everything is shiny and neon like an unflattering combination of Star Craft and Tron.
<br>
<br>No base building, it doesn&apos;t even have the ability to build defenses like in CoH (listening posts not withstanding), no mine fields, no emplacements except on points, just shallow and bland pop out your 6 or so buildings as quick as you can and done.
<br>
<br>DoW III doesn&apos;t feel like a finished game or much of a game at all, the mechanics are unfinished and shallow, there&apos;s no direction to the game, the animations are bad, and a decided lack of depth on the whole process. While I appreciate the thought, you don&apos;t just make a half finished clone of Star Craft pump out a few League of Legends inspired maps, and instantly get e-sports success, you have to make a good game first something Relic forgot to do while chasing that MOBA money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7288679">Expand</a></span>

<br>This isn&apos;t fun, it doesn&apos;t look good (were they designing this ready for a smart phone port?), it has no idea what its trying to be. I loved the first two games, and for me the only thing the series was missing was the sheer scale of the overall universe this IP is set in.

But in this new delivery everything is over, a cinematic campaign, instead of the wonder that was the dow2 campaign. The game vs IA is a ****** So hard to find this option and SERIOUSLY no OFFLINE vs IA...

<br>Why a strategy game has no offline mode... Never buy this ****</span>

<br>
<br>The graphics are decent and the sound is not so great.  The story is terrible and you won&apos;t feel connected to the characters at all.  I feel like playing this game is a chore.  I have kept coming back because of the happy memories I have from dawn of war 2 and the expansions expecially Chaos Rising.  This game tries to do something new and it totally fails.  The strategy element is weak with gameplay that offers no real depth.  Add that to the lack of compelling story or likeable characters and you have a game that is not worth your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7368329">Expand</a></span>

I totally disagree with that statement. The predecessors and  both CoH games, all belong to an original RTS style,  created and developed by Relic Entertainment for years.
<br>Those games feature many unique and interesting mechanics which ultimately make them great and distinct from other RTS games (mostly based on WarCraft style, C&amp;C style or Total Annihilation style).  It is why me and a lot of other people love those games. The DoW 3 do not implement  most of those unique mechanics but clearly try to be some kind of poor mix of StarCraft and DoTA at once.
<br>The Relic discarded all good features which make their previous games great, like:
<br>-	destructible environment,
<br>-	morale/pin down mechanics,
<br>-	indoor/outdoor cover system (the cover system form DOW 3 is very symbolic, most of times useless)
<br>-	rich unit customization (which alters the way the unit is used)
<br>-	unit preservation - previous games encouraged player to care about his units. In DoW 3 they made Space Marines, a cannon fodder  which is a Heresy against the lore of W40K.
<br>-	Different damage types (it is almost impossible to damage a tank with anti-infantry weapons) &#x2013; in DoW 3 the Tanks and Non-elite Walkers seems to be made from paper like in SC.
<br>-	Heroes with significant impact on the battlefield but incapable of winning the fight alone.
<br>-	The graphical design  of the units and environment suitable for the Lore. The cartoonish graphics in DoW 3, even though very beautiful, is a parody thus a Blasphemy against the lore of W40K.
<br>-	The epic music (especially in DoW2). In DoW3 I can hear some ambient sound with some melody in it, but is almost unnoticeable.
<br>
<br>There is actually one thing that I like very much. The UI is useful and very elegant.
<br>
<br>In addition to abandoning all of those great concepts, Relic manage to achieve something I thought was impossible. They crated the game with mechanics even more primitive then that in SC.
<br>They abandoned and betrayed their loyal fans and created the game for dumb players which recognize ultra-fast clicking and blobbing as an art of strategy. Downgrading DoW to SC style  (while SC is a well-known W40K imitation) is creating an Abomination, which cannot be forgiven.  The GW should seriously consider to revoke the IP from Relic after this explicit act of Treachery.
<br>
<br>On top of that, the game is not even a good MOBA, because if treated as such, is way too overwhelming   (you have to control 3 heroes and your creeps at once) and underdeveloped  (there is no in-battle customization and leveling).
<br>
<br>Summarizing in four accurate words:  The Heresy, The Blasphemy, The Abomination and The Treachery*. The Inquisition should now perform its duty and at least fire the Lead Designer of this game.
<br>
<br>* - I am using those specific words because those are suitable for the Lore of W40K, not because I am some kind of mad lunatic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7270610">Expand</a></span>

<br>The astetics are questionable at best, for example has the entirety of the bloodravens made a packt with slanesh so they would look fabulous and oiled up all the time?
<br>This game is far away from previous Dow games and the sourcematerial.
<br>The movement and behavior of the models just feels off and derpy.
<br>Some of the animations are just insulting, overall the artstyle and thone is a downgrade from Dow2.
<br>This game just feels like a compleately new rts with the DoW tag just slapped on for sales!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7273193">Expand</a></span>

MOBA - Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. What we have here:
<br>1. Game requires all-time online even for singleplayer, you won&apos;t earn experience points playing in Skirmish vs AI. As well as in Dota 2 and LoL. Game forces you to play online vs human players! Outside this your Heroes won&apos;t progress.
<br>2. Game has Heroes* and forces you to use them all time. Heroes itself are very OP as well as in MOBA. Other forces are just a covering crowd, worthless without heroes, like creeps in Dota but with direct control.
<br>
<br>*A little remark! In Warcraft 3 there also were heroes but only 3 per faction, with decent background gameplay RTS mechanics for &apos;em, deep tactical items system, only as support for forces, with permanent buffs for all game life cycle and without pay-to-win policy like here. WarCraft 3 made by former gamers for actual games, DoW3 made only for making money on further paid content spam this is first and the last goal.
<br>
<br>3. You can boost your heroes with aftermath experience points like in MOBA.
<br>4. No battle tactics, no retreat button, no weapons difference outside damage and HP, as well as in MOBA.
<br>4. Pay-to-win policy and further DLC spam with OP factions and heroes to make &apos;em attractive for buying. No doubt sega and relic will be selling &quot;heroes pack&quot; and &quot;skins&quot; like in MOBA - Heroes of the Storm.
<br>
<br>Obviously this isn&apos;t Warhammer 40.000 strategy game, it&apos;s barely can be called a strategy game, obviously it&apos;s MOBA with some strategic elements (building, collecting resources) and with very low quality of realization, more acceptable for f2p game but absolutely not for triple-A RTS game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7265469">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is all about that wonderful 2016 cinematic trailer (yeah, it was very promising...), and a lot of marketing by Sega. It&apos;s hard to call this product a game, since there&apos;s no fun in playing it,  it&apos;s more a successful advertising campaign: they are literally selling garbage, and people are asking for it...
<br>There are no good ideas behind this product, there are no successful innovations to gameplay, competitive game sucks, single player is too boring, the plot is randomly generated for sure.
<br>
<br>The only positive thing about this game, is that I haven&apos;t spent a dime to play it, because a friend of mine pre-ordered it some time ago and promised to let me play it before I bought it.
<br>He literally saved me 60$. Now he would sell it to me for 30. I feel sorry for him, but I think this &quot;game&quot; should be free-to (not) play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7265030">Expand</a></span>

Heroes like in WC3 but sadly no lvl Mechanic or skill choice at all. good fun in the campaign when you like storytelling and the MP part is fantastic, also you can expect a growing and healthy community like in the other dawn of war titles.
<br>
<br>Contra:
<br>Some balance issues, some pathfinding problems.
<br>
<br>Missing Content: Last Stand Mode, Coop Mode, Cover Mechanics, Tactics beside a bit micro.
<br>SP Part:
<br>Single Player Campaign to easy on the highest difficulty and sometimes it feels like a tutorial for MP the last missions have some challenges but overall it takes a lot of time since pop cap and limited ressourced to finish the missions savely, but you get a lot of experience for your elites and skulls. The storytelling and especially the ork part is awesome made. Sadly like in every RTS the AI in SP is not challenging or hard to come by, maybe in the last mission you need a second try. Achievement for finishing the Campaign is bugged but will be patched. Future dlcs will improve a lot also on the SP part.
<br>
<br>MP Part:
<br>Right now MP has only 8 Maps. But the next patch will bring a few more, the community have already some maps out for the dow 1 fans with less core mechanic and a lot huger with more ressourced for big battles. The Modes are 3v3 2v2 and 1v1. The Game is balanced mostly atm for 3v3 next Month will come a balance patch and so overall the game will be more fun. The only Mode you can play is rush the enemy core. aka Ancient and win with turrets and shields protecting it. Early loses are hard punished by low income and lose of map control which further decrease the income so the enemy will stay ahead, and if you win the early its like a comp stomp in 90% of the matches. But thats due to all learn the game and mechanics you will soon see that the game itself is awesome and brings fun you can also make some real comebacks by countering units and enemy tactics. Splitpushing and such things. Income increase with Each Escalation Phase, and when you turtle you can actually make it back when the enemy don&apos;T use his advantage correctly or you can finish the enemy when you have the advantage. You don&apos;t have the macro game like in SC2 with 2-5 bases and a lot of workers but that helps you actually to learn to master your micro if its is not perfect.
<br>
<br>Game Pace/Pathfinding:
<br>the Pace is ok for an RTS! sadly the Pathfinding and reaction to your clicks are not always but relic will patch this soon. Sometimes your elite or normal units don&apos;t respond at all to a command or bug out, in 5% of the cases. This is heavily due to terrain issues or stuns when they channel an ability.
<br>
<br>MP Games are decided in 60% of the matches in the first 5-10 minutes, comeback mechanic will help a lot if players get better and escalation buffs those with less units a bit more in income since you have the upkeep mechanic. You cant disband units so your eco will still be behind but with 1-2 good fights you turn the tide to your favour.
<br>
<br>Bad for Competition:
<br>The Skull System forces new players in the future to do the SP and a lot of Mp Matches, to upgrade their &quot;Elite&quot; which act like heroes in WC3 without a lvl mechanic, and doctrines to even flash out 1 army to win vs people who have it. Limited balance see above. I hope this will be changed so you don&apos;t have to lvl up elited and farm skulls to unlock them and doctrines.
<br>
<br>at the moment the game missing a lot of quality of life features like: Custom Key Binding, Better Zoom in/out, Better switch in control modes, faster scroll and a lot more.
<br>
<br>Sega solved the DLC issue and is now mostly helpfull.
<br>

                                        <span>Playing this game i feel more like im playing some advanced version of Cannon Fodder, then RTS. It feels more arcadey then strategy - battles are chaotic, super fast and require hell of micromanagement.
<br>
<br>Graphically, the game is imo quite pleasant. IRL it looks better then on streams.
<br>
<br>Regarding campaign, i don&apos;t like constant side switching. I prefer playing one faction.</span>

<br>They removed unit upgrades and customization.Which was one of the things I loved about the dow games.The roster is smaller and you cant even play the single player campaign offline.
<br>Lastly don&apos;t be fooled by reviews by users like &quot;Voenix&quot;,they have just created an account to give 10 rating to this **** game.If you value your money and time stay away for this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7275684">Expand</a></span>

Non &#xE8; possibile che questo gioco disti cos&#xEC; tanto dal primo dawn of war ma soprattutto &#xE8; identico a quel cazzo di starcraft 2. IDENTICO!!!!!!!!!!! Pure le texture fanno schifo...sembra di giocare alla guerra con i soldatini tutti colorati, gli edifici sembrano usciti da un parco dei divertimenti scadenti tutto sembra cos&#xEC; colorato e &quot;Fumettoso&quot;. Ammetto che dopo aver visto il trailer di dawn of war 3 ero in orgasmo per il realismo e l&apos;atmosfera che era riuscita a creare in quel trailer dall&apos;epicit&#xE0; senza paragoni. Poi per&#xF2; tutto scema in un cazzo di gioco che emula lo stile grafico di Blizzard e il pi&#xF9; recente LOL. LOL esatto! Mi viene appunto da ridere per non piangere. Forse non vi &#xE8; venuto in mente perch&#xE8; il primo dawn of war era cos&#xEC; figo? Perch&#xE8; anche se in miniatura tutto sembrava realistico, a partire dalla natura e dealle texture e quella nebbia di guerra che dava un atmosfera surreale, &quot;tossica&quot; o aliena alle mappe. Si ogni mappa aveva una cazzo di atmosfera. Ora le mappe sono un esplosione di colori nonsense e addio epicit&#xE0;. Addio realismo! E poi 8 mappe contro le 40000 disponibili nel primo dawn of war, mille sfumature di mappe diverse, ANCORA  PIGRIZIA. Dawn of war era speciale e magari qualcuno ci giocava perch&#xE8; forse quel cazzo di stile cartoon non si addice a tutto. L&apos;universo del 40000 &#xE8; cupo cazzo!! CUPO!!!!! Cazzo er davvero cos&#xEC; difficile??? Se a qualcuno piace qualcosa e si &#xE8; affezionato a quel qualcosa non vuole che cambi, O-K??? Vuole semplicemente di pi&#xF9; e pi&#xF9; figo quindi volete fate dawn of war 3? tenetelo uguale ma aggiungete eroi, aggiungete truppe, migliorate semplicemente le texture e gli effetti e vomitate dettagli e animazioni ambientali stra fighe ma mantenete l&apos;atmosfera cazzo!!! Le mappe di dawn of war sono senza anima, senza carattere, senza esplorabilit&#xE0;. Quanto figo sarebbe stato anche solo semplicemente ingigantire le mappe e creare questa volta delle vere e proprie fortezze o imperi con mura torrette sistemi di difesa, che ne so tipo un age of empireso o che so io... 0 perch&#xE8; non si poteva peggio tradire la fiducia di un fan di dawn of war. E ve lo dico, continuer&#xF2; a giocare a soulstorm perch&#xE8; lo adoro ed &#xE8; ancora attuale e figo. Piuttosto fategli un remastered e ve lo compro subito. Ma sono contento di aver ritornato i miei 60 euro a steam dopo l&apos;acquisto di DoW3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7264626">Expand</a></span>

Relic enforcing people to play the only MOBA mode the game has. They pushed away DoW fans who awaited real RTS and tried to cater f2p MOBA casuals community. A fail fail. Really really disappointed. Don&apos;t buy this stuff or refund it.</span>

<br>The gameplay is stupidly basic comapred to anything Relic have made before, I loved company of heroes 1/2 and DoW 1, DoW 2 was a little hit or miss to be fair but it was playable. there is no way I&apos;m buying another Relic game without trying it 1st now, 0% faith in the company to produce a quality sequal or even a playable game (and after so long too!) no doubt they will bring in more factions (as there are only 3) as DLC later but they won&apos;t be getting a penny more from me on this pile of junk.

<br>To put it another way, this game to Relic is what C&amp;C 4 is to EA</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7276424">Expand</a></span>

<br>the bad things now:
<br>-when i buy a game which is a sequel (furthermore for 60&#x20AC;) based on a marvelous and complete license than warhammer 40k, i expect to have more content than in the previous one.
<br>here you have less armies (only 3 choices), less units (take &#xE0; look at the eldars, where are the guardians? or the spacemarine motocycles for exemple).
<br>
<br>-it&apos;s suppose to be an rts game, which mean for me basically build a base and an army.
<br>here you have 5-6 buildings available depending on the army you play and which are mostly the same in each army, so much for diversity...
<br>
<br>there are probably more defaults i don&apos;t think about right know but it&apos;s enough for saying i&apos;m really disapointed about this game and it&apos;s not worth it the expensive price of 60 &#x20AC;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7278122">Expand</a></span>

Units lack of soul, personality and this is not a fact for Warhammer 40k becaus there is many heroic moments for every basic unit but they are very passive under so many effect of graphics and no animations in campaing or sync kills. It is fast based developed for money bait with many adversite not for the satisfy of players.

Just like everything else in today&apos;s society, game reviews are so polarized. This game absolutely doesn&apos;t deserve anything less than a 6-7. I thoroughly enjoyed the campaign playing on Hard, I actually found some of it to be decently challenging. Most of the campaign missions take about an hour to complete and there are 17 of them.I haven&apos;t played too much multiplayer yet, i&apos;m sure there&apos;s balancing issues (what game doesn&apos;t have balancing issues) but overall seems pretty solid.
<br>
<br>There are some minor complaints (such as units not automatically defending when attacked) or personal preferences I wish they had kept from previous installments (like the cover system or the retreat function) but all and all, its a solid game. I would definitely purchase a 4th version of this game so I hope these extremely polarized reviews don&apos;t reflect sales. If you&apos;re a Warhammer fan, I would definitely suggest picking up this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7280224">Expand</a></span>
