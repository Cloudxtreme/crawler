The fact is that this game is made by one guy is making it more amazing! I mean SimCity is made by a big company, compared to this they made nothing. I mean it. Anyways this game is a must buy if you like RTS and city building games!</span>

<br>Build more food, build more houses.
<br>Get medicine, build a hospital, a church, etc. so your peasants are happy. Try to get all available resource types for the hell of it.
<br>
<br>And that&apos;s about it.
<br>
<br>Where&apos;s the fun in that?
<br>It&apos;s very challenging at the beginning and that&apos;s what makes this game so much fun. But once you got your head around it it gets really, really boring.
<br>For a building game it only gave me around 15 hours of entertainment - which just isn&apos;t good enough. And there&apos;s no actual goal once you got everything working besides having more citizens which again, has no payoff whatsoever.
<br>
<br>All in all, it&apos;s fun, but the price tag just isn&apos;t fair. It defends itself as being a &quot;one guy dev&quot; game but it charges you like there was a whole indy team behind it.
<br>Currently it goes for 19 bucks on Steam -  a proper pricing would be 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=4004610">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I ruined my first town trying to figure out how the game behaves (despite going thru full tutorial), which was to be expected.  The second town I built very carefully, and apparently I more or less mastered the game because all it devolved into was a series of moving numbers up and down on tiny GUI buttons.  Assign peasants to tasks, unassign them......raise building quotas....lower them.  There&apos;s no end to this game that I am aware of.  No upgrading of buildings. No new &quot;era&quot; to be born into.  The game is all about creating an equilibrium and trying to maintain it while people either die of old age or from (more often than not) dying in a quarry or mine.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s it.  That&apos;s the game.....
<br>
<br>It had addictive qualities but ultimately it&apos;s a time waster of a game.  Do NOT buy this for full price ($20) wait for it to go for $5 and then it&apos;s a fair purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=4377714">Expand</a></span>

If you have a small town and everything is in close proximity to each others then assigning villagers at random (or from the last placed house?) is not a problem. However, if you have a large population of over 300 villagers and you&apos;re playing on a large map just think of the distance the villagers have to walk to get back to their house for food. Some will go to the nearest Market or Storage Barn to eat but not all. I&apos;ve noticed that for the most part they will most likely return to the house they were born in to eat. They can&apos;t eat from a house that is already occupied that is not theirs because that would make things so much easier. This here is where lies a major flaw in the design of this game. The way this game was design you can only play on a small map. If you play on a large map and planned on inhabiting every nooks and crannies of the map then it will most likely end up in failure.
<br>
<br>The design flaw is the assigning of villagers at a random location from a random house (or the house that was last built?) to replace a recently dead villager. Let&apos;s put things into perspective. For example, if I have a farmer from one location on the map and if he happens to die he will be replaced by the next available laborer (wherever this laborer may live). However, if this laborer lives on the other far end of the map, he must trek a super long distance to the farm land to replace the dead farmer. Then when he gets hungry he must trek back to his house in the far distance but often times he will never make it even if he is walking on Stone Road. You see how this can be a problem?
<br>
<br>And this was exactly what happened to me. I had a population over 300 villagers and everything was going fine until a chain reaction of hunger occurred. Since every laborers can be from any house any where on the map, when they get hungry they must trek back to the place where they were born to feed. If you&apos;re playing on a large map, the randomness of villagers being assigned as replacements to the dead ones will throw the whole game out of whack. My population hit a critical mass at 300+ villagers then everyone started dropping like flies down to around 125+ villagers because of death by starvation. This all happened literally within 5 minutes. You should have seen the looks on my face as I glared at the monitor thinking to myself WTF just happened? It&apos;s not the scarcity of food because I was banking on 50K+ (I built a lot of farms and focus heavily on food production) and I made sure I had a few houses at every work sites. I had everything built perfectly and there was no shortage of supplies of any kind. As a matter of fact I had a surplus of supplies.
<br>
<br>The mass starvation deaths was caused by them trekking super long distance that they couldn&apos;t make. Here is what I would like to see changed in a patch if there ever will be one. Have the Storage Barn and Market be a central point where any villagers can come to eat regardless of where they live on the map. This way even with the randomness mechanics of villagers replacing dead ones, they will always be guaranteed that they will be well feed if they have to work far from their homes. Thus you can build Storage Barns and Markets anywhere on the map as a place to come to feed, therefore not relying on trekking back to their homes.
<br>
<br>Yes I was pretty pissed that over 41% of my workforce died in a chain reaction within 5 minutes. I wanted to see if it was a bug or what if I had tried something different then that won&apos;t happen. I load an earlier saved and did a few things differently but once my population hit that critical mass of 300+ villagers, they started to die in a chain reaction due to starvation.
<br>
<br>I would have given Banished a perfect 10 had it not been for this fatal flaw (literally) that prevent you from expanding to the far corners of the map.  This game is almost there but not quite yet.  Patching the dependent on homes as a food source will allow for a far more fulfilling experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=4006088">Expand</a></span>

<br>However once all this is done, you begin to realize there&apos;s not a lot left to do. There feels little point or purpose is expanding your city further as there&apos;s no further reward for doing so. There&apos;s no new buildings or benefits. Just more to manage. I had one incredible city working with 300 people with every building and supply done.

The slow paced village life will perhaps lull you into a false sense of security before disaster strikes. It could be considered a difficult game as, though on the surface it is simple, the micromanagement - which is a key part of the game - is sometimes hard to manage. Despite the fact that I enjoy Banished very much, I give it only a six out of ten because it can sometimes get boring. Once you have a knack for the game there is little left to do than watch your village just carry on life as usual. I&apos;m not sure how it would be incorporated, but the lack of multiplayer is disappointing as this is, in my opinion, an important feature of games today. Additionally, the absence of an endgame can make playing Banished feel rather pointless and times, though not having a set objective might be considered a good thing for some. For those who like action games, Banished is not for you, however, city-builder fans should enjoy Banished immensely.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=4211645">Expand</a></span>

Though it lacks depth, and soon you&apos;ll realize you&apos;ve built every single construction the game offers, and there is nothing left but expanding in the same fashion... The graphics are nice, the technical requirements are very very forgiving, and I hope a sequel comes out soon... But this original game ends up being repetitive very fast.</span>

It&apos;s not SimCity, CotN, CivCity Rome, Caesar, Emperor, Anno, Cities XL or any other number of builders. It&apos;s not meant to be. Banished is a rather simple premise executed beautifully but without embellishment. It is simply about growing and sustaining a viable village. Not a town, a city, an empire or a dynasty. It&apos;s just about keeping a nondescript village going and in that it succeeds totally. I love the pace and game environment not because it is simple but because it is focused and it is challenging. My first village in Banished failed. It was the first time that I can remember ever losing a town in any city builder and I&apos;ve been playing them since the original SimCity. I was delighted.
<br>
<br>Now I didn&apos;t see in any previews that suggested anything different or more than what I got in the game. What it doesn&apos;t do is have talent/building trees or progression - but then again a small rural village in the 1700s or 1800s wouldn&apos;t expect to progress much from a technology standpoint. It doesn&apos;t have monuments, castles, combat or beautification projects. Are these limiting factors? Yes and they could have been included but they&apos;re not necessary for the core game to succeed. I wouldn&apos;t mind DLC or mods that include larger construction projects or the ability to create flower beds and other beautification projects. I think we&apos;ll see those things and I think that may make the game feel more &quot;complete&quot; for some people.
<br>
<br>Personally, I like the game for what it is. I find it relaxing but challenging and I enjoy seeing my little hamlet survive and grow and perhaps even eventually thrive. It also reminds me of a different era of gaming, where resource limitations required games to stay focused on their subject matter without becoming bloated. To me, Banished has a soul unlike some modern city-builders (Cities XL I&apos;m looking right at you) and that makes all the difference.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=4010980">Expand</a></span>

<br>This has become yet another genre that hasn&apos;t been getting much competition, though.  Compare it to what,  Sim City?  Well, all other considerations aside, it still blows that game out of the water, but that&apos;s not saying much.

<br>It does lack scope, though.  It would be nice if it had another dimension or two, such as technological advancement, or competing neighbors.  Or even customizable aesthetics. The game does get tiresome, once I got the hang of it, even on the hardest settings.
<br>
<br>Still, I enjoyed the hell out of enough hours to more than justify the $20 cost.  So, I do highly recommend it to fans of this sort of game.  For what it does, it does it exceptionally well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=4007582">Expand</a></span>

Some people might not like the fact that there are no real goals in the game, but personally I prefer it this way. No constant pestering about what you should do, but figuring out yourself what you to do next in order to make your people happy and the town prosper.</span>

However, in the end the game starts throwing random negative events like fires and diseases, destroying the awesomeness you&apos;ve built.
<br>
<br>The good:
<br>- pretty difficult
<br>- many interesting mechanics which all depend on each other and work pretty well together
<br>
<br>The so-so:
<br>- graphics are 3D and look ok, but most buildings have very similar roofs which makes it a bit hard to distinguish them from each other
<br>- the game is all about hardship and endurance, but such things aren&apos;t fun in real life, so in the game they bore you after a while. The game would definitely benefit if there was at least some humor, or maybe an advisor/companion. Some human touch. Or maybe a little story, or the main character who led this banished group. As it is, it feels somewhat anonymous and mechanical.
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>- if you make a mistake or some random crap happens, or you didn&apos;t know some rule - you are screwed. It will take 10 or more in-game years until you recover. In my case the only &quot;educated teacher&quot; died from old age, there was no laborer available to take his place, and all students stopped their training. And after that the game would randomly re-sort villagers, covertly appointing a non-educated one on important roles like blacksmith or teacher although I made sure an educated one was on that role! The non-educated blacksmith couldn&apos;t renew the tools for everyone fast enough, and uneducated farmers without tools couldn&apos;t produce wheat etc etc. By the time I finally sorted that out I didn&apos;t care anymore for the villagers dying and just kept speeding up the game as the whole system slowly corrected itself across years.
<br>- as the village grows, the slow movement speed of the villagers becomes the main factor which hinders further development. A villager can spend 3 in-game months or even more on just running from one side of the map to the other, and by that time his task may become obsolete. An action like chopping a tree takes a second, but the villager will spend a minute running to that tree, and then another minute running back.
<br>- pathfinding seems to ignore roads. The villagers run in diagonal paths, ignoring roads - so why even build roads?
<br>- the music gets very repetitive, need more tracks
<br>- there is no goal (maybe just achievements), so after playing for a while you will just turn the game off because you will get fed up. You will fill the whole map with buildings and there will be nothing left to do, and there won&apos;t be any sense of accomplishment because the game is still running, and still tortures you with random destruction.
<br>- there is no way you can send a specific villager to a specific task. There is a clumsy &quot;increase priority&quot; dragbox which works in an arcane manner and never tells you which villagers will now go do this, if at all. Prioritizing commands doesn&apos;t work well which leaves you feeling powerless in front of a gigantic simulation which mostly runs by itself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=5869012">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The gameplay is beautifully balanced and really rewards intelligent planning. There are no hidden mechanisms behind the town&apos;s operation, instead you can see every single resource moving around, and every single citizen doing their part. It reminds me a little of Tropico in that respect.
<br>
<br>The complaint that you get a &apos;world without end&apos; and &apos;no scenarios or achievements&apos; is in my view very short sighted. It is a very interesting challenge just to get all the basics up and running and even then the great thing about the game is how fine tuned it is. If you imbalance the town by growing too quickly or neglecting a certain type of resource then you can find yourself in difficulty. There are also occasional disasters to keep you on your toes and force you to react and rebalance.
<br>
<br>And after all that, without having exceptional graphics, the game somehow has a very pleasing look to it that really rewards aesthetic planning.
<br>
<br>Thoroughly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=4106496">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>However don&apos;t be fooled by this game&apos;s city building genre like other games such as the SimCity franchise and the Anno series, this game is more of a survival, village/town building strategy game where you&apos;re main focus is trying to maintain a small village of people while trying to survive starvation, diseases, natural disasters and fires, and don&apos;t think this game is a walk in the park unlike other games mentioned, this game is challenging even on Easy difficulty! This game is not for people who like city building games where you manage a whole city and not every single individual like in Banished.
<br>
<br>The graphics are simple but this is of course a strategy game and graphics are not really the main focus in this type of genre, I would however congratulate on the water and rain/snow effects, they are really well done and it becomes even more immerse. The soundtrack, although very repetitive, you will be more immersed by the sound effects of you&apos;re town/village coming to life more than just the music.
<br>
<br>The AI, the villagers AI is a bit stupid at some points, for example, an outbreak of some disease broke out and the people that were infected were right next to a hospital but instead they walked over a bridge I built and then went back to the hospital to get cured, and thanks to that, a few more villagers got sick as well! The AI is not the best AI I&apos;ve seen in a strategy game.
<br>
<br>Although the game is fun and challenging, I still feel that the game is still a bit empty, there is not a lot of stuff to do, no more natural disasters such as earthquakes etc... just tornadoes! And even though there is immigration from the Nomads, there is no invasions from other neighboring towns/villages, no wars unlike games such as the Civilization series! Plus sadly there is no Multiplayer/Co-Op in the game, so if you wanted to play this with you&apos;re friends such as the new SimCity game, this is not the game for you!
<br>
<br>The game is a mixed bag for some, although I love this game and has really pulled me in into playing more and more, it may not be enough for some people, especially with some of the &quot;missing features&quot; the game does not include or the level of challenge/difficulty which may put some people off. It is still a great game to play, especially if you like Strategy and the city building genre like me and you would like to play something different!
<br>
<br>The game does support Steam Workshop and some Workshop items do make the game a bit better. I am a bit upset however that the developer hasn&apos;t done as many updates as I intended, I can understand that he is just one man who developed this fantastic game, but a bit more updates would make it a bit better!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=5338183">Expand</a></span>

<br>However what keeps this game from a perfect score is it&apos;s endgame potential. Once you have covered the whole map and can&apos;t build anymore you are daunted with the fact that you have nothing left to accomplish. All you can do is start again?
<br>
<br>To improve the game I would like to see more game modes and different styled maps to make the game a little bit more re-playable. The potential is there for this to be a top tier sandbox game and I really hope it gets there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=4527380">Expand</a></span>

After you learn how to grow enough food, all you do is expand your settlement. Once in a while, a trader arrives, and once you get your chickens, sheep and cows, there isn&apos;t really that much excitement about the trader anymore.
<br>
<br>It does not seem like villagers have any particular skill focus, the same guy can be a woodcutter one day, a farmer another day. This is important because of the route villagers take to their job site from the houses. Unfortunately this also means that if you have a large agricultural population, you have to reshuffle your population every year once the harvest is done. In the course of doing so, it&apos;s possible to end up with a population that has to go all the way across the map to their job site. Fixing this gets tedious and kinda boring after a while.
<br>
<br>Overall, an OK city builder, although Tropico 4 is so much better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=4146627">Expand</a></span>

It has a very low learning curve and great game mechanic the keeps the game interesting.  Designing and managing the city requires planning, expanding the quickly and you will find yourself in trouble.  Graphics and Sounds are simplistic and yet provide a great backdrop for the game.  Re-playability is decent as it is a sandbox structure with randomly generated map.  At the moment of this review, it has minimal structures and their functions.  The game plays simple but it has a great potential to expand into more depth and scope.  For one guy who developed the game, it is definitely a 10 that beats all the other big-name title out of the water.  Highly recommend!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=3986996">Expand</a></span>

<br>I would recommend this game to anyone who likes the city building genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=3977986">Expand</a></span>

<br>There&apos;s no campaign, a very limited set of buildings... you&apos;ll be doing the same stuff over and over, I feel like I have nothing to look forward to... the only hard thing to get is some special items from merchants, like seeds and animals, but that&apos;s it.
<br>
<br>Infact, my desire of playing this game decreased rapidly in just a few days, now I barely touch it anymore, and kinda regret spending 19&#x20AC; for it.

<br>
<br>The base of the game is actually very solid. It looks nice, has the spice of a few random events which might or might not happen and the mechanics are pretty neat in general.
<br>
<br>However, once the player has gotten a feeling for a good balance for a settlement, the game is just way too easy and simple. Whether your settlement has 30 or 500 settlers, keep roughly the same percentage of them occupied with food production, don&apos;t forget to build houses every now and then and your village will grow and prosper. There is no enemy to fight and no competitor for space and resources. It does not help that there is no sense of progression at all after a short while. Every single building one can build is available from the start and there are no settler, city or building tiers. You will probably have built everything the game has to it within the first 50 years of your settlement. The natural disasters like diseases or a tornado are so random that you might go dozens of years without anything happening or have your people wiped out within five minutes into the game.
<br>
<br>The economy is not complex at all. There is nearly no production chain. It does not get any more complicated than Iron + Logs + Coal -&gt; Steel Tool. Yes, that is actually the most complicated ware in the game. The only other processing goods you have is Logs -&gt; Firewood, Wool + Leather -&gt; Warm Coat and finally seven different foods (pick one of them) -&gt; alcohol. And that is all. All the other resources are fine for use without any processing. Wheat or corn for example seem to be eaten raw only. There is no mill or bakery for bread.
<br>
<br>The game has a very solid base to build on in the future and since modability is supposedly coming as a feature in a future update, the modding community might very well make this as much as a long-term fun as it is when only having played a upstarting settlement. But in its current form, without regarding the size of the 1-person-development-team and just seeing the game as a game, it is sadly only that: a solid base that needs to be built upon to actually make it worth the 20$ it asks for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=3986992">Expand</a></span>

Big game developers seem to have forgotten this genre (apart from the ill fated SimCity franchise) and it&apos;s such a shame. There is so much joy in balancing food production with food consumption and seeing your people happy. This one isn&apos;t easy - although the first few tries it&apos;s worth starting on easy mode - but it&apos;s challenging enough that, if your economy collapses, you will be eager to try again and put in place what you learnt :)
<br>I really like that you can place buildings then stick them on PAUSE - thus giving you a simple way to plan out your town for optimum production. Well done to SHINING ROCK - mods are already being spoken of on the forums, and I think that&apos;s a sign the game will still be entertaining me in years to come.

This game just sucks you in and keeps you there. It&apos;s hard, unforgiving, relentless and cruel but it&apos;s enjoyable, rewarding, entertaining and engaging too! After 6 winters I think I finally have the hang of food distribution and keeping people healthy and alive. Sure a person dies here or there, but it&apos;s almost always from old age. Finding a good balance takes time, but it&apos;s completely doable. Now I just need some fruit for my Tavern. :D
<br>
<br>When you buy this game don&apos;t expect to do well your first time through and USE the tutorial. It&apos;s not too long and it&apos;s really helpful. Don&apos;t get too attached to your first villagers as they will most likely die from starvation or cold.
<br>
<br>Great game; amazing even. I plan to spend another 4 hours on it after work tonight too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=3977452">Expand</a></span>

<br>Well it&apos;s now been 24 hours since I purchased the game and I`m sitting at 17 hours played. This game really makes you think about every decision, i&apos;m constantly having to find the right balance between food, wood and other resources. If you don&apos;t have a perfect strategy, YOUR VILLAGE WILL DIE, simple as that.
<br>
<br>Despite all of the good, I have encountered a few glitches which have forced me to reload my save a time or two. (villagers refusing to plant crops in one of my fields for no reason) I`m sure these few glitches will be fixed in time though.
<br>
<br>Overall a great game and probably the best impulse buy I&apos;ve ever made!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=3979432">Expand</a></span>

You start off with a handful of ragged outcasts thrust into the wilderness with a mission of building your own civilization from the landscape.  Because of its small scope, Banished is also much more personable than more robust city builders; instead of managing multiple cities or even a nation, you start with four to six families and grow to a few hundred people (or more, depending on how long you wish to play a map). This isolation combined with little charming touches, like knowing each citizen&apos;s personal info, excellent ambient sound design, and a slower paced game speed, makes Banished the most atmospheric fictional city builder I have played.
<br>
<br>Although there is a rough &quot;progression&quot; to what you can build via resource requirements, any building can be built at any time depending on what your city needs. Real strategy comes in properly timing and planning your construction; While Banished is a pretty laid-back game, a sudden influx of nomads can bring diseases or cause starvation if your city isn&apos;t prepared and construction takes significant manpower and cross-profession coordination. This flexibility can be overwhelming for a new player trying to survive their first winter but thankfully Banished&apos;s tutorials are well constructed and actually worth playing through even for veterans. Your city&apos;s growth (and essentially the game&apos;s difficulty) is tied to how much or how little you want to build, leading to a more relaxed game than most city builders.
<br>
<br>Even though I loved most of this game, I spent a lot of time fighting with the villager&apos;s AI. While Banished strictly doesn&apos;t have win/lose conditions, it is heart-breaking to watch your citizens die from starvation while they are harvesting crops or gathering fish. Other AI issues emerge much earlier in the game, like farmers acting like laborers and not tending their fields during the summer. Laborers also seem to act erratically; when you assign multiple removal tasks, they seem to work in arbitary priority. Constructing multiple buildings is a huge pain with trying to coordinate the laborers with the builders; I eventually resorted to laying down a &quot;building plan&quot; and mass-pausing construction, unpausing one building at a time to be built. Maybe I don&apos;t understand all the intracies of the AI but 50 hours in and I&apos;m still frustrated and often resorting to using the &quot;Increase Priority&quot; tool.
<br>
<br>Banished is also missing many things that add challenge and depth to other city builders. This is essentially the &quot;kiddie pool&quot; of city builders with no crime, polution, budget balancing/taxation, or non-essential buildings. With 31 construction options, everything you build is for managing food, housing or supplying citizens, or transportation needs. There are some minor trading elements but its mostly there to keep your city growing once you run out of certain resources. Once you have a stable city running all there is to do is make it bigger while avoiding starvation or disasters. The same could be said of many games but I always look forward to building a sports stadium in SimCity... here it feels like it&apos;s just food, food, and more food.
<br>
<br>If you haven&apos;t played a city builder before, Banished is a great place to start. Veterans looking for a more laid-back experience will get a few dozen hours out of this while alt+tabbed with something else. Nothing here is groundbreaking but what there is is a great change of pace from playing certain other sims at Cheetah speed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=4999816">Expand</a></span>

Get beyond the need for simple food and shelter and your settlement can start to grow and you find yourself in a relaxing well-made village builder. Once you start playing it has that, just one more year, quality that keeps you sat at the PC engrossed as the hours fly by.
<br>
<br>However, a week on I find myself with little incentive to replay. As the game currently lacks any higher goals or real sense of progression once you have a viable settlement.
<br>
<br>While I&#x2019;m hugely impressed this all came from one person I feel the game needs more depth. In its current form it has too little replayablity. As a foundation to add greater depth you could not ask for better than this, and I hope in time the dev and modders flesh out the game.  I am glad I purchased, but I will now be taking a long pause until the game gets built upon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=3992478">Expand</a></span>

I am giving this a higher score since it was made by one guy and that is very impressive. Anyways gameplay wise this game is pretty easy on medium difficulty the only reasons why i lost the first two times is because i forgot to build more houses so there&apos;s more room for population growth rather than watching my entire city die by old age. If you ever need resources you can just grab from nature and I suggest do it in huge chunks this is because trees take time to come back so you might as well grab a surplus for when it grows back. The only nitpick I have about this game is that after you gain all the buildings and a pop of over 200 there is honestly nothing else to do. Since the city can function autonomously it&apos;s basically staring at an ant farm if you ever reach this point. Other than that my tips for playing this game is Harvest all crops in late summer if you do not have many farmers or else winter will take the crops I lost 10-12 people from starvation for not doing that. Make sure to cut down large areas and not small amounts to ensure there is a surplus in your stores to survive the winter. and most of all as your first domestic animal get sheep they breed quick and give a lot of wool with a max size pasture you will have so many warm coats and wool that you can trade for anything else needed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=3988830">Expand</a></span>

<br>My only criticism is that though the level is &apos;randomly&quot; generated, it doesn&apos;t really affect how you build- just slightly the location. I propose more varied terrain, better elevation and things like desert or maybe tundra. waterfalls, etc. This stops it being a 10 because after 6 or 7 attempts game can get repetitive, particularly if you looked up build order on the wiki.

<br>
<br>Very nice balance of design freedom and challenge.  The game masters a less-is-more system, from its mechanics to its graphical presentation.  Much like the old Settlers series, you want to take it slow and watch closely while you are learning how to play.  Much of the game is in discovering the nuances of the resource system and then min-maxing your way to a booming economy.
<br>
<br>I really appreciate how the game&apos;s most valuable resource is actually &quot;people&quot;.  Keeping your villagers healthy, happy, and productive is far more important than stockpiling goods.  As each citizen has his/her own name, occupation, and family, I found myself attached to a few here and there, following them around on their activities...perhaps with a bit of sadness over time, as the toddler I remember playing dangerously close to the river was now a tailor in her 60&apos;s, and likely to pass away soon.
<br>
<br>Pacing of the game is deceptively slow to start, as one tiny mistake early-on will likely spell disaster for your entire settlement.  Once you learn the basics, it doesn&apos;t take long to get a flourishing settlement up and running.  But, just like Dwarf Fortress...the more successful you are, the more likely things will go to pot in a heartbeat!  It&apos;s truly a game about seeing just how far you can push your growth until it all collapses under its own weight.
<br>
<br>Graphics are quite charming, and don&apos;t take a powerhouse PC to run well.  There is a great deal of macro detail, and big settlements really look awesome.  Terrain can be a bit redundant after a few games, however, and it would be nice if you were able to build some unique, set-piece structures to show how far you had really come.  There simply is not the bleep-ton of variety as offered by SimCity or Tropico, nor the intricate detail of the Settlers series, but what is here blends together well and creates a beautiful picture.
<br>
<br>I have a feeling Banished has already been granted a permanent spot on my hard drive.  (*Ahem.*  Excuse me!  My &quot;SSD&quot;.  Must keep up with the times...)  It might be nostalgia, but I spent many chilly days this past winter at my desk, mug of coffee in one hand, mouse in the other, guiding a handful of refugees towards a civilization of their own.  I intend to return to that place many times again in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=5072227">Expand</a></span>

Some may not like the interface . I keep a few windows open and i do fine. First time i played , it was 4 am by the time i looked up ,says a lot about how much this game sucks you in. You end up feeling about your villagers and there plight.</span>

The AI needs serious work yet and the 90&#xB0; totally square construction layout is a little annoying. The major flaw for me yet is what I call &quot;Tool Outbreak of Doom&quot;, basically, when you have more than 100 citizens and don&apos;t maintain the eyes in your iron and/or log stocks and your blacksmith stop making tools, the stock vanish and your blacksmith needs to work with a broken tool too, it makes he produces tools at a very low speed and can&apos;t keep up to the tool consumption, it causes a chain reaction lowering all your city production, food and fuel get consumed faster than can be produced and your town break. The annoying thing is, the stupid blacksmith keeps making tools but cant grab one for himself, It&apos;s serious.
<br>
<br>Otherwise the game is fun and addictive, but is not worth his value in this state yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=3986471">Expand</a></span>

Well worth the small investment in my opinion just for the mechanics of the game. I would happily play this on a 16 bit system with 2D pixilated graphics such is the depth and charatcer of the game. Well done indeed.</span>

<br>70/100: &quot;A nice change of pace for city-builders, but it loses momentum once the immediate urgency of survival goes away.&quot;

Everything seems to affect other things. I lose some people to starvation because I can&apos;t keep them fed. So I finally get that issue fixed and build up a surplus of food, then their tools start to wear out. I finally get a blacksmith shop and a blacksmith, but all the while, they cant build as fast or farm or hunt because of worn out tools, so my food runs out, I run out of coats to keep them warm because they can&apos;t hunt deer for the leather (or venison), so they freeze to death. Now I don&apos;t have enough population to spare one to be a blacksmith, because I need them to gather food.... well, you get the point. This is NOT a complaint... this is a challenging game, and well worth the $20. This runs circles around SIM CITY and those types of games. Looks simple, easy controls... but don&apos;t let that fool ya!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=3985431">Expand</a></span>

<br>Just because your 15-18 and have a false nostalgia for &quot;difficult&quot; games doesn&apos;t warrant an increased rating.
<br>
<br>This game has poor prioritization which artificially scales its difficulty.  Largely, it is not difficult, its just unforgiving when you develop without balance, which is the same for every game in the genre, you just don&apos;t have to find an earlier save game in those to dig out of the hole.  Watch your entire population throw their jobs you carefully assigned to the wind to follow a resource collection order.  Watch them freeze to death on a resource gathering death march.  Watch them walk back and forth to a granary to pick of food, not find any when they get there.  They instantly know there is more, but don&apos;t instantly know its out.  Convenient.
<br>
<br>The legitimate factors that make things difficult are easily circumvented:
<br>Early chills kill your crops before you bring them in (be sure to early harvest a few)
<br>Fauna migrate around the map making hunting hit or miss (sometimes a ridiculous hit)
<br>Crops and herds need to (sometimes) be rotated.
<br>
<br>The rest is truly just poor pathing/AI...
<br>
<br>The art is OK, winter is pretty.
<br>Time passes confusingly for a game so set on being immerse.
<br>There are names for people, but this is no Children of the Nile.
<br>There is a poor diet mechanic that is supposed to be innovative but is pretty throw away in its implementation.
<br>There is some lack luster trade.
<br>
<br>The thing it does well is climate.  So that&apos;s what your getting.  A bare bones city simulator with a thermometer.
<br>
<br>10 out of 10 best game of the year.
<br>
<br>The indie love is officially out of control.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=3983121">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Worth say that this game will be great once the modding community get their hands on it and develop new content and new structures. I&apos;m glad to see that the community is avid of city building games; after the Sim City 5 fiasco was clear that there is desire and market for them.
<br>
<br>There are some minor bad choices on how the UI works but you can pretend they are not there. Technically the game has a great performance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=3977446">Expand</a></span>

Like most games, it offers nothing truly groundbreaking, but is still a very enjoyable member of it&apos;s genre. Unlike most games, it was developed by a team of One. This one-man indie title is similar to larger company titles like Stronghold 3, with the exception that Banished is a far more polished piece of software (and it actually works the majority of the time!). Banished does seem to currently conflict with F-Secure&apos;s &quot;Deepguard&quot; product, part of their Antivirus package. It can be switched off to allow Banished to function perfectly, though this will likely be addressed by a patch sometime after the posting of this review.
<br>
<br>Overall, Banished earns a very solid 7 in my book. Banished is nothing new or exciting, but is an enjoyable re-imagining of a well-loved genre. It performs well and will offer at least a few days of entertainment, and it&apos;s relatively low price-point being comparable with a DVD or Blu-Ray makes it easy to suggest that you give it a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=3978809">Expand</a></span>

I was initially a bit hesitent to get the game after seeing some reviewers going off about how difficult/impossible the game is, but I&apos;m so glad I bought it. It&apos;s not as difficult/impossible as some reviewers would have you believe, especially if you do a little basic strategy research beforehand. With that, my FIRST town reached a population of ~450 before finally collapsing due to mistakes on my part (a massive food distribution problem during a famine). I&apos;ve started over from scratch and I expect my next town to be even bigger and better now that I understand the game mechanics better this time around. Yes, the game can be difficult and has a bit of a learning curve, but that doesn&apos;t make it as difficult/impossible as a lot of disgruntled reviewers would have you believe. (Tip: Stick to hunting/gathering/fishing early on! Only start planting crops for farming when you have a stable food supply and a surplus of food and labor! This is almost all you need to know to get off to a good start!)
<br>
<br>If you like city-builders and you have the small amount of patience required to learn how to play the game properly, you will love it and wonder what happened to your weekend. My only criticism so far is that I would like to see some more features eventually - for example, a way to slightly alter terrain. We don&apos;t need to have the ability to move mountains, but it&apos;s annoying when you can&apos;t put down a 15x15 crop field because ONE tile inside the area is too &quot;uneven.&quot; Also, ridges that are too uneven to build roads over and too shallow to build tunnels through, yet that people are able to walk over, are annoying. It would also be fun to eventually see some new crops, livestock, jobs, resources, etc. The game is already a blast, but also has a LOT of potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=3985502">Expand</a></span>

The game is a joy from start to finish.
<br>There is only one area this game lacks in and that is replay value, with a one man development, I highly doubt any DLC or many updates to the game to come thick and fast, and although I loved what he has released, the game once you have finished it has very little to do, maintaining your city once it reaches it&apos;s borders is basically just watching your population get the resources they need to keep on going. Once you get a grip on the game, there&apos;s little more you can get out of it as the challenge is figuring out what you need to do to keep them alive, once you&apos;ve figured it out it is game over.
<br>
<br>The game for all the time before that however is tremendous, and deserves a high score and high praise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=4176726">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is hard, basically you can lose a lot at any point, which is interesting and keep things spicy. However the mechanics here again means you will just fall back at an earlier point in progression, and run again the same actions once more time.
<br>With more content the game could be great. What it needs is a lot more buildings, actions, and generally possibilities which are unlocked with your progression.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=3987069">Expand</a></span>

My biggest problem is the grid system you build on. I should be able to pasture or farm slightly hilly ground but you cannot. You must build on completely flat ground with no way to have citizens level off ground,this in turn makes placement of structures tedious. Bridges have to cross windy rivers at 90 degree angles. Same for fishing docks and trade posts. Natural objects that are on the hills can be gathered and citizens move over them but you can&apos;t build on them. I want curvy roads but it cannot be done.
<br>
<br>While I like the small UI, after time the white text on gray background, becomes depressing like a data entry program. The normal AI is slow, having the simulation rate at 5x or 10x should be the exception not the norm while waiting for resources to gather and structures to be built. The graphics look nice and are similar to Age of Mythology via 2001.
<br>
<br>You have to manage citizens with a professions interface. It lets you set the number of citizens you have build, farm, herd, blacksmith, fish, etc. It is a little frustrating when it seems more simple to click on a villager and task them to do the immediate work you want done. Maybe some combo of the two could be implemented. I guess I have played too many RTS games and become too accustom to that type of game mechanic.
<br>
<br>I was under the impression that it was completely a sandbox building game. All buildings and structures are possible if you have the resources but you only have a few types of seeds and 1 livestock available on easy. While some may enjoy the reward of building up and trading for more crops,seeds and livestock I was hoping for more casual flexibility.
<br>
<br>I like the humble story of how the game was developed. It is a work of art and like all art it is just perfect for some. I can still appreciate it but in the current state it is just not for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=3990752">Expand</a></span>

It is difficult that you can start crying at any point because your villagers just die every second during the early days of Winter while the kids do nothing but walk around with their hand up their ass. The game starts all nice and easy with your villagers who will start collecting food and other resources from the land. You will build houses and feel accomplished by that but then.....WINTER comes. Winter is your worst enemy, it somehows makes your villagers crave potatoes on such a massive scale that you could feed the entire population of Africa for an entire year. Oh but not also that, somehow they can burn down through wood to make a fire faster and therefore run out faster than I can cut them!
<br>
<br>Oh, did I mention the highly likely but always happening natural disasters in this game? Did I not? Most likely because you are crying yourself to sleep since your entire village just got massacred by a tornado like a human squashing ants.
<br>
<br>Put aside the large amount of time spent crying and sweating and this game actually has some promising features such as a very smooth game with a very simple and functioning HUD that was designed to do exactly what it was meant for. The game settings are very nice as well providing lots of options when wanting to change the game&apos;s graphics or control settings or if you just want to customise your world.
<br>
<br>Another positive point about this game that I wasn&apos;t expecting was the size of the game. It is less than 300 MB where I expected at least 2GB of a download for a game like this especially with the price tag and all the screenshots I saw.
<br>
<br>The only really negative point here to make may be the price of $20 but that may be negotiable since it is still an early release and a lot of features may be coming to this game and I hope the developers will spend time on this game and make it even better because I would love to see more of my villages starving to death.
<br>
<br>If you want to spend $20 on a building/survival/strategy game made by Satan himself then this is the game for you!&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=4026269">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a very unforgiving game, and it took me a couple of tried to get a town that didn&apos;t fail after 30 minutes of me playing. It&apos;s still a very fun game, and gives me something to do when I&apos;m bored.</span>

<br>
<br>Banished is a city builder, with buildings modeled in a European Medieval style. Like other city builders I&apos;ve played, you have to worry about resources like food and building materials. Unlike other city builders I&apos;ve played, Banished is much harsher. You have to worry about pestilence, bad crops and disease. Your people can starve or freeze to death, and may slow down production if they are unhealthy or unhappy. Building houses doesn&apos;t just mean more people either. You have to wait for your families to grow have kids and grow up. And sometimes rapid expansion is more a hindrance than a boon when there isn&apos;t enough food or firewood to go around.
<br>
<br>There are some minor flaws with the game. Sometimes building things and gathering materials can seem painfully slow. And other times you can blink too long and your people are starving to death. Then you have to scramble around to keep them fed. There have been some complaints online that some of the jobs/buildings are unbalanced. However (one of my favorite features of any game) Banished can now be modded. So if there is an aspect you don&apos;t like, use the modding tool (or find someone who&apos;s already done so). There isn&apos;t any sort of fighting between clans of peoples either (only the elements) if you&apos;re into that sort of thing. I think it would be an interesting addition, but not really necessary. All and all, a great game (my favorite city builder so far)!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=4875300">Expand</a></span>

Modding it will perhaps double the enjoyment time.
<br>As others have pointed out, one main problem is that the beginning of the game is relatively challenging, but once you survive the first few cold winters, you will find that you spend the rest of your time micro-managing tiny details that have no direct impact on the outcome of the game.  Sure it is fun to see your village grow, but it feels very hollow once you realize there is no reason to grow it.  There are no other cultures or factions.  In fact there is no contact with the outside world at all with the exception of a random trader that wanders through your map with random frequency.  The game feels lonely and hollow.
<br>There are still bugs within the simulation.  On occasion you will find that you hit a choke point in your development when you HAVE to build a certain building.  You may have all the supplies, idle workers, foundation laid&#x2026; and the builders will refuse to build it.  You will watch their activities as they decide to go gather resources from the far side of the map, etc, while your village starts to wither and die because they refuse to build.  This can sometimes cause cascading problems where you can actually lose the game&#x2026; for no reason you can understand.
<br>There are some bugs with some of the population mechanics.  One year you can fill a field with 5 cows and watch as they slowly wither and die off.  A few years later you can fill the same field with 5 new cows and they suddenly reproduce up to a healthy herd of 30.  Why?  Who knows?
<br>There are only two non-renewable resources in the game &#x2013; stone and iron.  Because of this you will find yourself thinking the game should be called &#x201C;Stone and Iron Manager&#x201D; because once you get past the first survival stages almost all your time will be spent managing these two resources.  Of course most of your buildings require stone, and most of your tools and production houses require iron, so the second you run out of either, you can find yourself in a negative spiral that may be difficult to recover from.  This might be all fine if it weren&#x2019;t for the fact that iron and stone are almost prohibitively expensive to mine, and to purchase from traders is based on random chance, so you feel the &#x201C;luck&#x201D; requirement to the game is overly high.
<br>The trading mechanic is underwhelming to say the least.  Initially traders are exciting because they offer the key to future upgrades &#x2013; new crops and livestock.  However once you unlock these new features, you suddenly realize that the traders become less and less important.  Nothing you will do will influence which traders show up at your dock.  You might refuse to buy from one trader&#x2026; and yet he will keep returning.  You might buy out one trader&#x2019;s entire stock, and he will return no sooner or later.  As your village advances, you have more and more advanced goods to sell and your demand will shift to selling high value goods for raw materials.  The traders never change and you soon find yourself dismissing 90% of them without purchasing anything.
<br>I would have been done with this game quickly if I had not modded it, which doubled the content and added a lot of additional depth &#x2013; including some dwelling and building upgrades, decorative city options, and other features.  However it did not address the emptiness, or the feeling of &#x201C;why am I growing all of this stuff when I can&#x2019;t sell it and it serves no other purpose in the game&#x201D;?  Forget an end game.  This game even lacks a middle.  Maybe in the future, after it has been heavily modded?  Otherwise I would wait for version 2.0.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/banished/user-reviews?user_review_id=4877647">Expand</a></span>
