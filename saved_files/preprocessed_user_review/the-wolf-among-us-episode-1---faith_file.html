Without giving much away, this game features an incredbly unique world filled with interesting and often times hard to read characters and fantastic (and often times cheeky) lore. The first episode is gripping from start to finish, and truly demands some quick thinking and demanding choice making to make this adventure your own. It also talkles, in unique ways, many hard to convey themes; hopefully the series continues this trend of mature story-telling without being obscene.

<br>This is a dark and winding fantasy tale that any TellTale fan or gamer looking for something starkly refreshing should definitley give a shot; especially if you love fantastic art design, great character development and incredible worlds you want to explore deeply.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3641070">Expand</a></span>

Characters are really nice. and now you have more choices than in TWD. As for me, i liked it more than TWD, characters in Wolf are more interesting and wider.</span>

Beyond: Two Souls out-shined this, but I find The Wolf Among Us to be a much better game due to consequences actually having an impact unlike Beyond. This game keeps its style and their gameplay similar to The Walking Dead, but I find myself more intrigued by this game due to it being more interesting, by adding a dark feeling to the art, and adapting the story from Fables (A fantastic comic). Even though Walking Dead is more easy to relate to, The Wolf Among Us captures my attention better, and never fails to disappoint me (so far), where Walking Dead has at some points. I have a feeling Telltale learned from some criticism about Walking Dead, and improved it in The Wolf Among Us. That is why I have a feeling that The Wolf Among Us will surpass its predecessor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3643445">Expand</a></span>

The storytelling is perfect, and the characters are alive so you won&apos;t be just a spectator but will have much more feelings about game events. The graphics are well-looking, similar to The Walking Dead series. The sound and music are great, and it makes the game much better than a simple graphic novel. Can&apos;t wait for the new episodes!</span>

The team at Telltale Games took everything that was right with the walking dead and then Improved on it. Sure it is in ways a visual novel and your only involvement in the story are QTE&apos;s, but they are done so well and the story carries such a pace most players won&apos;t mind it. The graphics are a bit sharper than the walking dead and it seems as though the texture quality has improved as well. They added pop-ups to the top of the screen indicating how the characters reacted to your choices and that they will remember it in the future so you know exactly where your decisions are coming into play. As far as the story goes the writers have done a unique take on tales we all know and love from when we were kids, you play as Bigby (Big B, Big Bad Wolf) who is a cop in a town full of &quot;fables&quot; characters from well...fables. Only in his town things get a little mature, don&apos;t be surprised to see lots of blood, violence, swearing, alcohol and nudity. Bigby is attempting to solve a crime when he is seemingly dragged into the criminal underworld and left to fend for himself. There may not be an emotional attachment like Clementine (Walking Dead) right off, but the story is good enough that it keeps you interested through the first episode and definitely left me wanting more. Worth every penny of the $25 price tag.

<br>TL:DR Buy the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3632691">Expand</a></span>

The Wolf Among Us sports a fresh roaster of instantly relatable characters in a colorful and stylistically brilliant graphical environment, both taken from and inspired by the Fables comic book series (which you don&apos;t need to know to enjoy the wonderfully written story). The voice acting is once again fabulous and varied, each new character offers a convincing, interesting background. Situations as well as decision making never got stale or felt unimportant. I encountered neither technical hiccups (the PC version being the definite one performance wise) nor any bugs. I finished the episode in about 2 hours, leaving me satisfied, yet wanting more. Still, you can replay it at least once, just to see what difference your decisions make in terms of story development. For fans of fantastic storytelling in video games, or a great experience in general, this is an easy buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3632769">Expand</a></span>

<br>Good work from the voice actors also. And about the gameplay well there isn&apos;t that much. I don&apos;t really mind that, i like following the story. Just easy, laying back style works for me and many others i assume. If you loved walking dead you like this one. Just buy it already, its cheap if you ask me 2-3 hours first episode. It really worth&apos;s the 4 euros (season pass: 5 episodes 20 euros  or 5 euros if you don&apos;t buy the season pass.
<br>
<br>With all this said i will give this Episode 9 of 10.
<br>
<br>story 9 out of 10.
<br>
<br>Characters i will give 9 out of 10.
<br>
<br>gameplay 8 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3644448">Expand</a></span>

The play style (adventure based QTE) and gritty story are both present with the reemergence of their decision interactions.
<br>
<br>I felt the first chapter of the Walking Dead&apos;s voice acting was pretty bad but then got significantly better with the second and later chapters.  Wolf Among Us starts off with get voice acting that draws you in and will emotionally guide you into decisions if you aren&apos;t engaged.
<br>
<br>For 25 bucks, less than half of other story-based QTE-styled adventure games (like Beyond Two Souls), you will find the first chapter of this season very enjoyable and entertaining.  Lets hope the next 4 chapters are this sticking good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3637610">Expand</a></span>

<br>The gameplay has developed and the action scenes are much smoother and fun to play this time around. This goes for most mechanics and the game feel more polished than previous titles. There is also some investigation and interrogation scenes that add variation to the gameplay.
<br>The story is unique and the familiar characters you meet all have some twist to them that makes them feel more human than they are. It is an interesting world we get to explore a small part of and I hope that it is expanded upon as the season plays out.
<br>If Telltale manages to keep the story going and the quality steady &quot;TWAU&quot; is going to be a strong contestant to &quot;TWD&quot; for the champion title. This first episode impressed me far more than the first of &quot;TWD&quot;, but it all comes down to the overall quality of the season. I, for one, am already jumping in my chair waiting for the next episode.
<br>If you liked Telltales previous titles this game is a sure thing, but it is also worth the price if you like adventure games in general or unique twists to old formulas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3630251">Expand</a></span>

Although it is early days for this marvellous piece of narrative genius, the story has a hook to it. The protagonist, Sheriff Bigby, formerly known as the Big Bad Wolf, is now in charge of keeping numerous fable characters from each other&apos;s throats. He can be a likeable character, who&apos;s just misunderstood by the community of Fables that surrounds him. Or he can live up to his name and be cold and ruthless. He is, in a sense, a canvas that has little known back story for the purpose of the player being able to create their own protagonist.
<br>
<br>Elements of Telltale&apos;s brilliant Walking Dead Game are on display in this new adventure. Choice and consequence, characters responding to what you do (or don&apos;t) say, same basic game play mechanics. However there are some nice touches to compliment the noire style game they have created. The art is already much darker, neon lights and a slick 80s style score give this the perfect feel of a New York murder thriller. Fights are now much more engaging. Having the player aim for a specific spot to land a blow in the heat of a fight would make anyone in their right mind tense up and feel under pressure. Along with this, we are also given more interaction in these sequences. Choosing whether or not to send a man flying into a sink or a bookcase adds that extra depth to the game.
<br>
<br>The world itself is beautifully designed, both physically and socially. Wandering the dark moonlit streets of New York city is a surreal experience given the fairytale touches every now and again. The characters are the crowning achievement  in this game though. Most of them are given specific and thick accents, and Telltale takes any chance to destroy the conventions of a once innocent fairy tale character. The writing is superb and the voice actors bring these characters to life. Even after spending twenty minutes with one character, you&apos;ll know exactly who they are due to you recognizing them from your youth and more than that you&apos;ll connect with them. In good or bad ways. It hurts when they are taken away from you. In a simple way of putting it, if Bigby gets mad, it&apos;s a safe bet you will. You may find yourself doing things you never would have done in the Walking Dead Game. Playing the bad guy. But in the Walking Dead you had control. In Wolf Among Us, chances are you won&apos;t care how it impacts the story you just feel as if you need to in order to satisfy yourself. It&apos;s this kind of connection that makes this game so special.
<br>
<br>Of course, like any game, there are bugs. Bugs like the frame stuttering during cut scenes or bad camera angles. But these can be forgiven as they aren&apos;t major deal breakers. All in all, the first episode of Telltales venture into fairyland has proved itself as a surprising and magical experience. There are funny times, disturbing times, sad times or times of intense rage, and they all combine into one of the best games of the year. Only time will tell if Telltale can pull this off with the rest of the season, but the first episode is an amazing beginning.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3631542">Expand</a></span>

It isn&apos;t &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, but neither should it. There are several similarities when it comes to gameplay, but both the story and the setting itself differ greatly from the tone of Kirkman&apos;s work. As something more of a mystery/detective type of game it instantly feels refreshing and different. The artwork and visuals are fantastic, especially if you&apos;re a fan of the comics, since they have an even more striking resemblance to the source material than TWD did (mostly because those comics are in black and white, of course). When it comes to story, &quot;The Wolf...&quot; delivers an interesting  plot with several twists and turns with a side order of choice and consequence. Characters are well fleshed out, for a 1st episode, and are all done justice by providing them both solid voice actors and great dialogue. Even Bigby himself sounds like the sarcastic badass he is. Oh, and the soundtrack. Yes, the soundtrack. It&apos;s great.

<br>
<br>Noir -
<br>
<br>Whether you have your 20s/30s Noir with the rain-slicked streets, heavy smoking and drinking detectives, dames in distress that walk into the private eye&apos;s door, or your late 80s counter part with the neon lights and modern descents into darkness you certainly will certainly feel the role.   This game has you traveling various areas, dealing with people in a way where you might play polite, or rough house them in some of the most violent ways imaginable.
<br>
<br>Some people had an issue with the combat in The Walking Dead, and in my opinion, that was a bit of a weak link in the series.  TWAU (The Wolf Among Us) has really been tightened up and the combat is incredibly fast and fluid. It feels precisely how it should feel.  And it&apos;s a blast.  Particularly I like how you feel like you are choreographing your own personal chaotic ballet.  I might shove somebody into a sink, or those ugly looking bookshelves.  I might even toss the bugger out a window. Why not rip a limb off? It could happen.  Visceral, bloody fun.
<br>
<br>Course you&apos;re also a detective.  You&apos;re poking around, talking to mystery women, glimpsing for clues, and exposing lies.  It&apos;s great fun.  And hopefully we will get to do more of it in the later episodes.  And of course the murder mystery that starts off is already showing plenty of layers and developing interesting characters that will have a big part to play the further you go.  And the way it goes? Well TellTale is promising that the story will big significantly impacted by choices you make. Hopefully more than The Walking Dead which did take choice into consideration, but in the end it seemed a bit of a moot point, didn&apos;t it?
<br>
<br>Fairy Tales -
<br>
<br>Perhaps you&apos;re a big fan of Grimms Fairytales or maybe ABC&apos;s Once Upon a Time.  This game is based off the Fables comic by writer Bill Willingham for DC&apos;s Vertigo line.  It depicts many characters you could be familiar with such as Bluebeard, Snow White, The Big Bad Wolf, Ichabod Crane, etc.   The game is a prequel taking 20 years before the comic.  So for fans of the comics, it is an interesting companion piece. However while the game might reward you for having some prior knowledge into the comics, I can testify to having never read the comic series before.  The game was still fun and I found the characters involved since they know each other.  You feel a certain sense of direction with Bigby Wolf (the protagonist) in that everyone is either afraid or suspicious of you.  You can either keep that going or try to soften their hearts. I suspect you can&apos;t do too much though due to the fact that there is that comic series that it has to blend into by the end.
<br>
<br>There are definitely some unique twists with the characters that you will find out too.  Definitely fairy tale characters flipped upside.
<br>
<br>The Walking Dead -
<br>
<br>I mention this only because the game is very similar.  You still have the four options for dialogue. You still have the QTEs (Quick Time Events) that predominate most of the action in the game.  The puzzles that were in the Walking Dead (some rather asinine like the one involving the train) seem to be replaced by ones that are a lot more straight forward and blend in with the detective scenario.  In other words, puzzles don&apos;t appear to get into the way.
<br>
<br>To be honest this first episode seemed to show off the combat a bit more. It seems like everyone wants a piece of the Big Bad Wolf.  Considering how tight the gameplay is for these events,  I think it makes sense.  The story is already impressive.  So fixes in the gameplay are in order.
<br>
<br>There are some that are complaining about frame rate drops.  I don&apos;t really recall seeing much of that in my game.  I did however have issues getting the game to run in Windows 8.  It seems like every TellTale game I buy seems to have that issue.  I resolved this by finding a dll file called &quot;DINPUT8.dll&quot; and copy and pasting it into the game&apos;s directory. I don&apos;t know if this is a steam related issue or not, but it promptly made the game playable.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t have any other problems with the game, but  due to the fact that the average person might freak out if they can&apos;t play the game on their computer after purchasing, I docked the game a point.  Patience, of course, and google search (or browsing the game&apos;s forum on steam) will provide help but it seems odd to me that an important dll file would be missing.  Kinda breaks the game you know?
<br>
<br>Art style is crisp and is a much better representation of a graphic novel than the Walking Dead. Music is spot on.  If you like the three aforementioned points, I suggest you buy the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3630447">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game itself is simply great. I have a 5 years old laptop, running on minimum, yet the graphics looks amazing and stylish.
<br>The humor of the game is always at the right time and right place. The first episode proved to be interesting, and from the first opening scene to the last one I couldn&apos;t stop. Finished it in one sit.
<br>And of course, the storytelling is one of the most important part in a game like this. And oh my god... you thought TWD is great? Think twice, baby.
<br>
<br>TL;DR: So far, TWAU lived up to all my expectations and even more. If they continue like this, many-many game of the year award will follow this piece of art.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3633274">Expand</a></span>

As with The Walking Dead, TellTale took what could have been a perfect 10 and threw it away by forcing the player to decide between blatantly right and blatantly wrong choices. These games were made and marketed for adults not children. The stories should play out assuming the player is an adult. Having played through the 1st Chapter twice now, making different decisions both times, I can say with 100% certainty that TellTale has once again made a game that either rewards or punishes the player based on the decisions they make as opposed to creating a story that genuinely changes based on those decisions.
<br>
<br>Remember the end of The Walking Dead when the owner of the ransacked car takes all the decisions you made during the game and crams them down your throat? Well do you remember how badly that ruined any sense of meaning or immersion the game held? The Wolf Among Us starts this process right out of the gate from chapter 1. I wont spoil anything but if you play through twice and pick different decisions for the obviously crucial choices this will become immediately evident.
<br>
<br>I was hoping for an immersive interactive story that changed and played out in different but equally as engaging ways. However what we got here is another story that plays out essentially the same no matter what decisions the player makes with more or less rewarding outcomes based on whether or not the player makes what the developers believe to be the &quot;right or wrong&quot; decisions.
<br>
<br>As an adult, I don&apos;t want &quot;right or wrong.&quot; I want different. I want genuine choice and variety. TellTale has once again failed to deliver on this and wasted so much potential. As it is, It&apos;s still not a bad game, better than average. But it&apos;s not by any means the masterpiece everyone is touting it to be.

Once again, Telltale eschews complex puzzles to focus on a mature branching narrative with awesome comic-style visuals and it works.</span>

<br>You play as bigsby wolf (the big bad wolf!) and in the night your friend calls you to investigate something in his apartment.I wont say much because its an experience to be had since you have your own choices.All the characters are well done and voice acted and all are unique.Overall despite a few things i love the game so far!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3633480">Expand</a></span>

It features mature themes in what would normally be pitched as fairytales. These fantasy beasts, known as fables, often swear, and behave in a mature manner. The story almost instantly envelops you, and you will begin to form connections with many characters. Being a sheriff, much of what you do is investigating, which is very satisfying. I found the action scenes to be satisfying as well as tense and interesting. The characters are well thought out and have distinct personalitys. You can choose how Bigby interacts with these characters, and this will change how they perceive you, possibly affecting later actions. The story is an interesting twist on your typical murder thriller and so far (only episode 1 has been released) is turning out quite well. I didn&apos;t think I would like this game at first, the fantasy genre does not appeal to me much, but keep in mind this is a game dealing with very serious and mature themes, and although one might think of this as a dumb fairytale at first, it is far darker, and deeper, than that. I really cannot say anything bad about this game, but I have yet to see whether this game delivers in the end and deserves a 10/10 later. So far, Telltale does not fail to impress us with yet another narrative masterpiece. This is definitly a must buy if you are looking for an interesting tale placed in an interesting world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3631017">Expand</a></span>

<br>Its better than The Walking Dead in EVERYTHING.
<br>
<br>The art is incredible, the graphics look better, the story and setting are incredibly original, the characters are also much better.

<br>If you enjoyed Telltale&apos;s The Walking Dead, this is a MUST BUY for you.</span>

When D&amp;D first came out in the 70&apos;s the boom in science fiction and fantasy was enormous.  This included the creation of &quot;alternate ending books&quot;   ones where you would read the story until you were faced with an important choice.  Once you made that choice the book directed you to the next set of relevant pages.
<br>
<br>As a piece of storytelling and art, this first chapter is remarkable.  Well written, dark cell shaded graphics (which is a style I love), great voice acting and wide variety of choice makes this another must play piece of art.  To view this as a game is not really appropriate.  As a piece of fiction with some limited interaction and great art its a winner.
<br>
<br>As such this will not be for everyone and certainly will catch a lot of die hard gamers by surprise as they find its not long in the game mechanics department.  As a game, reviewing it solely as a game, I would rate it a 2.  But knowing that its more about a narrative and choice and about interactive art I am easily able to rate it a 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3659625">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Rather then actually playing game to the conclusion, where, what you do from actions and speech. Has any real effects to the games final outcome. The outcome will undoubtedly be the same. As if  in any reward will only get a slightly different speech or animation throughout which doesn&apos;t effect anything., These slight differences are never of any actual consequence to this game because they will always be the same in this played out *video-game progression.

<br>It has all be done before and much better so many other games, alter, tailoring gamer choices to events and outcomes. Even a game coming from under the same brand the Walking Dead had many better choices of characters left in play from direct game event actions. But also tedious when having a naff ending and lacking in much specific difference.
<br>
<br>Puzzle games, seek and search games are wonderful. However this isn&apos;t that type of game, items often wont fit as in if you do or don&apos;t have them, they are painfully easy to find, further they are mostly of no real consequence to outcomes. Actions won&apos;t particularly effect any game play neither will most choices of speech.
<br>
<br>Somebody will argue because I tore off a creatures arm in a  programmed sequenced fight. The game is severely altered Oh no. That same armless guy is saying the same things to me in all the same places, however armless. if going to a different location this will affect a different game outcome? No! The same events will always take place, more through a lack of any actual event though. dulling wait another few months to get a different starting episode animation that won&apos;t have altered anything.
<br>
<br>Ultimately a tedious rip off selling a 1/5 of the game every  few months to get more money from the gamer, but never the entire game for any complete discounted satisfaction.
<br>
<br>Simply them playing out a story for the gamer , where personally I would rather be watching my TV or reading a book. Avoid a complete waste of time until the full version is available at a discount</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=4174588">Expand</a></span>

First off, hats off to Telltale because this is not only as good as Walking Dead but it is better in my opinion, I&apos;m a fan of Walking Dead and easily liked the characters and Telltales style of the game and how it worked was all new and great to me, but The Wolf Among Us is a world that is so intriguing to me, I found the game so enticing and couldn&apos;t stop playing (like the other Telltale games).  But this game is still a huge improvement to me, I find the story more compelling and intriguing.  I highly recommend The Wolf Among Us, I know I purchased the season pass right away because I fell in love with Walking Dead and this looked so cool. But I highly encourage people to play Telltale&apos;s games!

<br>+Solid voice acting and animation.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-has a problem story-wise (considering this is supposed to be canon) at the end, but we&apos;ll see how they rectify that as the other episodes come out.</span>

<br>I really cant say more about the episode without spoiling it so i end the story subject here.
<br>
<br>The game use quick time events for actions sequences and give you choices in talks, that will eventually lead to different paths and events but dont get so much excited cause theres a major plot that will always be followed no matter what you choose.
<br>
<br>But this is not a problem, what take your attention is the mystery,investigations and the charismatic characters, the game is directed to adult audiences and have mature subjects.
<br>
<br>If you like a well written story with investigations,a bit of action, some different paths to take and liked the walking dead series of telltale its almost impossible not to like this one</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3724572">Expand</a></span>

<br>Guys: fantastic vision, art direction, animation and everything in &quot;that&quot; department but come on, 3hrs of a well executed but ultimately linear story is nuts for that kind of price. Surely there&apos;s a better way the devs there could have done that. A sliding scale fee maybe? &#xA3;7.50/$10 for the first, &#xA3;5 for the second or something?

<br>
<br>The basic concept is very creative (fairy tale characters in the real world, trying to get by). The game plot is intriguing, with a nearly jaw-dropping cliffhanger at the end. The characters are very interesting. It was just fun seeing them interact with one another in this new world. The controls are fluid, especially in the fight scenes. The art style is amazing.
<br>
<br>Perhaps the only problem i had was the time limit in the dialogue choices. It pissed me off a little. The short length didn&apos;t bother me, since it was expected to be short. There was no room for disappointment in that aspect.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a very enjoyable game. I&apos;m definitely checking out The Walking Dead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3684362">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t think I would like it since I wasn&apos;t very hooked on the Walking Dead game but I was drawn in from the first minute with this game.  Between the great animation and the way choices affect even just this episode, I can&apos;t wait until the rest of the episodes.  Bravo to Telltale games.</span>

This game is totally different, some people call it a  movie with interactive choices. I like this concept. it worked for &quot;the walking dead&quot;. The wolf among Us, is everything &quot;the walking dead&quot; was. The graphics are stellar, smooth control of your choices/actions. Keep up the great work Telltale games!</span>

<br>
<br>I also grew with Monkey Island and the other greats at the time but I can see that what Telltale is doing is different. The game is more akin to those choose your own adventure books than to a true adventure game. And if you see it in this light then you can trully enjoy it for what it is, a great semi-interactive story.
<br>
<br>And the choices you have to make are quite good, only very rarely I felt like I couldn&apos;t choose what I wanted to choose which has been a problem even with Monkey Island. Like for instance a character gives you sob story and I wanted to say: I believe you, you can go. But I didn&apos;t get that choice which can feel constricting at times but that was really only 1 time during the episode.
<br>
<br>Overall, highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=4348683">Expand</a></span>

The character you &apos;play&apos; as is the Big Bad Wolf (Yes, the one of the fables), Lurking the streets of Fabletown trying protect its fable population. Can the past be wiped or forgotten? NO. Thus how the plot unveils itself while you search for the antagonist of the newest problem that has arisen and you must be BIG and BAD... or you might become an actual hero. Indeed, this is not 100% game, but a graphic adventure novel that abuses heavily of QTE. If you are looking for an actual game, this is not it. But if you are looking for a great &quot;TV-series&quot; in which you have some control of the story then this is a MUST. I shall look forward for new episodes for I intend to enjoy every single bit of Bigby and his temperament.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3870722">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_3672297"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I&apos;ve got to say, as hard as I am to impress- which I&apos;ll readily admit to just about anyone, The Wolf Among Us: Episode One has me fully enthralled, waiting for what happens next. Sure, I&apos;ve read a few of the Fables comics before- being the literary and motion nerd I am, but not on the same level as my obsession with The Walking Dead saga courtesy of Robert Kirkman. As with TWD however, it is not the writing that grips me, rather the circumstances of the characters. Needless to say, Telltale has done it again and made lightning strike twice with TWAU thus far- making episode one just as explosive as that of their first season of TWD. I don&apos;t know about you, but I&apos;d love to see them alternate seasons between these two universes for a few seasons or years at least. That way both worlds will remain fresh for us, and rife with content.
<br>
<br>This goes way beyond your average twisted Grimm tale however, as TWAU shares a semblance to Telltale&apos;s TWD not just in looks in some ways, but in desperation and setting as well. This tale might be even dark than cannibalism and zombies, if only just barely. And to think we tell our kids the bedtime stories this tale is essentially derived from- incredible. Speaking of curious resemblances between TWD and TWAU, it&apos;s also intriguing to note that this particular adventure also begins with a car ride- though not one from the back of a police cruiser, notably.
<br>
<br>This particular story takes on a darker tone than previous Telltale exploits right from the offset- from disorderly conduct in the form of abuse to premature decapitation. As with Larry and Lilly from TWD, there will nevertheless be characters that irk you from the start- only to presumably redeem themselves or damn themselves even more later. I could certainly name at least one that really got to me this time around, and then surprised me further in the very same episode later on. Even the Woody Woodsman himself manages to shed a tear or too for some things it seems, despite his gruff demeanor.
<br>
<br>Qualms with the linear gameplay aside, it remains true that the experience is highly enjoyable and also replayable multiple times over. Despite it&apos;s grievances, it is an excellently written narrative experience first and foremost, although it does have some enjoyable and intense gameplay as well at times. The best part of the episode is easily the pretty unpredictable plot line, and the immersing world and culture it is based around. It opens strongly and closes subtly, but not before piquing your interest enough to leave you salivating for the second episode- Smoke and Mirrors.
<br>
<br>Concept: Put the pen and paper of the Fables universe to a cinematic and enjoyable, playable experience- narrative revelations and quirky characters included.
<br>
<br>Graphics: As with TWD, Teltale really has the cell shading and art stye here down pat. No complaints here, aside from the fact that it doesn&apos;t run as smoothly on consoles as it does on computers- with notable differences in lag before fight sequences.
<br>
<br>Sound: The voice work is well done and creative, and the background music and sounds really get that noir detective vibe across- even with the flamboyant and colorful cast.
<br>
<br>Playability: While not necessarily the easiest controls to grasp at times, the contextual buttons are quite responsive to the touch amidst the action.
<br>
<br>Entertainment: Certainly more exciting at times than TWD, TWAU is on par or more advanced than that particular project- though it does not yet have the feeling that Clementine and Lee elicited from players. Maybe with time, Snow and Bigby can persuade us to think otherwise...
<br>
<br>Replay Value: High.
<br>
<br>Overall Score: 8.5
<br>
<br>Note: I loved the ending, but dang- even for a game, it was really heart wrenching. In the short time you get to meet some of the characters, as it is simply episode one, it still through me for a trip. Can&apos;t say it wasn&apos;t perfectly executed though. Telltale is at their finest in terms of drama and story, so I can&apos;t wait to see the next episode...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3672297">Expand</a></span>

The setting is beautiful, music well placed and composed. The player controlled areas are no longer tedious, like they were in the Walking Dead.

If you have played The Walking Dead you will be familiar with the choice-based gameplay system, where your decisions will influence the story. The Wolf Among Us is also based on a comic book look and it fits the game perfectly. You will take control of the main character Bigby Wolf (the big bad wolf) and investigate a case of murder, while meeting a lot of classical fable characters like Snow (White), Mr. Toad and one of the Three Little Pigs in a fictional New York. Somehow the world looks and feels like a mix of Sin City and Grimm&apos;s Fairy Tales to me. The first Episode was very exciting and ended in a way that I can&apos;t wait for the next episode. The only critic to me is that it took nearly the whole first episode to get the story started, but that&apos;s what first episodes are for and I am sure the next one will be even better. It made me damn curious about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3635792">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I was enthralled by the music and atmosphere of this beautiful game.  I am a huge fan of the sound and visual aspect of a game and this one takes the cake.  There is even starting and ending credits to this episode, something I hope to see in the following episodes.  It really does feel like a television mini series that you can control the main protagonist in.  The way the people show emotion on their face makes it clear on how they are feeling about the situations that are presented to them.  All of this combined helps build emotional ties to them and the world they live in.
<br>
<br>Normally the length of the title would warrant a score reduction but since they make it clear this is only the first episode I decided to count it for what is was.  It is a well priced ($5 in US) first chapter to what is looking to be an amazing experience.  If it continues at this price level, it should be $25 for the total amount,  If they are all the same length as the first then I&apos;d say that it&apos;s a fair price.  Even better, you can try the first chapter and if you do not like it then you can say that you only lost five dollars and not get the rest.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s action is split up very well, it will move at a slow pace at times but that makes the action parts more exciting.  I&apos;m not wanting to add any spoilers but I will say the pacing was quite good in my opinion.
<br>
<br>In the end, I decided to give it a 10 out of 10 because it did exactly what it wanted to do, I can see a lot of debates going on for how the story progressed for each individual person as they try to solve the mystery.  I get the feeling that we won&apos;t know who is right until much later, in the meantime I high recommend giving this game a look to everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3639539">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game play isn&apos;t much,but i like it,because it&apos;s like a movie,but you make the decisions that leads to another happenings.The ending is sad(i won&apos;t say more) and i can&apos;t wait until the next.
<br>I know this review is short,but the game isn&apos;t finished,so when it will be complete,i will make a better review.</span>

<br>You play as Bigby Wolf, the sheriff of a place called Fabletown. He&apos;s tasked with protecting all the &apos;fables&apos;, including classic characters such as Beauty, Beast, Snow White, with Bigby himself being the Big Bad Wolf. The plot revolves around the murder of a young woman. What makes this different than your average murder case is that the victim was decapitated and deliberately placed on the front steps to Bigby&apos;s apartment. This sparks an investigation with the aid of Snow White.
<br>As was the case with TWD, the story is strongly driven by the choices you make. There are tons of dialogue choices to be made throughout which may affect how certain characters view you, but there seem to be 2 major decisions that could greatly affect the way things play out for you in Episode 2.
<br>The middle portion of the episode is a tad bit slow, but it really picks back up for the last 25 minutes or so. The action scenes are intense and gruesome, the dialogue is extremely witty and even a bit humorous, and the murder mystery is fascinating.
<br>My only real complaint is that moving Bigby around can be a bit of a hassle whenever the camera changes angle. I often found myself getting stuck on objects that I had no business getting stuck on. However, it was never frustrating and never distracted from the experience.
<br>Episode 1 took me just over 2 hours, so for 5 bucks, It&apos;s a fair deal. I&apos;ll definitely be buying the season pass. After the truly shocking cliffhanger at the end of the episode, I&apos;ll be eagerly awaiting Episode 2! Great start to this new series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3675936">Expand</a></span>

It is nice interactive story where u can make decisions, but there very small part of the game so we cant watch right now how ur decisions will affect story.</span>

                                        <span>i thought i didn&apos;t like games like this where i have to make one choice out of many, and most of the time the game is just watching cut scenes, but &quot;the wolf among us&quot; really changed my mind. maybe it is because i normally don&apos;t play games like this, or maybe the game  is just fantastic, but i really liked it, and i&apos;m looking forward for the next episodes</span>

Also, the world of The Wolf Among Us is way better than The Walking Dead. It&apos;s incredibly original and fun to explore. Another main difference between The Walking Dead are the kind of choices you have to make. In The Walking Dead, you choose with the purpose to maximize you chances of survival, whereas in The Wolf Among Us, you do not choose to survive but to unveil the truth as fast as possible. The Walking Dead is more of a survival horror game, whereas The Wolf Among Us is a whodunit.

<br>Episode One: Faith
<br>Episode Two: Smoke and Mirrors
<br>
<br>The second episode primarily focusses on the story, there&apos;s only one combat scene and two nice plottwists. I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of scenes in this episode: you being interrogated, you interrogating/torturing, a post-mortem body examination, visiting a brothel, visiting a murder site, etc. The play time is around 2 hours, and could be longer although 10 hours (approx. 5*2) for 20 euros is actually a good deal. Still, the episodic releases do slow the game down and I think you should play all episodes after one another to really feel like you get a 10 hour game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=3958825">Expand</a></span>

It is a mature detective noir game, in spotlight with big bad wolf&apos;s dificult morale choices. I hgihly recommend playing it, like every other Telltale Game it&apos;s a hit.</span>

<br>The story, characterisation and choices are amazingly good and if you can come to terms with a game that resolves mostly around the dialogues (like for example mass effect 2 or telltale games in general) than this is definitely a game for you to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us-episode-1---faith/user-reviews?user_review_id=4144126">Expand</a></span>

It offers dark humour in places and difficult character choices, so much that you question yourself whats right and wrong and explore many different emotions. I think the next step for telltale is to offer more game play methods to really break the barrier so for that reason 9/10</span>
