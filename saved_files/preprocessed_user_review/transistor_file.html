Do yourself a favor and at least watch the trailer if you are on the edge of buying this great game. Transistor is a worthy followup to Bastion and I hope SuperGiant will keep up the great original work!</span>

I wasn&apos;t exactly sure what to expect with Transistor and while it is the spiritual successor to Bastion a lot of it is very different and everything that it borrows from Bastion is improved.
<br>
<br>The art style, music, and narration are all in the same vein as Bastion, which is to say they are a masterpiece. The artwork is very beautiful especially during cutscenes and found myself taking screen shots constantly for desktop backgrounds, etc. The music is a big part of the experience as well, and just as in Bastion, both the music and the artwork set the scene. I would not say they improved on Bastion because that would be saying Bastion was flawed in those aspects. And Bastion is more of a western feel while Transistor is very much a cyber-punk game. However, the artwork is more detailed, rich, and beautiful, probably due to the fact that this is a newer game. I also feel that the music is a bit more developed and varied. The narration is also wonderful.
<br>
<br>The gameplay has changed significantly from Bastion, so if you&apos;re expecting the fun but rather simple gameplay of Bastion, you will be pleasantly surprised. In Transistor, you only have one weapon, if you can call it that. Your weapon looks like a sword, but it is more like a computer that you can upload programs to. Those programs are your powers and you pick them up as you progress through the game. The awesome thing about these programs is that they have three different uses. You can use them as active powers, passive powers, or you can use them to alter other active powers. For example, you have an area of effect attack, and an attack that gets enemies to fight for you. You can alter the AOE attack with the conversion attack and you have an AOE attack that converts enemies. This obviously gives you an immense amount of flexibility in combat and very different gameplay styles and approaches to defeating your enemies.
<br>
<br>These programs/abilities are then socketed onto your sword, which is the Transistor of the games title. In keeping with the cyberpunk theme, your Transistor has a limited amount of RAM...each program uses different levels of RAM...some only take up one space of RAM, others take up more. Another cool thing about your Transistor is that it is the narrator for your game...I don&apos;t want to say too much because I don&apos;t want to give away the story, but it all makes sense a little while into the game.
<br>
<br>Another thing that makes the gameplay very fun is that you can pause time on the battlefield. While paused, you can move around the battlefield, and choose which powers you want to use and which enemies you want to target. This allows you to escape when surrounded, or flank your enemies (since attacks from behind do more damage). This gives the game a turn-based feel to it. It does not really feel like a hack and slash at all...you can use your powers in real-time as well, but when facing very powerful enemies, you will die very quickly when using that tactic.
<br>
<br>I have not actually died yet while playing but I have discovered another thing about the gameplay in almost doing so. When you&apos;re health bar gets to zero, you don&apos;t immediately die, you simply lose one of the programs you have socketed into your Transistor. My assumption is that you will die after you lose all four programs. This also requires you to carefully plan how you which programs you use and how you have them modified, etc. Just another thing that makes this game awesome.
<br>
<br>Finally, the story is very intriguing. You play as Red who is a famous artist and singer. Apparently, there&apos;s a group called the Camerati (sounds kind of Mafia-ish) who is angry at you for some reason and they try to kill you. They have also killed the other important people in the city you live in (called Cloudbank). That is all I can say since I don&apos;t want to give anything important away. But I can say that the story is very intriguing and every aspect of the game helps tell it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4201704">Expand</a></span>

The ride it takes you on may be short, but that&apos;s not because it&apos;s lacking in any facet. This game is an instant classic. It will stand the test of time by being a mechanically rock-solid, colorful snippet of story.
<br>
<br>The art is top-notch. The locked isometric view lends itself well to the carefully crafted backdrop vistas. While no elements are 3D, enough care has been taken in the design and visual style that it never feels like a detriment, but more of a statement. The animation of Red&apos;s &apos;flourish&apos; maneuver is particularly fluid, belying the great care taken with even the smallest details.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack is flawless. It&apos;s a full expression of everything in the game; a blending of classical vocals and classical music instruments, with techno and chiptunes. I continue listening to certain tracks to this day. It stands on it&apos;s own, and reinforces the gameplay by being so powerfully moving.
<br>
<br>The combat is dynamic. Your skillset evolves over the course of the game, and the limited options you start with form a framework that expands and empowers your character to fight stronger enemies. The quick-time system appears to be an easy-mode to let even low-skill players experience all the game has to offer, but the down-time between uses introduces a powerful risk-reward consequence for relying on it too heavily. Added to that, a set of challenge missions, and a very large amount of difficulty modifiers means players can tune the game to be extremely challenging (even so far as having consequences for removing those difficulty modifiers). There is a full second-playthough mode, and enough skill/level additions available to warrant making that leap. The game even adds more, and more difficult enemies as you play though again, but there may not be enough dynamic full-level combat elements to keep you interested for more than two playthoughs.
<br>
<br>The real longevity comes from the story. I advise anyone who hasn&apos;t beaten the game to save what I&apos;m going to say for later; SPOILERS ahead.
<br>
<br>The story is symbolic, deep, and enthralling. Unlike other games that don&apos;t hint at what might be (cough, Destiny), Transistor is so brimming with a &apos;shadowed&apos; symbolic narrative, that it can barely contain itself.  An air of mystery, suffusing a rock-solid direct sci-fi story about a girl combating a &apos;grey-goo&apos; apocalypse in a mysterious world, is enticing. It&apos;s left to the player to make the final calls on what really happened, and there is nothing more powerful than imagination. This isn&apos;t a hindrance or a copout because the game doesn&apos;t rely on the mystery, but uses it as a catalyst for intrigue.
<br>
<br>The player can easily figure out that the speaker and Red were lovers. Sybill also loved Red, and successfully had the speaker killed, possibly to get closer to Red. The speaker is never identified, and his voice changes to that of Royce briefly after a full completion. Why?
<br>
<br>The process was created to stabilize the excessive paradigm shifts of a fantastic city, but grew out of control absorbing and homogenizing everything in it&apos;s path. It&apos;s hinted that the process was already responsible for most of the fantasy elements in the city, but the Camerata had corrupted it for their own ends (creating a stable utopia powered by the greatest voices in the city, trapped in the transistor). The true questions about this are, who created the transistor (Royce was studying it, and found it to be empty)? Who truly corrupted the process, as Royce was showing signs of process sickness at the end game (despite being the architect of it, and holding it at bay while waiting for Red).
<br>
<br>Then there&apos;s the city, and the country. It&apos;s obvious that the country is both a real place, and a euphemism for death. The city is practically a eutopia, pre-collapse, and it&apos;s citizens live in peace despite the rapidly shifting reality paradigms. Is it possible that this place is a simulation, and that the inside of the transistor is yet another simulation layer? Is the real world in the transistor, and Cloudbank the simulation? Did Red truly free herself in death, but leave Royce and others trapped in the simulation, or is she really dead, along with everyone not trapped in the Transistor?
<br>
<br>There are so many questions, and thematic elements backing up many of the theories of what&apos;s really happening in Transistor. It&apos;s no stretch to believe that Red escaped the simulation of cloudbank with the assistance of an outside motivator (the speaker). It&apos;s also no stretch to believe that she joined him in death, too sad, alone, and silent to be able to live.
<br>
<br>The game is beautiful, something to be treasured. I will return to it, years from now, and find it as engaging, but possibly different than I remember. I will love it forever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4572151">Expand</a></span>

This time the player plays as &quot;Red&quot;, a singer whose voice has been stolen, aided by the &quot;Transistor&quot;, a sword-like weapon, that can absorb &quot;lost souls&quot; to gain new powers.
<br>
<br>The game is built upon a pretty isometric 2d style engine (maybe Bastion&apos;s), the graphic and the art style are, once again, polished, well defined and definitely unique. The whole world, as in Bastion, seems to be handcrafted - and maybe they are - and as you venture through the many areas, you&apos;ll have the chance to notice how small details make that game worth spending time on it.
<br>The sounds are good, music&apos;s the best part of the game&apos;s &quot;audio aspect&quot;: an original soundtrack where the vocals singer is Red herself.. smooth, chillout-like and ambient are the defining characteristics.
<br>
<br>Gameplay-wise the game relies much on its &quot;spiritual predecessor&apos;s&quot; mechanics: though this time there&apos;s no hub to navigate the world through, they chose a classic area-after-area mode, the player can upgrade the Transistor with an awesomeness of abilities and swap them using specific &quot;terminals&quot;. Abilities are known as &quot;functions&quot; (...) and they can be used as &quot;active&quot;, &quot;support&quot; and passive&quot;. The first one, let you use the function&apos;s main ability (as many as four); mid one&apos;s, let you put a function in support to another one, creating a new effect (you can have up to two support functions); the latter let you gain a passive effect that auto-activate and you can unlock four of them. You can stack as many functions as memory capacity let you have; memory can be increased leveling up and choosing to upgrade it; other options are also available, like different functions, more support slot, limiters.. what in the heck limiters are? Ever played Bastion and divined any god? Well, limiters are Transistor&apos;s shrines: they give you % xp bonus.. but also activates malus like stronger Process (main enemies AI)..
<br>
<br>Red explores the world areas in real-time though, during combat, the actual moving area is restricted; combat can be executed in real-time and/or aided by the Turn() option: she can stop time and use a combinations of moves and attacks that she will then executes in real-time, allowing for greater gameplay experience and differentiation.
<br>
<br>Honestly, as with Bastion, there&apos;s no point in looking for negative aspects  as positives&apos; more than successfully pawn cons. If you liked Bastion, want a unique adventure, a fresh take on RPG.. you definitely want to give Transistor a try. You&apos;ll love it.
<br>
<br>Overall:
<br>
<br>Graphic: 7
<br>Art: 9
<br>Sound: 7
<br>Music: 8
<br>Gameplay: 8
<br>Replay value: 8
<br>Uniqueness: 9
<br>
<br>Partial: 8
<br>
<br>The partials and so the final score are identical to Bastion&apos;s and that is soon explained: I see Transistor as a transposition of Bastion&apos;s mechanics and feats to a new world; there&apos;s no real &quot;reinventing&quot; but the story, the world, the themes.. they all are unique and different from each other.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4801907">Expand</a></span>

<br>But a very short one. Shorter than Bastion (you ll finish it in 5 hours), new game+ is not a really attractive proposition. The only real disappointment here is the story, I just couldnt care enough. While the plot was one of the fine points in Bastion, here it just feels like a wasted opportunity, as I wasnt given much background of the characters and therefore, I really couldnt care.
<br>Also the function/abilities menu could have done in a much more efficient way, way too messy the way it is, too many clicks needed.

So please keep on making games, Supergiant Games! &quot;Transistor&quot; though, alas, feels like a mixed bag. The game&apos;s composition of visuals and audio is great (you can see that in the trailers), but for me the narrative and gameplay, while having potential,  don&apos;t add up to something larger.
<br>
<br>Transistor&apos;s gameplay focuses heavily on combat, other aspects (e.g. a hub/haven where you can rest and do some challenges) fall short, granting you access to them only sporadically at rest houses along the road of battles. The combat itself gives you many skills and combinations thereof to play with, the option to pause the action and plan your moves is awesome, but tactically the encounters don&apos;t really inspire you to use all the combinations, since default attacks are just as good to prevail most of the time against the few mobs Transistor throws at you. Instead you&apos;re kinda forced to switch and use different skill-combinations because that unlocks bits of the story... yes, just like that, yes, sounds strange... it makes sense story-wise but doesn&apos;t feel fun: makes trying out different combinations a tedious work like crossing off a check list to get all them story bits. Although those story bits then only come in form of written text, i.e. entrys in an encyclopedia..
<br>
<br>Speaking of the story, you really need those bits because occurrences of &quot;true&quot; story feel rare and are convoluted. While this has worked for me before (hello, Planescape Torment) Transistor&apos;s story is so  incoherent (especially in the beginning) that for me it failed to build up enough mystery and wonder to get me involved. I.e. often it felt like running along beautiful drawn levels with just as beautiful music, doing kinda casual battles, now and then encountering a boss that should mean something to you, but somehow doesn&apos;t, and on you go... These aspects of the game ultimately made me want to finish it fast instead of taking my time to take it in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4202834">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game begins in absolutely breathtaking world. The art is incredible. The atmosphere hits you like a ten ton hammer. For a while, you&apos;ll wonder around killing few shells and processes being bit confused, but after a while the game unravels itself bit by bit.
<br>
<br>By the time i got to the first singing scene, i was already sold. Transistor is more than i expected. First 10 minutes proved that indie companies still do produce the best games out there. The person who came up with the combat must be a genius. The combat combines turn based and real time elements really cleverly. When you initiate your pause mode, music goes all eerie, which helps to boost the atmosphere.
<br>
<br>Granted. I already wanted this game when i first heard the main theme by Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett. When i first heard this tune in the game, i felt i am going to cry. The scene was so emotionally set up that it was just beautiful.
<br>
<br>This game is the creme of indie game development. It has a SUPERIOR soundtrack, extremely beautiful graphics, atmosphere like no other, and almost revolutionary combat. At the side, the story seems to require you to use your brains and nothing is spoonfed to you.
<br>
<br>Jerks are everywhere. There have been a lot of great games this year that i&apos;ve absolutely loved, but transistor so far seems to be one of the best of them.
<br>
<br>10/10. Oh my god. What a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4202231">Expand</a></span>

The developers have created a new experience and it should not be criticized for being a different style of game from their former work. The approach that the developers have taken this time have meant that this game is not for everyone.
<br>
<br>The game has amazing, well thought out music, in addition Supergiant Games have heavily improved upon the art style of Bastion by adding well implemented modern graphical effects. The game drew me in immediately as the genre greatly appeals to me, the immersion will definitely vary by the player. An understated accomplishment of the developers, is that they have managed to successfully create a second game of the same genre without repetition. The world, story and themes are vastly different from Bastion and I truly appreciate the details of the story.
<br>
<br>From what I&apos;ve seen people raise three main arguments against the game:
<br>-The story is confusing and uninspired.
<br>-Combat is unappealing.
<br>-Slow progression
<br>
<br>This time around the story is agreeably cryptic as #$^&amp; and a more human approach was taken to the narration. I would compare it to braid in the way that you are left to solve the jigsaw that is the story-line, however unlike braid you are given all the pieces. Everything in this game is explained through details in the world alongside some conclusions of your own. I understand a wide portion of the player base was distraught with the ending, (SPOILERS to theme ahead) as it wasn&apos;t directly satisfying, though if you truly investigate the world you will understand it could not have ended any other way (end of SPOILERS).
<br>
<br>I find the only legitimate argument to be made against this game is with the combat. The system is a unique integration of real time and turn based combat, the system has one issue in my opinion and that is the time while your turn ability is recharging. This just felt incredibly restrictive, an interesting trade off but definitely not justifiable in terms of good game design. The rest of the combat was still up to par as there were some interesting play style choices to be made that were well balanced.
<br>
<br>After having raised these few issues some would say that the game is only worth an 8 or 9 out of 10. However at the end of my first play-through and even in my second I was in awe of the masterful emotional reaction that Supergiant managed to evoke from me. The good aspects of this game just absolved any doubts I had on the gameplay 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4212864">Expand</a></span>

Features exist to amp up difficulty if needed.  Well worth the money - I even bought the sound track.  If you play, be sure to unlock and read the &apos;Function Data&apos; as a lot of the story hides there.</span>

I can only appreciate that the developers wanted to push their previous results and achieve something even greater. Unfortunately, while Transistor delivers a level of artistry that is equal to Bastion, it loses in every other regard.
<br>The story is too subtle and inconsistent to truly intrigue players from the get go. This despite the super soundtrack to give it life, which instead steals the spotlight entirely. Furthermore, the narration that made Bastion famous is back, but with no story to narrate. This time the narrator is part of the story, and since said story is holding itself back to create a sense of wonder, the narration has truly little to narrate, quickly becoming a nuisance to the action.
<br>Finally, the gameplay (combat), a hybrid of turn-based battle and real time action, doesn&apos;t coalesce into a unified whole because of a lack of coherence to its mechanics. While the player can control the main character freely, he usually cannot efficiently escape the enemies because of their superior range and speed. This forces the player to make use of the &quot;planning&quot; stage, which allows to perform a multitude of moves virtually instantaneously, while the enemy is helpless to react. While this mechanic balances encounters, it renders the action part of the game often futile, and misses the obvious gameplay potential of allowing players to plot and stack moves while anticipating enemy movement, since enemies are virtually stationary during its execution. Worst of all, this mechanic translates to a simple and obligatory bite&amp;run tactic for inexperienced players and, given the limited length of the game, requires a second and a third playthrough to be exploited more creatively. At that point the game has already lost most of its difficulty, however.
<br>Ultimately, all the extravagant and ambitious choices of the game turn out to be shallow, despite the developers&apos;&apos; obvious quest for depth. There is still a remarkable game to play in Transistor, but a number of frustrating flaws as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4203661">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I tried hard to think of elements to complain about, but cannot find any significant thing. All in all a rare gem, well worth the price. For me, more than a game, it is a piece of style and art. a clear 10/10 from me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4204712">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Positive: First thing you notice is the graphics/art style : beautifully done cyberpunk with very fluid motions.
<br>
<br>Mixed: The gameplay is also very interesting as an idea, but the implementation of it is somewhat shallow. Although Red has lots of abilities, named after supposed computer commands which can be combined as active commands or supporting other commands, the actual fights get really, really boring really fast, mainly because of the battle style. Very small amount of enemy types with the game being focused around constant battles make it very repetitive.
<br>
<br>Bad: The story. For an indie RPG of such minor length (5 hours until completion) to have a positive impact to the gamer, it has to at least have a mildly interesting setting/characters/scenario, something for immersion to this fictional universe. Sadly, this never happens. The whole setting almost makes zero sense,  overall it seems like something that was wholly conceived over an evening, and this comes from a sci-fi fan, Red is extremely uninteresting as a character, and the style of narration doesn&apos;t help either...as for the narrator.....
<br>
<br>Hideous: My god, this is probably the worst narrator I&apos;ll ever encounter, in any medium/irl. The narrator (transistor / the sword) has an EXTREMELY PRETENTIOUS voice and constantly makes these godawful   irrelevant remarks about everything, made me mute him the first 20 minutes in the game. Trying to be a &quot;badass&quot; by force leads to a very aesthetically unpleasant result. So, this, combined with the lackluster story makes the game seem like it&apos;s targeted to retarded 10 year-olds, which is sadly not the case at all.
<br>
<br>All in all, I wanted this to be a great game, and it indeed could have been, IF it had a decent story, more work into battles/gameplay/gameflow and of course a totally different narrator and narration style. Anything, even the voice of Goofy would be better. Jesus christ how could they release the game as it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4879824">Expand</a></span>

The soundtrack and visual design alone warrant a purchase, but an impressively deep and rewarding combat system paired with a mysterious and emotional story seal the deal. It takes some time and effort to work out the story, and some of the attacks seem much better than others, but I absolutely loved everything about the rest of it. Easily one of my all-time favourites.</span>

<br>But the game is boring, that&apos;s main drawback to me. I completed it, but barely.
<br>The sword never shuts up, he&apos;s constantly speaking, in some moments there are 2 guys commenting my every move, close to an end I stopped reading messages, couse it was quite frustrating hearing this 2 and reading at the same time, for me it&apos;s waste of time.
<br>I also didn&apos;t like the music, some probably will say that it&apos;s atmospheric, for me it was just sad music playing for 6 hours... Whole game is really sad, more or less in the middle of the plot I was just only looking forward to finishing it, it&apos;s sad, boring and makes no sense</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4991470">Expand</a></span>

But... first of all, the story never got me. I tried hard to get into it, read all the terminals and all the information about characters from the skill info&apos;s, but I just never really started to care. When you break down the activity that you&apos;re doing in this game, 90% of your time you&apos;re just going forward from one fight to another, that&apos;s it, another fight, another fight, another fight. It stopped being entertaining very soon, it got repetitive and the game doesn&apos;t have anything else to offer. On top of that the narrator (the sword) is just annoying beyond imagination, every time he started with his terrible voice I just wanted to tell him to STFU already, but he never did. I almost never had fun playing this game and even if I would, it just ends too quickly. I finished it under 5 hours, which for me was a salvation that it&apos;s over and I can move on to some other interesting titles, but for someone who likes the game, the length is another big minus. I never played Bastion, but if it&apos;s anything like this, I probably never will. What good is it that the game is unique, creative and has an amazing soundtrack when it all leads to such a boring, short and repetitive experience that does such a poor job in captivating you in it&apos;s world and in it&apos;s story. I wanted to like it, but unfortunately left very disappointed. 4/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4650682">Expand</a></span>

Yes, it was beautiful. The art, the story, the soundtrack. Everything top notch. But 3 hours of play time? Really? I&apos;ve even enabled all the limiters I got in that playthrough, but it obviously didn&apos;t slow down my progression.
<br>
<br>Now the big problem about this is: You&apos;ve finally experimented with most of the possible skill combos (MOST of them, not even all) and you feel like the story is just getting started and you&apos;ll finally understand what&apos;s happening in this weird world and then they just end it all of a sudden. The end kinda explains a lot you didn&apos;t understand before, but it comes way too early.
<br>
<br>I feel like I&apos;ve been robbed of my money because it&apos;s nowhere near what I&apos;ve expected. The fights in this game are few and there&apos;s a lot of talking and cutscenes in between. So when the game ends you&apos;ve probably had ~30 fights that were less than a minute each and feel like you just started the game because gameplay-wise nothing happened. It&apos;s basically a graphic novel with some little rpg elements in between that make up ~20% of the game. The rest is storytelling, no more. This is also what keeps me from doing another playthrough, it&apos;s just not worth it without any actual gameplay...
<br>
<br>On a side note I&apos;ve even bought the soundtrack because it&apos;s just that beautiful. But once you look behind the shiny disguise there&apos;s just no game to be played. I don&apos;t even know how to describe my feelings towards this game, because after all it is just BEAUTIFUL. But the abrupt ending combined with the feeling of &quot;yeah, finally there was a boss fight, now the game is going to get started, right?&quot; followed by the realization that this was the only and final boss fight after a meager 3 hours made me want to smash my PC screen to pieces.
<br>
<br>So after all, this is a beautiful piece of art, but really lackluster as a game. While the RPG elements are all there and have potential you never get to really use them because of the actual lack of gaming content. If you are looking for an indie graphic novel beautifully disguised as a video game look no further. But to all the serious (RPG-)gamers out there that want CONTENT, stay away!
<br>I would have enjoyed this way more than I did if it was a comic book, maybe Supergiant Games should think more about what they want to achieve and use the correct medium.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4222764">Expand</a></span>

<br>While everything looked very nice, the combat system was kinda cool,the characters were likable and i really liked that all your abilities were people(?) and that you learned more about them as you used that ability there were some flaws that were kinda hard to look past.
<br>
<br>First some of the minor ones:
<br>The controls felt kinda clumsy on PC, everything was controlled with your left hand,all the keys you used were grouped very close to each other and moving and trying to use attacks in real-time(as opposed to the pause everything wail away mode) was really clunky making it almost completely worthless.
<br>The story was really vague for the most part, I had no idea what was going on sometimes like that spine thing that was attacking you in one part, why did it affect the transistor guy? why did the Spine reappear for like one area and then went away again? Stuff like that, it felt to compressed most of the time.
<br>
<br>But the the biggest problem was by far the length of the game, I finished it in 4 hours not dying once and i did maybe half of the challenge missions on the beach.
<br>
<br>So in the end the game was nice i liked to listen to the Transistor guy talk about the world, i liked that there wasn&apos;t really a bad guy, I liked the art style and characters but in the end the game was so short and sometimes just plain confusing that it didn&apos;t really leave you with that sense of wonder when it was done
<br>
<br>It&apos;s worth playing it for the story telling but i would still say wait for it to go on sale</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4207933">Expand</a></span>

The music is fantastic and a mix of ambient songs with five vocal tracks that call back to the plot of the game itself. &#x201C;Red&#x201D; is a character of unfortunate circumstances who must piece together what happened to the city she inhabits.
<br>
<br>Combat can be done in pseudo turn-based mode, or all in real time. The mechanics of combat remain very fresh due to the skill system. Each skill can be used in its own right, or slotted into another skill to serve as an enhancement to the base skill. Therein lays the dilemma, do you use this skill as a main skill or a passive skill? There are certainly rewards for changing up your build as well.
<br>
<br>There is a sizable amount of optional content. Lore is tucked nicely in with combat skills you unlock as you progress through the game. The tutorial is there but it isn&apos;t patronizing, in fact it&#x2019;s one of the best I&#x2019;ve seen in years. Controller support is in the game as well as a native support of keyboard and mouse. The controls are responsive for the most part, some skills can require a bit more precision than Red sometimes wants to give.
<br>
<br>Transistor is easily in my top three games for 2013/2014. The whole experience is rumored to be 3-9 hours (depending upon play habits) but the retail price of $19.99 is easily far for a stunning experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4201770">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_4204577"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">From the confusing beginning, all the way until the creepy chick-flick ending, this game never felt &quot;right&quot;, not like Bastion did. By the time &quot;Red&quot; decided to suicide, an outcome I cherished since I never felt connected to her like I did with the &quot;Kid&quot;, I couldn&apos;t wait until the weird pictures stopped rolling, and then in turn, the credits, to see if there is something else; something else that was coming that could salvage what little hope I had by that point in this production. Alas, there was not. Merely a game-plus mode that would put me through the whole ordeal again. However, all is not lost. The production did contain certain aspects that made me feel my $20 wasn&apos;t a complete wash down the toilet, such as beautiful art-work, mesmerizing music, and a some-what interesting combat system. Nothing much else beside that I&apos;m afraid. The list of the things I found lacking follows below:
<br>
<br>- Extremely easy and casual that it even makes games such as Child of Light feel hardcore in comparison. I haven&apos;t died once throughout the entire game, which is a huge contrast coming from Dark Souls 2, as one can imagine. I did get over-loaded a couple of times at least. I remember Bastion becoming challenging with all Idols enabled, requiring a change in strategy to survive, not so with Transistor. Enabling 5 out of the 6 &quot;limiters&quot; I acquired through-out the game did nothing in terms of adding any meaningful challenge. It seems, to me at least, that the game was heavily tailored towards the female and casual players demographic.
<br>
<br>- Extremely short. Not the game as whole only, but even the battles in-between. One could literally finish most battles in under a minute, and often times without getting as much as a scratch in the process.
<br>
<br>- Lackluster enemies/bosses. I could swear there were only around 7-8 enemy types in the entire game, which gets &quot;leveled-up&quot; with time, instead of the game giving us new enemy types, which I must, with apologies, attribute to lazy development. If I&apos;m not mistaken, I believe there was a total of only three bosses thought-out the entire game, each being a complete cake-walk. If there was a fourth one, my bad, but they&apos;re just so forgettable. I do remember there being some sort of an umbrella in the mix somewhere.
<br>
<br>- Meaningless optional additions. The beach where you go to do challenges and practice is so meaningless and boring that I decided to skip it entirely after the third-one. The terminals you encounter throughout the game serve nothing; they could literally be completely gone and nothing would be lost or gained in terms of substance. The cut scenes where you are riding a bike, a boat and finally what I&apos;m assuming to be some sort of cloud made out from Processes, does nothing but extend the game-length for a couple of minutes. Then, there&apos;s the button that you press to make the girl hum a song and the button you press to make her jump and catch her weird, glowing sword; I&apos;m yet scratching my head to try and fathom what the point of adding all this non-sense was.
<br>
<br>- Very Interesting upgrade system, where each acquired skill could be used as an active skill, a supplement skill or a passive skill, but it is too simplistic. Bastion&apos;s upgrade system was much more cohesive. Each gun you acquired had its strengths and weaknesses against certain enemy types. In Transistor, I beat the game with the same 4 active slots I acquired at the beginning, and without giving much thought to what I put as supplements or passives.
<br>
<br>Finally, I must complement Supergiant for another artistic achievement; you have clearly put your soul and heart into this, although I feel it was transferred through the wrong medium. It might serve better if someone transfers it as a romantic sci-fi book or movie than it ever does as a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4204577">Expand</a></span>

Three hours in and the story behind this world makes little sense. The combat system is frustrating since it gives you bare minimum information on how to manipulate your skills (and even less information about switching skills). The top down view reminds the player of classic Shadowrun... without anywhere near the quality of the story. Speaking of story, when it feels like telling one at all, it&apos;s disjointed and lacks any kind of cohesion. Frankly this game feels like indie BS that&apos;s too trendy to try to tell a cohesive story or provide solid gameplay, certainly not in the same league as its predecessor, Bastion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4201604">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>On its own, it has a lot of charm. It is pretty to look at, but no matter how you package it, at the end of the day, it was a love story with sort of cool fighting mechanics. That&apos;s about it. The one thing I felt was messy about this game was its menu system. It never really explained a whole lot, so it didn&apos;t insult the intelligence of the average player, but because of this, I didn&apos;t want to bother figuring out what sorts of move combinations worked optimally.
<br>
<br>In the end, I know the makers of this game could have put more effort into things. More abilities, more end-game content, more hidden dialogue. Maybe I&apos;m just a complainer, but I felt let down after waiting so long for this game to come out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4210325">Expand</a></span>

Random lines which the Transistor gives you get really annoying because they don&apos;t contribute anything. It&apos;s a case where &apos;less is better.&apos; The way this game is unique. You could say the features of most games are unique even if they are really similar.
<br>
<br>The combat system is somewhat interesting, utilizing an unusual form of real-time with pause-on-turn. You can choose when to take a turn, you can move whenever you actually like (besides during the execution of a turn). You can take many actions or you can forgo it altogether, so the system gives you a choice or flexible experience, it can be played in different ways. The issue with this system is that a turn based system has more strategy and a real-time system feels less frustrating. Because turns let you do so much, it still ends up rather spammy and there is a lot of lee-way besides when the game is not difficult, so when the game is easy, it&apos;s just a bore, the game has to always be challenging and it wasn&apos;t. I get the feeling that most people enjoyed the system just because of the execution of turns (result of actions plus eye-candy) and the fact that it was fresh or unique.
<br>
<br>The skill system is great and for people familiar with games such as Path of Exile, Diablo, it will be familiar and easy to grasp. I don&apos;t have any particular complaints about balance.
<br>
<br>The music is, well, some parts are great, sometimes the music distracts from the game. In the field at some points it gets really repetitive. If there was more minimal ambient, it would of helped the atmosphere a lot and avoid a lot of the repetition, and take out the cheap beats. The humming was actually my favourite thing, although that could of been minimized when you pause. Less is better.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, repetitive, music and sounds could of been so much better, graphics are gorgeous, story is okay but put forward well. I didn&apos;t enjoy it much and I think it is overrated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4211588">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I couldn&apos;t really enjoy the art or the music either. The visuals don&apos;t look cyberpunkish to me. They don&apos;t even look general sci-fi. The main character looks like she belongs in a Final Fantasy game, the enemies all look pretty identical, and those white-grey blocks... I don&apos;t know what they&apos;re supposed to be, but they look like candles to me. And the music doesn&apos;t fit the sci-fi theme either. It just sounds... romantic.
<br>
<br>Also, nothing was ever explained. I was thrust into a confusing special abilities menu and had to figure out how on Earth to equip them and so on.
<br>
<br>I can see why some people would enjoy this game, but it&apos;s most certainly not for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=5329081">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I still don&apos;t quite understand what was happening in this game, despite being almost at the end on my second play through. When someone other than the &quot;sword&quot; speaks it is typically a boring monotone speech. It&apos;s almost emotionless, I haven&apos;t been so bored by voice acting in a while. On the plus side, the narrater &quot;sword&quot; voice is far more interesting and pretty much saves the whole story. The antagonists are boring emotionless **** while the enemies are colorless drones, but fortunately the major speaking character has emotion, there&apos;s something to get invested in.
<br>
<br>However like I said, I don&apos;t care much about the story. I enjoyed this game for the combat. This game gives you the ability to pause time and plan out a set of actions (this is called a ()turn), then when you unpause you get to watch your plan unfold. The way the soundtrack syncs up with the ()turn as you plan everything out then watch it unfold is awesome. This is one of the first games where I&apos;ve felt I could control time. For that alone I can say I&apos;ve never played anything like this. I wish there was a bit more to do in the game, but I enjoyed it for what it was.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4909621">Expand</a></span>

<br>The function upgrading is great, it allows you to expand your character and combat style to suit how you wanna play. Want lots of quick killer back-stabs? GO FOR IT! Want slower bu massive AoEs? You can do that too! It&apos;s great!
<br>
<br>Also, found this out during a boss fight, when your health reaches zero, you don&apos;t die right away, instead you lose access to a function for a set period of time (a couple of access points), which means you have to adapt and use different strategies in all the fights until you can reslot your lost functions, really a clever idea.
<br>
<br>My suggestions? Use the mouse and keyboard instead of the controller. Makes using the turn system a lot more intuitive, and really feels like a proper strategic system rather than just a way to delay attacks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4205167">Expand</a></span>

Drawing comparisons to Bastion may seem unfair, though it is warranted in some sense that they do draw some similarities.
<br>One big difference however is the combat system, which I quite thoroughly enjoyed, though sceptical about the turn base mode at first. Trying out different combinations of skills and using them in various ways was something I really enjoyed. The story was just okay, and you&apos;re mostly left in the dark until late in the game.
<br>The thing that bugged me the most was the narration in this game just wasn&apos;t as good, sometimes even a bit annoying. One liners here and there wasn&apos;t welcomed at all. Furthermore the challenges in this game just wasnt  rewarding as it was in Bastion. That said, it is still a good game and a worth while experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4256923">Expand</a></span>

I thought it was quite innovative and fun enough to entertain me until the end. The art and soundtrack are also both great, but the level design was sort of bland and the random things you could find or do didn&apos;t make the game feel any less like a really long dungeon-crawl. The story is convoluted and disjointed at times, presented through extraneous terminals scattered throughout the map and a voiceover that feels like he&apos;s talking to himself, rather than the narration given in Bastion. After a while, I found myself not caring altogether; Transistor&apos;s simple story is full of rhetoric and style that is novel and cool to behold at first, but quickly grows weary when you realize its lack of substance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4210393">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- The narrator came off as a bland and diatribe. In fact, the voice acting of all characters was really lifeless. I realize the city is rotten and dying, but having a lifeless narrator destroys the game.
<br>
<br>- Red&apos;s singing doesn&apos;t match the background music. More importantly, the soundtrack doesn&apos;t match the gameplay.
<br>
<br>- The gameplay and combat system were also tedious. I absolutely hated how slow my character walked around. Combat was very random and simply not enjoyable.
<br>
<br>- There&apos;s not much of a story. Whatever barebones tale Transistor attempt to tell didn&apos;t make much sense. By the end of the game, I didn&apos;t care for a single character. It wasn&apos;t like the ending of Bastion, where I was nearly heartbroken when character X dropped everything to save character Y.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=5351353">Expand</a></span>

Talking about graphic: What can i talk about, there is only one word to describe it- Artistic. Music is in my opinion the best part of this game, soundtrack is just phenomenal, and discovering new song by beating chalanges is enough for me to spend a few additional hours on listening to music and discovering the next ones. Now to the most important thing in games to me, plot. The story in game is good, it didn&apos;t sticked in to the ground but it is consistent. Characters are, well, for me they are a bit shallow, but maybe it is only my opinion. For me it is strong 8/10 And i look forward to see the next games of this studio :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4205325">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You will be confused. You will be confused as to what&apos;s happening...where you are...who you are...what you are.   You will be confused by the mechanics of the combat abilities, and as far as I&apos;m concerned, that&apos;s perfect.  The story and mechanics become more apparent as you play further into the game, and this no-hand-holding-approach to Transistor&apos;s design make it all the more engrossing. Your understanding and revelation become an experience. Wanting to understand more drives you to keep the experience going.
<br>This game isn&apos;t just beautiful. It is curious...it inspires curiosity.   Once you understand the weapons system it goes from  confusing to interesting to absolutely brilliant.
<br>
<br>The only flaw in this game is that there isn&apos;t more of it.  Immediately after finishing the game, without moving an inch, I began it all over again, and I had to force myself to stop. I can&apos;t wait to play it again, and again and again and again.
<br>
<br>An absolutely tremendous accomplishment for a team of only 10 people. Simply wonderful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4219831">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Artistic direction: Beautiful
<br>Soundtrack: Sublime
<br>
<br>Story: Lacking
<br>Explanation....
<br>From the get go you are dropped into a world you don&apos;t understand and that doesn&apos;t change at any point of the narrative. It was like reading a Greg Bear sci-fi novel. Nothing is explained. I don&apos;t know if we were all living in a computer or if the process invaded the &quot;real&quot; world. I&apos;m a programmer by trade and all the references and terminology were endearing but by no means coherent. It is baffling, and downright depressing at times, which I suppose is good, it got an emotional reaction out of me so that&apos;s not a complete loss...
<br>
<br>Gameplay: Lacking
<br>Explanation...
<br>Missed the boat here... Hate to compare, but bastion had it all. A dodge and block mechanic made enemy offense avoidable but not balance breakingly so. In transistor there are issues... I&apos;ll elaborate
<br>
<br>Enemies with tractor beams make it impossible to stay in the regular action mode, you will just be pulled in and forced to take hits to the face. Planning mode is forced on you. Which wouldn&apos;t be so bad if it didn&apos;t preclude you from your attacks or dodge mechanics until it recharged again.
<br>
<br>Jerks and Fetchs are faster than you and you are guaranteed to take damage from them if they target you. Planning mode is your way out but once again you are precluded from attacks and dodge mechanics.
<br>
<br>That is to say if you&apos;ve CHOSEN to have a dodge mechanic in your lineup which takes an attack slot.
<br>
<br>Another thing is that some combinations that you can make are woefully lacking compared to others, I don&apos;t know how I&apos;d complete the endgame with my original choices, I likely would&apos;ve quit the game. Comparatively running around jaunting and voiding enemies before mask backstabbing them makes planning mode a guaranteed kill in one turn even on Jerks!
<br>
<br>After all this the length is rather disagreeable with what my wallet spent. I&apos;ve gotten more bang for my buck out of FPS games with single player only. 4 hours is not satisfying.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m tempted to rate a 1 just to try and bring the user score down. But it is not a 1 just a flawed experience. Balance could be better, but length is the biggest upsetting factor. I don&apos;t feel it is worth $20 unless I get the soundtrack :P That is worth $20 alone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4299259">Expand</a></span>

Its won the Game of the year award in 2011 and 100 more others to count on , the makers SUPERGIANT ,have added another to their list called the &#x201C;Transistor&#x201D; . Transistor as I would call it,is a Game Musical.A Top-down isometric view game which comprises of mix of real-time and turn-based combat.
<br>
<br>transistor
<br>
<br>Red is a lounge singer in Cloudbank City who is attacked one night by a mysterious organization called the Process. Red loses her voice and awakens next to a dead man impaled with a talking sword. This sword is  the &#x201C;Transistor&#x201C;, which speaks to her as she travels and seems to know her very well. At the same time, strange creatures are infesting the city and attacking anyone they find, and Red has to battle through them with hopes of stopping the Process
<br>
<br>Much of Transistor&#x2018;s plot is told organically as you play, but a great deal of the narrative context is reserved for text character biographies which unlock as you progress. Red&#x2019;s sword is the primary Transistor features a constant story telling from Red&#x2019;s sword and offers a lot of  play-by-play commentary.Red communicates through text in a few instances and has expressive animations.
<br>
<br>When it comes to gameplay. Red can use one of four powers in real time, or she can enter turn mode&#x2014;time freezes and she can plan out her next actions. However, Red can&#x2019;t use any offensive abilities for a short period after her turn ends, forcing one to be extremely strategic when using it.
<br>
<br>In addition, Red has many different sets of abilities and upgrades that give the player many possible builds to work with. Each new ability can be used as an active primary action, used as an upgrade for an existing action, or be used in a passive slot to gain things like health regeneration or more actions per turn. All manner of play-styles are supported, making the game extremely adaptable to personal preference.
<br>
<br>transistor 2An impressive selection of enemies maintains a steady challenge curve throughout Red&#x2019;s journey. The insidious Process take many forms, and each attacks and defends in its own way. One might fling out grenade-like area attacks, while another hides in a corner projecting an energy shield onto an ally. Even as one enemy charges headlong toward you, another hangs back and remains phased out and impervious to damage until you come within line of sight. Each battle becomes a puzzle, and the solution lies in which enemies to hit first, and what powers will best do the job.
<br>
<br>The artwork is absolutely gorgeous,along with the soundtrack, Transistor&#x2018;s aesthetics deserve every bit of credit that&#x2019;s been given to them. In between fights, there&#x2019;s plenty of time to enjoy the gorgeous surroundings. Lush color brings life to the computerized cityscape of Cloudbank, while brief still-life cut scenes help push the story forward. A striking soundtrack combines jazz and electronica to great effect.

<br>While I have passed very little time on Bastion , and a lot of comparison happening between the two , I would find the game not very disappointing. Though,players looking to find all the answers by the time the credits are likely to be disappointed. Transistor is as much about what is left unsaid as what is explained. But what made me fall in love with the game is the soundtrack which works extremely well   in context with the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4263922">Expand</a></span>

<br>I dislike:
<br>The lack of variety in combat ( There are just 5-6 creatures-robots in whole game. You just fight with updated versions of these creatures which makes fights very repetitive and boring after some time)
<br>Short game-play time (3-4 hours max)
<br>Shallow character development (Well, you do not have a chance to randomize-choose the character because of the scenario. This is something understandable from my side and do not disturb me much. But level development and character development are awful. After each level, you have to choose a power from 2-3 alternatives that was given by game. There are powerful and necessary skills in the game like &quot;MASK&quot;, so your only customization chance is by using powers as upgrades. I think that %90 people that finished the game, more or less use same powers and have %90 similar end-game characters. If you use limitations your alternatives will be less.
<br>
<br>A good game but needs development. I will gladly wait and play future games of SUPERGIANT:</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4405661">Expand</a></span>

<br>Music: 10/10   Amazing tracks, the girl&apos;s vocals (when you hear them)  is perfect. From the drum n&apos; bass track to the jazzier stuff.. all very atmospheric and enjoyable.
<br>Art: 10/10    This game is freaking beautiful. The watercolor effect looks so good.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: 6/10    I wanted to like it more than i did. So they describe it as an innovative part action/ part turn based game. I thought it was cool that they tried to integrate both styles. But when playing the game, I found using your &quot;turn()&quot; was pretty necessary, as attacks have a significant start-up time and allowing you to freeze and plan out your actions not only works around that but you can set yourself up for backstabs  or line up multiple enemies. When you use your turn(), there is a cooldown till your next turn where you can use any attacks. So time unfreezes and you&apos;re basically in runaway mode (i usually just spam jaunt() ) till your next turn() is up.  I like and appreciate that all the functions can be interchangeable between primary, upgrade, and passive, but I usually found a few that outclassed the others. Once I got cull(), I just spammed that for offense. It got dull within the 6 hours of play time for me.
<br>
<br>Story: 3/10  I didn&apos;t get the story the first time playing through, looked it up on wikipedia.... anndd it still doesn&apos;t make sense.  You don&apos;t know who the final villain is until the last hour, and their motives/objectives are still pretty unclear.
<br>
<br>Characters:  3/10   They started with a great premise, and just didn&apos;t get much out of it. The main character, Red, is a girl who is a famous singer who gets the ability to speak taken from her. Her sword, is a companion of hers who can talk, but no longer has his body. Too bad thats about as much as you learn about them. The sword, who acts as the narrator is pretty dry, and even annoying at times. There isn&apos;t that much chemistry between red, and the sword. Red, who is now mute, could have been given so much more personality through body language but nope. The villains/ other npc&apos;s are even more unclear.

<br>I can&apos;t believe people are saying this was a beautiful love story. I get that some stories can leave space for the reader/gamer to fill in the details, but in this case, I think the story was downright confusing nonsense, without memorable characters to boot. The art+music in this game are seriously unmatched, and should be praised and appreciated, but its layered on top of a story that is utterly flat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4879857">Expand</a></span>

<br>While visually interesting (although generic and lacking in detailing), Transistor seems to reflect its very core of gameplay and narrative with its artistic styling - it seems to be all colors but no substance.
<br>
<br>The narrating manhattanesque voice is irritating in tone and frequency - it is annoying and never pauses, keeping the story superficially and evenhandedly driven on.  The story itself so far (i did not finish the game and do not intend to continue playing it) is, well - flat and one-dimensional, never trying hard to reveal characters, emotions, motivations.
<br>
<br>Was really looking forward to playing it but in the end:
<br>
<br>Meh.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6805192">Expand</a></span>

<br>

<br>Amount of abilities can be overwhelming, you will likely only use a few and never touch the rest
<br>A lot is thrown at you at the beginning of the game in terms of mechanics, it can be a bit much to take in all at once
<br>The difficulty can be a bit on the easy side, I would recommend skipping the extra missions to help fix this</span>

You can put any skill into an active slot to make it an active skill, passive slot to make it passive, or use it to upgrade another skill. The effects vary depending on the skill, for example a dash will become damaging if you upgrade it with an attack move. These are not permanent and can be changed at any point, resulting in the combat being never dull with you keep trying new things.

The only thing that keeps Transistor back is the length of game, but it is definitely worth the purchase price of $20.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4285227">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is more or less short but brings replayability in NG+ as well. The story is fantastic and has plenty of reference to programming terminology, but the designers made it in such a way that it recreates a new whole world and environment by lending some metaphores from the computing into a fantasy world.
<br>
<br>This also translates into combat, which is rich and has numerous combinations and tactics to play.
<br>
<br>The graphics are just amazing, seem to be hand drawn carefully, the animation is fluent and natural and the soundtrack is incredible. Normally I am not taken by games music, but this one was the exception and it made me feel like getting the soundtrack.
<br>
<br>This game is worth to play and I would definitely recommend it. Thanks to the developers for such amazing game. IMHO 9.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6924743">Expand</a></span>

Its story structure and combat system is alien to Bastion, but what remains is easily one of the best games of 2014 coupled with one of the greatest soundtracks in gaming.
<br>
<br>My favorite aspect of Transistor (aside from its soundtrack) is its absolutely superb combat system. It&apos;s unlike anything else I&apos;ve played and the closest comparison I can draw is the VATS system from the Fallout games. You have to manage real time and paused turns in addition the many abilities granted to the player via the Transistor. It allows you to mix these &quot;functions&quot; as a main ability, upgrade, or a passive ability. Options like these grant over 100 different combinations if not more. The Process, which serves as the game&apos;s enemies compliment this system very well and the addition of limiters and the ability to customize your own difficulty for higher rewards trumps Bastion&apos;s fully real time battle system. The Transistor&apos;s battle system is like solving a puzzle every enemy encounter and the game&apos;s addition of its &quot;backrooms&quot; which offers challenge tests and a place to wind down speaks volumes of the strength of this game&apos;s combat. It&apos;s equal parts satisfying, rewarding, challenging, and even fantastic for a New Game+. There is a slight learning curve, most especially at the beginning, but getting past that point won&apos;t take too long.
<br>
<br>The story of Transistor is also a departure from Bastion in the sense it doesn&apos;t give you any details about the world and setting right away. It&apos;s vague in the best definition, and I can&apos;t fault it for that. Much of the narration revolves around the mysterious voice omitted from the Transistor, who serves more like a sidekick since he&apos;s not omnipotent. You control a stage performer named &quot;Red&quot; who lost her voice after an incident by her assailants. I won&apos;t discuss plot details any more than that, but many of the details surrounding the characters and the world they inhibit come from text that you read in terminals scattered about in addition to the game&apos;s menus. This style of storytelling trusts the player&apos;s to piece it together but still leaves plenty of room for their own interpretation, especially at the game&apos;s conclusion. I will say that I didn&apos;t enjoy the game&apos;s ending as much as I wanted to, mainly because it felt a little too sappy for me, but given that it&apos;s open for interpretation, it&apos;s fitting for the game&apos;s themes and the character of Red and her relationship with the mysterious character that accompanies you throughout. The real problem with the story actually lies in how it clashes with the combat system. The stop-and-go style of gameplay interrupts with the fast paced story, which Bastion did not suffer from since everything was in real-time. The flow of it ends up jittery more than graceful, but it&apos;s a design decision that ultimately benefits the game in the end in favor of its amazing combat system. The story, while not perfectly paced, trusts the players without being nonsensical. It&apos;s not vague for the sake of it, but rather to suit its style and themes, and I applaud it for that.
<br>
<br>Speaking of style, Transistor is absolutely gorgeous. You hear plenty of people scoff if a game sports an &quot;artistic style&quot;, but the work of Supergiant games in creating Transistor&apos;s setting is unlike anything I&apos;ve seen. The game is viewed from an isometric standpoint and the art paints a picture closer to virtual reality that a painting, but this same art style appears to be achieved by means of brush. It&apos;s difficult to describe, but it is  utterly gorgeous. Every inch of this game is packed with so much visual love that it seems no other aspect in the game could surpass it, except for its soundtrack. Darren Korb&apos;s work in crafting Transistor&apos;s soundtrack is nothing short of legendary. I understand that everyone has different musical tastes, but it is incredibly difficult to spot anything wrong with Transistor&apos;s soundtrack. I love every track but the ones containing Ashley Barrett&apos;s vocals are equal parts haunting and beautiful. It also helps that the lyrics allude to the game&apos;s plot, which is always a neat touch. Korb&apos;s mixing of different instruments create Transistor&apos;s own identity, while making me buy the soundtrack of the game, which is a sign of an amazing soundtrack.
<br>
<br>Transistor has flaws, specifically of those tied to the story and how it&apos;s way of telling it may turn players away and clashes with its battle system&apos;s but I wouldn&apos;t have any other way. It&apos;s triumphs are of a high order and succeeds as a worthy follow-up to Bastion and even surpasses it in key aspects such as style and soundtrack, things that Bastion was already revered for. Transistor is also replayable, and tied with its superb combat, makes it an even sweeter deal. It is easily one of the best games of 2014, and a shining example in style blending well with function.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6912531">Expand</a></span>

So many questions left unanswered until you get towards the end. Gameplay takes some getting used to but discovering the combinations of abilities is fantastic and you can really customize the way YOU want to play. This game blew me away, the art is stylized and fantastic, the story is very intriguing, albeit short, but what makes this well done is that there is replay-ability. Trying out new styles, unlocking the rest of the skills, and even using more &quot;limiters&quot; to make the game harder. I highly recommend this game to anybody who is looking for something different than your average game. Oh and the music is superb, very relaxing and edgy at the same time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4273484">Expand</a></span>

After the incredible success that was bastion, I was afraid Supergiant Games wouldn&apos;t be able to match it. But they went above and beyond, completely blowing my expectations out of the water.
<br>I will warn you, though, if you&apos;re more interested in the story than anything, it is not spoon fed to you. You have to work for it. And I mean really work for it. The majority of the backstory is unlocked, piece by piece, as you level certain abilities, or when you search for terminals. The large majority of the story is told in a more classic sense, but the details behind everything are what you have to work for.
<br>To me, I think that&apos;s great motivation to get as much out of this game as I can.
<br>Did I mention I love it ?

Mixing and maxing my &quot;Functions,&quot; and utilizing the unique turn based combat system was not only a challenge to master, but very rewarding. It really added an extra dimension to the game that gives it extended playability. Three thumbs up for combat.

<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, this game is not perfect. I thought it was too short and level design grew old quickly. It was overly and needlessly challenging one moment and then far too easy the next. But all in all, for $20 you are getting a great game, definitely worthy of your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4257446">Expand</a></span>

An absolutely phenomenal game. Supergiant&apos;s 2nd game is just as good, if not better, than their previous game Bastion which was already fantastic. The presentation is fantastically done with amazing art all throughout, while the music sets the right tone for all aspects of the game. There are very little problems with the game, especially since the gameplay is vastly improved. Outside of turn() it is still clunky but that is the main difference - the intuitive turn() system is fresh and utilizes the abilities quite well. Difficulty is never overwhelming unless you want it to be - activating limiters ramps up the difficulty massively but only if you want it, with a bonus to experience which allows you to get more earlier. Bosses are simple and yet incredible and as is the rest of the game, especially the final boss which throws a complete curveball at you - but I won&apos;t talk about that here. The story of Transistor is similar to a Shakespearean tragedy in that it is bound to make you cry at some point, and I love this whole game to death if you hadn&apos;t already been able to tell already. A must play, potentially even more than Bastion was.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4247335">Expand</a></span>

It also has one of the best soundtracks I&apos;ve ever heard in a video game. The whole concept would be truly unique if not for Supergiant Games&apos; previous title Bastion, and fans of that game will no doubt feel right at home with Transistor. It is a fairly short game, taking about 7-10 hours to complete, but it&apos;s a truly enjoyable experience throughout and definitely worth the asking price.
<br>
<br>The controls are very well optimised for both kb+m and a controller. Graphical options are pretty much non-existent, but the game looks absolutely gorgeous and should run just fine even on older PC&apos;s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=5906081">Expand</a></span>

I was playing Bastion one day, and my friend sends me a link saying: &quot;SuperGiant is making a new game.&quot; After learning that fact, I clicked on the link instantly, and I saw the words &quot;Transistor&quot; on the screen. I was confused because I thought this would be a sequel to Bastion. I went along with it anyways. I saw a Lady, dressed in a performer&apos;s attire, walk at a slow pace and then, a sword, laying in the ground. She grabs the Sword and her clothes are changed to battle-appropriate gear, if you can call it that. She moves a lot faster now, and the sword says her name, &quot;Red&quot; I can&apos;t remember much of the dialogue, but I remember that she eventually had four battle skills. I them see her stop time, and I question what&apos;s going on. That&apos;s when I learned of what made me absolutely hyped for that game, other than SuperGiant, the &quot;TURN()&quot; function. I watch the entire video, and my hype level reaches 100% after seeing only ~30 minutes of Gameplay.
<br>
<br>Okay, music. Beautiful, they bring back the voice of Zia to voice who we can only assume to be Red in some of the music. My favorite track is &quot;Paper Boats&quot;, the credits theme. SuperGiant&apos;s music is at its best in Credits, hands down.
<br>
<br>Visuals, amazing. A different style from Bastion, but again, SuperGiant doesn&apos;t only make it work, but makes it something to want the game for. And I am not a graphics ***** at all. While at rate times the buildings would block my sight of enemies, it didn&apos;t matter because in TURN() you can see through the buildings.
<br>
<br>The Plot is... It&apos;s confusing, as with Bastion. The general gist is the Process (The equivalent of the Calamity) has taken over, and you want to end it. The game starts with you in front of a Man who has a Sword that is somewhat like a USB drive. (The USBuster Sword! No, it&apos;s the Transistor.) impaled into him. You pull it out and it talks to you. This isn&apos;t the sword talking, but the man who was impaled by the blade. Also in the sword is your voice. The sword was meant to kill you, but the man saved you. The Camerata is also apparently trying to stop the Process as well and wants the Transistor so they can do it, but you don&apos;t trust them. It&apos;s a weird story, but SuperGiant makes it work.
<br>
<br>Finally, the Gameplay. As with Bastion, many consider this &quot;a generic hack-and-slash game&quot; and that is further from the truth than saying Bastion is! Throughout the game, you collect functions, your skills. You are allowed 4 with you at a time, and each takes up a certain amount of &quot;data&quot; on the Transistor, depending on how useful they are in battle. Not only is each Function different, but you use the data left to either equip remaining functions to passive slots or upgrade slots. You have a maximum of 32 Data, 4 Passive Slots, and 2 Upgrade slots for each of the four Function slots, allowing for an insane amount of customization, as each function is different depending on which slot they&apos;re in. There are also the equivalent of Bastion&apos;s idols, Limiters. Each one making the game harder, but you get more experience. There are 10, just the same amount as in Bastion. The perfect finale the this is the TURN() function. It does not go into any of the Function slots, but you have a bar at the top of your screen. That is the &quot;TURN() Meter&quot;. When it is fully charged you can activate TURN(), stopping time and allowing you to plan for what to do. You setup your plan, each function taking up a certain amount of space on the meter. When you finish planning, you go out of TURN() and watch your plan play out as you are normal speed while everything else is slowed. (Like the Matrix!)
<br>
<br>This game is worth more than its $20 price on the Steam Shop, I would hands-down pay $40 if I had to. Do everyone, yourself included a favor and buy this game. Also, I said earlier I originally wanted a sequel to Bastion, and this provides it, not as a direct sequel, but as a spiritual sequel. Also, its the same Voice Actor for the Narration (The Man in the Transistor) as in Bastion! Hurrah!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4336388">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed the story too, kept me guessing and I liked the way the story linked up with upgrading the power upgrade options for the Transistor..  Regarding the various characters that are key to the story - I would love some action sequences with them each, if a Transistor II is ever in the works.  But the backstory given with each helped to keep me involved. I was enjoying the game enough that I thought the game ended too quickly.  Once you&apos;ve gone through each level, I guess the using the limiters is next for me. If you&apos;re a first-time player, you shouldn&apos;t use them until you&apos;ve been through the entire game and landscape at least once.  I would like more memory, but I guess that&apos;s a reasonable limitation for the Transistor weapon. I like the music, especially the last song.  I think a Transistor II would be great, especially if it upgraded levels.  Building or rebuilding a world is always harder that destroying one. But overall, it&apos;s a beautiful achievement.  I applaud the creators.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6231281">Expand</a></span>

I loved the feel of a dystopian society run by a higher power but still beautiful none the less. I thought the story was unique and the combat was a lot of fun, having the choice to plan it out or just go on the fly really mixed things up. Upgrading skills is very useful but I do think it should be explained more. I truly think Transistor deserves all the praise it achieves and I look forward to Supergiant&apos;s next game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4386747">Expand</a></span>

But when it comes to the plot it is far too vague.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, I like being thrown in medias res and struggling to understand the situation piece by piece but on this game they got a bit too far: you don&apos;t know where you are and more importantly which are your world &quot;rules&quot; (more or less like in physics rules). Not knowing the &quot;limits&quot; of your surroundings you can&apos;t empathize with the main characters and their story, you don&apos;t know who they are and what is their role in the world either (again, because you don&apos;t know what is the world you&apos;re playing your part in).
<br>So, well, with a little bit more knowledge about the world (not the &quot;politics&quot; that you can read on the terminals) I&apos;d have been able to empathize with the main characters and understand the plot completely.
<br>
<br>I also like to spend a few words on the combat system itself. I don&apos;t know if something like that already existed, but, well, the hybrid turn/real-time combat system was amazing. You have to both plan your turn() and the time before the next turn(). Seldom being off-turn is better for strategic reasons and you have to take in considerations that too.
<br>Finally, there are no ninja-spawns you cannot react to (hello Valkyria Chronicles and partly XCOM: Enemy Unknown) meaning that you never feel like the game is not fair.
<br>
<br>So, in my opinion, if you approach this game as a multimedia artbook you will enjoy it from start, far, far more than expecting something from the plot or trying to understand the cyberpunk-art-deco world you&apos;re thrown in.
<br>Recommended to art-lovers and romantics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/transistor/user-reviews?user_review_id=5758338">Expand</a></span>
