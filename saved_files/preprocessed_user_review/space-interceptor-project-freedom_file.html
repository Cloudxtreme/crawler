<br>Go to the HKCUSoftwareCity InteractiveProject FreedomV4D Direct3D Renderer.
<br>
<br>There, you can find Width and Height. Double click on it, and change the value to Decimal. Put your desired resolution, and the game will be applied with your custom resolution next time when you execute the game.
<br>
<br>2. Create a shortcut of the exe and add -skipmovies to the end of the target.
<br>
<br>This game has good graphics (it actually feels like your flying in space close to a huge planet while dodging some asteroids), relatively good voice acting and the gameplay/control of the ship is great.
<br>It actually has a first person view, which is extremely rare for this type of game, and you can even roll 360 degrees. Think decent/homeworld/freelancer with just pure action.
<br>
<br>Maybe this game just got released at the wrong time, was overshadowed by other games etc.
<br>But this is a pretty decent action packed game that more than decent, it&apos;s so simple yet so fun and kinda challenging too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-interceptor-project-freedom/user-reviews?user_review_id=3436495">Expand</a></span>
