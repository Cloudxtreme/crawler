It takes forever to tie in the moves I want and then I hate the avatars which pop up and go &quot;ahh&quot; in rapid fire when I have no clue what they are moaning about since I had half a second to see the move that upset them. The game seems &quot;distant&quot;...it lacks character and seems like a cheap Hoyle card game (with less charisma) or one of those Adventure Company games with cheap production values. I really expected a wilder and more free feeling game. This game really should of just gone with an English language based gameplay where you don&apos;t have to guess at symbols and you can actually communicate with players and strike up &quot;outside the box&quot; gameplans so you can exercise your devious ideas. Now the game isn&apos;t all bad...it works, and you can play it, and once you get the hang of it you could probably enjoy it more online...but it doesn&apos;t feel fun. I think it&apos;s time we give up on Diplomacy as a computer game, but maybe take the spirit of it and try to implement it in a new way and in a new game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diplomacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=384351">Expand</a></span>

When the turn is resolved the &quot;talking heads&quot; show emotions and ahs and ohs but it&apos;s not clear why. Since it&apos;s hard to find other players online, you can try playing vs the AI but since the UI is clumsy you will end up playing without any diplomacy, as if it were a simple combat-only strategy game (like Risk or similar). So, when the whole diplomacy thing is cut off you are left with just 2 types of units (infantry and ships) which don&apos;t have very interesting interactions. I&apos;m not sure this game could even work well on computer because in single player it loses its meaning and for multiplayer there must be a constantly active and large online community (which, as other games show, won&apos;t exist for long after game release unless it&apos;s something constantly updated like an MMORPG).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diplomacy/user-reviews?user_review_id=5873180">Expand</a></span>
