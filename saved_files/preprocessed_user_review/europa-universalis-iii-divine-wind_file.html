That said EU fits into a very fine niche of history enthusiasts. If you do not enjoy reading history books then you will find this game lacking but if your the kind of person who reads Gibbon from cover to cover then you will find this game scratches an itch that very few other games scratch. Mechanically it is not very impressive, you build your buildings, move your armies, and watch them fight with other armies. The real joy is in creating a realm of historical fiction, or, more difficult, re-create history. What would have happened if the French conquered Lombardy? Where would history be if the Bohemians dominated the Holy Roman Empire? What if Russia had expanded West instead of East? If you are the kind of person who has asked these questions then you are the kind of person who will enjoy EU Divine Wind regardless of its many mechanical nuances.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/europa-universalis-iii-divine-wind/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724056">Expand</a></span>

You cant just conquer every neighbor to get gigantic industrial capacity to build gigantic army and conquer even more. If you try that you&apos;re be hated by every nation and endless wars coming from this hate will destroy even biggest empire - from inside coz of peasant riots, revolutions or independence uprisings. So clever politics is a must. This is actually first game that I played where after your crashing victory against one of your enemies if you&apos;re not modest in your demands and will be to greedy, you will actually in long-term destroy yourself. After playing this game I for the first time understood why European borders look this way as today - and why there is no 2-3 empires that divided whole continent between them eating every small nation on their way. And this kind of thinking is a must in every other game - From total War to Empire Galactica. Because her you can be involved in war, completely destroy your opponent and have opportunity to get most of his land, and you still demand from him nothing more than some money that would not even re compensate  what you spent on an army for this campaign. Because if you would take his land or demand too much you would be crashed. For me EU3 is 9,0 game. I won&apos;t give 10 because i liked EU2 much more and not every change in EU3 was for better (alas a lot of them were) in my opinion. This expansion is nice - with all previous ones i would say this is 9,5 game now. Pure essence of strategy but definitely game not for every one, and casual players won&apos;t find anything here - only Total War with no tactical battles, but hundreds of tablets and diagrams that you need to check all the time</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/europa-universalis-iii-divine-wind/user-reviews?user_review_id=1644777">Expand</a></span>

Cascading alliances is pretty two-sided addition, because it makes little conquest missions to be almost World Wars.<br><br>It doesn&apos;t add to game that much like the latest expansions, but it&apos;s still must-buy if you&apos;re Europa Universalis fan.</span>
