But, well, except for selection of villains, like, i don&apos;t get why they took Deadpool or Juggernaut, they easily can be replaced as, i don&apos;t know, Punisher and Rhino. Gameplay is pretty repetitive and PC port a bit laggy, but game worth a while. I managed to beat it twice.</span>

It&apos;s got a passable story, good enough not to turn me away from webswinging. But the controls ruin it. My specs FAR exceed the minimum and reccomended, 460 GTX, I72630QM Sandy bridge, 8 GB of 1333MHz RAM. I can run witcher on medium settings, skyrim and arkham city on nearly max. But the game has horrible input lag, despite the smooth framerate. This is something that should have been fixed in a patch, but it hasn&apos;t come yet so i&apos;d feel pretty confident saying they dont care about their crappy port and will not be patching it. (January 5th 2012)<br><br>Still the games not complete crap, the button delay is less noticable(Still enough to irritate me) if you drop your settings to maximum which is the only way i&apos;ve been able to move forward, the levels are paced nicely and the villains are represented very nicely. I didnt like the mysterio in the opening cutscene, but i&apos;ve warmed to him.<br><br>Basically, if you are a die hard fan of spidey, this might be worth a look depending on if you can get it cheap, or rent it. But get it on a console if you can, the PC version makes a rockstar port look like gold.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spider-man-shattered-dimensions/user-reviews?user_review_id=2091551">Expand</a></span>
