<br>This is my first SH game and I hate it. I have nearly finished chapter six and I have still only have two hours game play on the clock. Pointless useless notes left lying around to read. Oh thanks for telling things are fine now in that note. I don&apos;t know who you are or why stuff was bad before. I don&apos;t care.
<br>
<br>I am sick to the back teeth or dying after a stupid combat with inadequate weapons or no ammo. Sick as hell of having to repeat it. On top of that it crashes everytime I minimise it, like when looking for a walkthrough. Basically 2.5 hours of nothing and 50% of that time repeating stuff. What the hell is that for over 1/3 of the game?
<br>
<br>All I can say now is thank goodness I didn&apos;t pay &#xA3;12 for a CD copy on ebay. The Steam copy is &#xA3;18. For ages I kept thinking risk going for the ebay one. Anyway luckily a Steam copy arrived for &#xA3;5.40 and I got that.
<br>
<br>Days later and I tried to carry on a few times. still can&apos;t finish the chapter six boss. Wrangling with the controls to get him to axe the creature&apos;s arms is nearly impossible. By default it aims for the head. Then to aim you have to press shift. It is so hard to remember to cancel toggle shift after a strike. You get knocked down and get up to find you can hardly move because shift is still on. Smashed to the floor again. Maybe thirty goes at this boss. The end. I give up. Four days it has taken me to try finish chapter six.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hill-homecoming/user-reviews?user_review_id=4883604">Expand</a></span>

The main reason of why this game is so bad is because of the terrible gameplay mechanics and the poorly designed controls, and the PC version is even worst, the first time i could not believe that the controls started acting differently as they were configured. Then after I managed to get a controller to play this garbage I was suprised of how BAD the combat is in this game. Shepperd is supposed to be an ex marine, but he moves like a tired old man and he fights like a kid. Enemies are way too annoying and they never miss a single hit unless you are very lucky, this game is focused in action instead of suspense and horror itself. The first puzzles are easy and the whole atmosphere is good, and they managed to retain the basic horror aspects of the game, but where the **** is the creepy and sad music? The characters are so lame and boring, the places are repetitive as hell and the enemies are always spawning from predictable locations, it doesn&apos;t scare the players that way. Also the enemy design is repetitive and boring, the enemy has always advantage in combat and the attacks are so cheap and lame, some exectuion animations are decent but others are a complete joke, like 2 frames of animation, it is THAT terrible.
<br>At the end of the day, you will want to throw this game to the trash, where it belongs, it is a ocmplete disaster and i don&apos;t reccomend buying it unless you collect silent hill games or you are a fan of the series.
<br>After Team Silent left, Double Helix made a mess with this game, I doubt that they even tested this crap.
<br>I am giving this game an extra point just because it&apos;s a silent hill game that retains the atmosphere.

<br>
<br>While a few faint glimmers of hope remain in the music and boss design, the overall mood and feel of the game is nothing like classic Silent Hill games and it completely fails to create any sort of tension or compelling narrative. A greater emphasis on combat removes the horror from the equation, and the combat itself is awkward and jittery. Not to mention, the starting knife attacks so quickly it can stunlock almost every enemy in the game and makes every other melee weapon useless.
<br>
<br>And this is all assuming you can actually get it running. Especially on newer systems, you&apos;re likely not to be able to launch the game at all without some fiddling. And if you do, expect a lack of video options and weird performance issues or visual glitches all around, as well as frequent crashes. It&apos;s a messy version of a game that was already a mess, and yet somehow they still feel fine charging $40 for it.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re eyeing this one during a sale in hopes of one last little gasp of Silent Hill to satisfy your craving, just don&apos;t. You&apos;d be wasting your money and your time on a game that is an amateurish, embarrassing shadow of those that came before it. It&apos;s not scary, it&apos;s not fun, and it&apos;s not interesting or well-written, failing to give any reason to justify its existence.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hill-homecoming/user-reviews?user_review_id=5666098">Expand</a></span>

However, this SH installment was so poorly executed you couldn&apos;t have paid me to see it through to the end. The PC port controls are mega-clunky. There are bugs throughout the game which force you to load a previous save in order to continue (moving the books in the bookshelf to access the button behind them will break if you don&apos;t drag the books all the way to the left before letting go of the cursor, for example). My other massive complaint are the over abundance of loading screens and load times for them. This game feels like it was thrown together 10 years ago. If i hadn&apos;t gotten it for almost nothing on Steam I&apos;d be, well....steamed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hill-homecoming/user-reviews?user_review_id=743954">Expand</a></span>

The game is buggy, and will frequently pause or lock up, requiring a restart.   The freeze and pause typically happen in combat, which throws off your coordination.   Your coordination is already way off, because the controls are laggy and imprecise, and in addition to inconvenient pausing, the game will sometimes randomly wrench control of the camera and your character away from you, right in the path of an enemy&apos;s attack.    It&apos;s like the developers (read sadistic -----) went out of their way to make the game as frustrating as they possibly could so they could claim it was &quot;challenging.&quot;    If that wasn&apos;t bad enough, you&apos;ve got a CONSOLE SAVE SYSTEM, with save spots fairly far apart.   Not only do you have to fight your way through almost an entire level after being killed by a level boss, but you&apos;ve got non-interactive segments along the way that you can only *SOMETIMES* skip.  Sometimes, hitting escape will skip the in-engine cutscene.  Sometimes, all it does it jump you to the menu screen and pause the game -- ie. you have to sit through it for the billionth time.<br><br>I loved SH1, SH2, SH3, I even thought The Room was ok.   I absolutely HATE this game.    It&apos;s a game designer&apos;s train wreck.    Hate this game.   It&apos;s a total waste of money.    The graphics are nice and slightly spooky, but there&apos;s no feeling of dread or goose bumps like with the first 3 games.   After all this time, I had expected the bugs to have been patched, but nope, this is the same steaming pile that was on shelves  last year.  I&apos;m not even sure why I gave them a 2, other than that I can&apos;t bring myself to totally slag anyone&apos;s hard work (They&apos;d get a 1 if the review system allowed for a zero).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hill-homecoming/user-reviews?user_review_id=1400522">Expand</a></span>

This makes submersion into the game difficult. MOST ANNOYING is the PC port which is more littered with GLITCHES than the game is with bodies. 4/10 - a generous 4, do not waste your money on this game.</span>

My complaints come down to these issues: The engine has a lot of bugs, missing, cutoff and misplaced sounds, glitchy and inconsistent gameplay and a very broken combat system. The American developers of this version didn&apos;t hold true to the original idea and now it seems to just be a conveyor belt of horror cliches. It does not deserve the Silent Hill name. Save points are few and far between. This is the last time I&apos;ve played 1-2 hours without a savepoint to have another broken combat enouter throw me back and lose 2 hours of progress. This game will certainly guarantee frustration and I highly recommend skipping it. If you want to be scared, play Dead Space or replay one of the other Silent Hill games. Do not buy Silent Hill Homecoming. It is a bad game, and a terrible PC port. It is a waste of $50.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hill-homecoming/user-reviews?user_review_id=420370">Expand</a></span>

What I&apos;m getting at is, if I put Pyramid Head and Valtiel into Animal Crossing, it doesn&apos;t make it a Silent Hill game. Anyway, Silent Hill was never about fighting monsters. It was a psychological thing, and that was what made it scary. This game was not at all scary. I wish Team Silent would pick back up the series and show Konami how to really make Silent Hill games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hill-homecoming/user-reviews?user_review_id=421729">Expand</a></span>

First, the game engine is flawed even though I have a PC that far exceeds the specs for what is essentially a console port.  I experienced long unexplained pauses while traversing maps, long loading times when accessing save points, and FMV sequences did not transition correctly from gameplay leaving the last frame of gameplay paused for approximately 15-20 seconds, while the fmv movie continued to play in the background.  I think the longest pause I experienced was about 40 seconds, and that was simply accessing one of the various save points in the game.  These type of engine errors occur throughout the game, on different levels, and even prior to boss battles, which is simply inexcusable and sloppy for a console port.  I give the game engine a D- since the developers should have known better than to distribute a flawed game.  The combat system leaves a lot to be desired.  There are different enemy types in the game, and you are forced to dodge and block attacks in a particular way with each enemy type in order to survive.  Player can dodge at will and in any direction, but the game gives no indication which direction is advisable when dodging.  Thus, one incurs damage even when attempting to use the only defense mechanic in the game simply because the evasion was not done in the proper direction, at just the exact time, etc.  The player is simply expected to figure it out, through experience and even hope for a bit of luck, which in my opinion is not proper in a survival game these days.  The combat system sort of sucks to be honest, I would give it a D since it is clunky and ambiguous.  In any case, the game is still playable you just have to be patient and endure a lot of loading times and reloads until you get lucky with the dodging mechanic.  Plot and story was ok, it was passable but like a lot of Silent Hill games they weave in a lot of vagueness and mystery into what is actually an extremely simple plot.  I felt it was passable and one of the few saving graces of the game.  I found myself continuing to play the game simply to progress the plot and solve the final mystery, despite all the negative issues.   I would give the plot and story a B.  Game length was a bit disappointing however.  There doesn&apos;t seem to be a lot of places to go in general.  A lot of the shops and buildings are locked.  If you are lucky, you get maybe a 1 or 2 sentence explanation of what Alex believes is inside the building, or you are simply told that the door is locked.  I would have preferred more side areas to explore because otherwise the main map areas are simply foggy places with a never ending supply of spawning monsters that try to kill you.  Traversing the foggy streets becomes predictable as you continue to play and realize you can do absolutely nothing other than reach the next quest area.  Level design leaves a lot to be desired and I would give it a D.  The questing system was completely linear in nature and side missions were for the most part encountered (whether you liked it or not) while pursing the main goals of the game.  I give this type of questing system an F+ since it is sort of pathetic and simplistic.  The graphics were good for a Silent Hill game if you compare it to a Playstation 1 or 2 console.  You couldn&apos;t do a whole lot in the foggy city but at least it was the best looking foggy city to date. For the PC, the graphics are perhaps a bit dated compared to other survival games out there such as the Resident Evil series but otherwise I enjoyed how most of the game looked.  I&apos;d give the graphics a B+.  So I can&apos;t quite give this game a fail grade but it comes pretty close.  For some people I suspect the game engine issues will really piss them off since they game chokes even with my power house of a PC that plays all other PC games flawlessly with no problems.  I hope Konami makes better Silent Hill games with better ports to PC, because this will be the last Silent Hill game I buy that has these type of engine issues and awful game-play mechanics.  My final score is a 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hill-homecoming/user-reviews?user_review_id=2088249">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphics are bad, as well as the performance, there aren&apos;t very detailed graphics settings, gameplay is bad, as well as the story (it can&apos;t be even compared to the old ones), and it&apos;s not scary. I would give it a  4-4.5, but it is very good compared to Downpour (should I give it -2, if I gave 4 to this?).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hill-homecoming/user-reviews?user_review_id=2802204">Expand</a></span>

Well this game was a huge surprise to me since I had only seen bad reviews and critics about it for years but after playing it myself all I can say is the game is not bad at all. The PC port is crap for sure but once I made it work with patching and modding the game is very enjoyable. Not the best SH game but a genuine SH game in the end. Graphics are fine they look ok for a 2008 game althought they don&apos;t captue the essence of SH all that well 9/10. The music sound  and voice acting are all fine but once again they are not as scary as other SH games 8/10. The gameplay and controls are very awkward and take time to get used to them, it was very frustrating at first and this can be a turndown for many not to mention all the button mashing when fighting any monster or boss so thats a 7/10. The story of this game was really it&apos;s good point. hadn&apos;t seen such a great story since SH2 very good story worthy of a movie 10/10. Last appeal 8/10 the game is great and has good graphics and a great story but the broken controls and fighting style are a huge turn down not to mention it doesn&apos;t have many riddles or puzzels and when it does they are those slide square kinda ones.  The sounds and graphics don&apos;t capture the essence of Silent Hill all that well either, besides that great game 8/10 RECOMMENDED for any true Silent Hill fan and horror lover. THE PC PORT is BAD btw but CAN BE FIXED WITH PATCHING AND MODS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hill-homecoming/user-reviews?user_review_id=5598451">Expand</a></span>

After many hours trying to kill them, I had to simply quit trying. I wish there were an easier setting for those of us who are more into exploring and solving puzzles, as with the earlier Silent Hill games. If Homecoming had such a difficulty setting, I would have given this one a 10 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hill-homecoming/user-reviews?user_review_id=6698447">Expand</a></span>
