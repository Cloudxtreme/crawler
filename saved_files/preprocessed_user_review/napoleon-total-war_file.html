I think the AI is a little better and a little more agressive which make the real time battles more fun to play. My disappointment comes when I go from the strategy turn based part of the game to the real time battles. there is a glitch where the game runs intermittent while loading the battle. It can take 5-10 minutes to load up a battle on my computer. My computer is a brand new Alienware aurora with upgraded graphics. It&apos;s definitely not a slow or under powered computer. I think it&apos;s a game flaw. It will also freeze up every now when going to a real time battle. Other than that the gameplay is great and smooth at full graphics. The other thing I like is the time frame for each turn, two weeks. It&apos;s great and much more realistic than previous total war games. That adds so much to the game for me and the reason I rate the game higher than I would with my loading problem. If it weren&apos;t for the battle loading problem I would give this game a 9....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/napoleon-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=746859">Expand</a></span>

If anyone wants gunpowder love i would highly suggest you buy this game over the Fall of the samurai or shogun 2 as there is less cheating and it simply looks and sounds better!</span>

I know that some people will prefer the themes and styles at work in Shogun 2 or the first Rome game (great games, both of them); however, I just don&apos;t think that there&apos;s another real-time strategy game out there that has come close to bringing it all together so nicely.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a very polished package and works as a standalone in its own right, although those seeking absolutely immense depth may be happier with Empire.  This game may not be  the &apos;marianas trench&apos; of deep games, but it&apos;s certainly not the kids&apos; paddling pool at your local swimming baths either.
<br>
<br>The user interface is really tight.  It stays straightforward and swift to navigate, whilst still retaining detail and an ornamental appearance for you to feast your eyes upon.
<br>
<br>Battles are exciting and fun to be involved in.  With the addition of artillery in the Napoleonic setting, battles really become vast stages on which the drama of your campaign unfolds.  When your cannon blunt the opposing cavalry charge and the enemy infantry starts to falter as you send in your troops with bayonets fixed, you get a great feeling of accomplishment and exhilaration.
<br>
<br>In honesty, the game does have some well documented glitches, which have caused frustration for me in the past; in particular, a random buzzing and hissing noise which sometimes makes itself known on the campaign map, until you click elsewhere and then it vanishes, mysteriously.  Add to this some questionable artificial intelligence and (unfortunately) I feel the game cannot quite warrant a score of 9 out of 10, which would be nearly perfection.
<br>
<br>BUT (and this is a BIG but), unlike the problems that beset the most recent release (Rome 2  2013) from the Creative Assembly, that&apos;s all these problems are and all they remain; just glitches.  They are not cavernous flaws and glaring omissions from the core of the game that have you reaching for the reset button.  On the contrary, it&apos;s a mark of how compelling the gameplay is that you press on in spite of the glitches, determined as you are to finally win a titanic struggle with the enemy for their capital city.
<br>
<br>Last, but not least, no other Total War game has ever made battles at sea feel quite so &apos;right&apos;.  The arcade-like appeal and usability of Sid Meier&apos;s &apos;Pirates&apos; meets the authenticity and tactical feeling of &apos;Fleet Command&apos;.  And it works like a charm.  I mean, Shogun 2 does a decent job of sea battles, but pfftt....seriously?  Bows and arrows?  Give me a full broadside, by jove and damn your eyes, man!  Sit back and watch in glee as your enemy&apos;s flagship catches fire, starts to sink and then detonates with a huge explosion...muwaa hahaha!
<br>
<br>So why carp about the flaws?  Why focus on the minor irritations?  Why worry about these things, when sitting in front of you is a great looking, great playing, great sounding and great value game, with oodles of replayability value.  Go out and buy it, and confound the knavish tricks of the French  The King commands it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/napoleon-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3495472">Expand</a></span>

Again, it had teething troubles and I had some fiddling to do to get it to play reliably and stable. I love the game, I love the graphics, the battles are the best yet and I like the slight de-emphasis on economics and diplomacy.

I regret its a-historicality, but I still think it is the best of the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/napoleon-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=1480758">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I believe that this game delivers what it intends to. I love the tota-war franchise and the gameplay style. The Napoleon theme also enriches the game a lot. Would give it more if not for the lack of improvements from Empire. Also some buggy features, overall a good game. Buy it if you find it at a decent price. The development team needs your support, not fanboysm. Not a full price.</span>

I really enjoyed this game.  A lot of new units with the new feature where units automatically gain back their losses through replacements when in friendly territory was a definite plus.  It cut out the micro management of having to select all units in a stack and click the replenishment plus button or actually moving them back to a city to retrain them like in older titles.  Plenty of good things to say about vanilla Napoleon Total War, but I can not leave out the modders who have done an outstanding job of providing endless replay ability with new mods still coming out today.  This is a win win for any total war fan, so definitely pick up this copy and enjoy for yrs to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/napoleon-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3529975">Expand</a></span>

At best it is a passable game that might be interesting for a fortnight, but it never really captures the essence of warfare of the period it pretends to portray. But what is even more.. it tends to become boring pretty fast.
<br>The game is a watered down version of civilization in which battles are conducted using a real time strategy (hah!) engine. There are a few Napoleonic features that should give us an impression of warfare from that period. So we have infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Each neatly divided into heavy, medium and light. Heavy to provide the punch, medium to provide the backbone of the army and light to provide easy maneuverability. Infantry was equipped with muskets and bayonets, cavalry with swords, pistols, lances and short ranged muskets, artillery with guns and howitzers.
<br>All of this is done with nice looking models so there is no complaint from me there.
<br>What I do complain about is the implementation.
<br>The game completely misrepresent warfare of that period because it just generates troops as if they are part of a twentieth century production line. An army, and certainly the Grand Army that was commanded by Napoleon, was a carefully husbanded tool of power. The performance of this army, which out performed most other armies of the time, was a combination of revolutionary spirit, corps the esprit, tactical and strategical genius, and careful planning.
<br>Instead the game defaults to a: generate troops and throw them against your enemy in batches of twenty, as twenty is the maximum amount of units that you can field in a battle. Eventually you will be able to create crack armies out of thin air by having a few cities produce them from scratch.
<br>Like really?
<br>The game doesn&apos;t really bother with things like supply lines, which at that time had a crucial impact on the deployment of armies. We are speaking about time that armies started to become so big that they could no longer live from the land. Sometimes they could for a short while: the Grand Army of Napoleon deliberately abandoned their supply lines in 1805 to fool their enemies.
<br>Napoleon was often facing superior numbers which he dealt with by using speed and maneuverability. He utilized the corps as unit, basically a small self contained army, which would march along a separate route from the other corps and was to meet other corps at a certain point to combine into an army and attack the enemy.
<br>Nothing of this you can find in this game. You could easily march your armies back and forth through Europe without suffering too much for it.
<br>In essence on this strategic level the game has nothing Napoleonic. It could be Rome: Total War, Shogun: Total War or Alexander: Total War, Word War 1 : Total War or Korea: Total War..Just change the graphics accordingly.
<br>
<br>So is there anything Napoleonic on the tactical level?
<br>What there is, is not much and  it is half implemented. For instance.. your infantry can assume a square formation. This was a tactic used against cavalry. In this game you have to order them.. the AI never assumes square formation, not even when directly threatened by cavalry. In fact... ai led infantry just assumes a line formation and fires at your cavalry even when attacked from the rear.
<br>Column to line and vice verse tactics do not exist. For those who are not in the know: column was used to move faster and to deliver close assault. Line tactics were used to maximize fire power. Oh you could click on the button to change decrease and increase your ranks.. but really.. that is not how it should be.
<br>Skirmish infantry doesn&apos;t work properly. Skirmish infantry was used to screen units from attack and to harass the enemy or provoke him into an unwise attack. The essential element is that the skirmish unit would fall back when attacked.. which in this game can only be achieved by having them turn their backs towards their attackers and march them away.. Skirmish units were trained in backing up.
<br>Line units lack skirmish units. In reality french units had an integral skirmish unit. Nothing like that exists in this game.
<br>Artillery units when attacked, usually took shelter inside squares.. nothing like that happens in the game.
<br>And I could add more.
<br>
<br>Napoleon: Total War  has nothing to do with Napoleonic warfare, it is the same old game Total War game fitted in  a new outfit. If you liked Rome :Total War.. you might like this.. it is just the same game. If you want something that represents the time better.. look elsewhere.. or read a book.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/napoleon-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=4590553">Expand</a></span>

The combat animations are excellent and exciting during a fight you feel inside the scenario, the action, the bangs, the shots, it&apos;s just exciting, not to mention the presence of epic Napoleon Bonaparte.</span>

The campaign drop-in battle addition is actually pretty cool and interesting, though there&apos;s really something; CA forgot to improve the A.I. It&apos;s dumbed out as Empire&apos;s. The campaign is still fun, but when fighting in real-time battles with A.I., it&apos;s not really fun. Napoleon is basically Empire, with fewer factions and a new title screen. This game only excels in multiplayer. There&apos;s no dumb A.I. that puts its cannons behind hills, or any exploitable stupid act they perform. If you&apos;re that guy that doesn&apos;t play singleplayer (specifically, the campaign) at all (like the Prince of Macedon), this game may suit you. Although, beware of noob players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/napoleon-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2427219">Expand</a></span>

Graphically, game is superb. Explosions are beautiful and soldiers are fairly detailed (at least better than how Empire total war was), but that means you won&apos;t be able to see what Napoleon total war has to offer if your PC is not good, so keep that in mind. Napoleon total war is pretty similar to its predecessor Empire total war, but adding more features into game, such as cold/heat attrition makes invasion more challenging and stronger rebel forces requires you to put more attention toward town management. Also, this game have overall better multiplayer experience than its predecessor. However, game&apos;s scope is only limited to Europe; don&apos;t get me wrong since it is still wide, but it feels narrow because its predecessor had very large scope, stretching from America to India. Also, game is very heavily focused in five factions  Britain, France, Austria, Prussia and Russia. Each have unique tactic and unique units, but when it comes to more &quot;minor&quot; faction, such as Portugal, Spain, Denmark and Sweden, it is very lacking. First, you can&apos;t play them in campaign, and second, their units are standard. I hope there were more depth into each factions, not for all but at least faction you can play in custom battle. Although it is better than Empire total war since it had exactly same looking unit with just minor differences in stats. However, this game is more fast paced for better multiplay experience, so line infantry and cannons in this game have phenomenal reloading speed. It&apos;s minor issue if you just want to enjoy the game, but hardcore historians may feel offended by this. So, game is pretty good, but I can&apos;t help but feel this game is standalone expansion pack of Empire total war. If you are more singleplayer-centric gamer, you may want to pass this one since it&apos;s not that different from Empire total war. However, if you just want to break free from bugs of Empire total war, want to pursue Napoleon&apos;s ambition, or just want to jump into wonders of total war franchise, this is game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/napoleon-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3078669">Expand</a></span>

Their games definitely LOOK great. The loading screens are PERFECT, the music is great, the campaign maps are BEAUTIFUL. In battles the units look and sound terrific. All the eye-candy is there. But the gameplay? It&apos;s INCREDIBLY BLAND. And as many, users note time and time again. the unit AI in battles and the campaign AI in general looks and plays like bad computer coding. The games never feel as good as you imagine they should feel from looking at them. I think the naval battles in this game, as a separate component, are the only truly sound part of the design. Everything else looks great but plays MEH! It was also very rude of CA to spurn the Darth MOD dude, because his hard work was actually pointing the way to make a better game. IF CA don&apos;t change their designers and find a team capable of improving their campaigns, or at least start borrowing liberally from the ideas of Paradox Interactive we are doomed to  see ever new ever prettier but ever hollow shells of good games. For the long of God CA, please get over the graphics and get the gameplay right for a change!
<br>
<br>THE GROT REVIEW CRITERIA: After a long time writing reviews like an anus, think its time to set a few bad habits straight: Stop insulting designers. Show some respect for the design process and getting games in circulation. Hence (1) No Red scores. (2) Game scores as follows: Bad Game 5/10. Poor Game 6/10. Mediocre Game: 7/10. Good Game 8/10. Great game 9/10. Stella Game 10/10. To get 10/10 it must be a game that can be (theoretically) play-able for 1000+ hours. Not only great but near endless fun. Games may be bad or poor but making them should earn respect. Thus even the worst POS will still be a 5/10. 0/10 no longer exists in my vocabulary. Yellow is the new red.

Unfortunately the campaign-part is too predictable when you&apos;re familiar with other TW-games. There&apos;s not much happening between AI-controlled nations: usually one nation will become big and once you&apos;ve subdued that nation, all the fun is over. Very few rebellions, emergences of new nations and the diplomacy is flawing and illogical at times. Also it&apos;s a pity that real military doctrines do not seem be in use anymore (such as the benefits of flanking fire and enfilade artillery). However the advantages of being on high ground are quite realistic. It would be interesting to see an Total War: American Civil War (including Indian tribes, diplomacy with European nations, new warfare technology, siege battles, entrenchment and such) and with the playability of Rome Total War (which is in my opinion the TW-game with the most &quot;depth&quot; in gameplay).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/napoleon-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=746853">Expand</a></span>

This game is NOT broken, its got faults but its NOT broken 2. The Ai is NOT broken, little stupid at time but naval battles Ai is far more advance and battle Ai is leaps and bounds above Empire&apos;s although that still isn&apos;t saying much 3. The game look beyond stunning simply the best graphics for such a big strategy game. 4. sound again is amazing as long as you have 256 channels on. music is well implemenetd from the drummers to the build up music ect. cannon fire sound great 5. Anyone can play this and have fun, where as with me i simply got annoyed with empire grand campaign as you&apos;d never really compete for india and it simply too to much managment for europe and America ect. this much more focused and with the right mod you can have a &quot;Grand Campaign&quot;. 6. Multiplayer is ecerlant if you can get into a game. and once in the game is well amazing 7. My specs for my laptop: 1. 2.2GHZ dual core T6600 intel. 4GB RAM, mobility ATI4650 and i can play this game on ultra or High graphics @ 1366x768 very easily.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/napoleon-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=747129">Expand</a></span>

For some reason, TCA have removed the dead bodies unless you play on ultra settings; after about 10 seconds, the dead bodies will disappear. Why?! Oh God why would you do this? Also, i&apos;m playing on medium settings and GUH it&apos;s ugly. Empire looked pretty great to me on medium, but this...this is horrible. The characters are all washed out and completely lack bump mapping. You&apos;ll understand what i mean if you check the Steam store screen shots; the textures look rushed, and i&apos;d expect better from a modder.)<br><br>Anyway. Nappy Total War isn&apos;t a bad game. It&apos;s just not a very good game either. It&apos;s just a rehash of Empire with improvements that could easily have been patched into Empire. The improvements over Empire are very tasty though, such as round shot on cannon actually being useful now, somewhat improved AI and all the other crap promised in the blurbs. The problems are that the bugs are still present, including some new ones, the AI still can&apos;t manoeuvre over the battlefield without getting confused, and the campaign is crazily short. The new &quot;technology&quot; is just a rehash of other tech in Empire, much like the promised &quot;Warpath&quot; technology.<br><br>&quot;Game Revolution<br>If you own Empire, there&apos;s not a good reason to own Napoleon.&quot;<br>There you have it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/napoleon-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=1491783">Expand</a></span>

The truth is, this game shares many problems with E:TW. The difference being that I was willing to forgive that game somewhat because it had just come out, had a lot of new features and had some promise. This game though? They have no excuse.
<br>
<br>What we have in this game is the worst unit AI I have seen. I can&apos;t believe it is still so broken from E:TW. Units will never fire at their side, even if a unit is standing on the side pouring shot into them. When you order a unit to move, it will often just walk in front of your own lines and then walk next to the enemy, the path finging is horrible. And, to make matters even stupider, your other units will NEVER attempt to avoid friendly fire. Working your cannon and a full is crossing your path? Why, you just shoot through them of course! Who cares if you kill 40 odd people, it was there fault for walking in front of you. God knows you couldn&apos;t possibly stop loading, aiming and shooting your gun for a brief few seconds while they walk past. This isn&apos;t just limited to the cannons either, your men are perfectly happen to shoot friendly units. If one of your other units slightly overlaps them, they won&apos;t have some men not fire, they won&apos;t position themselves between the other people. They will just happily blast all their friends.    Another failure in the AI, and this is one I am totally fed up of seeing, having been in the game since M:TW 2 and is still in the latest Shogun game. That is, Cavalry are almost totally incapable of chasing down routing units. They will charge up to the fleeing unit, charge past them, and then very slowly walk in the same direction as them, only interacting with the enemy if they happen to bump into them. I&apos;ve seen hundreds of people escape purely because my mounted units are totally incapable of getting it into their artificial heads that they can actually  DO SOMETHING! You don&apos;t have to slowly walk after 1 person who is running when 100 people from the same unit RUN PAST YOU!
<br>
<br>This absolute failure of the unit AI (There are many more ways they fail other than the examples I listed) in my opinion totally ruins any chance this game had. Every single little detail in a battle has to be micromanaged because the developers clearly can&apos;t be bothered to put effort into this game
<br>
<br>As for the other aspects of the game, what do you get? You get some micro campaigns, massively dumbed down from Empire, so they end up as stupidly simple little things compared to previous expansions. The graphics are normally a strong point for these games, but I think this game suffers along with Empire. Units will turn into sprites when you zoom out a bit, but sprites and 3D units seriously don&apos;t mix, making it look horrible. All bullets fired by people are still mini meteors with a  blazing white trail behind them. Rain is just hideous, and turning graphics to the top just makes everything look shiny and bloom-tastic.
<br>
<br>I hate to say it, but this game is really bad. Don&apos;t waste your money or the 25GB of HD space it needlessly takes up</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/napoleon-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3125874">Expand</a></span>

But the gameplay? It&apos;s INCREDIBLY BLAND. And as many, users note time and time again. the unit AI in battles and the campaign AI in general looks and plays like bad computer coding. The games never feel as good as you imagine they should feel from looking at them. I think the naval battles in this game, as a separate component, are the only truly sound part of the design. Everything else looks great but plays MEH! It was also very rude of CA to spurn the Darth MOD dude, because his hard work was actually pointing the way to make a better game. IF CA don&apos;t change their designers and find a team capable of improving their campaigns, or at least start borrowing liberally from the ideas of Paradox Interactive we are doomed to see ever new ever prettier but ever hollow shells of good games. For the long of God CA, please get over the graphics and get the gameplay right for a change!

<br>Napoleon: Total war is an excellent strategy game the redeems the series for the sins of Empire. The ai is much better in Napoleon then Empire and bugs are much less frequent in Napoleon. Napoleon also has fantastic historical battles, which have never been my favorites to complete in the past. The campaigns, all 4 ( I&apos;m not including Waterloo because it&apos;s one battle with cutscenes) while being more restrictive then in the past, are great fun, and present a challenge when set to very hard. The graphics are fantastic if your pc can handle them, but the game is a system hog and if you have a lower end pc you should rethink purchasing until you&apos;ve read up if you can run it decently or not. Multiplayer is great, with very little connection issues and the introduction to the series of a multiplayer campaign.
<br>Overall Napoleon:Total war is a superb strategy game that deserves a place in every strategy players liabrary.
<br>10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/napoleon-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=4588266">Expand</a></span>

How dose it have less freedom? Lets say you play Prussia. when I play a campagin, I want to do change history. When I first started to play this game I jumped in as Prussia and started off with wanting side with France and get an alliance with them. Nope. The game won&apos;t let you do that as Prussia to side with France. it might as well commends you to get an alliance with Russia. you have to do what they did in history. that what kills it most for me.

<br>On the outer hand online battle in this one are way better then in Empire Total War. The graphics are way better, there are more maps to play on and there a lot more units to use in battle.

They are both extremely similar games, but your preference will come down to what part of the game you covet more. Multiplayer fans will prefer Napoleon  since it has better combat and unit diversity. Singleplayer fans will want to stick with Empire since it has a vastly superior campaign map and a large diversity of factions. I still encounter several annoying bugs throughout the game, and sometimes I&apos;ll crash for unknown reasons, But it&apos;s nothing that completely detracts from the experience. Napoleon is a worth addition to the Total War franchise and is definitely worth the money if you liked Empire or even just the period it was set in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/napoleon-total-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=4082523">Expand</a></span>

Games from the Total War franchise are not like other strategy games, they are fresher and aim to be, particularly in battles, as realistic as they can - and Napoleon: Total War is no different. On a good computer, the game can look truly astonishing - if you are running it on a lower-end PC then you may be a little dissapointed (I have played on both). From the campaign map you see the whole of Europe spread out in front of you, your armies represented by a soldier or general with your country&apos;s flag displaying pips on the side, which are proportional to the number of units in that army. My favourite part of the game is when your armies clash with others, then the game really shines. In a campaign land battle, the map will be entirely random, not preset or from a list. Also, it will match where you are - for example if you are fighting near a town then you are likely to see this town somewhere on the battlefield. In the battles effects are excellent, from the individual melee fights between each soldier to the firing of the cannon and the smoke drifting across the battlefield.
<br>
<br>To cut a long story shorter, Napoleon: Total War is an extremely enjoyable strategy game. I highly recommend it to any fan of the strategy genre, and certainly this is a must-have for anyone interest in the Napoleonic Era.

The gameplay is somewhat dull only having 5 nations to play as and less fractions than before. Although the map of Europe has more provinces than in Empire.
