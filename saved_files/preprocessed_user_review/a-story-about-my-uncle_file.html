<br>An unique experience that is worth all the money.

<br>
<br>Story:
<br>The game is a bedtime story told by a girls father about his journeys searching for his uncle. The narration feels a bit like Bastion but with what seems to be an inexperienced voice actor as some lines are poorly executed.
<br>Overall the storytelling feels like something I haven&apos;t seen too much of before and felt a bit fresh.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:
<br>You run and jump from platforms and swing through levels with a magic grappling hook like Samus to reach the end. The game has you on a fixed path and only a couple of collectables can get you off that path for a brief moment. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen a more linear game.
<br>In certain places you can explore and look at the text and pictures on books and notes but nothing that will support the story.
<br>
<br>Overall:
<br>It feels pretentious. It really does.
<br>The story is like the ham on a peperoni pizza. It&apos;s not supposed to be there at all. There is a language within the game with different symbols each representing a letter in our alphabet. I decided to decipher what texts I might encounter but it all makes so little sense.
<br>
<br>Early on at the only cross roads in the entire game you can see some of this text hidden to the side but it makes no sense and I suppose it&apos;s supposed to be an inside joke on the devs part.
<br>Also, the devs don&apos;t think it&apos;s important either which is shown a moment later when another text appears and the companion reads that one out loud as well even though you could easily translate it with the letters you already had.
<br>It&apos;s not like it&apos;s important either as it only gives you a hint to the next room that you could have figured out by dying once.
<br>
<br>The voice acting overall is pretty bad and the animations are stiff and inhuman.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>11-12&#x20AC; is too much for a game this short. It has close to no replay value if you don&apos;t intend to speed run it. I think steam sales and humble bundles has tainted me. I barely buy games at full price because you can often wait a could of months and it will be half off.
<br>I&apos;d suggest trying other games that does this games job better.
<br>
<br>For going fast and pretty visuals, Sonic Generations is a better game.
<br>For pretty visuals and pretentious story, Dear Esther is a better visual novel.
<br>For narrated story telling, Bastion is godlike.
<br>For swinging around, the Amazing Spiderman 2 should deliver a better experience (haven&apos;t played it).
<br>
<br>The game simply doesn&apos;t deliver on any aspect to have me give it more than a 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-story-about-my-uncle/user-reviews?user_review_id=4238842">Expand</a></span>

The small events and encounters happening in the game, and the story, while simple, prevent it from getting too boring. Still, the game is much too short, and the gameplay never get more complex than using the grappling hook to advance to the next platform.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-story-about-my-uncle/user-reviews?user_review_id=4262486">Expand</a></span>

The premise of the story is that you have wandered into your absent uncle&#x2019;s house and find a teleporter that takes you to another world. Using the suit he left for you, you must find your uncle and make your way back home.
<br>
<br>The central mechanics are quite simple; there&#x2019;s no combat in this game, with the game being wholly devoted to platforming through 3D environments. Your abilities include a normal jump, a super jump, an energy grapple you shoot from your hand that can connect to most (but not all!) surfaces and pull you towards them while allowing you to swing after a fashion, and later on, a pair of rocket boosts which give you an abrupt, very large bit of acceleration in a certain direction (yes, as if with a rocket) when you try to double jump in midair.
<br>
<br>These controls are quite simple, and the game fundamentally consists of using them to traverse environments. You start out only getting one grapple per jump through the air, but soon you end up with the ability to grapple up to three times before landing &#x2013; and in the final area, refresh them mid-jump by draining glowing crystals on the walls.
<br>
<br>Sadly, the lack of much variety in mechanics means that, in the end, a lot of puzzles ultimately feel fairly samey &#x2013; there&#x2019;s only so much you can do with a limited control set, and it feels like you&#x2019;ve done it all by the end of the game, and probably more than that. A number of areas feel kind of samey, which isn&#x2019;t helped by the graphics &#x2013; while each area of the game has its own unique look, each individual level looks pretty similar internally.
<br>
<br>This is kind of annoying later on in the game, when it becomes increasingly more difficult at times to see what exactly you&#x2019;re supposed to be grappling onto &#x2013; there&#x2019;s a few points in the game where you have to do a bit of searching to figure out where you&#x2019;re trying to go next, and it can be less than obvious. Combined with the game&#x2019;s general aesthetic of &#x201C;rocks floating in midair/stuck in the sides of a cave over bottomless pits&#x201D;, the environment can start getting a bit confusing and very same-looking over time.
<br>
<br>Really, that&#x2019;s all there is to the game; there&#x2019;s three or four characters, with decent but slightly off voiceovers that contain the odd grammatical error betraying the writer as a non-native English speaker (or just some poor proofreading), but in the end, I didn&#x2019;t feel a strong connection to any of the characters. Without this, there&#x2019;s just the platforming &#x2013; and that wears thin after a while.
<br>
<br>Overall, while the game has an okay aesthetic on the most basic of levels, in the end it ends up feeling too samey and there just isn&#x2019;t anything else there to give it much oomph. It just is what it is, and what it is isn&#x2019;t anything special. At the end, I was left walking away without feeling like I&#x2019;d gained anything from the experience, or experienced anything really memorable. It just isn&#x2019;t worth your time or money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-story-about-my-uncle/user-reviews?user_review_id=6909378">Expand</a></span>

This was one of the fewest games in which I paused to applaud the beauty of the surroundings. The village felt so alive - not with the crowd but with its citizens living out their lives. You could see the villagers and get a &quot;feel&quot; of what they&apos;re feeling like right now. One guy has climbed the second floor of his shelf-like open hut and is sleeping while an open book lies in front of him. Another is staring at the sky, 2 people are talking to each other. The grandma is searching for something. Really lovely world and combine all this with the game&apos;s lighting and it&apos;s an enchanting experience.
<br>
<br>The puzzles are also fantastic. It&apos;s incredible to go about hopping from place to place using your limited powers and see more and more of this beautiful world. The puzzles are very satisfying and it&apos;s not a pain to repeat them once or twice but generally they&apos;re quite easy.
<br>
<br>However, the only cons that this game has is the last 25% (Monastry - falling block level onwards). This level is ridiculously tough and it breaks the whole experience of the game. There were lots of people complaining about this level in the Steam forums a long time back (1.5-2 years back, don&apos;t exactly remember) but the game developer responded back saying he&apos;ll fix this level. However, this level and all subsequent levels from this point onwards remain with a very high level of difficulty. In fact, if you watch the Youtube walkthroughs after the jumping puzzle onwards you&apos;ll find that they too are dying over and over and over again. I&apos;m not sure but the Dev just ditched the difficulty spikes in the last 30% of the game. I also tried using a cheat code but that too wasn&apos;t sufficient to cover it up. So -4 points for the horrible difficulty in the last 30%.
<br>
<br>But +2 points for the beautiful, memorable, heartwarming ending. I kept thinking about the end long time after I had finished the game. This remains &quot;a beautiful experience&quot; in my memory even though I finished this game about 2 weeks earlier.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-story-about-my-uncle/user-reviews?user_review_id=7054336">Expand</a></span>

Manipulation of the three dimensional environment, nice story and very atmospheric/well done graphics makes this a unique and very enjoyable experience. Figuring out the game&apos;s puzzles is very satisfying. Definitely worth it if you are looking for a change of pace from your regular games.</span>

<br>+ Ridiculously beautiful environments for the size of the team and the engine used; it&apos;s possible to see where they saved on art assets, but for the most part the game feels as visually impressive as some AAA games
<br>? Mechanics play well, but there&apos;s a lot of rough patches caused by the freeform gameplay, a lot of failures will be due to unavoidable situations
<br>? The collectibles felt very well placed sometimes, and insanely placed other times -- ended up using a guide to avoid missing any of the more absurdly placed ones

The details in this world makes it even better. One of these details are the notes that you find laying around. They explain some miner things about the towns and about Fred and i think this gives the world so much more depth.
<br>While we&apos;re on the subject of details, why would you make a alphabet that&apos;s fake?  I&apos;d love to learn it and read the different things that are spread out threw the world. I mean they even have a book in the game that says witch letter is witch, but every time i tried to use it the sentences didn&apos;t make sense. Another thing that bugs me are the frog creatures, there modelling is so bad in comparison to the rest of the game i wish they could use more time on them. They have big eyes that stares in to your soul and it ruins a lot for me. Because of this the towns feel un-lively and deserted. And i can&apos;t forget about the hair on some of these characters, it looks awful, it&apos;s if you just put a mop on there head and said &quot;done&quot;.
<br>Enough about the astethics , what&apos;s the story? Well the story is pretty simpel, you&apos;re the nephew of an adventurer called Fred who hasn&apos;t been seen for a while. So you go to his house, only to find out he&apos;s not there. You also find a suit and because you&apos;re a brat who doesn&apos;t respect others property you put it on. Then you continue to his lab and end up on a platform that sends you to a new world. Your mission is now to find Fred your uncle. I like the story, it&apos;s simpel with somewhat of a twist at the end that i won&apos;t spoil, even tho i&apos;m not sure it&apos;s even a spoiler. I do have a problem and it&apos;s not as much as a problem with the story as the voices and the dialog. The dialog is so akward at some times. It feels so false and forced. The only voice  i enjoyed was Freds voice. It fitted him pefectly and so did his dialog.
<br>The gameplay is pretty straight forward, but so much fun. The main mechanic in this game is that you got a suit that can shoot a beam at almost any surface and you get sucked to that surface, but once you used that one beam you got none left until you land on solid ground. You can upgrade it to have 3 beams. It&apos;s a really fun mechanic that doesn&apos;t get old. Now this isn&apos;t the only thing to keep you occupied, we also get a jetpack upgrade later in the game that lets you fly for about 20 seconds in one direction. When you use the jetpack you get the greatest feel ever. It&apos;s kinda hard to explain, but you feel like the most awesome kid in the street.
<br>All in all this game is great and it&apos;ll probably last about 3 hours for players that&apos;s good at first person platformers  and 5 hours for newer people to the genra. It also has a time traile mod that gives it a little replay-value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-story-about-my-uncle/user-reviews?user_review_id=4755940">Expand</a></span>

<br>I really like this game because it&#xB4;s like a game should be: FUN! And excitement! And NO killing and other negative things nowadays are common for &quot;games&quot;. This is really a GOOD game to play:
<br>- the graphic is fantastic, I think it uses Unreal Engine 4? It really looks awesome!
<br>- the sound effects are atmospheric, the voice acting is great,
<br>- although the game is sometimes hard, due tue endless &quot;lifes&quot;, it&#xB4;s quite a challenge and makes fun!
<br>- I would say it&#xB4;s a mix of Beyond Good &amp; Evil and Mirrors Edge.
<br>
<br>This is an Indie game which really rocks! I give it 10/10, because it&#xB4;s great and even can compete with AAA-titles!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-story-about-my-uncle/user-reviews?user_review_id=5221678">Expand</a></span>

The controls are a bit clunky and the voice acting is rather bad, though charming. There are times where I felt completely immersed, marveling at the pretty settings and layouts and times when I was just annoyed at the mechanics and the repetitive nature of its gameplay. After a while it just became quite one-note and a little boring. It&apos;s a cute little game, that is fun to a certain extent with an initially enjoyable gameplay mechanic that unfortunately gets old rather fast, but I would still recommend it, even though I found it a bit underwhelming and a bit frustrating at times, it&apos;s still a unique and charming indie game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/a-story-about-my-uncle/user-reviews?user_review_id=7370928">Expand</a></span>
