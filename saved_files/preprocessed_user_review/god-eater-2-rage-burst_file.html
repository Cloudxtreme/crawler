<br>God Eater 2 is a solid game, and I give my stamp of approval. If you don&apos;t play MH, and are into these kinds of games you&apos;ll love it. If you DO play MH it becomes less a little less appealing though. The game has its strong points (story, beautiful anime artstyle) but it&apos;s not as engaging, the hunts are far too quick and the areas are smaller. Im playing it just because I like to diversify and see what&apos;s out there. I enjoyed the first but I think it just got a little stale for me in the sequel. So I&apos;m scoring it an 8 despite having grown bored of it, cause it&apos;s at least as good as Resurrection which I did enjoy.
<br>
<br>Idk. It&apos;s a good game and I recommend. Not as good as Monster Hunter (nothing ever is) but enjoyable all the same. Especially good deal since it comes with Resurrection</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/god-eater-2-rage-burst/user-reviews?user_review_id=6699600">Expand</a></span>
