<br>
<br>The 2% that has changed has changed for the good. An example, if you surround an opponents unit with several of your own units who have still got their shooting action for the turn left, you get a bonus when you attack. In the old panzer general you had to attack with one, then another then another, with no benefit for each attack.  Although you still launch the attacks separately you get a bonus for each neighbouring unit, making outflanking and swamping that really tough enemy unit a viable (and realistic) tactic.
<br>
<br>If you were a panzer general fan then I would say it is a no brainer, you MUST buy this game.   If you are not ancient enough to have played the original game and are looking for a really interesting strategic WW2 game then look no further...

I loved Panzer General in those days I and played that game to exhaustion. Panzer Corps is everything that Panzer General was and it had its terrific gameplay further improved. Another reviewer has already commented that now you get a bonus when attacking an enemy unit for each of your units that is next to it, making swamping a unit, a viable tactic. But no one seems to have commented on one of the most important gameplay refinements, that you are now able to move or attack with a unit, then change to another units (or units) and then come back later to finish with the remaining movement or attack of the original unit. This freedom to attack/move in any order that you wish makes for a much more interesting game. Another interesting new twist is that recon units may move, stop, spot the terrain and move again (spending one movement point each time that they stop and move again) and they are able to move one hex at a time even when next to an enemy unit. Artillery and strategic bombers inflict suppression as in the original game but the presentation is also better in Panzer Corps. You may also overstrength your more experienced units between scenarios (instead of having to do it in the middle of a scenario like in Panzer General). All those improved rules make Panzer Corps shine even more than Panzer General.<br>The game also has a very good tutorial campaign that explains all these rules very well and it includes a few new scenarios like the invasion of the USA at the end of a very successful axis campaign.<br>Finally, the only reason I did not rate it as a 10 is that the game is somewhat expensive and the African scenarios from the original do not exist here (nor the invasion of Crete) and the AI, although better than the AI in Panzer General, still does not know how to attack very well. It defends itself better but it still does not know how to use effectively the different combat units in order to take a city with lesser losses, for example.<br>The only other complaint I can think of is that I haven&apos;t had a decent night&apos;s sleep in over a week now...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/panzer-corps/user-reviews?user_review_id=1718585">Expand</a></span>

They&apos;re wargames of the everyman, far less complex than Steel Panthers or pretty much anything by the famed Gary Grigsby.  Those are great games, too, but Panzer General was the gateway to its more complex cousins.  Today, Panzer Corps is every bit the spiritual successor to those classic titles and does not disappoint.  Deep enough to be engaging, simple enough to be picked up quickly, Panzer Corps does it all right.  If you enjoy strategy games that are accessible while still being complex enough to require thought and planning for a few turns ahead, then Panzer Corps is for you.  If you remember and love the old Panzer General Series (Panzer General 2 is available on Good Old Games), then Panzer Corps is doubly for you.  Well made, stable, and hours of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/panzer-corps/user-reviews?user_review_id=1703368">Expand</a></span>

<br>But i wouldnt mind that at all to be honest.. IF it was done right. But they **** it up, and heres why.
<br>
<br>SO youre comanding front/ army group. for example.. campaing in poland.. and your units suppose to represent ..div?/reg/ bat? ok.. so we can order aa for example flak 36 or something, wait a minute..whole unit flak36? hm.. how about tanks? pzr 2? at ? So units actually represent single units..but they are placed on grand scale map scenario and they are switched to div./bat/reg? HOW THOSE THAT MAKE SENSE???
<br>
<br>It dosent..instead of making like Eastern front.. battle on &quot;local&quot; level..where you started with your own platoon.. and every single unit in that platoon were represented..so you had 4 tanks in platoon.. and while go thru campaing you slowly progressed ..and in the end you could comand whole **** DIVISION..with ALL units..from HQ Arty..truck horses..to inf..tanks and so on..
<br>nobody of course expect them idiots to do that..but just make game that makes sense..
<br>
<br>IF youre going for large scale strategy.. make units appropriety to this scale.. morons.
<br>I wont even mention mechanics of that game..its simple as hell...
<br>
<br>Score = 1...i think its too much ..cause they coopy game.. and **** it up.. but hey they did something.
<br>LORDZ GAMES STUDIO.. are idiots and beware of their games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/panzer-corps/user-reviews?user_review_id=3948462">Expand</a></span>

Coz all other that i was waiting for and counting days till launch were major disappointment - for example Dungeons. Why? because devs didn&apos;t only want to remove dust, and make graphics little more modern - they try to make whole game a lot better then those dinosaurs did it 10 years ago so they remove everything that they can to make action faster, focus at graphics flashiness and implement 1 or 2 ideas that most certainly kill whole gampley but look good at paper and in commercials. Here with Panzer Corps we have good old Panzer General with better graphics and very little cosmetic changes to gameplay. And it&apos;s perfect -they basically only patched up Panzer General not trying to do it 3d RTS or something even more &apos;brilliant&apos;. I thank you for this mr. Panzer Corps developer you earned my respect with this and I will most certainly check out your future products. Oh and please dust up People&apos;s General also maybe it&apos;s only Panzer General clone but NATO vs communist China with modern weaponry gave me very nice weeks of gameplay those i don&apos;t know? 10 years ago?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/panzer-corps/user-reviews?user_review_id=1761966">Expand</a></span>

I played all the older SSI games (from panzer general to panzer general 2 to allied general, peoples general and even fantasy and star general). So if Sliterhine wants to expand on Panzer Corps the still have ample opportunities to do so. But first I am looking forward to the expansion campaign sets.</span>

It&apos;s not &quot;one more turn&quot;, but rather one more battle.  ;o)  The game does a number of things exceptionally well.  Although a turn-based war game it is not a hard core uber-complex Grognard game at all, but rather in the &quot;easy to learn, hard to master&quot; category that rewards a thoughtful combined arms approach.  Also, the level of abstraction in the game was a stroke of brilliance: the game consists of several branching campaigns, and although the battles are at the operational level (i.e. the invasion of Norway, the battle of Kursk), the gameplay has a very tactical &quot;bang, bang, shoot them up&quot; feel to it.  It works very well, however, and the battles have a surprisingly high degree of historical accuracy, abstractions notwithstanding.  Perhaps most importantly though, by being able to purchase, upgrade, rename, and carry over units from battle to battle, the game has a distinct role-playing feel to it which makes it extremely compelling.  And I should also mention that the unit choices and upgrades available to you are nearly enormous.  You can eventually even obtain the ME-262 and Komet fighters, to say nothing of a few advanced heavy bombers that as far as I know never made it to production.  It&apos;s also interesting to note that you play a very de-Naziffied Germany in this game.  No where is &apos;The Fuhrer&apos; ever mentioned.  This is a good thing though, as the Germans in WW2 created the most efficient military machine the world has ever seen and they are a blast to play.    The only real down side to the game is that if you don&apos;t decisively defeat the Allies in the early-to-mid war you may find yourself facing long odds by mid-1944, although to be fair this of course was the case historically.  Still in all it can be very demoralizing to see the magnificent military machine you&apos;ve painstakingly built up and led through many hard-fought battles in 1939-43 get trashed by superior Allied numbers in 1944-45.  Losing one of your &apos;pet&apos; units is almost like seeing a favorite companion killed in Fallout: New Vegas.  ;o)  Still in all this game is a gem and an instant classic, and one that I will probably come back to at least a couple of times a year.  If you are a fan of historical strategy games this one is not to be missed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/panzer-corps/user-reviews?user_review_id=1765002">Expand</a></span>

Waiting more than a decade for a sequel to Panzer General II, Panzer Corps was a relief. Embraced the basic concepts of the original game and added a few new features. I hope the next release involves much modern graphics and game engine.</span>

Thorough tutorial introduces the easy to learn but difficulty to master unit tactics for new players.  Scenarios are fantastically well done and challenging requiring the mastery of a variety of tactics.  Great introductory war game but also great for anyone looking to relive the nostalgia of the old masterpieces.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/panzer-corps/user-reviews?user_review_id=1789111">Expand</a></span>

I got through the campaigns rather quickly and some new material really would have been welcomed and even expected at the offered price. The PBEM system should have also included being able to save to stick or sending by my personal email as well. Well, those things overall were relatively minor, thus the 1 pt. off. I hope we get some more re-makes of the rest of the PG series as well as those wonderful other games like Steel Panthers for use on today&apos;s equipment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/panzer-corps/user-reviews?user_review_id=1853326">Expand</a></span>

<br>My main point of criticism is the price of this game. I understand it is like a fine ivory set of chess, which you buy only if you can appreciate the genre, but still its price greatly exceeded my expectations.
<br>Another point of criticism, is the game is not really designed for high resolutions. Everything feels way too small at 1900x1080.
<br>Averaging metacritic user scores gives 9.14.

<br>Synopsis: if you feel nostalgia, install &#x201C;Panzer General II&#x201D;, but never buy &#x201C;Panzer Corps&#x201D;.
<br>For details read on.
<br>&#x201C;Panzer Corps&#x201D; is indeed like good old Panzer General II with improved (?) graphics. And that&apos;s all good I can say about this game.
<br>Graphics is awful for 2011. Yeah, I know &quot;graphics is not important for strategy game&quot; mantra. It is just an excuse for lazy developers. In fact, everybody likes everything nice.
<br>Now about main feature: strategy.
<br>You cannot rename your units in this game. While in battle, should you send &quot;Elite replacements&quot; or just &quot;Replacements&quot; to this particular unit? Developers considered you should write down names of your core units in your notepad.
<br>&quot;The bigger - the better&quot;. Nazi dream brought to virtual life in &#x201C;Panzer Corps&#x201D;! You just upgrade you units to fattest versions to be happy. Seems not realistic to me.
<br>I consider &quot;Panzer General III: Scorched Earth&quot; best game in series because it had brilliant concept of action points: every unit had action points it could you actively (moving, firing, resupplying, changing transport mode, etc.) in single attack turn or passively, like being suppressed by enemy artillery fire while in defense turn. In &#x201C;Panzer General III&#x201D; 105mm leFH was in fact superior to 155mm leFH thanks to high rate of fire (many action points). &#x201C;Camouflage&#x201D; concept in &#x201C;Panzer General III&#x201D; was brilliant as well. Units retreated when badly hurt so you had to chase them down to finish them... All that is realistic!
<br>In &#x201C;Panzer Corps&#x201D; infantry is useless. Enemy infantry just delays your progress slightly each turn.
<br>In &#x201C;Panzer Corps&#x201D; you cannot disband your core units. Not a problem? Consider this then: this game also limits quantity of your core units on particular map. So &#x201C;choose wisely&#x201D; ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/panzer-corps/user-reviews?user_review_id=4894403">Expand</a></span>

But, perfect for playing cool with tactical and strategical minds.<br>For instance i&apos;ve too Heart of Iron III, maybe more serious, but too long, too hard, not cool in fact.<br>This one, Panzer Corps, really for have a nice time.</span>

Loved playing as the Germans and will get the dlc when its cheaper too. Very addictive game, just very outdated visuals with almost non existent animations</span>
