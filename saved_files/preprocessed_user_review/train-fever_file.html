<br>
<br>It should be noted, that as of December 2014 the Developers still work on this game and release patches periodically. There is even a free DLC planned for early 2015.
<br>Due to the constant work of the devs, while listening to consumer feedback, many of the stated bugs and drawbacks written in the older reviews are fixed by now!
<br>
<br>Negative points:
<br>- for beginners, building tracks may seem complicated - actually, the building tool is quite powerful but it misses an &apos;undo&apos; or &apos;planing&apos; function
<br>- as every single person on the map is completely simulated, performance gets an issue especially in the late game
<br>- without a tutorial, rhe simulation specifications are unknown to new players - they have to inform themselves in one of the thriving communities, maybe a tutorial or at least a help in finding external tutorials would be a good idea
<br>
<br>Positive points:
<br>+ nice graphics, realistic vehicles!
<br>+ modding support, I suggest everyone to have a look at the mods available for this game as they introduce loads of new vehicles, buildings, decorations, ... Even total conversions, industry conversions, and other advanced stuff is available!
<br>+ periodic updates after release, direct contact to developers possible
<br>+ long time fun as playing through the different epochs of transportation always offers new challenges, even without a campaign
<br>
<br>Of course it should be noted. That this game serves a very specific target group. If you have fun building a transportation empire or just love model railways, Train Fever is right for you.
<br>Although it is perfectly possible to mod the game in a way that money is not an issue in the game, I do not recommend TF for casual gamers, as they have to invest a bit of time to understand the simulation concepts of the game.
<br>
<br>When taking the target group into account I can give 9/10 points with clean conscience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/train-fever/user-reviews?user_review_id=4858876">Expand</a></span>

The idea of the dynamically growing cities is interesting, but doesn&apos;t leave you needing to capitalise on the market as it grows around you. No tutorial, which is acceptable if the mechanics were not so shrouded in mystery. It is based on journey times, so there is little point in cross-city bus routes, trains are too expensive in the beginning so you are left with a couple of routes early in the game. Once you have progressed and can start in a later start date the towns are of the same size roughly as when you started in the previous time thereby not allowing you to turn a profit as the cost of infrastructure is increased but the demand remains as low as horse and cart. UI is disgusting, I have never experienced anything so micro managed and vomit inducing. The system of management of vehicles and trains is terrible, that by the time you have a large network you are left to sit and micromanage all your trains as they need to be returned to a depot to be decommissioned, which sounds fine in practice, but in reality it is just terrible. It has the scope to be quite interesting. If Cities in Motion and these guys got together it may create an interesting game. But on it&apos;s own it is nowhere near worth the price tag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/train-fever/user-reviews?user_review_id=4524620">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game just works really well and gives a solid simulation of real world mechanics giving a gamer one hell of a challenge (especially late in the game) along the way.
<br>
<br>This game can be hard to play well - and yest there are some minor bugs and annoyances in the initial release - the good news is that in spite of those issues - if you like this sort of game - TF is well worth your time and money.
<br>
<br>The game engine does a great job of simulating the running of trains but more importantly it does a great job of simulating the underling economics - to be really successful you have to combine your design, engineering and line connecting skills with the critical look of an investor or a bank loan manager.
<br>That&apos;s also where the real challenge comes from - making the lines not just run well but also be profitable.
<br>If you like answering question like where should a rail line go, how many trains should run on it and of which type - you should have lots of fun.
<br>
<br>Some reviewers here have really given this game far too little credit - probably because of some the annoyances - it&apos;s true tjat the line upgrading process is cumbersome for example - but if you do it right it becomes part of the challenge and the fun - how do I build lines with depots so that easy replacement can be achieved?
<br>Ultimately you need to break through the initial challenge and learning curve - especially if you have become accustomed to big money UI/UX driven games of the last few years - this game is more about the core engine driving the economy than about user interface (the latest simcity for example - while not as bad as some make it -  falls under this category - too much bling not enough solid mechanics, I suspect the new Civ does too).
<br>Bottom line: If you like train and/or economy sims and enjoy a decent challenge - this is a true gem - a throwback to the old days of PC gaming when figuring out any game was a real learning experience and actually involved a good chunk of the fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/train-fever/user-reviews?user_review_id=4646050">Expand</a></span>

In real life you too have to predict and plan when you want to build a new railroad track. Here it is similar, when you underestimate it, it wil be very costly, or it will end with LOAD button :-) But after few hours you will become skilled in track building and every new track will make you proud of it when the first train/bus/tram appears on it.
<br>
<br>The graphics is detailed, the cities seems like living and sometimes you stop building/managing and you can only stare at everything moving, working, living. Only the terrain outside cities could be more detailed, more trees, different scenery etc, but i believe that will come later from the creators or community.
<br>
<br>There is great modding community, so you can have a new high detailed  train/bus/tram/building model every few hours if you want, the adding of the content is very easy using the community  made  Mode manager.

<br>I you like complexity, challenge and trains, the game is for you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/train-fever/user-reviews?user_review_id=4585626">Expand</a></span>

Playability is low. The user interface is primitive, confusing and misses most basic features found in similar games.  The game challenge is very low.  It is difficult to build realistic networks. I haven&apos;t found a way to schedule or select a loading plan for vehicles.  But as there is no manual, I don&apos;t know know if this is possible or not. Graphics are dated and it is difficult to follow what is actually going on in the spreadsheet .... er game. I have seen Excel spreadsheets more fun than this. 24hrs after release there are a lot of very unhappy purchasers on the Steam forums as the poor state of the game was not revealed before launch. It has been mentioned on Steam that of 200 beta testers, 80 were investors in the game, which may explain the glowing reviews that have been published.  Hopefully the game can be fixed, but there has been no statement from the developers yet.  Even if it is I can&apos;t see it offering anything new in railroad gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/train-fever/user-reviews?user_review_id=4452786">Expand</a></span>

<br>Living and breathing cities that change as the years go by not only in size but also in style and complexity - Lots of challenges along the way to supply the ever increasing demand for goods and commuters force you rethink old strategies and adapt to the turn of the century. From simple horse carriages and early steam engines to modern Electric trams and trains, you&apos;ll be spending far too many hours playing this - if you give it a chance and live with the few annoyances it current has.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/train-fever/user-reviews?user_review_id=4452744">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re not, then perhaps this isn&apos;t your cup of tea.
<br>
<br>The game has flaws, but then again it has trains.  If you&apos;re the not the type who thinks 3D trains more than overcome some annoyances and missing features, then I&apos;d say skip this, or wait and see.
<br>
<br>So, the good: this is a game about building a transportation network for fun and profit.  It heavily features trains, but there are road vehicles and trams too.  You lay out your stations, tracks, roads (sort of) and routes.  Then you purchase train locomotives &amp; rolling stock  or road vehicles and assign them to those routes.  If you&#x2019;ve designed well, people and cargo will use your transportation and you get money.  It&#x2019;s a real joy crafting a well designed network of tracks, switches and signals and then watching your steam locos chug along efficiently.
<br>
<br>It&#x2019;s like playing with model trains, but there&#x2019;s enough game here to make it more compelling than just a train simulator (I&apos;ve played a few and found them boring after a few hours).
<br>
<br>The bad: laying down tracks and roads is complicated.  When you try to build something the way you want it, the game often cites &#x201C;collision&#x201D;.  It&#x2019;s kind of picky as to what it lets you build.  To me, it&#x2019;s entirely forgivable and I look at it as a challenge, but not everyone may agree.
<br>
<br>And there&#x2019;s no manual.  Finding out information at this early stage of the game isn&apos;t as easy as you&#x2019;d like.  Again, with experience playing Locomotion, I found the game immediately familiar and I&#x2019;m sure soon there will be much more concise info on the game from the community.
<br>
<br>Content at launch was a bit sparse &#x2013; there were no North American trains.  Sad face.
<br>
<br>But overall, I&#x2019;d still recommend buying it if you&#x2019;re into these sorts of games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/train-fever/user-reviews?user_review_id=4453619">Expand</a></span>

Sadly, the UI is unfinished and the game balance is a little bit off (trains are too expensive and there is nearly not enough demand for all the industrial goods). The developers have been busy releasing patches and if they keep on improving this game, it could very well become a classic.</span>

<br>If I want to make something a bit advanced, I have to find ways to cheat the game to make things work realisticly. I&apos;d say the game is a nice try of revamping the TTD feel, but as it stands, it lacks far too many features. I really wanted to enjoy it, but I just can&apos;t.  Soundtrack is terrible, the game runs poorly on my very powerful gaming rig, and the UI leaves a lot to be desired.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/train-fever/user-reviews?user_review_id=4509962">Expand</a></span>

<br>You can build passenger and cargo lines (with trains, bus, streetcars, trucks...) and connect the towns and industries to each other, which is fun. Cities grow when they are connected to other cities via your transportation network or get goods delivered.
<br>
<br>The simulation is very solid. Every inhabitant has a persistent home, work, a recreational area and a preferred shop where he or she likes to go.
<br>
<br>The optical presentation is nice which makes it very satisfying to watch the networks come to life. The cities are very lovely done, except sometimes the surrounding lands feels a little bit monotonous. There aren&apos;t any premade maps, instead they are procedural generated.
<br>
<br>There are some rough edges at the moment (like the UI), but the biggest oversight is that the developers somehow missed to provide a user guide and the tutorial is lacking. It doesn&apos;t explain all important things. Some people are simply lost and rely on user generated guides or youtube videos at the moment, which understandably is frustrating for some.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/train-fever/user-reviews?user_review_id=4452263">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Graphics are great.
<br>- Gameplay is good. Laying tracks could be better, but as its complex I don&apos;t know how it could improve since it allows a lot of combinations.
<br>- UI is good to me. Some people complain of being small. There is already a mod with bigger icons. You can mod yourself, as change the UI icons is as simple as replace an image in the folder of the game. Font, music, everything, simple replace it.
<br>
<br>The game give a nice environment and atmosphere of the old Locomotion, TTD and RT2.

<br>
<br>Good:
<br>- modern graphics engine
<br>- detailed models
<br>- it&apos;s really fun
<br>- speed of trains is adjusted based on angle of curve, incline/decline and some other factors
<br>- tracks must follow the same rules as real world train tracks (eg. no steep hills, no sharp turns, 90 degree road crossings)
<br>- cities grow dynamically (depends on quality of your transportation network)
<br>- train signals are easy to manage, they work like path signals in openTTD.
<br>- maps are procedurally generated
<br>
<br>Neutral
<br>- steep learning curve
<br>- user interface is ok, but nothing special.
<br>
<br>Bad:
<br>- poor tutorial
<br>- no user manual

<br>This is not so much a game as a collection of error messages and vague economic models. At first glance this game seems to provide a much needed graphical boost to the ancient Transport Tycoon series and its open source sequel OpenTTD. Gone are the square blocks and 45 degree corners. It looks pretty.
<br>
<br>But then you try to upgrade a dirt track railroad crossing and can&apos;t because of endless collisions that can&apos;t be fixed. Road bridges are near impossible to build. So your transport network grinds to a halt as highways are bottle necked by dirt roads you can&apos;t replace.
<br>
<br>The economic models is unclear to say the least even on the official forum people seem to be guessing at how to increase a city. And for a game called train fever, buses and trams seem to fare far better.  A simple problem is that traffic demand never increases to the point you really need trains. Cargo demands especially are so low and close together it makes more sense to create a trucking network then a rail network. Each city has a limited demand for goods. Why send a train capable of moving 100 goods if demand is 30. Supply chains are simplistic, deliver raw good to factory, deliver produced goods.
<br>
<br>The game in theory has potential but the game devs need to learn that error messages in a game are bad, especially an engineering game. The real world is filled with countless examples of engineers figuring out how to build seemingly impossible bridges, tunnels and roads.
<br>
<br>You shouldn&apos;t get endless error messages just trying to have a road cross a railroad track at right angles. Or trying to build a bridge or a tunnel.
<br>
<br>Even if these issues are fixed, the game will remain very basic. Switches are simplistic, signaling the most bassic, trains can&apos;t use multiple platforms, train stations are all the same model.
<br>
<br>For a game, the mechanics are to finicky and unclear and for a building game, the building is to awkward.
<br>
<br>If you want to simulate this game, start up an online game and cancel your internet subscription. You will have more success doing that then trying to build anything beyond the basics in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/train-fever/user-reviews?user_review_id=4812632">Expand</a></span>

<br>...ma questo gruppetto scarno di sviluppatori nemmeno quello &#xE8; riuscito a fare. La difficolt&#xE0; estrema coincia gi&#xE0; dall&apos;interfaccia, un gruppo di finestre di testo sparate a caso nell&apos;interfaccia e quasi sempre posizionate una sull&apos;altra, gi&#xE0; dal tutorial (se di tutorial vogliamo parlare...).
<br>Tutorial che per l&apos;appunto, dovendoti spiegare le basi del gioco, quando ti consiglia di collegare le due citt&#xE0; con una ferrovia non considera che se per sbaglio non riesci a piazzare bene un tratto di binari (e capita, visto che il posizionamento lo si fa tenendo premuto il pulsante sinistro del mouse, lo scorrimento lo si fa tenendo premuto il pulsante destro e, se per caso non hai azzecato l&apos;impostazione visiva prima di iniziare l&apos;azione, arrivare alla rotellina per settare lo zoom potrebbe accidentalmente farti rilasciare uno dei tasti) cancellandolo hai gi&#xE0; esaurito il credito necessario per acquistare il treno.
<br>la creazione dei binari, quando si riesce a mantenere una sorta di equilibrio di tasti premuti del mouse, &#xE8; automatizzata al punto tale (ponti, gallerie, rimozione terrapieni e curvatura decisa dal sistema) che se sbagli di qualche millimetro il posizionamento ti mangia met&#xE0; dei fondi per eseguire le opere di adattamento del terreno, oltre all impossibilit&#xE0; totale di poter creare intersezioni a livello stradale (costringendoti a creare infrastrutture costosissime per superare una piccola strada di campagna).
<br>Anche la parte che riguarda i trasporti pubblici segue una sua strana logica dove, se un mezzo deve andare da A a B, magicamente seguir&#xE0; un percorso a P invece che avanti e indietro, aumentando i tempi ed i costi di gestione.
<br>Questo tipo di gioco non sa dove posizionarsi se tra il genere simulativo, tycoon o quant&apos;altro, riunendo alcuni punti di forza che resero celebri altri giochi tripla A passati (Locommotion, Railorad&apos;s) ma allo stesso tempo riuscendo anche a denigrarli completamente creando uno sconforto generale di chi sta al di l&#xE0; del monitor e vorrebbe vedere un feeling positivo, un accostamento divertente o comunque che appassioni (le sfide tycoon sono ormai impronta storica e standard per questo tipo di giochi).
<br>Insomma, a conti fatti se di programma vogliamo parlare non ci sono molti punti a sfavore. ben fatto, pochi bug, quasi nessun artefatto grafico, una buona componente texture e spazio per aggiunta mod, ma siccome parliamo di un videogioco con cui (ovviamente) si vuole interagire, se proprio si vuole sorvolare sulla difficolt&#xE0; di approccio dell&apos;interfaccia ci si ritrover&#xE0; comunque davanti all&apos;impenetrabile muraglia di un gioco che nemmeno lui sa cosa vuole essere, e cosa vuole trasmetterti, e queste sono cose che purtroppo con una Mod non si risolvono.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/train-fever/user-reviews?user_review_id=4530593">Expand</a></span>
