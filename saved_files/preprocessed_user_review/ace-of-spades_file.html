Well, what can i say: I am a bit disappointed there. I thought i get to design whole maps to tear them down. I thought i could host my own game.  But NO, said STEAM (or JagEx, the company behind the game). From what i read so far, the game was bought by them from a single programmer and then totally altered in a unpleasant way? Anyhow, here go my big let-down facts:
<br>
<br>A) NO Editor whatsoever. There is said to be an editor to do that called VOXEL, but that thing is post-alpha pre-beta status, a pain in the ass to use and it is not delivered with the game. SO, YOU CAN NOT DESIGN OWN MAPS.
<br>
<br>B) ah yes, the maps. THERE ARE ONLY 4-5 MAPS. for ALL the gaming modes. tedious as hell.
<br>
<br>C) THE GAMING MODES: THERE IS LIKE 4 OF THEM. and Demolition is about the most fun. and that&apos;s it. D) YOU CAN NOT HOST YOUR OWN GAME. no possibility ingame to get a server running. i heard there is a tool delivered with the game to do that, but it is not to be found in the steam download and from what i read - a pain in the ass, just like the editor.
<br>
<br>E) SERVERS ARE **** pings are enormous, you get timeout warnings all the time, lagging, what have you.  F) building is totally not half as important as it is mentioned in the ad text. you CAN add own blocks to repair your base and such, but that is boring. Conclusion: i would love to give that game at least a 5 out of 10, since it is new on steam, can be patched easily and i hope that jagex will improve the game. but my gaming experience tells me: this game was released half finished of what it COULD have been to get the company a quick buck, and it will never see any more improvement. it&apos;s still not a total **** thanks to the demolition mode, it&apos;s fine for a quick round now and then, but yeah......as i said. i doubt it will see many patches and/or important and needed improvements as &quot;setting up your own server&quot; and &quot;designing your own maps easily&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2824166">Expand</a></span>

Where are the different game modes? Why have they changed the entire concept of Ace of Spades from a WW1 environment to some magical fantasy land? Unlike the beta, there is virtually no point in building your own fortresses/trenches etc because there is no room to do so nor is there any point. There is no team work whatsoever and everyone is an individual fighting for themselves. Overall, a poor result of a game that had so much potential to be great. Do not spend $10 on this game, It&apos;s honestly not even worth $5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2825164">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You&apos;d really expect Jagex to fix all the things they&apos;ve done to Runescape and complete the new sci-fi MMORPG called Stellar Dawn that they were working on for years. NO, they spent the money on making this **** game right after CANCELING Stellar Dawn because they had to use their RESOURCES to work on RuneScape instead!
<br>
<br>Really, I have seen several awful game companies, and I really thought The War Z had the worst game company I had ever seen. However, when I think back on it, Jagex has had the worst customer support of any game I have ever played! Never EVER have i received a message from a Jagex Moderator that was not computer generated. Why would you want to send them a support message though? Because they don&apos;t have any phone number you can contact them on if something happens to your game account.
<br>
<br>Now the real question is, do they support the customers?
<br>
<br>*drumroll*
<br>
<br>No, they leave a first impression that slaps you in the face and burns into your brain.
<br>
<br>Remember, stay away from Ace of Spades, stay away from RuneScape and STAY AWAY FROM JAGEX!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2858331">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>People can jetpack over huge patches of the map quickly and weapons do little damage per shot, meaning people will never feel the need to build cover. This combined with small maps leads to COD style run in and shoot gameplay. You can often see the enemy spawn area from where you spawn in and fire on enemies within seconds. It&apos;s a waste of a great concept and most definitely a waste of money. Avoid at all costs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2826071">Expand</a></span>

What Jagex have done to the original game is absolutely horrible and they have turned AoS into a much more commercial &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; style game. The very heart and soul of the original has been stripped, and I seriously recommend that those who still want to play Ace of Spades, play the beta version, which is being kept alive on a website called &quot;build and shoot&quot;.
<br>I&apos;m giving this game 1 star for being fun to play, but it loses 9 because of how much Jagex stripped it of everything that made the game lovable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2852679">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Jagex wants to turn this into a cash cow like call of duty. That was clear with all their DLC plans. They didn&apos;t give it a month before trying to spring the valentines day stuff on people. Segregating maps almost instantly for those who bought it and those who didn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Its a class based shooter thats trying to be fast paced, Its minecraft with explosions, its trying to be a modern fps styled title, It really wishes it was tf2 in minecraft. (seriously just play the minecraft maps if you want that kinda fun).
<br>
<br>The problems with this game are the following: Destruction is too easy, you can build but why bother when a single rocket can destroy an entire  structure if fired right. Matches become almost instantly leveled and leave some classes at a supreme advantage: snipers, rocketeers.
<br>Snipers have been nerfed, this is largely due to the fact that spawns are locked, if your team is losing and getting spawn camped, you have no method of avoiding damage.
<br>Regarding the sniper issues, maps are asymmetrical most of the time. Meaning that one side will usually have a distinct advantage over the other.
<br>
<br>Gone are the stealthy digging and listening for a tunnel in the first one, classic mode is a joke. Its barely even the classic mode from the original. Some may disagree, but prebuilt maps with interesting geometry kinda defeats the entire point of the build and shoot aspect.
<br>
<br>Finally, Their servers are complete and total trash. East coast servers on east coast even with good ping is like 100+ms, anyone outside of that is going to get several hundred more. No private server hosting either, they have plans for players to pay a small moderate fee however, so you may be able to rent custom server space in this turd of a game.
<br>
<br>1/10  Jagex once again smothers a game with desperate attempts to leech money in non subtle ways.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=3169093">Expand</a></span>

<br>I did form this opinion before I actually played the new version, but then Steam lent it to us for free for a weekend so I decided to justify my reasoning for anger. The game was just as bad as I made it out to be.
<br>I have also heard that Jagex is working to get the sites where you can play the original version removed, if that is true; to hell with them.

A lot of people compare it to the older versions but I&apos;ve never played the older versions and I love this game.  Maybe more frequent updates, maybe another character but still.  Very enjoyable.</span>

<br>1: Building   Why should you build? There is no reason to do so if there&apos;s enough cover in the map already. I love the idea of being able to break stuff and dig, and possible build a little, but the building aspect is no fun. After building something you wana fell accomplished, and happy. The game doesn&apos;t really make that happen. Even when you build something nice it will most likely get blown up soon. If they implemented a game mode where you would have like 2-5 minutes to build and what you build couldn&apos;t get blown up instantly, that would be great! But no such thing exist.
<br>
<br>2: The Classes  There are 4 classes, Marksman, Miner, Rocketeer, and Commando. Each class kinds of does something different. Marksman is supposed to be support and help clear out enemies. It is way to effective. There is almost no reason to not just be Marksman, kill people from far away, and advance. It can kill ANYTHING with the bid maps that are usually outside. And the other classes can&apos;t deal damage from that far away. Next class, the Miner. He&apos;s supposed to build and dig tunnels and stuff. But why would you do that!?! Like I said before, building or digging isn&apos;t a very good idea and most likely thing to happen if you build or dig is someone comes and blows it all up. What could be able to do that you might ask? EVERY OTHER CLASS! The Miner should be specialized in building and digging and also destroying other enemie Miners stuff. Other classes shouldn&apos;t be able to easily come in and and shoot down what you build or destroy it with a grenade. Next class, Rocketeer. Rocketeer used to be quite OP with the old jet pack it had. Jagex saw this and looked for a solution. They should have nerfed it instead of removing it. Now all there is is a bad jet pack that makes you go up for 2-5 seconds. Yeah, that thing is useless. Next class, Commando. I think this is one of the best, most balanced class that does what its supposed to do. Kill everything in close range combat. Except other classes(Marksman) can easily kill you for this. Marksman can kill you from afar, witch makes sense, but can also easily kill you with its pistol. Yeah, that makes sense.
<br>
<br>Well, I advise you don&apos;t buy it as the time of this post. The game has had some changes towards getting better, but still lacks in lost of things. It says that it you will be able to &quot;Unleash your imagination in an ever evolving battlefield.&quot; The only thing it offers is bad, unbalanced combat, with OP classes and bad hit boxes. Its also not a surprise very few people seem to play it now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=3276968">Expand</a></span>

<br>Sadly, the extremely over-powered Marksman class isn&apos;t my biggest complaint with this game. The spawns are. You spawn in the same place every single time, regardless of if enemies are right in your spawn. I&apos;m always dying as soon as I spawn, making it nearly impossible to even play.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t reccomend this game at all, it&apos;s broken, and you will regret your purchase within half an hour or so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=3833047">Expand</a></span>

The whole building idea is pointless due to the jet pack class just fly&apos;s over the whole map and the rocket class just blows it up faster than you can build. Do not buy this see if you can play the free version.</span>

<br>But after I bought the game, which is only about 5-6 dollars (because of the steam winter sale), I was very disappointing.  It&apos;s just plain not fun. The only reason I&apos;m not giving it a terrible score is because it&apos;s a pretty cheap game.</span>

For a &apos;fully released&apos; game, that is absolutely unacceptable! After uninstalling it, and leaving it sitting in my Steam account for a while, I decided to give it another try. I mean, the devs should have had the time to fix the bugs, right? Wrong. In fact, it is even worse now! After two crashes, the game won&apos;t even start. Literally, it just stops, right before even the black start-up screen! But the thing that really puts Ace of Spades in the hole for good is that instead of working hard to fix the bugs, Jagex is releasing DLC... Jagex is turning into EA, but without the eventual great game.

I immediately bought the game as it was released on Steam and well...was very surprised of the LACK of readiness this game was for a mainstream market. I didn&apos;t even expect this game to have fancy graphics (which it didn&apos;t) I really was looking forward to a well-built game engine as experienced with Minecraft....but fell VERY, VERY short of my expectations and consistency in game play. I have never bought a game on Steam that I had felt like my $10 instantly burned up upon purchasing. Realistically this game should be .99 and believe they moved the decimal over once space was an insult to the original developer&apos;s product and open-source attitude.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2841907">Expand</a></span>

After all, these guys aren&apos;t about quality games, at least, not anymore. It&apos;s all about money money money, so what do they do to achieve that? Combine the favorite 3 things of every 13 year old: minecraft, guns and team fortress. And there you have it, the worst game out there.

It had strategy, creativity, and the promise of always being free! But then Jagex bought the game and proceeded to mess it up. The games now a Terraria/COD/Minecraft mashup. Not necessarily a bad thing, but the servers are incredibly laggy, and building is not as much as fun as it was before, mostly due to the ease of destroying them now, and the snipers don&apos;t do nearly enough damage. It&apos;s defiantly got it&apos;s problems now. But for 5 American dollars it was worth it. Despite these problems I still had fun, though it could have been better. And hey, maybe Jagex will work to fix some of these problems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2875678">Expand</a></span>

Once they brought it to Steam, everything went downhill.  The use of a master server was probably the worst idea they could have thought of so far, because all the servers lag and game play is almost impossible because you are always missing your shots, or getting sniped.  Remind you of something?  Oh yeah, COD.  When I was buying the game, I expected something great like the standalone but instead I got this crap.  I hope you guys are reading the reviews here and decide to use the $10 that we all wasted on this game to make it better.

Well, I&apos;ve tried it for a few days now and here is my impression of the game broken down into points.
<br>
<br>The game feels and looks as if it was made by a European toy company. It looks like Legos with guns aimed at a demographic of 8-12 year olds. It seems like a rushed production where  the goal was to make it look attractive, promote it the same way you would toys, and sell as many copies as possible right after launch. They even use reviews from video game review websites/companies such as IGN, before a proper review could be made, leading to my suspicion, that as always, these sites/companies were paid for a positive review. IGN for example has been suspected many times of being paid to give a game a positive review.
<br>
<br>The maps were made by artists and not level designers. In fact, level design seems to be non-existent in the maps. It feels more like artists took inspiration from levels from other games and made an attempt to make maps like them. With no destructible terrain, the maps might be half decent. No one that worked on the levels took into account how destructive the classes/weapons are and did not use that knowledge in designing. However, those who designed the levels themselves do not seem to have either the knowledge or experience to design proper maps. For example, the map: London Bridge, has spawn points for both teams somewhat perpendicular to the orientation of the bridge. In other words, rather than facing eachother from opposite sides of the bridge and thus the bridge would become a key element in map control, the bridge is nothing more than useless eye candy. Both teams spawn practically on one side of the bridge and face eachother over a curving part of river. Both teams also spawn on one side and corner of the map, rather than exactly opposite eachother.
<br>
<br>Lastly, I understand at launch, every game has bugs in it that eventually get fixed. Ace of Spades 1.0 however not only has shoddy netcode, but it also seems to suffer from many memory leaks. The clientside to server side updating is some of the most horrible I&apos;ve ever seen. Sometimes, it seems like the server can&apos;t decide if you hit an enemy or haven&apos;t or where you really are on the map. I can&apos;t count how many times I warped back and forth between 2 coordinates. The memory leaks are noticeable from the graphics. Even at the lowest settings on a fast system with a new card, more than adequate ram, high end processor, the FPS is still all over the place and gradually degrades as you play the game. From a programming perspective, I&apos;m starting to be suspicious that they took the original engine and layered all the new elements in the game on top of it and hoped that it would be able to handle a heightened graphic level and many more effects such as increased particle effects. If this is true, the original engine is getting bogged down by all the extra work and was not originally designed to handle so much.
<br>
<br>In summary, like I said, if feels like it was made by a toy company for the sole purpose of immediate profits. It really does look and feel like someone took Legos and weapons and threw them into pot and then pushed the digital version of that pot out the door as fast as possible.  And I&apos;m saying that while trying to be straightforward and give an honest opinion without hate or any negative intent.
<br>
<br>I think it&apos;s going to take Jagex a lot of work to fix the list of problems with their game, if they would like to continue to make money off of it. I support any company that wants to sell a game. Game making is very hard work and takes a lot of resources. However, quality is what makes or breaks a game. Time will tell. Buyer beware. Buy the game if you feel that there is still promise there and that they can still improve to a point of being a quality game. Thanks for reading,

I won&apos;t rip on the lag issue since I hope they are actually working on it but I will complain about the lack of private servers. It looks like Jagex wants to keep tally of all the users scores for competitions or something. This is an annoyance and Jagex should place the social media aspect on the back burner since this game has more then enough problems and I really doubt they will ever hit that point since this has all the feel of an inexperienced team taking on more then they can handle.    The game can not decide if it is a team based game tactical game or a quick paced twitch deathmatch.
<br>Of course team play wise it&apos;s not there. This game just screams team play build forts and fight in them but no, combat happens to quickly and the pace is far to fast to actually consider doing anything with your team members. But don&apos;t worry all the classes and weapons are horribly unbalanced, despite the fact that none of them could hurt a wounded kitten, I&apos;ll give them credit for that should be considered a feat to make some guns suck that much less to stick out from the bunch.    They tacked on the classes without thinking about how they will play in relation with other classes. The rocketeer and miner end up negating any reason to build fortifications. And even if they didn&apos;t the combat occurs at a fast pace that you will feel lucky if you know what is going on.    The biggest problem I have with this game other then the lackluster guns and the poor attempt at recreating TF2 in minecraft is the fact that they neglected the construction and have made no attempt to actually build that into the game play or build the classes around this game play mechanic, Ok I lied some classes can build unique prefabbed structures while others can&apos;t but that means little when I noticed another problem.    After playing one hour I noticed I wasn&apos;t building anything so I tried, and the placement mechanics are awful and after 3 attempts, Read get shot while I slowly move my mouse around to put down a green wall to cower behind I noticed it&apos;s pointless to do so when the whole map is covered with an even density of both teams equally everywhere and half of everyone is strapped with a rocket pack that allows them to ignore things like my obstacle while the other half is equipped with a death drill that treats my obstacle like a tissue.    Have I mentioned if you are playing something other then rocketeer or miner you are looking for a long painful not fun slog.  Yep it&apos;s true, the developer decided to place iron sights into this game (There should be something like a swear jar for developers and every time the think &quot;Iron sights&quot; they get punched) The pace of the game makes using them obnoxious, it&apos;s like you can tell the developer realized &quot;Hey this should be a tactical game that should be of a slower pacing then normal shooters and focusing on teamwork and planning&quot; but then proceeded to huff paint for the next hour while pretending to code Quake.    Well I can rant more but I am getting tired, the biggest fault of this game is it doesn&apos;t break any molds. I know it has the blocks and destructive terrain but it never uses them in a fun or interesting manner. It&apos;s just a really poorly put together FPS and if they decide to remove the block destruction/construction (not like they were using it for anything good) I will consider giving it a score of 1 instead of 0.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2826169">Expand</a></span>

The music is ok but gets annoying after a while. However the game does require strategy and skill so that&apos;s a plus. Dlc offers minimum addition to the game and costs $5.

I had played the game when it was in beta, and it was fun due to being simple and encouraging digging and building. Now, they made it a class warfare game, similar to TF2. The difference is that TF2 is fun and has 9 classes. Ace of Spades has 4, and they aren&apos;t better than the 3 different primary weapon choices from beta. You cannot build because everything explodes. Rocket launchers, landmines, TNT, and so much more. Also, when someone dies, they turn into a tombstone (Which, if they were trying to be funny, is a pathetic attempt at a joke), which also explodes and destroys a small amount of blocks, making even killing your enemies ruin your buildings and trenches. The sniper rifle&apos;s accuracy is so bad, a broken flintlock pistol shot at a target from a mile away is more accurate, and that is just sad. Please do not buy this, even if you did play the beta, because it will never live up to it&apos;s beta.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2971854">Expand</a></span>

Now, the problem is: The servers are incredibly laggy, the snipers don&apos;t do a lot of damage, and building is not as much as fun as it was before. Though I am sure Jagex will fix the lag issues soon.</span>

If I wanted a game with the same pace of multi player I would be dishing out $60 (6 times it price) for Call of Duty Black Ops 2, or maybe if I wanted a Minecraft game I would buy Minecraft for $30 (3 times the price), so in all I would spend $90 to get the best of both worlds, or I could get a game which fits both of them together for a 1/9th the price! And I feel like this game has a future due to the fact the developers are constantly updating, and making it better! Not to mention the DLC&apos;s!!!! In my opinion this game is better than minecraft or Black Ops. Sometimes you don&apos;t want a storyline, sometimes you want a fun time that is quick, easy, accessible, and over all a amazing work!

Allow me to explain: For those of you that only heard of this game when it was released on Steam, and still think it&apos;s bad, you can only imagine how the fans of the original game feel. And I myself am a fan of the original game. The reason it attracted so many people in its early days was that it was simplistic. Very simplistic. The map was entirely featureless, with only a few green hills and a river. The weapon was a rifle. There was no mini-map. It was a game based entirely on skill. The building elements actually made a difference, with walls actually holding off the enemy, and tunnels actually allowing you to infiltrate their bases. Then I played this new version. Buildings are essentially useless now, with the inclusion of bazookas and TNT and other explosives. There&apos;s now four classes. There&apos;s new weapons that make the rifle effectively useless. It got turned from a fun little &quot;Minecraft with Guns&quot; into &quot;Call of Duty with Minecraft elements&quot; and that makes me sick.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2950402">Expand</a></span>

Lag plagues servers and the general feel of shooting and engaging in combat is a very flat one which leaves little impression.</span>

<br>PROS:
<br>+ It is pretty awesome to be in the middle of a firefight, your cover is destroyed and you either build more or start digging a trench to hide in.  + The commando feels great as a hybrid of the soldier/heavy in TF2
<br>+the rocketeer has a nifty turret/useful jetpack
<br>+the miner has a great shotgun(though it&apos;s useless at anything other than EXTREME close range imo) and the mining rocket is a fun toy to kill people with or actually mine with.  CONS:
<br>-The buliding aspect works but it&apos;s not as realized as I&apos;d like. It&apos;s a cool concept but it&apos;s not utilized in most modes as much as I thought it would be (building is an absolute must in the zombie mode but in other modes there&apos;s no necessity to build).
<br>-The class based combat is not anywhere near TF2 levels of synchronicity.  -the sniper feels weak ( the sniper rifle feels inconsistent with the number of headshots to kill, or I just suck lol).
<br>
<br>Verdict: MEH.  It&apos;s fun in short doses. It&apos;s not a horrible game but it&apos;s definitely not a must play. I got it for 5$ and feel that it&apos;s worth maybe that but definitely wouldn&apos;t recommend paying more for this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2881906">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Here&apos;s why:
<br>Mash up&apos;s are fun  Mixing the minecraft style and combat like Team Fortress 2 is a strange and enjoyable mix. Simplcity  From the design it&apos;s self to the gameplay, there&apos;s noting here that requires a great deal of for-thought, making it a fun game to mindless play with friends. Zombie Mode  Easily my personal favourite mode (though the VIP gangster is a close second), you can create all kinds of strange and impressive forts to try and keep the zombies at bay. (Personally, I&apos;ve had great success with the miner with the snowball gun, building complicated spider like bridges to the ground in many locations, making it more difficult for the zombies to collapse the building under you. )
<br>
<br>Clearly this game isn&apos;t for everyone, but the reviews here seem rather unfair to the game that lets you shoot a satellite down in the moon base map </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2966677">Expand</a></span>

Not only that  but the scenery is hard on the eyes and easily makes the game less enjoyable. Long story short, do not buy this game, you will be wasting 10$.</span>

It was action packed shooter goodness, along with the building style of Minecraft, and they were both combined in perfect harmony. Now they did improve upon some aspects, but in doing that, they ruined some, and even took some away. One of my favorite things to do in the beta was to tunnel under the map, but replace it with the same color block as the ground so no one would know. now, you place the same colored block as the team you are on, and gives away you position pretty easily. The classes is also a dumb idea, and it was better with just the three weapons. The classic mode fixes not having the different classes, but still, it has a lot of potential, that the developers did not capitalize on, and it is a huge disappointment in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2974397">Expand</a></span>

Players are able to not only bring down an entire server, but make every player on that server have a client crash. Thus far, nothing is being done to the players abusing this bug and it has not been patched, not even in the latest update. Jagex is not paying enough attention to this game&apos;s major problems.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not all bad, though. If your game server isn&apos;t taken down, you&apos;ll find a twitch shooter in a world made from blocks. The blocks can be placed either individually, in a line, or as an instant &quot;pre-fab&quot; structure. They can also be destroyed, and structures with no support underneath them will collapse.
<br>
<br>The previous complaints that you cannot set up your own game are now only half right. You still cannot set up a game server yourself. You can, however, set up a game on one of Jagex&apos;s servers with powers similar to a server host. You can set up the game type, player limit, password, and special rules, so this is at least a step in the right direction. You can also set up a match to only allow your Steam friends.
<br>
<br>Other reviews claiming a lack of CTF mode or rifle are also false. Both are present in the current game. It has been a while since the last patch, but complaints from last year may no longer be valid. Instead, there is a new set of cons that continue to mar the game. However, the list is becoming more technical than match-based, so hopefully Jagex will continue to update and improve this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=3217669">Expand</a></span>

<br>First off, there seem to be a lot of reviews giving negative scores because it is not as good as the original, but reviews should be about the games themselves, not in comparison to anything else.
<br>Ace of Spades claims to be a mix between Minecraft and Team Fortress 2, but in practice it doesn&apos;t quite live up to this. It feels like a weaker version of TF2 with an added little destruction mechanic. Although you can build your own fortresses, no one does because there is no encouragement to and you usually don&apos;t get the opportunity because the maps are so small. So it is, in reality, only in a Minecraft themed world, rather than in a world encouraging creativity. This isn&apos;t Minecraft.
<br>Nor is it TF2, because the classes aren&apos;t as interesting and the shooting mechanics are plain bad. It does make up for this by having a jetpack class, but you enter the game having no idea how to use it because there is no tutorial. For anything. With all of that being said, it is important to note that if you make it fun, it can be fun. I demonstrated this to myself after a while of playing it by creating a little base on top of a hill and sniping out of the window, and it was thoroughly enjoyable as a lunchbreak sort of game. I certainly couldn&apos;t play the game for long periods of time, whereas the opposite can be said for Team Fortress 2 and Minecraft.
<br>For a few pounds, it does give you its money&apos;s worth, but until there is more of an incentive to build and destroy, it remains a bad TF2 clone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2868152">Expand</a></span>

<br>I fail to see where all the hatred for this game is coming from. For a game like this to a have a user and critic score of around 45-48% is totally unreasonable. The physics of this game are great, the class-based gameplay is brilliant, the game modes are awesome and this game, overall, is amazing.
<br>
<br>To give a game a bad rating because it costs money is a waste of your own time and a statement that you are a cheap bastard. As for the critics, I&apos;m not sure why the reviews were so negative.
<br>
<br>My advice: buy the game and play it for yourself. It&apos;s only $10 and I would buy a game of this quality for $50+, it&apos;s that good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2926144">Expand</a></span>

Its a simple, fun, easy to pick up, casual game thats very entertaining. Yes its a bum that you cant make your own game, but there are plenty of servers with people on them and empty servers (so you and your friends could join and vs one another) i find it very fun, either running around shooting people, or just blowing stuff up! everything is destructible so you can destroy and alter the map as much as you can in the time limit! you can also build your own little base or bunker with pre-set moulds you can use to instantly make them. This doesn&apos;t deserve the hate its getting, this is not as bad as people say it is and i would recommend this to everyone. (also, yes its different to the first, at least its not a copy paste game like Call Of Duty Modern warfare 2 and Call Of Duty Modern warfare 3)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2975174">Expand</a></span>

Although it turned out well. I do have negative thoughts about it, but it is lots of fun to play and I highly recommend it.</span>

<br>I&apos;m used to playing a lot of voxel based games/sandbox games I started with minecraft way back when it started it&apos;s beta phase and from there I fell in love with the genre and do anything to defend it from poor reviews. Ace of spades is trying to match something like throwing all the good sandbox games and a valve fps in a blender and setting it to high, aka trying to create a creative blocky fps smoothie. But once the consumer buys ace of spades they will be greeted with something that wasn&apos;t to their expectation
<br>------PROS----------
<br>Well, if you haven&apos;t noticed already on the steam page it is only about 10 dollars (it was on sale at the time, about 7 dollars and came with a dlc pack) so it is worth a try if you got the money. when I was pushed into it, I was greeted with a (in my opinion) amazing throwback soundtrack which instantly kept me in even though I was searching for a game. The combat felt fluent for the most part and the classes felt balanced (except for that dahm sniper) and to what some players think it rewards you fairly well when you flank via digging or what building in general. Like most team based shooters however, it&apos;s most fun when playing with friends so I advise you do so. The gamemodes seem fairly straight forward and used in other games (tdm, ctf etc) they have a zombies mode which often made me feel like I was playing timesplitters virus mode (awwwww, nostalgia...) and a diamond collection mode (think of it like a neutral ctf a few games have used this gamemode). I&apos;m hoping that the developers listen to what the community is saying and will fix any major flaws. After playing the current version of Guncraft I can say for certain that ace of spades is indeed better than it (but guncraft is in beta) and it is safe to say that ace of spades is generally better than most voxel based shooters.
<br>-------CONS-------
<br>Like I said, only fun with friends for the most part. It can get boring (not frustrating, just boring) halfway through your game when you&apos;re not playing with a friend. I find that the lack of reload animations make the game&apos;s devs look like they were being lazy. The lack of textures is ok for some and bad for others. I&apos;, fine with it personally. The annoying one shot sniper can make you break your keyboard over your leg because of how frustrating it can get. The lack of hud on the map can be annoying for some but not for all. It doesn&apos;t encourage teamkill and discourage lone-wolf style of playing despite it saying it&apos;s team based. The low amount of weapons to choose from can make the gameplay stale. The levels are cramped and closed off. Building/breaking the environment doesn&apos;t impact the match very significantly. No stand out gamemodes. And lastly, lack of certain region servers and creating a server!
<br>-----------RATING---------
<br>I rate this game a 6.5/10 because it does offer some fun gameplay but unless it&apos;s at a 5 dollar price I wouldn&apos;t recommend getting it nor if your friends don&apos;t own it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2958046">Expand</a></span>

Yeah a guy may stand at your spawn or miles off and just spawn amp you but their bullets will nock out a nook for you to hide in and shoot them from. Destruction is a key feature and should be praised for being unique not condemned for not being as well implemented as it could be, it&apos;s not a &#xA3;15 million game. When you look at this game just remember: This is NOT COD! It is NOT a blockbuster game. It COULD have been a blocky FPS with NO creativity. This is an FPS with something different that if a big company, like dice or Bungie or someone like that, there to add it to one of their massive games it would be a huge success.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=3304089">Expand</a></span>

<br>The ONLY thing that&apos;s stopping me from making this rating a 10 is a mediocre issue. I live in Canada, and its sometimes difficult to connect to a server. Minus that, its a great game, class based, and it sort of feels like your going back to the world of Minecraft. It would be a 9.7/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2920708">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There are bugs and balancing issues, but it only takes a minute to find a different server if something goes wrong. I think the game was released too early, but it is already good and has big potential to be huge, IF the bugs are fixed and Jagex listens to the community. I played the original Ace of Spades too, and this is a different game. Not worse, just different. I like both and I will play both.
<br>
<br>On metacritic and reddit there is now an organized campaign by angry fanboys of the original game, who don&apos;t want this new one to succeed. It&apos;s disgusting. A lot of them are acting like spoiled brats who didn&apos;t get exactly what they wanted, so now they&apos;re crying and screaming and determined to take AoS down. Look at all those people giving it zero points. They should be ashamed of themselves.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t even get WHY they are trying to destroy this game. They can still play the original. JAGEX even keep a link to the original game on their Ace of Spades website, so anyone can download it and play it for free. What more do these kids want?

When you and your team undermine and demolish the enemy base to turn the game around in the last minute, it&apos;s epic. WARNING: Ace of Spades was built off of a free game, the fanboys of which have joined Metacritc in their droves to just to post 0 score reviews. Don&apos;t listen to them. This is a good game with good support. Most of the issues that those fanboys were whining about 3 weeks ago on Metacritic were already fixed. I don&apos;t like that you cant have your own server yet, but there are lots of official servers all round the world, lots of maps, lots of game modes. I think with the resources the dev company puts in, that this game is getting better every week</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=2885824">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>this game had a free weekend on steam this week, so i decided to give it a try. after about an hour, I have to say, this game feels almost broken. combat is boring, the building does not work half the time, and most objectives revolve around camping in an area and killing anybody who enters.
<br>
<br>Only fun thing to do in this game is cutting down trees with your sniper.</span>

<br>
<br>This is not a bad game, but it has its problems. This game is basically Team Fortress mixed with Minecraft. You can build cover, bridges, sniper stands, etc. That&apos;s good, because sometimes snipers can be VERY annoying on certain maps. However, if you are planning on building something cool, you&apos;re out of luck. Someone can easily destroy it. The environments are destructible, which makes for some interesting multiplayer matches. Someone can have a bunch of your buddies pinned down and you can dig under the enemy and flank them.
<br>
<br>The game, as I said, has its problems. The rocket launcher feels pretty boring to use to me, certain maps (like Lunar Base) have balance issues with the sniper class, and Diamond Mine can seriously be improved. SERIOUSLY.
<br>
<br>I have heard the original AoS was incredible, but I never played the beta, so I would never know. Overall: A 6 to a 7/10. MetaCritic can be misleading sometimes. More people liked this game than those that didn&apos;t (add up the pos  the mixed and compare it to the negative) but it still has a low score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ace-of-spades/user-reviews?user_review_id=3037009">Expand</a></span>
