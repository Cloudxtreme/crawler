I have attempted to enjoy many games in this general &apos;genre&apos; of game, and the vast majority bore me and fade out of my playlist after a short time (with some very significantly notable exceptions here and there- the Longest Journey is one of my all time favorites), but this game made me remember that adventure games can be incredible if done right. The comedy is truly hilarious. The puzzles are logical (usually). The storyline is superb. The atmosphere/environment is immersive. The gameplay is pretty slow paced (as are most adventure games), so if your in a mood to shoot up some fools or whatever, this probably won&apos;t be the best choice of the moment. But if your in the mood to sink into a game with depth and intelligence, you&apos;ll enjoy this one a lot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-book-of-unwritten-tales/user-reviews?user_review_id=2777198">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m generally a very harsh critic of adventure games as I&apos;m impatient and dislike tedium, but playing this game never once felt like a chore. The autosave system, the pacing, the fast travel, the ability to turn on subtitles and quickly skip through dialog  - everything was doing perfectly. The Book of Unwritten Tales is a masterpiece. You owe it to yourself to play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-book-of-unwritten-tales/user-reviews?user_review_id=2706008">Expand</a></span>

However, even in its tributes it isn&apos;t terribly clever.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not especially difficult but it does have a touch of that old-school annoying adventure game flavor (that most modern adventure games have wisely done away with).  For example: you can hold the space bar and all interactable items will be highlighted, but on one puzzle, it only worked if you were standing right next to the key item.  So basically you try every other possibility until, thoroughly bored, you hit the walkthrough. It&apos;s then you realize it wasn&apos;t your inability to solve the puzzle but the game deliberately breaking it&apos;s own rules to try and add more challenge.
<br>
<br>The environments are pretty, but tiny and boring.  You start in a boring Gnome town, then go to a deserted castle town, then to a sunken temple.  It just never wows you with its visuals.  A great adventure game feels full of possibility even if you&apos;re somewhat limited in how much you can explore: a feet created by great storytelling.
<br>
<br>Again, no idea what the hype is with this game.  I played Tesla Effect and Deponia recently and both are easily superior on every level.

I also was a fan of the &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; - in the long time ago when the game was actually smart and fun. But if you are like me and you loved all these games, I can tell you that &quot;The Book Of Unwritten Tales&quot; can occupy a proud first place among them.<br><br>It amazes me to see how little appreciation is given to this game, although it was launched back in 2009 in Germany. They probably don&apos;t have a huge marketing machine in place. This game has everything: an excellent script, a wonderful story, humor (lots and lots of humor), strong characters, nice graphics and smart puzzles. Indeed, the puzzles were a bit more difficult in &quot;Syberia&quot; (this could be the only &quot;bad&quot; thing I could think of in regards to this game) - but it&apos;s not a major issue. A big problem with this kind of games is that sometimes inconsistencies appear in the story and in the course of action, but &quot;The Book Of Unwritten Tales&quot; has none of those. The story goes smooth and logical. The $30 you pay for this accounts for a good 20-25 hours of play.<br><br>The humor in this game is addictive! It makes fun of many pop-culture subjects, it contains super fun references to WOW and Monkey Island.<br><br>For a preview of the game you can search youtube (this is what convinced me to actually buy it and play it). If you liked the games listed above (and in general, if you like smart games) I can guarantee you will love this :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-book-of-unwritten-tales/user-reviews?user_review_id=2076262">Expand</a></span>

And by copies I mean the exact same joke, I swear they stole some of them. Call it a tribute or theft or whatever but I enjoyed the original jokes in the game and found the weird moments that literally took other developers work unnecessary and pointless.<br>To those who can ignore something like this: It&apos;s a decent game with okay graphics, an okay story and good chunks of humor.

The Book of Unwritten Tales is also a work of an independent game studio, although when I look at this production I feel like it was made by of a well-known, experienced team supported by one of the publishing giants.
<br>
<br>The beginning, nay, the entire story is a conglomeration of many well-known themes from games, movies and famous fantasy universes. References attack player from each side, but not too aggressive, so there is no feeling that it was somehow forced. The game is very climatic and has not too pushy humor. Already in the first dialogues one of the characters says that artifacts, the struggle between good and evil, and similar things are clich&#xE9;. This gives you the clear understanding that the KING Art studio was aware of the banality of many references and despite this they managed to turn it into a huge advantage of this production. I wonder how would the game do for someone who is not familiar with universes of for example Lord of the rings or World of Warcraft. Would that person have same amount of fun with that production?
<br>
<br>The story focuses on four playable characters  a gnome (Wilbur), an elf (Ivadora) and a human (Nathaniel) who is accompanied by hysterical creature known as Critter. All of them (except Critter) use the English language in the most British form possible. For some time, it is even an enjoyable experience, but after a few hours, I have had enough.
<br>
<br>The game was created on proprietary engine designed specialy for it. It allowed developers to generate very detailed and pleasant to the eye 3D graphics mixed with 2D elelements and backgrounds. The game uses a very different camera shots  from the standard view known from some classic adventure games, through isometric, until 2D camera just like in most of platform games that show a cross-section of the building. It allows to construct a more distinct and various puzzles that may not be too demanding, but very pleasant and thoughtful. In addition, by pressing the space bar on the keyboard all interactive elements are highlighted. Every now and then there are also some Quick Time Events (minigames consisting of pressing the keys in the right order and intervals). Overall, the game does not have any major defects apart from a few technical bugs or unforseen situations. For example, you have to backtrack a few charts to activate some element.
<br>
<br>The Book of Unwritten Tales is a great game and keeps you in front of computer for more than 15 hours of extremely rich fun. I also can&#x2019;t complain about the level of AV, or on the quality of the story. This is the perfect choice for people who like easter eggs and references. The Book of Unwritten Tales should also appeal to players who have not had the opportunity to play a decent adventure game  of course under the condition that they manage to slow down a bit and sit calmly without waiting for explosions, the omnipresent death and quick action. As I mentioned earlier, I am very curious as to how this production would have been received by a layman in the subject of popular culture. I do not believe, however, that someone like this lives, so I can do nothing else but recommend this production to all who can appreciate a well thought-out and gripping story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-book-of-unwritten-tales/user-reviews?user_review_id=3207313">Expand</a></span>

And that does`t stop, the whole game has great humor, top-notch voice acting and really beautiful and nice drawn backrounds. One of the less critic-points of the proffesional reviews was that it ist sometimes hard to find little obejcts, but what they have missed is that if you press space, the game will show you all usable objects. Overall it has nice puzzles which are the most time very logicall and fun, good written dialogs and funny humor. For the price of about 30$ you get a big package with the full game (with about 20 hours gameplay), a soundtrack CD, an artbook and a double-sided A2 artwork poster. What does an adventure fan need more!? If you love adventures, this is a must have ;-)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-book-of-unwritten-tales/user-reviews?user_review_id=1977749">Expand</a></span>

The visuals are pretty decent, about on par with Syberia II or TLJ:Dreamfall. Since the emphasis is on comedy, you need a sense of humor to enjoy this game.  For me it was very funny, there were a lot of laugh out lout moments. It has a lot of references to nerd culture like DOD, WOW, LOR, etc. All of the puzzles are inventory based, and not very difficult. My nine-year-old was able to solve about half of the puzzles without any help from me. The game has a lot of lengthy conversations that include a lot of jokes. You will need to go of back and forth to fetch this item or that item, so the game took me a good 17 hours to finish. If you are looking for a lighthearted diversion that will occupy you for a long time, this is the game for you. If you are looking for a hard core puzzle game, look elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-book-of-unwritten-tales/user-reviews?user_review_id=3604336">Expand</a></span>

However, I was sorely dissapointed. The game isn&apos;t exactly terrible, but it&apos;s just hopelessly mediocre. On the technical side, the game is simply gorgeous, but while the graphics of the game are good, a number of silly glitches and inconsistencies break any sense of immersion in the game (such as at the very beginning of the game where you see a gremlin writing in a book, the entire page visibly filled with text and the gremlin simply moving his quill left and right). However, on the whole the game&apos;s audiovisual style is very charming, even though some of the voice-acting is mediocre at best and the game&apos;s female lead takes the cake for being the most improperly dressed fantasy heroine for a long time. Furthermore, in addition to the sad portrayal of the game&apos;s female lead, the game features at least one bit character whose entire purpose in the game seems to be to serve as a platform for laughing at dainty men. While I wouldn&apos;t go as far as saying that the game&apos;s writers are homophobic, the said character seems to serve no other purpose than to be a target for jokes poking fun at his lack of traditional heterosexuality. Furthermore, the game suffers from very lackluster writing. One might be willing to forgive the game for its cliched plot, seeing as it&apos;s supposed to be a parody of fantasy cliches, but at the same time the game seems so earnest with its plot that it&apos;s hard to tell what is exactly being parodied. Most of the characters are flat and lacking in any real characterization, and for anyone whose read any Terry Pratchett the characters will seem like cheap imitations of his wonderful dramatis personae. This is further compounded by the fact that the game&apos;s cast is extremely small, a fact that the game takes great delight in pointing out. Furthermore, the game&apos;s world seems very empty and small, and I feel that the fantasy genre would&apos;ve lent itself more easily to a more open-ended format in the style of Monkey Island 2 and Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road. Now the game progresses very linearly, without so much as a hint of exploration.
<br>
<br>It is also clear as day from the game&apos;s script that it is a translation of an originally German script: while there aren&apos;t any mistranslations per se, a lot of the dialogue doesn&apos;t sit well with the characters and doesn&apos;t seem very idiomatic. In addition to this, the subtitles are littered with the occasional misspelling and sometimes the transcriptions of spoken text to subtitle are completely off.
<br>
<br>Related to the above point about the game being a very shallow parody, while the game obviously tries to be funny, for me it didn&apos;t lend itself to more than a few chuckles. Most of the jokes and gags seem to have been recycled from somewhere else and I noticed a few obvious nods towards gags from Lucasarts&apos; classic adventure games, where the same jokes were better executed in spite of the technical limitations of the time.
<br>
<br>With all that said, I guess I could recommend this game to you if you really enjoy point-and-click adventure games, but at the same time I feel that even with the lack of all that many new releases you could do a lot better. I do hope that the game&apos;s creators do keep at it, because the game does demonstrate great potential. Were the developers capable of making as beautiful a game as this with less of a linear story and more room for exploration, as well as a larger cast of characters and better writing, it would be a pleasure to play. As it stands, The Book of Unwritten Tales is nothing more than an ultimately disappointing little romp in the world of shallowly parodied and tired fantasy cliches that doesn&apos;t seem to be able to decide whether it wants to be taken seriously or not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-book-of-unwritten-tales/user-reviews?user_review_id=2562852">Expand</a></span>

The controls are okay, but there is no running, so it takes some time to walk across the screen. Fortunately, double clicking the exit is faster. Character switch is similarly organized. I liked the fact that I could and deeded to play as different characters in the story, not that common among point-and-click lately. The graphics are okay, sounds are okay, and the voice talk is usually limited to two screens worth of text. One small issue I faced was the constant loading of audio from disk, it made the game pause too often until I moved the game to an SSD.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-book-of-unwritten-tales/user-reviews?user_review_id=3941246">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is fine, but slow. Puzzles aren&apos;t really hard and sometimes a bit dull and unimaginative, where most of the obstacles are the usual mismatch between personal and developer&apos;s logic. The biggest problem I had with the game is the slow story development. It jumps from puzzle situation to puzzle situation without much, if any story progress. In the end I found the main story to be underwhelming. Even though play time was decent, I was surprised the game was already over and that this was it. The last part was even more a sidequest than part of the main story. The end seemed rushed and rather sudden, as if the developers were bored with the game themselves and just wanted to get it over with. Honestly though, while I had fun playing the game, I felt the same way at that time and was just happy it was done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-book-of-unwritten-tales/user-reviews?user_review_id=5032941">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played almost every big title and many little. But I can&apos;t remember to laugh out loudly many time in my gamer career (not even with Monkey Island or Grim Fandango, although I loved them both).  With this game it happened a few time. I&apos;d give only for this a 10 to this game.  The story is saving the world-stuff, the usual to be expected, but the developers put their heart and tons of jokes in it. And jokes you can actually laugh at... The puzzles are great, I rarely enjoy them this much. They were logical, not nonsense riddles. The  game starts a bit slow and to tell the truth it isn&apos;t an eye-candy. The models are rigidly animated, at first they seem lifeless. (The usual problems can be found here: if you make one of the characters do anything, they go all over the place before starting to do what you want, even if the object was right beside them in the first place...) But after a short while you get to like them, they become flesh and blood. And they are funny...
<br>There are many quotes from games, irony and sarcasm well spent (like the gamers in Seefels, or the quick-time event dance). BTW, I played in german and the voice acting is superb. It&apos;s the thing that makes the characters come to life.
<br>The game is relatively long (longer than many other adventure games), and not because you have to try EVERY combination of objects before you get the most insane solution. And now you can have it for 20 Euros. It&apos;s a gift :) (and I&apos;m not one of the makers... :) )
<br>This is the only game from the developers beside the Critter Chronicles, of which I haven&apos;t heard too many positive opinions. I will try it, even if I don&apos;t like it my money is well spent I think - I not often enjoy a game as much as this. Hopefully the developers with one of the stupidest company name in gaming history (King Art - if this is a joke also, I didn&apos;t get it...), will be making many games on the level of TBOUT. I&apos;ll be following them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-book-of-unwritten-tales/user-reviews?user_review_id=2862555">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pro
<br>- Very Funny Game (chuckle all the way)

<br>- Fair puzzles

<br>Con
<br>- Story is not the best (ok, still)

(Hope someone makes a special edition of MI4 with 2D graphics!)
<br>
<br>The multiple character gameplay  is really great.  Although it is a little annoying that the swap (switching between the characters)  isn&apos;t instant because the characters have to walk back to their starting positions (unlike &quot;day of the tentacle&quot; where the swap is instant)
<br>
<br>The storyline is good and there is a lot of (semi)funny references to the fantasy genre. The dialogues are wellmade and witty.
<br>
<br>There is a lot of different beautiful locations. But there is not much room for exploring (unlike the kyrandia-games) there&apos;s only the  screens you need. If you do not have a purpose wtih scene you simply can&apos;t go there. Which makes the game a little easier.
<br>
<br>That brings me to the next topic the difficulty. This game is a too easy. The puzzles are very obvious and simple, do not expect to get challenged by this game.
<br>&apos;the only time I had difficulties was when I had the temple-bug.
<br>
<br>Summary: A beautiful and funny game, but unfortunately it is way too easy,</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-book-of-unwritten-tales/user-reviews?user_review_id=2883130">Expand</a></span>

<br>Point-and-click adventurers, RPGs and fantasy worlds lovers must have it! It is full of really funny references of a lot of known worlds like World of Warcraft and Lord of the Rings. Those who are familiarized with this kind of games will just stagger at the screen and probably will find themselves smiling alone while playing.

                                        <span>Nice game esp when you play it in German. Well the only thing i didnt like is that the puzzles are too easy. I played Grim Fandango before and thats really hard to solve so playing TBOUT afterwards becomes really easy. So if you dont mind easy puzzles the game is very funny and well done. Will now check out part 2 hope they made it not that easy.</span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s pretty, humorous, surprising, well told, well interfaced, with multiple characters (one of which I particularly enjoyed,) and rich in possible interactions.</span>
