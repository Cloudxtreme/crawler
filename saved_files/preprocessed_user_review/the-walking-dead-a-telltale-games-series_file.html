The Walking Dead is an absolute pleasure for the zombie enthusiast who also has some degree of maturity and intellect.  What impressed me most of this game was its ability to, perhaps very unintentionally, teach the audience truly the consequences of our actions in this game and in real life AND the importance of simply being nice to everyone as best as you can.  If you are truly paying attention, you can walk away from this game with these two lessons and be a better person in real life from playing this game.
<br>
<br>In regards to the graphics: great style, nothing was a turn off in this vein- although it did remind me some of borderlands without steroid muscles in terms of art.  Bugs: yes this game has them and some wonky camera angles sometimes that throws you off here and there- but this I believe was made by a smaller design team and although it has that unpolished indie feel to it, it also has that great feeling of, &apos;we love our product that we worked very hard on,&apos; feel too.
<br>
<br>The story: well, it has been a LONG time since I had the pleasure of a video game that does something right in terms of a story: a bizarre conflict where we test the characters and see how they would all respond in the worst and best of times.  There is however no illusion that you the gamer are on a roller coaster ride and it becomes very clear that you are NOT in the driver&apos;s side, you are a passenger the whole way through to the horrible conclusion.
<br>
<br>This fatalistic outlook is key to this game, as it gives you the dread and somber morose feeling necessary for such a- piece of art in video game form.
<br>
<br>My only beef would be- episode 2 was way too predictable- pun intended...
<br>
<br>here is a little example of how badly things can go:

This is a question that has been floating around the industry for years but has never truly been taken serious until this generation of gaming. In many ways it really comes down to how grounded your opinion of art is. Is art free form to you? Is it something that can only be achieved via deep principals, or is it simply anything and everything that is created as a form of expression?

Perhaps best described as an interactive story, Telltale&apos;s The Walking Dead became the masterpiece of a story so many of us know it for because its ability to make you feel empathy for its characters. Every character of the Walking Dead feels and responds like a real person. When a character dies, as they often will, you feel like **** Every death in that game is a terrible thing that  will tear at your soul. Why play it then? For Clementine. For that one last precious thing you&apos;re fighting for. You play as Lee Everett, and once upon a time, you killed a man. The apocalypse seems almost too good to be true, at first - a second chance to for yourself. But as the story progresses it becomes more and more obvious that what&apos;s important isn&apos;t fighting for your own survival, but fighting for the survival of the people you come to care about so deeply as the story progresses.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2847510">Expand</a></span>

The game is beautifully written, and remains true to Kirkman&apos;s universe. It is emotionally gripping, and balances the story expertly between the desolation and intensity of a post-apocalyptic world. The visual design is highly stylized, and creates some wonderful set pieces. I should preface my criticisms by noting that I really enjoying the format of these narrative point-and-click adventures; Some of my early favourites included Myst and the original Monkey Island series. I found that, although immersive and adeptly convincing, my choices often had little effect on the broader outcome of the adventure. The consequences of a poor decision were often minimal and only swapped small pieces of dialogue. This often served to break the experience for me, and I felt as though I wasn&apos;t playing a game as much as I was reading a one-shot story arc in the Walking Dead comic book series. The limited puzzle-like content was excruciatingly simple, and felt served up piping hot.
<br>To cut my ramblings short; Wonderful story, a must-play for fans, and nothing I regret spending time on. I wouldn&apos;t suggest approaching it like a true video game, more of an interactive animated series, and at that it TRULY excels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2860807">Expand</a></span>

The actual gameplay is complete and utter trash. Its horrible and terrible. None of the decisions you make have any consequence on your survival, hell, they barely even matter. Sure they change how certain scenes end, but the story still drives foreward. I dont understand how anyone could look past the terrible gameplay and give this game a 10/10. I understand the conflict, but storyline is ONE ASPECT of video games. Why are all the choices with survivors forced? I knew from the moment I was forced to pick between two survivors to save that the game was going to be a forced story and that my actions would be limited, but hell, I never expected the game to blatently and utterly disregard my choices physically, with only getting some verbal acknowledgment of the choice I made. It honestly does not sit well that a game with such a great story has such terrible gameplay. I am utterly dissapointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=3282452">Expand</a></span>

Also both seasons follows in main among others the evolution of Clementine(main character) from a little helpless girl to a real survivor, all settled in an apocalyptic zombie world.

You emotionally connect with main characters Lee and Clementine and your choices always feel like they matter. Point and click games may turn people off but I implore anyone who enjoys a good story to give The Walking Dead a chance. Its probably the only game that has ever got me close to crying at the end.</span>

It might be more accurate to call this an interactive story than an adventure game though. So if you&apos;re looking for tough puzzles or gameplay, this is not the game for you. The game is easy enough that anybody can finish it without giving it much thought but despite that, it is pretty immersive and emotional. You WILL get attached to certain characters and panic when they are in danger. When something bad happens to someone you like, you will keep wondering whether you could have done anything differently to save them. This is a must-buy if you enjoy good storytelling and I hope developers make more games like this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=4295224">Expand</a></span>

<br>Two most important things that made it so good are:
<br>- relation between two main characters, Lee and Clementine, an adult taking care of a child, feeling responsibility for someone, gives great framework for emotional engagement - something rather hard for me to get in computer game
<br>- game made really bold step to depart from gameplay being a hindrance to the story. You see, in most games, gameplay (being fight in rpg and inventory puzzles in adventure games) is something that slows your progress through the story. This somewhat masks the fact that most stories are written very poorly (even in games critically acclaimed as having Great Writing - Mass Effect, Pillars of Eternity). When mixed with some shooting or spellcasting it makes an &quot;ok&quot; experience. Walking Dead has a good (not great) story that is not watered down by &quot;do some repetitive boring stuff in order to get another part as a reward&quot;. Result is well above average.
<br>
<br>There are probably better games in similar spirit now (Life is Strange) but still this one is well worth your time. Enjoyed it a lot even though I hate TV series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=6758118">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>this game is NOT superficially dramatic...i cant emphasis it enough there are very few things in life that are able to make you truly feel empathy..to truly suspend reality and become thoroughly engrossed in a story line is something that is getting harder and harder to do...this game is able to do that and so much more..
<br>
<br>please for the sake of expanding your own intellectual horizons BUY THIS GAME.

Look, I love stroy-driven games. I love Telltale style games. This game is RIGHT up my alley, or at least it should be, but in reality it is an incredibly weak offering and one of the worst Telltale games despite being perhaps the most well-known. I feel like most of these positive ratings are just pure fans of the show or comic and will gobble up anything with Walking Dead slapped on it.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s my beefs: For starters, this game is on rails more than any other Telltale offering (many of which are way better in this regard). The Telltale formula always involves the illusion of choice, and that&apos;s fine because these games are all about how you reach your destination, not where the destination leads to, but WD does a poor job disguising the illusion of choice. Instead, all your choices feel meaningless and forced and the tasks put in front of you are far too often tedious and boring. Please, I beg anyone, before buying this game try instead some other FANTASTIC Telltale games, like The Wolf Among Us or Tales From The Borderlands. Or, dip outside of Telltale and fall in love with Life is Strange. I promise you, if you buy any of those games you wilo not be disappointed, and if you make the mistake of playing The Walking Dead after you will certainly understand why my review is so critical.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5525320">Expand</a></span>

This is how it looks like in theory at least.
<br>
<br>The truth is The Walking Dead deserves a solid 10/10 and was the gem of gaming in 2012 for me. I&apos;ve mentioned all of it&apos;s shortcomings and I&apos;m still sticking by it. As a game it&apos;s not great but as an interactive story with multiple twists and tribulations, involving characters, tough moral choices and a sense of ultimate despair that main characters are facing at all times makes it an EXTREMELY rewarding experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2969912">Expand</a></span>

Even after hearing all the hype, I had no idea what I was in for. I&apos;m a huge fan of story-based adventure games, and have played many of Telltale&apos;s other series. They have always been good at humor and cartoony worlds, but I questioned whether they could pull off a serious or dark game. My concerns were left shattered on the floor early on in episode one, and stayed there through the rest of the game, all the way to the shuddering end. This game grabs you and never lets go. As others have mentioned, I experienced many complex emotions throughout the game which I rarely feel when playing games. It was like the best thriller films, except I was involved in the choices so it felt even more personal. The writing and characters are so well done that you forget you are playing a game, and you never know what&apos;s around the bend. I feel like this game is a refreshing change, and only the beginning of what is possible in interactive storytelling if it is done right. I hope its popularity will push developers more into this front.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2907494">Expand</a></span>

<br>Some of them, you&apos;ll regret further on.
<br>This game has a some great characters. It&apos;s not a hard game, and not too long, but it&apos;s worth every cent spent on it. Really recommend it!</span>

This game has the best character development and story of any game out there. I found myself liking some character while disliking others and the choices I made in the game reflected my feelings towards individuals in the group. I have never had a game make me question my own morality. A choice I made in the heat of the moment later filled me with self doubt and regret... did I make the right choice... and believe me, the choices are not easy. The game makes you feel something for the different character in the game, and if the ending does not have you at least choking back tears... then you simply are not human! This game is an instant classic and on my short list for best game I have ever played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2831384">Expand</a></span>

<br>As a 25 yr old male, I could hardly believe the moment that I burst into tears in the final act. It is as moving as any film and more engaging than any game that has come before it. You do not just feel the decisions that Lee makes as the protagonist, you feel as though you are standing in his shoes, and every decision you make is helping shape your journey through the zombie infested streets. If you buy one game in the next 5 years, I would suggest this one be near the top of your list of considerations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2862294">Expand</a></span>

The installment model of distribution bothered me at first as I wanted to continue on with the story. In the end however, this actually built excitement for the game because the tale was so excellent. Even for those who are not into horror or apocalypse themes,I would recommend this game. The zombies are simply obstacles that are part of the larger story which revolves around the people in the game. I won&apos;t leave any details (spoilers) but I think most players who enjoy a story driven approach will love this game.  The themes explored are adult- redemption, loss, suffering and how people might behave when everything they have ever known comes to an end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2877714">Expand</a></span>

I was really impressed by the way things moved in the game one tragedy after the other you cant help but feel the tension that is surviving in a world like that. Even when i was just exploring I just couldnt feel safe anywhere. Also, almost all the characters in the game have managed to create a emotional response from myself. I hated some, I loved some but rarely I felt indifferent about them and that is always a plus. Honestly, at some point I started caring for Clementine like she was my own daughter. The only character I felt lacked depth was the main character but I think that may be on purpose because your supposed to feel like you are the main character. The gameplay itself was a little lackluster in some parts, with some solutions being WAY too obvious. I barely had to think when solving the problems in the game. But this isnt a traditional point and click adventure so I took only 1 point from my review. The graphics and sound are all top notch but some of the voice acting was bad to the point it made me laugh. Great game, definetly one of the best of the year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2826069">Expand</a></span>

And for a bonus I was left with a tear in my eye by the third and fifth chapter. This game must be played by anyone who loves storytelling and amazing dialogues in video game and even movies. What many are complaining about is that there is no gameplay or oh this isn&apos;t a game it&apos;s an interactive show but they are missing the entire point of the game! It isn&apos;t to collect killstreaks or to amaze with set pieces, it&apos;s to move your emotional strings and make you care about it&apos;s characters! If this isn&apos;t your type of game don&apos;t play it but this review is for the ones who knew what they were in for. You play as Lee Everett, a man with a shady past who in the midst of a zombie apocalypse finds a lonely little girl, Clementine. The moment you meet her you feel the burden of having to protect her and it doesn&apos;t ever go away. There were moments I felt so much sympathy for her or even doubt of myself if I was good enough for her that I felt things only real life could achieve! This is a very dark game, for those who didn&apos;t know! You will see a lot of  up things and meet some  up characters (episode 2, holy crap). But you will meet others who will join your group and become friends with you. And by god there will be choices! Choices that matter even from the first episode! And you will disagree even with your best companions in some cases! I repeat this is some intense  and there&apos;s gonna e tension in the air. But I can say in the third chapter there was one so strong character development that I shed a TEAR! And of course the final episode I cried, literally cried. And not just in one scene! This game will move you! Even if you are the most stone cold emotionless man in the country. About the gameplay I can say it&apos;s point and click and there are tense scenes that require you to press a button really fast or stuff but nothing very gripping. But th strong  is in the dialogue options! You have to think and react fast and believe me there will be a time or two that you will do something you would have never done in any other choice game. Like I said this game requires your emotions and ideas to play, not the ones from the character! So in general if you love good stories and great character development and dialogue you are in for the experience of the year! I&apos;m gonna give it a nine because it doesn&apos;t really appeal to everybody! But great game for the right audience!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=3126832">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Good story. Great atmosphere. The cell shading is awesome. I shed some tears. But it begs the question: what makes a videogame, a videogame? Because even though I liked it, it looked like a giant cutscene which is interactive. Call me purists, but I think a videogame needs to be more &quot;game&quot; than &quot;video.&quot;</span>

                                        <span>The Walking Dead is the best story based game I have played in a long time. I got very attached to my character and those around him and felt compelled to help everyone even though thats a imposable task. The dialoge options are vast and I found myself lost in telltales world. I can not wait untill episode one season 2 is released!</span>

I was worried about it going in that it would focus too much on random zombie action and take away from WHY we love the Walking Dead. We like it because it actually has story and character development. Not just random gore. The game is a point and click adventure. If that&apos;s not your type of game wait for the crappy FPS coming out soon. (That I&apos;ll still probably play.) The timed decisions mechanic is a great move from the developers. Only have seconds to make a split choice really ripens the tension and panic of your situations. On top of that the game has a lot of content. 5 full episodes that can be a couple hours each to finish, with different paths and outcomes depending on how your handle things. Every choice you make can affect you way later down the road to similar to the style Mass Effect recently took.

<br>If your a fan of the show, comics, zombies in general and like a good game that will challenge your wit and morals, get it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2917368">Expand</a></span>

All those little annoyances are nothing, nothing to detract you from this master of story driven games. Obviously, video games are not exactly high regarded when it comes to the storyline and yet This game has some of the best set of narrative, characters, and dialog you can find in the industry. But is it a game, really? I see it as more of an experience. An interactive tv series, if you will. Gameplay elements are rather thin in this game, like in most point and click adventure games. The chocies you make are difficult, and even if they don&apos;t have too much effect on the outcome of the story(from what we have seen at the end of the 5 chapters), they still change characters behavior and dialog  along the way. But it doesn&apos;t matter at all, in my opinion. The choices you make still dictate how you will feel at the end of the game. Have I done the right thing here? could I have saved this person if I did that? if you are making choices without caring too much because it&apos;s &quot;just a game&quot;, then your experience will be the same. The characters are outstanding, through voice acting and choices they make, this  is as far as you can get from the &quot;black and white&quot; storyline that&apos;s found in most videogames these days. If you invest yourself into the narrative and characters, and really think about what&apos;s the right thing to do(in your eyes), you could find yourself drawn into one of the best games of the year, or interactive movies, or however you wanna call it. It really doesn&apos;t matter one bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2874824">Expand</a></span>

<br>I bought it once it won game of the year, and it deserved the win. Writing is so important now. The gaming industry is getting larger and its audience more mature. We need games that immerse us, not just entertain us. I love movies and some games need to be a medium to tell a story. If I just want gameplay I&apos;ll go play my vast arcade game library (fez, shootmania, dota 2, etc).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=3035751">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Yet when I moved on to chapter 2 the game had failed to retain the effect of decisions I had made in episode 1, essentially rendering my influence on the plot useless. After googling this problem I see it&apos;s an issue shared by many and for which no official solution has been provided. Unfortunately I haven&apos;t continued to play the rest of it as I couldn&apos;t fix the issue and it put a real dampener on my involvement with the game.
<br>
<br>I imagine my score would have been around 6 or 7 or maybe higher had I managed to enjoy the whole game but because of this fundamental flaw which rendered my experience a waste of time, I must mark the game accordingly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=3418030">Expand</a></span>

Sadly your actions don&apos;t actually affect the ending, and in a visual novel (and YES, it is a visual novel, not a game) that is pretty important.

Iam not a big fan of adventure games but this maybe is a start to play more adventure games soon. The only thing i dont like are the graphics. The graphic could be from 2008 and i dont like also the cartoonish style. But overall an awesome game</span>

The decisions feel meaningful and, while not twisting the general plot, have an immediate impact even throughout several episodes. I cannot give it a higher rating than 8 though. The graphics are, even if they want to create a stylized comic feel, just not good. Several better textures, for example, would not have destroyed the aesthetics. And still the game stutters from time to time, regardless of the power of the PC it runs on.
<br>Additionaly, the controls feel very weird in several places.
<br>And at last, the gameplay does not challenge the player in any scene... I would have been able to complete the game at the age of 4. TWD defines itself with the storytelling though, and that&apos;s why I don&apos;t downrate it a lot because of the previous negatives.
<br>
<br>P.S.: I would not advise to let a 4-year-old play this game ;-)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2922983">Expand</a></span>

Wonderful story, wonderful characters, interesting graphical style, and an interesting approach to the adventure game genre. I looked forward to getting off work each day so I could progress further into the story and uncover the next bit of plot. However, I simply can&apos;t give this &apos;game&apos; that high of a score. As an adventure game, it was an absolute flop. The puzzles (if I can even call them that) were not even remotely challenging. In fact, the solution was always given to you (via the cues your mouse overs would give you.) And they never required any effort on the players part to really solve. Also, while you were presented with a lot of choices in the narrative as to what exactly you wanted to do, it&apos;s hard to feel like the choices really made any significant difference. I&apos;m almost afraid to give it a second play through just to prove my point further as I feel it would be rather depressing to see how little changes. Now I understand it would be damn near impossible for a developer to make infinite branching possibilities to a game, but there was many times where I could &apos;guess&apos; where they were trying to lead the plot and was specifically trying to make decisions that would deviate away from that path, but regardless the story would progress down those lines no matter what I said, did, etc. So generally, it felt like I was &apos;playing&apos; a movie, with light adventure elements and a bit of &apos;choose your adventure&apos;. In the end, the resultant feeling I got was super &apos;casual&apos; and so even though I really enjoyed the experience and consider it a memorable experience, I rather get left with the impression it was an awful game. As a game, I&apos;d give it a 4 or 5, as an experience i&apos;d give it a 9 or 10. So in the end I will give it a 7 and certainly give it my recommendation regardless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=3240429">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>10 is way too low for this game.  Brilliant writing that deviates from the story line of the TV series but keeps the spirit fully intact.  Brilliant game that keeps you involved in the story and links you to each character, which were each well developed.  Loved it.  It seems like it can be replayed multiple times.  Also love the fact that you are shown what others did in the choices.</span>

I literally exclaimed out &quot;AWESOME&quot; or &quot;NO&quot; several times while playing the game! I was so taken back by what was happening and what I experienced during the game, I can&apos;t wait for the next 5 as the ending was immense :) Buy and play this game, you will not regret it!</span>

                                        <span>This is my favorite game of 2012 and imo the best adventure game of its class to be released this century if not ever. The story and pacing were both superb and I am anticipating a sequel. The fact it came out at a time when entertainment is over-saturated with zombie media makes it all the more surprising that I became so invested in it. I couldn&apos;t have asked for anything more.</span>

It is based on the Walking Dead Comic series, which the TV series is based off of. The choices you make effect the game. You can&apos;t always be a saint, and have to make very tough decisions.

<br>
<br>There&apos;s this false impression that your choices change the story, but all it does is show you a different dialogue. One example: That crazy woman kills another member of your party, then you have to choose: Leave her behind or take her with you. If you leave her behind you simply don&apos;t see her anymore, if you take her with you, after a while she steals you car and ... you simply don&apos;t see her anymore ...
<br>
<br>Clementine bonds too easily with Lee, at the end of the game she sees her zombie parents and all she does is a sad face and says comment &quot;I saw my parents&quot;, no crying, no emotions, nothing. After a while Lee dies and she cries from sadness. Srlsly? Did she seriosly love this person she met a few weeks before more than her parents?
<br>
<br>Oh, and the hero, Lee, the game seems to try to make you cheer for this guy, even other characters do this. He lied to you, and in the moment he couldn&apos;t lie anymore he tells you he killed some1. At some point they start treating him like a leader, the next moment he slips into something and falls, then some1 dies because of him being stupid, the next moment some1 else is in danger, then he stumbles into something, hit his head and some1 else dies. Srlsy, this guys slips A LOT.
<br>
<br>And the link between the game and the series/hq doesn&apos;t exists. Glen and Hershel, the first one appears for 5 minutes, you barely get to know him, and Hershel, from what i&apos;ve seen, after the game started taking heavy weeds, cuz he&apos;s forgot everything that happend during the game, in the series/hq he&apos;s too &quot;over it&quot;, doesn&apos;t feel like his son just died, but since the hq came before, they shouldn&apos;t have made his son&apos;s death so dramatic.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m sorry but I advice anyone who rated this game 5 more to read the HQ and then review your score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=4143528">Expand</a></span>

The storytelling was amazing, the voice acting was great (with the exception of Clementine for me, but perhaps that&apos;s how she was supposed to be and it just went over my head), the graphics weren&apos;t top-notch but they captured that comic book feel, and the interface was pretty good.  Sometimes I felt the point-and-click quick-time-events were a bit clunky.  Sometimes I was clicking, multiple times, on the designated area, but nothing happened.  Also the lack of free saving during the game and the inability to skip dialogue scenes was a bit irritating.  The game is definitely not action-oriented.  It&apos;s all story and character.  But each episode makes you make some very hard decisions and the game takes those choices into account as the world moves on.  Some choices have higher values than others, and you sometimes learn that the hard way, and sometimes the choices you make seem like they would have a bigger impact but then they don&apos;t...  That&apos;s why I gave the game a 9/10.  Overall, it&apos;s an amazing game that deserves some of the highest praise, but there are just a few things that stick out that keep it from being perfect.  It&apos;s more inconsistencies than anything...  But if you get it, and you don&apos;t mind doing the story/puzzle thing instead of shooting 50,000,000 zombies in the face, then you&apos;ll definitely enjoy the ride!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2852162">Expand</a></span>

The game&apos;s writing is fantastic and could stand on it&apos;s own without the zombies. This is not another stupid zombie craze cash in. The characters are well fleshed out and you get attached to them. The combat and quick-time events are taut and meaningfully placed. This game is (generally) better than the show and well worth the asking price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822812">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You can&apos;t save, so you can&apos;t explore. Of course, since there is nothing to explore. You watch and listen, and once in a full Moon you click somewhere. The little playing there is is essentially reflex-based.
<br>
<br>Now, even this most extremely limited gameplay, they managed to fail:
<br>- In this fake 3D, the diagonal movement is clumsy;
<br>- your field of vision is terribly limited;
<br>- the keyboard mapping is incongruous;
<br>- you&apos;ll have to hammer the keys like a maniac to achieve something during &quot;combat;&quot;
<br>- choices are disguised screw jobs. Basically, 2 characters are in danger, choose which one you save, and therefore which one you kill. Wow ! What a subtle way to create an emotional investment...
<br>- it doesn&apos;t matter; people will die because of them, yet these choices are purely cosmetic;
<br>- and the crime de la crime: When asked to make a quick choice, you don&apos;t even have enough time to physically read the options.
<br>
<br>In the end, I had no problem choosing anything: First answer in a list without even reading the rest. And when asked to save either the guy on the right or the guy on the left of the screen, I clicked on the right. Because I&apos;m right-handed, maybe, but mostly because I didn&apos;t have time to toss a coin.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s 95% video and 5% playtime, and still this game manages to offer the most pathetic gameplay in the history of video games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5836828">Expand</a></span>

The Walking Dead has a great story and voice acting to go with it, there is no doubt about that. Just about everything else in the game is bad. The animations and lip syncing are both horrendous. Downright laughable. The graphics are supposed to represent a comic, but i&apos;ve seen comics that look better than this game. Some of the textures, especially trees and bushes and the ground, are terrible. And the gameplay, which is the most important part of any game, is boring and sometimes unintuitive. You rarely get something to do, most of the game is watching a cutscene and listening to dialogue. But, when you do get something to do, it&apos;s just simply clicking here one to kick a zombie, or some other unimportant thing. It&apos;s not fun at all, honestly, i&apos;d rather have just watched the game play before me then having to keep my hand on my mouse and wait an see if there is some QTE that pops up. The game also states that the decisions you make affect the game. This is true to a degree, but don&apos;t expect to be able to save one person all the way through to the end, or have your decisions greatly affect the ending. There is one ending to the game no matter what you do. The points in the game where you&apos;re supposed to pick one thing or another don&apos;t have any bearing on what happens in the end, either. So there&apos;s really no &quot;choice&quot; at all. I was super disappointed in this game, honestly. If you want a movie with a good, emotional story and don&apos;t care for gameplay, then buy it. But if you really want an experience you can interact with, you&apos;d best look elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=3187497">Expand</a></span>

Do not expect to be hacking and slashing or shooting your way through this game because it can hardly be classified as one, it&apos;s more like a glorified t.v. series. I am not saying that this &quot;game&quot; is bad by any means... it&apos;s just hardly a GAME, think a tv series you can (somewhat) interact with. It&apos;s pretty linear despite the whole &quot;your actions affect the story blah blah&quot; disclaimer displayed. There will things that will be presented as &quot;choices&quot; but you simply will not have a choice in the matter. At the end of the day you will be forced to preform specific actions because if you choose otherwise the story will not progress. However, the story is good and it truly is entertaining. I found myself playing longer than expected some nights but the riveting game play is not the blame. If you really aren&apos;t into playing video games or you want to take a break from having to actually run or jump or do actions then this is your game or if you just want a really elaborate animated story to break up the monotony of your life then this works too. I was majorly disappointed when it came down to game play seeing that it&apos;s almost obsolete. How this won game of the year over a real game with GAME PLAY substance and a well written screenplay like ME3 is totally beyond me though. I wouldn&apos;t recommend any of my friends to buy this game but I wouldn&apos;t say that it&apos;s horrible if one of them asked me my opinion on it either. Take it or leave it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2895971">Expand</a></span>

In this game you make choices, these choices have an outcome on the game itself, as the slogan of the game is &quot;this game is tailored by the way you play.&quot; Some people are criticizing this game for having a &quot;illusion of choice.&quot; This is partially true as some of the choices in the game have the same outcome either way. However, the majority of the choices have different outcomes. The storyline is the best game story I have had the pleasure of playing in a long time. If you are thinking about playing this game you really need to follow the story well to get the best out of it. The game lasts for about 12 hours on average, a pretty decent amount of playtime. You will probably replay it to make different choices to the ones you made before. People are criticizing this game due to it&apos;s graphics, when they should not. The game takes on a cartoony art style, as it should. Many people would nowadays just class a cartoony art style as &quot;bad graphics.&quot; Please do not listen to the negative reviews here, especially ones about the graphics. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and frankly cannot wait until February when they release The Walking Dead Season 2. Excellent title, my game of 2012.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2871089">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Walking Dead (2012 video game)is not as good as The Walking Dead (TV series).
<br>The TV show is an overwhelming hit and is very highly thought of.  It has a combination of excellent writing and excellent acting that combine wondefully with the Robert Kirkman themes developed in the comic book series.
<br>Those same Robert Kirkman themes are an integral part of The Walking Dead (2012 video game).
<br>The game provides nice examples of good acting combined with interesting characters:
<br>Lilly, voiced by Nicki Rapp
<br>Carley, voiced by Nicole Vigil, and
<br>Molly, voiced by Erin Ashe.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, the most important character, Lee Everett is voiced by Dave Fennoy who provides a barely average performance.
<br>Even more disappointing is the key character Clementine who is voiced by Nicki Rapp who provides a very sub-par performance.
<br>I think perhaps it is almost impossible for a 40ish year old women to provide an acceptable rendition of an 8 year old girl
<br>I think producers use adults to provide for child roles because they are lazy.  Child actors require a lot of effort to manage.
<br>Additionally the Clementine charater is drawn oddly and very unrealistically  to the point of being somewhat distracting.
<br>
<br>I enjoyed playing the game.  I wish Robert Kirkman would take a little more interest in protecting how his work is utilized.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2944125">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is a masterpiece. They have taken a ridiculous scenario (zombie apocalypse) and turned it into something heart-wrenching, ethically charged and mature. The characters are real, the gameplay is fun, the choices matter and afford real replayability, but more than that, this game makes you stop and think.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t let the zombie apocalypse setting fool you. This game is not about a zombie apocalypse, it&apos;s about the human condition.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2852575">Expand</a></span>

This may be the first time I&apos;ve ever gotten emotional playing a game.  it&apos;s true.  But hey - if the characters and stories don&apos;t get to you then you must be a walker your self!  The Walking Dead comic and TV show give the same emotional pathos as the game with the same amount of gore and potty mouth to boot!  It&apos;s a clever concept that allows you - the player- to choose the path of the narrative.  It&apos;s a very well written script that adheres to the choices you make very well.  There are a few times that your common sense wants the narrative to go where you think it should but in order to complete an episode you have to over-ride your impulses.  Another small drawback is the fact that you can&apos;t forward the dialogue.  That got annoying quick. The artwork from the comics flows beautifully, the foley work sounds fantastic and the voice-actors are fantastic.  They really give such depth to all the characters and make everything they do so vital which are always well worth investing time and emotion.  It&apos;s a rare thing indeed in a crazy world of games that just ask you to hit a button.  Special kudos to Melissa Hutchison as the voice of Clementine who made me bawl over her...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2854508">Expand</a></span>

While some complain that the choices you make don&apos;t matter ,they are wrong the choices form you as a person and your relationships with other people. You play as a convict who murders his wife called Lee Everett on his way to prison during the zombie apocalypse and then there is the little girl you meet called Clementine. When you meet Clementine she is an innocent 8 year old surviving in a tree house after her babysitter &quot;turned&quot;. Throughout your journey you choices also affect her personality and relationships towards others as well as your own personality. The back stories and events are completely believable for the situation and when they die they make you genuinely feel something. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good story. Go on try it for yourself make your choice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=4385391">Expand</a></span>

Quick time events are annoying. Lack of inverted mouse or gamepad controls makes the few gunfights difficult.  Pathetic that inverted controls are not an option.
<br>However the game got a bad score from me for really just one reason.  Player decisions do NOT make a difference, despite what is constantly prompted to players on-screen. The problem here is that this is the key feature of a point and click adventure like this. Take any major event in the game for example. Typically there will be a series of 6 to 10 dialogue or action sequences, each with up to 4 choices. That&apos;s great in theory, but your selections make no difference on how the story unfolds.  **** is going to unfold how the writers want it no matter Lee&apos;s actions.  Sure it may seem like you have choice at times, such as choosing between saving one persons life over another, or choosing to kill someone or not, but by the next scene it makes no difference.  Those are only a few canned events. You&apos;ll still be headed down the same linear path. Nothing dynamic about it. There was more freedom of decision with consequence playing Leisure suit Larry 15 years ago.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2868294">Expand</a></span>

My problem is that it&apos;s a story and dialogue-driven experience, and the story is boring. If you&apos;ve ever read a half decent book, you&apos;ll be bored to tears with this material. For the hell of it, imagine you aren&apos;t playing a game and instead you&apos;re watching an animated movie; you&apos;ll soon realise it would be the blandest, most predictable, cliched piece of crap ever created. So if it&apos;s light on gameplay, and the story is terrible, what&apos;s the point? What&apos;s the point indeed.

I&apos;ll admit, I was wary going in, because I hadn&apos;t heard a thing about it except from friends. On top of that, I had no idea if it would stay good throughout all five episodes. But that&apos;s exactly what Telltale Games did. They made a work of art instead of a video game. The comic book art style was absolutely fantastic, the voice acting was top notch, and the story was...well I&apos;ll be damned if it wasn&apos;t one of the best video game stories I&apos;ve ever encountered. Don&apos;t go into the Walking Dead expecting a lot of combat, or a fast pace. It&apos;s a very slow building game, but that&apos;s what makes it fantastic. It actually takes the time to develop the characters, actually make you like them or hate them. That&apos;s what makes some of the deaths really...tragic. But there are some combat sections, and they&apos;re simple and quite fun. This isn&apos;t just your average zombie apocalypse game. This is truly a masterpiece. I just hope Season Two can reach the ridiculously high bar that Season One has set.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=2853586">Expand</a></span>
