<br>
<br>The cyberpunk setting the game has is amazing. I could really connect with the characters. Their motivations were clear, and the decisions they faced were well-executed. The whole story was put together well and kept the intrigue going, apart from maybe the big plot twist, which I saw coming from a mile away, and when it was revealed, it only left me disappointed that there wasn&apos;t more to it than what I already figured out.
<br>
<br>I also really like the old-school pixelated art style. The art is beautiful. Most notable were the character portraits. Brilliant artwork. The voice acting was also really well done.
<br>
<br>So, a great story, beautiful art, and solid voice acting. What&apos;s the catch? Well, just like most point and click games, this game suffers from convoluted puzzles that often make no logical sense, and at times even require you to have the knowledge of how things in the game&apos;s fictional setting work, like wetware or trance. Don&apos;t get me wrong - some of the puzzles were fun and executed well, but many others require you to have a walkthrough on hand, especially in the last two chapters. It just horribly breaks the pace of the story.
<br>
<br>The game also offers some choices. It was a great touch, though many don&apos;t seem to make much of a difference to the story. I was especially annoyed by the ending, which felt like a false choice (for spoilers sake I&apos;ll say no more).
<br>
<br>So to conclude, although I enjoyed a lot of parts of the game, it left me feeling disappointed. If you don&apos;t mind the outlandish puzzles that will force you to consult a walkthrough, then by all means, get the game. Otherwise, eh, just watch the story on Youtube or something.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/technobabylon/user-reviews?user_review_id=5375331">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I was not too fond of some of the voice acting - which was almost perfect in the Blackwell series. (sorry - i keep comparing to Blackwell because the games are so similar in style - due to both being by Wadjet Eye) - but it is nothing to really ruin the atmosphere.
<br>
<br>Like the Blackwell story - this is rather story-driven than puzzle focused. which is a good thing. - It means that puzzles won t get in the way of the storytelling too much. For seasoned point &amp; click adventure players the puzzles are pretty much on the easy side.

But chances are, unless you&#x2019;re a Victorian time traveller who has never played a computer game before, you already knew that. Solid puzzles, beautiful level design, decent voice acting and a constantly intriguing plot make Technobabylon an adventure well worth embarking on and at just $14.99/&#xA3;10.99, despite being a little on the short side, it is also an adventure which won&#x2019;t break your wallet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/technobabylon/user-reviews?user_review_id=5522597">Expand</a></span>

<br>Playtime: 28 hours (though I had it open in the background a lot so scratch some 5 hours from that)
<br>
<br>The story revolves around playing 3 different characters with interconnecting stories. Unlike Resonance though it doens&apos;t get super complicated with different locations and what not.
<br>The game is pretty much doing sections with some good puzzles, nothing too cryptic really but what can set you back a lot is that occasionally it doesn&apos;t really tell you what to do. You gotta run around then asking people or going into the trance (virtual reality) to get that info.
<br>
<br>While it has a good balance between talk and actually doing stuff I sometimes felt like the dialogues were too dry and boring.
<br>The setting is also pretty serious all the time and there&apos;s hardly fun moments. The most memorable thing is probably the kitchen that serves human flesh... legally.
<br>
<br>All in all the game is very polished and nicely executed.
<br>It&apos;s just that something, and I couldn&apos;t even say what it is, is missing that would make it a great game.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s really good though and I&apos;d quite recommend it - especially since it&apos;s only 15 bucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/technobabylon/user-reviews?user_review_id=5508150">Expand</a></span>

I will admit there are some puzzles that defy logic and understanding but there are walkthroughs for those situations ;) technobabylon is simply an enjoyable point &amp; click cyberpunk adventure game with a believable story and Characters that you can always relate to in some form, it is a nice break from all the brain numbing triple A pew pew shooter games we seem to be drowning in these days, i simply want more games like this on PC, plus Technobabylon has the Wadjet Eye Games stamp of point &amp; click approval :D
<br>
<br>Buy it, if you enjoy Cyberpunk themes and point &amp; click games you will not be dissapointed.
