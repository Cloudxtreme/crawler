<br>
<br>1)  Netcode.  It&apos;s the same as all previous CoDs, peer-to-peer &quot;servers&quot;.  Horrible latency causes people to seemingly die in 1 shot, while others get a huge advantage.   It&apos;s their horrible netcode that tries to balance ping with play.   It never works and never will.

2)  Same old stuff, new look.   Only now we can call it &quot;CoD:</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Unlike others, I&apos;ll explain why this game is bad.

<br>1)  Netcode.  It&apos;s the same as all previous CoDs, peer-to-peer &quot;servers&quot;.  Horrible latency causes people to seemingly die in 1 shot, while others get a huge advantage.   It&apos;s their horrible netcode that tries to balance ping with play.   It never works and never will.
<br>
<br>2)  Same old stuff, new look.   Only now we can call it &quot;CoD: Titanfall edition&quot;.  If you&apos;re looking for a skilled team game that takes good aim and situational awareness, this isn&apos;t it.   People just fly around guns blazing all the time.
<br>
<br>3)  &quot;Classic&quot; modes, where they take out the exo suit movement, brings it back down a notch to the skilled play area.   If this mode catches on, it could make the experience much better.
<br>
<br>4)  Posistional audio is horrible.   On multiple tested headsets, including the Logitech G930 and the Psyko Audio 5.1 real sound sets, there is virtually no rear channels.  Good luck hearing anyone behind you.
<br>
<br>5)  Graphics are ok, but nothing new by any means.   I play 4k with 3x GTX 980&apos;s in SLI.  The game itself runs crisp and smooth but nothing to get excited over.
<br>
<br>So there you have it.  Pretty much the same problems that plague older releases.....and why Acitivision / whoever makes it this year make no attempts to fix it is beyond my reasoning.  Horrible netcode,  monkeys flying around everywhere, same ole&apos; same ole&apos;.
<br>
<br>And for the love of buddah do not bother trying to snipe.  It&apos;s like trying to swat a fly buzzing around your skull with a postage stamp.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4655937">Expand</a></span>

<br>The amount of bugs in the multiplayer system is insane, and the P2P connection (no dedicated servers) is one big **** up on their side. It&apos;s laggy and the game crashes, the server are so unstable right now it&apos;s just to laugh at.
<br>Gameplay is just about the same as all other CoD games out there, with a few improvements..</span>

However I have played every iteration of COD and feel slightly more qualified to comment than a multitude of adolescents who claims this is the &quot;Best COD ever&quot; having only played Ghosts before AW.
<br>
<br>After the utter shambles that was COD Ghosts I wasn&apos;t expecting much from Advanced Warfare but like a moth to a flame I dutifully purchased AW hoping I wouldn&apos;t get burned.
<br>
<br>After merely minutes in single player it was immediately apparent this was a vast improvement on Ghosts. The game actually ran properly - no stuttering in the menu, the mouse actually moved where you wanted it to and it didn&apos;t take a fortnight to load each mission. Add to that the fact they&apos;ve added a multitude of PC specific options in the menu and so far so good!
<br>
<br>Fast forward a couple of hours and I was really enjoying single player. It&apos;s a decent storyline, it looks good (as good as this engine can look) and sounds great. Maybe this years COD isn&apos;t going to be so bad after all?!?
<br>
<br>Then I tried multiplayer. On dear... Let me use an analogy - Take a room full of young children who suffer from hyperactivity. Sit them down and feed them copious amounts of full fat Coke, chocolate, and sweets with plenty of E numbers. Now let them outside to play nicely... Yeah chaos ensues! Some kids are running around in circles, some are climbing all over boxes, some are in trees, some keep sneaking up on you and kicking you in the shins. It&apos;s complete and utter chaos! That&apos;s pretty much multiplayer in Advanced Warfare.
<br>
<br>Any sense of strategy or tactics goes out the window the seconds that countdown hits zero. It&apos;s very much every man for himself as players bounce round the map in circles. Lining up a shot? Wait he&apos;s now bounced super gummy bear style behind you and stuck his first through your skull. Ok so you slowly get used to the fact it&apos;s no longer a case of looking in the &quot;usual&quot; spots and instead you spend just as much time looking at the sky as you do around corners but hey it&apos;s &quot;different&quot;!
<br>
<br>You should also note that while developers have confirmed dedicated servers are coming, quite why they&apos;re coming after release date I&apos;m not sure, until then you&apos;re at the mercy of P2P. One minute you&apos;ll have four bars, the next one bar, and repeat..
<br>
<br>All in all it&apos;s a great single player campaign but, for this reviewer at least, a poor multiplayer game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4653664">Expand</a></span>

I decided to plunk down $60 for Advanced Warfare because I was feeling nostalgic for the online play from earlier titles, and the early critic reviews were surprisingly good, so I decided to give it a try. After spending the whole day with the game, I can tell you I found it to have been a very, very disappointing purchase--and I am again bitterly reminded of the collusion and softballing that has become so common between developers and game review publishers.
<br>
<br>The game seems to have the ultimate potential to be as fun and enjoyable as some of the best Call of Cuty titles prior. With a little more work, the Exo-Suit mechanics like super-jumping and dodging might a nice fresh spin to the multiplayer. But after 3 years of working on this title in the 10-year-old Call of Duty engine (which you would think should be fairly well mastered at this point, and less resource-intensive relative to modern engines), developer Sledgehammer Games has somehow managed a complete failure in performance optimization to the point where it&apos;s baffling how such a low standard would have been allowed by the publisher for release. The very same computer which allowed me to play Black Ops 2 during it&apos;s launch window with all graphical settings maxed out, at a solid 60 fps, experiences poor performance, stuttering, and infuriating input lag--even when playing Advanced Warfare on medium-to-low settings with all advanced graphical features turned off. These performance issues are then compounded with extremely poor network performance with the P2P server system used by the game--again, something that is baffling to me given that it&apos;s been mastered several times before in the same engine--the background that several other Call of Duty games using a P2P system should have produced for Sledgehammer to draw upon and improve upon, but somehow they have released with a system that is producing the absolute worst connection lag I have ever experienced in a Call of Duty title on any platform.
<br>
<br>Between the performance issues, input lag on your mouse and controls during play, and the absolutely stark-terrible connection lag, it is nearly impossible to feel at all competitive in a multiplayer match even as a seasoned Call of Duty player. The competitive thrill is really the sole purpose and source of enjoyment for these titles, so without that, the game is just an exercise in futility and frustration. This is really the crux of my poor review for the game. Call of Duty games, to me, are all about the excitement of competitive twitch/tactical shooting--where you give up having the most impressive graphics or the biggest maps in exchange for great performance, low lag, and fantastic, tight controls--the things needed for purity of contest. If you take these few things away, the game becomes utterly worthless.
<br>
<br>Sledgehammer Games was working on a 3-year development cycle with access to some of the best budgets, talent, resources, and background knowledge to make a game using a 10-year old engine that was completely unambitious on it&apos;s face. And in spite of all this, all they could managed to push out when their release date rolled around was a glorified open beta with more issues than can be suffered to have fun playing. The only Call of Duty title that was released in a worse state was the infamous &apos;Ghosts,&apos; which released to a chorus of bad reviews and was thoroughly called out as the poor effort it was by gamers and critics alike. Somehow, Advanced Warfare, a game similarly devoid of standards, seems to have been given a near-unanimous pass on everything that&apos;s wrong with it by all the mainstream critics--and even has a surprisingly (and perhaps even suspiciously) high level of positive player reviews on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4660381">Expand</a></span>

<br>Random? Gun Damage - Two enemies at the same distance, one needs 15 bullets before he dies and the other one dies in 5 bullets, really no clue how this is possible but it happens ALL THE TIME. It really feels like bullets randomly deal between 10%-200% damage
<br>
<br>Netcode? - 90% of my deaths feel like I died instantly with no chance to retaliate, my last death I got shot from about 50 meters by a silenced SMG and I died instantly. When I try this, I need to hit a full mag.... Ragequited pretty hard.
<br>
<br>Guns - There are only 4 *meta* guns worth using, the rest is just terrible. All shotguns are really bad ( need 2x more range to work ), sometimes need 5 shots at 5 meters distance while enemy needs 3 bullets with his ak12. Snipers need 2-3 hits to kill someone, and it&apos;s already hard enough to hit people when they are jumping around like monkeys.
<br>
<br>Knifing - I removed the knife keybinding.... I tried to knife people 500+ times and maybe got 3 knife kills out of it. Enemy has to be either in kissing range, to your left or BEHIND you.....
<br>
<br>Same Call of Duty, but now with more mobility and lasers for $60...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4653247">Expand</a></span>

<br>Here is something you can do though. Instead of going out and buying the new call of duty, how about you do differently this year? You don&apos;t go out and buy the same **** so that games will start to get better, because they don&apos;t try to mimic this cashcow anymore and therefore don&apos;t get ruined and we get rid from this stagnation that is bugging games thesedays. Yes, call of duty is the biggest responsible for us having nowadays stagnation in our gaming community. We don&apos;t get varied games because they all try to mimic call of duty. Now i know we don&apos;t like that, so therefore you could just be and not go out and get the new call of duty this year. I promise you, it will pay off, because then we will get some totally new game, nothing to do with call of duty, that is gonna blow us out from the water. Totally innovative, totally crazy fun.

<br>Don&apos;t buy this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4649565">Expand</a></span>

Call of Duty finally gives us what we want with an extremely robust amount of settings, dedicated servers, a new engine, etc etc. People aren&apos;t even giving it a chance, and are instead voting 0 based on what they hear or what they think they know. Half the 0 reviews think that the game runs on the same engine.. do your research, it&apos;s a new engine by a new studio. These reviews are the epitome of what&apos;s wrong with Metacritic, where everyone who voted 0 on games either has a 0 or a 10 for all their games. Pathetic, broken system. As someone who&apos;s actually played the game, I can tell you that the game is fresh, fun, and definitely the Call of Duty experience that&apos;s translated well over onto PC, especially with a movement system that adds enough variety that will have PC players feeling at home. It&apos;s not GOTY material, and the story isn&apos;t as great as I was hoping, but I&apos;d be lying if I said this wasn&apos;t a good game, and I&apos;m going to give it the review it deserves. Not a 10 or a 0 to pad the whole user score to what I personally think it deserves to be at.

I know it&apos;s early to make such a sweeping statement but the game just oozes brilliance on a number of levels. It is streets ahead of Ghosts in every aspect and really puts Infinity Ward to absolute shame. Even Treyarch need to raise their game for next year. Sledgehammer have essentially taken the best aspects of past games and fused them into their very own interpretation along with delivering their own brand of unique ideas.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is fast, the guns are incredible fun, the matches flow superbly and every second is really enjoyable. The maps are simply stunning to look at and their designs &amp; layouts make way for some frantic action.
<br>
<br>The optimisation for PC which has been heavily questioned after Ghosts and Sledgehammer&apos;s silence in the media; is actually riddled with depth and all the key elements to compliment your rig. I really did not expect much but they really have hit the nail on the head from a technical standpoint.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve not enjoyed COD since the Black Ops days but this is a game that really rejuvenates my desire for the franchise. After the pitiful Ghosts last year; this game simply had to deliver and it truly has. SHG took a risk for their first outing and it really paid off in what could be a genre-defining title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4649612">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve never experienced a game, where the developers main focus is to allow players to use &quot;cheats&quot; that would get you banned in other games. Those being:
<br>
<br>I can see through walls with my gun sight (wall hack). I can shoot through walls (another wall hack). Another gun site lights up all players in front of you in bright red (Skinning Hack). Another gun will track onto lit up targets (Aimbot). Now if that isn&apos;t enough to make you an uber player... let&apos;s bring in the toys..... shall we? We now have &quot;Homing Grenades&quot; yes, the hand grenades can be tossed in the general direction of the enemy and they will home in onto them, no defense. You have hand grenades that light up every player camping in a building. So I pull out my no skill, shoot through a wall gun, and casually kill everyone. - Homing drones. Yes, boys and girls, you can take this paper airplane looking thing... toss it into the air without a care in the world, and it will fly over the battlefield and when it sees someone, homes in on them. Now, we have drones, that allow everyone to see everyone on the battlefield. A player tosses one of these no brainers into the air, and other players on the team, can join in on the fun, and rain hell down on everybody. And since it sees everyone on the field. You can kill everyone pretty easy. Lightning strikes obliterate anyone in it&apos;s path. Cover or no cover. If it flys over, you&apos;re dead.
<br>
<br>Oh the nifty new dodge feature/gimmick. It allows you to glitch your movement. It&apos;s not fluid, and it looks stupid, because the animation is stuck while you do it. And it lights you up on the minimap instantly when you bolt a few feet in a direction. Then you&apos;re dead because since the maps are so small, everyone can shoot everyone as long as you can see them. Since everyone can pretty much see everyone, what&apos;s the point? You may as well avoid all that, remove the buildings. Put everyone on a flat surface and give them all uzi&apos;s.
<br>
<br>Sound is horrid. Simply horrid. My surround sound headphones that are normally filled battle sounds and positional sound mapping, is confusing, because sounds just go in and out at random. Very quiet battles. Nobody yelling, nobody saying anything.
<br>
<br>Oh a shotgun can be silenced. Shoots like a full automatic rifle, and sounds like a small handgun. The positional 3D should be disabled, because where the footsteps seem to be coming from one direction, they are actually someplace else, because the sound processing is so weak, it&apos;s confusing. Turn off your surround sound gear because it makes things worse.
<br>
<br>Graphics.... ON a high end graphics card, it is pretty bad. No shading, I don&apos;t see any benefit for having shadows on, because you really can&apos;t see them, but they do appear to have a negative impact on performance,.... shut them off, because they aren&apos;t needed and will make things worse.
<br>
<br>Maps are tiny. Tiny tiny. If you play Battlefield, Imagine taking a server of 24 people. Cram them all between A and B objectives on Metro. You get the idea. That&apos;s what ALL the maps are like. A smaller, crammed full small Rush Metro map. That&apos;s their &quot;Conquest&quot; size map. I get claustrophobic just loading into the map. If you want a quality, fast shooter, that requires some skill... Go play Titanfall. It&apos;s much more of everything COD:AW wants to be and more.
<br>
<br>I wasn&apos;t a COD hateboy before buying this, but I am now. This is a joke. If you like it...good for you, but you must be seriously, easily amused or on a console. This is not PC gaming material. It&apos;s nearly an insult.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4659407">Expand</a></span>

The game isn&apos;t too bad, its fun to play, weapons seem more-or less balanced but its not all good. First, host-peer system, where your host may end up being very slow and your game being bad because of them. Second, everyone moves at an insane speed, its hard to aim at people now, especially when they dolpin dive under you or simply jump in your face. Its new experience, and its interesting, but not perfect. Next: cheaters are obvious like never since SECOND DAY AFTER RELEASE! If not cheaters, this game would be quite interesting to me, although I ended up not using any killstreaks other than UAV - they just get in the way or require too many points.
<br>My main issue was and remains not willing to play with cheaters, if this was cheat-free, I&apos;d give this game 6 points (weapons are so &quot;balanced&quot; they all feel the same, like, there&apos;s no difference between them, and these exo moves, I don&apos;t like them too much considering how limiting the maps are - out of bounds warnings everywhere, or you simply die by getting out of the map). This isn&apos;t how Call of Duty was, or how it should be, in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4659217">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t get how, according to the fans, &quot;this one is better&quot;. I also really don&apos;t get how even if the game is set 40 years later, they still use the same guns. And the same uniforms. And the same techs. WHY? Why do these games have to be so bland and boring? I don&apos;t give a s#!t that a new Call of Duty game is released every year. It could be released every month for all I care. The things that annoy me are the lack of new content, the stupid design choices and the bland story mode, which has become some sort of training stages for new players, rather than a story mode. The story is the most lazy and predictable thing ever. Basicly country X attacks &apos;Murica and &apos;Murica fights back with a team of idiot soldiers. Basicly you are freedom fighter A and, with the help of freedom fighter B you kill anyone who isn&apos;t american. However freedom fighter B is killed and you escape. Then you join company Y and fight......................................wait for it......................Terrorists! Then you realise something and blah blah blah....

<br>I would review the multiplayer, but I think the next sentence summarizes it better:

After 3 of the 6 hours of the campaign I was just playing to be done with it. Multiplayer has been turned into a game of chance where you&apos;re in a constant state of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. You&apos;re in an almost constant state of being exposed to enemy fire whether it&apos;s behind, above, below ,or flank. After being spawned 5 times in a row in someone crosshairs in the second round that I&apos;ve played, I&apos;m already trading this garbage in today. Seeing as how Activision and their devs have completely lost any ability to develop a decent COD game, I say they&apos;d be better off just remaking MW2. I&apos;d like to throw out a hearty FU to IGN for being instrumental in me wasting $60 of my hard earned money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4662379">Expand</a></span>

Otherwise they will start making really good games and do not only care about making a lot of money. Maybe someone at Sledgehammer Games needs a new yacht and I could not sleep well if he cant afford it because people don&apos;t buy the game. And i feel really bad i only paid about 13 euros for a Russian key. I think its a good thing Russians have to pay much less because those bad Russian&apos;s wouldn&apos;t pay as much as we do and would rather buy a cheap copy instead. I also really like getting discriminated by steam because i want to play with a Russian key. I should feel honored being forced to pay much more.
<br>Best review is from IGN and GRYOnline.pl. They say its the best CoD of all time or since MW. They must be really well  paid for promoting such nonsense.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4665693">Expand</a></span>

How about advanced **** 3 years of development Sledgehammer? GFY! A game like this is actually a development of few months. After making the worst CoD of all time(Ghosts), Activision intended to make at least a slightly better game next year. So they chose Sledgehammer to develop. Then, they compiled a bunch of ripoffs from other games(including the story, tech, weapons and etc) hired one of the greatest actors of our time for a cheesy, worthless, forgettable villain. Then some clumsy, incomplete development, and finally some heavy advertising, and ta-dah! Now you have the latest, revolutionary, groundbreaking installment in Call of Duty series! Special Edition exclusively for AMD Radeon R9 295X2, which includes following features. Massive FPS drops(ranges from 60-18 on a 4K display), massive stuttering, de-synced audio and many more!

There are hardly any guns, less perks than any other game, you&apos;ll get bored with it in a matter of minutes. Worse still: the maps are ****ing horrible. Literally same layout on every single one, that is all close quarters, no chokes, nothing interesting.
<br>
<br>So as you can imagine gameplay is the same run and gun **** as usual, in fact its a necessity if you want to perform well givin the small homogeneous selection of maps, and idiodic movement mechanics. All weapons from the already pitifully small pool are obselete except the SMG&apos;s.
<br>
<br>Whoever was the brains coming up with the features in this game is literally a joke, and should be fired from any project lead ever. The missing features are just completely ridiculous. For instance there&apos;s no lobby chat, something that a second year programmer could implement. Like what the **** were they thinking?
<br>
<br>Avoid this poison at all costs. Like I said any of the preceding COD&apos;s except Ghosts are more interesting than this not only repackaged but dumbed down horse ****. Please don&apos;t make the same mistake as I did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4687879">Expand</a></span>

Also, have seen a couple hackers trolling and admitting to it. Nothing you or i can do about it. They cant be kicked in p2p.
<br>
<br>I was really looking forward to this game. I had hopes that it would be as good as CODMW but no. Single player story is good but game it glitched and sound does not sync up in the cinematic events. Which one could over look. Then they tried to fix it and there is no sound now in the cinematic events so you have no idea whats doing on in the story.  Single player graphics look good. THEY DO NOT carry over to the multilayer. Maps are glitched. I constantly got my player stuck in the map literally between a rock and a hard place. Bodies float in the air after they are dead. Just laying there on some invisible platform. Just play on, we should be use to half built games by now right. all these years of pos mgnt shoving a game out before its ready.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer. Texture and the relative good graphics of the single player do not come over into the multiplier. You can seriously tell you had two teams making this game. team 1 did the single player and team 2 made the MP. Team 2 i think were interns actually cause its horrible. The environment textures and map layout are pretty bad. Most of this could have been over looked if the game ran. But the multilayer is on p2p networking so it runs like junk. Lag movement, lag shots, lag hits. lag. If you finally get paired into a game after 45 min and it runs well DONT LEAVE you will not find another one all day.  save your money. i wish i did. I so wanted this game to be good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4709131">Expand</a></span>

I give Sledgehammer credit for trying to innovate the game, but yeah.. There hasn&apos;t been a good CoD since MW3, and even that was controversial. This game gets worse and worse every year, so glad I have Battlefield to fall back on.</span>

<br>If the developers can&apos;t be bothered to implement the basic building blocks of an online FPS game then why bother giving them money!? I don&apos;t want to sit in some stupid lobby like these filthy console peasants waiting to get a game, and then when you do get a game have to put up with ridiculous latency, host migrations or pathetically low max players per match.
<br>
<br>P2P match making lobbies are clearly vastly inferior to dedicated servers where I choose which server to join to ENSURE I get good latency not having to hope for good latency, and no, getting dedicated servers hosted by the developers in a data centre isn&apos;t good enough either.
<br>
<br>We need privately owned/rented servers without any restrictions on what companies we can rent from with a fully functional server browser and favorites list.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4917564">Expand</a></span>

For a game that&apos;s called &quot;Advanced Warfare&quot;, the system is ridiculously outdated. No dedicated servers on a competitive PC game? Seriously?! That should be an automatic zero in my book. But for those who are willing to be a little more lenient in their judgment of this game, let me outline some more atrocities about this game:
<br>
<br>* Shader preload is an option that theoretically loads the map before you join the game, thus eliminating FPS drops. It&apos;s a really cool idea, and guess what? It doesn&apos;t work for half of the maps. As a matter of fact, it does nothing more than kick you out after waiting for several minutes. BOOOO.
<br>
<br>* Lag compensation. Their way of dealing with the hosts having the best connection is to introduce artificial lag that all players in the match have to deal with, just to even out the game. So if someone on another continent joins your game, then everyone gets to play with lag! Sounds fair, right?
<br>
<br>* Horrendous optimization. Those with powerful GPUs are still going to run into FPS drops when playing AW on the lowest settings. -sigh-
<br>
<br>* Instead of innovating the map design to encourage players to &quot;parkour&quot; everywhere, there&apos;s just a ton of boundaries everywhere. If you try to jump onto a ledge that you think you can grab, instead you&apos;ll find yourself falling off with an annoying &quot;Out of Bounds&quot; message. The new movement system is great, but these maps do not support it. These maps could have been thrown in any other CoD and would&apos;ve done just as well there. TItanfall&apos;s map design and movement system is far more satisfying.
<br>
<br>* It&apos;s missing a lot of fun game types like Gun Game and Demolition. Momentum and Uplink are okay, but they don&apos;t come close to filling the void.
<br>
<br>Titanfall, a game that came out over half a year ago and can be bought for a fraction of AW&apos;s price, is a much better game. That&apos;s really saying something. And the worst part is, I bet AW2 is already in development. -_-</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4796625">Expand</a></span>

<br>Starting from the technical side:
Let&apos;s suppose you bought the game, you install it and open the Single Player. The resolution is wrong, and you want to change it, but you can&apos;t!

<br>Starting from the technical side:
<br>Let&apos;s suppose you bought the game, you install it and open the Single Player. The resolution is wrong, and you want to change it, but you can&apos;t! There&apos;s no &quot;Settings&quot; in your menu... Ok, let&apos;s play, New Game... And the intro video starts playing. A fairly long video that introduces you to the campaign. Then the video finishes and the game is still loading. I have an SSD so I thought it was downloading some updates or something... Ok game starts, you go to options (now options exists), change the resolution, apply, and then boom! black screen, the intro video plays again, the whole game loads again, another long 2 minutes of loading. What is going on?? The only setting you can change without reloading the whole game is VSync!
<br>
<br>Once you configured the game and it performs ok you think you&apos;re ready to play... But it&apos;s just the beginning! the textures get weird, the game starts to be unplayable in some parts, there&apos;s stuttering, memory leaks, crashes, sometimes the whole computer crashes (that may be Windows 8 fault...). Then you start reading online or trying around disabling some settings. The conclusion: you will learn by hearth the dialogues of the intro video, I promise!
<br>
<br>Ok... aside from the technical problems... The graphics look like the game is 2 or 3 years old, Battlefield 4 released more than one year ago have by far better graphics. But graphics are not everything! that&apos;s true...
<br>
<br>About the single player: The campaign starts in a interesting way, it seems a cool game, but at some point random things that are not explained start to happen, it&apos;s like you missed a couple of chapters or something... You lose completely the story line.
<br>
<br>Another thing I don&apos;t like from this game is that some little things that make the game more realistic are not really accomplished. For example, collisions with dead bodies, you really pass through the bodies like they were ghosts. Or for example melee killing doesn&apos;t have a cool animation like many games today.
<br>
<br>AI, at least for me, is a very important from an FPS. In this game it feels like you are supposed to attack from a specific point of the level otherwise enemy bots, well.. They act weird, they don&apos;t know what to do, it&apos;s like... you are not supposed to be here! now what? sometimes they stare you, sometimes they kill you, sometimes they ignore you... I would expect something similar to Crysis 3, I know this game is not supposed to let you choose how and where you attack from, but at least the enemies would be able to react to a attack strategy change.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know, maybe I&apos;m being to critic because I compare it with BF4, which also had a lot of bugs and technical problems some persisting today, but even if BF4 drove me mad with all the crashes, memory leak and incompatibility with Windows 8.1, it seems like a very achieved game compared to the PC version of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.
<br>
<br>I gave it a 4/10 because I found the multiplayer interesting and funny, futuristic weapons are cool and it reminds Quake because of some details. The double jump other kind of futuristic things you have give a game a cool online gameplay, that is a mix of Titanfall (except you can&apos;t run on walls :( ), Crysis 3 and Quake 3 Excessive mods.
<br>
<br>The conclusion is... It&apos;s a console port, a not really achieved one. Maybe better achieved than previous versions, ok, but not enough for PC players, who demand some minimum quality. It have a lot of graphic options yes, but it&apos;s because you need to tweak a lot the game for working on your rig and configuring the game is really painful. You feel stupid for spending the money on that game every time some error appears, and you expect for the budget of the game, a better story development during the campaign.
<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t played too long this game online but the times I did it took too long to make the matchmaking. Titanfall which is probably less played than CoD:AW is very fast finding a game, what&apos;s happening? I also read that there are several problems with the servers like lag and disconnecting that I haven&apos;t experienced yet.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t buy this game on PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4855784">Expand</a></span>

At least other games like Mario put in a lot of new smaller mechanics to compliment the same, main mechanic. But COD adds a new jump. That&apos;s all. Buy CS: GO, an FPS that is all about tactics and teamwork that wont steal 60 bucks (or more) from you every year.</span>

<br>
<br>it&apos;s 2014 for god&apos;s sake...and we have to rely on connections instead of STABLE AND RELIABLE DEDICATED SERVERS ?
<br>
<br>WHY ? because they cost ? ok...i&apos;ll tell you what&apos;s gonna cost more...the ammount of time you&apos;ll spend to develop DLC&apos;s and NOONE going to buy them because even the MAIN GAME is broken...so why would i pay to &quot;have more&quot; when i&apos;m not able to enjoy the current material you had with the launch...
<br>
<br>ghosts died,advanced warfare is dying only 1 month since release
<br>
<br>it&apos;s all about treyarch now...let&apos;s hope for the best</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4755674">Expand</a></span>

<br>When starting the single-player, I noticed the great graphics. Sadly, the game had to start like it usually does. You lose a compagnion. Reaally sucks.

<br>The single player itself is, just like most of the call of duty&apos;s, awesome, but the storyline is always boring. It&apos;s so predictable! Some random missions, and then some development in the storyline. Even a kid can see where the storyline goes to. No surprises, really. Except for the alliance with Comrack, which I enjoyed. The extra features were nice. The graphics of the storyline movies are outstanding, the best I have yet seen in a game. If this could turn in actual gameplay, wow. The gameplay graphics are still the same.
<br>
<br>The storyline is, again, way too short.. I would rather have them publish a game every two years that&apos;s long with an outstanding storyline and great multiplayer, than this rubbish. It&apos;s all about the money, it seems.
<br>
<br>As I explored the multiplayer, I became very disappointed. The exo skeletons aren&apos;t an extra. They suck. I can imagine it&apos;s amazing for some, because of new speed, new dimensions, a new way of playing etc., but for me it&apos;s plain rubbish. I like to play a game stealthy without camping, but here there is no stealth at all. And if you&apos;re trying to be, someone will always spot u while hovering over you.
<br>
<br>I play with a controller on my pc and I feel I have a disadvantage. People with gaming mouses can set it up to reduce the recoil of the weapon and thus stabilize it while shooting. When I shoot, the weapon mostly shoots everywhere, while others (I watch the killcams) don&apos;t seem to have any difficulty with firing their weapon.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t feel like buying anymore of their games!! If only I could sell this very bad game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4875540">Expand</a></span>

Its like MW3 all over again. 70&#x20AC; down the drain. 0/5 would buy again. (Still giving a 2 because of the way things are going, i hope that someday i might want to play Call Of Duty again.

<br>
<br>La jugabilidad, el exo, la acci&#xF3;n y la mira con el mouse est&#xE1;n muy bien logrados, por tal motivo el juego no puede llevar un cero.
<br>
<br>Kevin Spacy le da otro punto y la historia no es tan mala pero si muy predecible, ni una sorpresa. si esperan algo memorable como el MW1-2 o el BO1-2 se van a llevar una decepci&#xF3;n muy grande. Mejor no esperar nada y as&#xED; se lleva otro punto en historia.
<br>
<br>El multiplayer no anda, as&#xED; que un juego multijugador pierde la mitad de sus puntos al no funcionar (-5 puntos por eso)
<br>
<br>Total 3 puntos: 1 historia, 1 jugabilidad y 1 entretenimiento (kevin spacy entretiene y la acci&#xF3;n de momentos es muy divertida)
<br>
<br>Observaci&#xF3;n: el juego es muuuuucho m&#xE1;s lento que Titanfall, los que busquen adrenalina mejor prueben el otro.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4796524">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pro&apos;s -
<br>The game is beautiful. Graphics are a solid 9+.
<br>
<br>Most of the movement is fluid, and most of the weapons feel balanced.
<br>
<br>The customization of the avatar&apos;s outfit and Exo is a nice touch
<br>
<br>Con&apos;s -
<br>P2P, after repeatedly being told that the game would have dedicated servers, that simply is not the case... again. This game has so much potential, but is hindered greatly without dedicated servers. This leads into problems in many areas, and a major issue is the lag compensation. One game I&apos;ll have ok hit detection, then the next I&apos;ll squeeze off 4-5 bullets directly on target, and not one will register. This leads to whoever I&apos;m shooting at to hear me fire, turn and return fire and kill me with bullet. Spectating your team will also display this behavior in lag comp, and leads to a ton of warranted complaining.
<br>
<br>The spawn system needs to be reworked. You will literally spawn right in front of the enemy, making it super easy to be killed. I&apos;ve spawned several time in the middle of a group of the opposing team, which always results in me being killed again instantly, and usually the enemy will get a team kill or two in the process.
<br>
<br>The maps are decent size for players without exo suits, but since all players have them, it makes the maps feel really small.
<br>
<br>DLC... there are a few issues here. First is the fact that Microsoft and Activision are in bed with each other, and have a deal worked out where Xbox gets any DLC 1 month before the other platforms, which IMO is a dumb practice that alienates everyone else that paid good money for the game too. Why are we be penalized because we do not own an Xbox? Makes no sense. This doesn&apos;t make me want to buy an Xbox, it makes me not want to buy the game. The 2nd part is this DLC nonsense is that is separates the gaming community into the haves and have nots. As seen with MW2, BO, MW3, BO2, Ghosts, and now AW, it splits the community and quickly kills the game. The falloff on Ghosts was so bad that the game was a ghost town after the first DLC was released, but that also had to do with the fact that Ghosts was a horrible game. And now that you can purchase guns, ie laser guns, this game has become a Pay to Win game. The laser guns are ridiculous overpowered and ruin what little balance the game had.
<br>
<br>Conclusion -
<br>Avoid this game at all costs. It&apos;s 6 moths after release, and major flaws/issues still have not been addressed, and this point, probably never will. It&apos;s definitely not worth the $59.99 price tag, and even at 50% off, that would still be a stretch. Save your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=5139167">Expand</a></span>

It is just like the rest, but with a few more features. It was fun at first, but then FPS was all over the place, and it became repetitive very quickly. I don&apos;t know what it is about MW3 and BO2 that makes them addictive for me, but this isn&apos;t great at all. Completely overhyped, to the maximum capacity. Weapons are not impressive at all, the maps are decent, create a character is actually pretty cool. That&apos;s about it. The only reason I give this a score of 2 is because of the new movement and new character creation. Other than those two, its the same as the rest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=5191722">Expand</a></span>

<br>Every once in a while you enter into a server where everything is running smooth, and it is a truly great game. In these moments, I feel like this could be the best COD multiplayer experience ever. I feel nostalgia for quake and unreal tournament. Then the next game I&apos;m back to these terrible P2P matchmaking shenanigans. Please fix this games MP and I will update it to the 8 or 9 out 10 that this game deserves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4787194">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>However,  I must say that this is the worst purchase I have made this year, and am kicking myself for not trusting my gut. The single player is exactly the same thing as every other CoD, and has now become so boring to play. The hand-holding mechanics are now at an unprecedented level in my opinion, and seems even worse than previous incarnations. The only improvement to campaign this time around is Kevin Spacey, whose fantastic performance does lend some quality to the campaign. Unfortunately, the storyline fundamentally is not up-to-scratch, and it&apos;s all a bit too predictable. As far as single player goes, I will not buy another CoD game if there is even a hint of &quot;follow me&quot; mechanics in there, not when there are so many other great single player experiences on the market today.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer has been universally praised as &quot;fresh&quot; and &quot;exciting&quot; by critics. I must be playing a different game. The &quot;innovative&quot; movement mechanics are basically just variations of  &quot;double jump&quot; in different directions and apart from that it&apos;s exactly the same as previous games. These new mechanics have also clearly just been designed for console controller look/turn speed, and as such the gameplay on PC is just stupid, with every one jumping about and swiveling at breakneck speed, it&apos;s just a gigantic cluster f**k with no tactical elements whatsoever. It doesn&apos;t feel like a military shooter at all. They have abandoned the idea of dedicated servers, instead opting for the &quot;one player is host system&quot; which makes the lag the worst of any multi-player PC game I have ever played.
<br>
<br>The audio is terrible, there are no sounds of your enemies moving to create immersion in the environment or any tactical audio elements and everything is really &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;nice&quot; sounding (not in a good way - it doesn&apos;t feel like a battle ground in the slightest). Explosions sound like fireworks.
<br>
<br>The port is what I would call just about passable. There is strange mouse acceleration on certain configurations, and limited options (you can&apos;t even fine tune the sensitivity of the mouse, it&apos;s either too fats or too slow). There is no FOV slider for single player, which means I had to play it with a wireless controller and sit 6 feet from monitor to avoid headaches.
<br>
<br>There are many other issues with the game, the menus lag (Yes, a AAA game in 2014 has laggy menus!!!) and the player count on PC is now getting ridiculously low already (you better want to play team Deathmatch, because all the other modes are empty and/or unplayably laggy as the game seemingly gives host to Pablo from Brazil playing on 128kbit dial-up)
<br>
<br>Suffice to say, the game is uninstalled.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4799016">Expand</a></span>

Many will have said this is just halo with a C.O.D badge on it but it&apos;s true. In cod there have always been options to play different styles and with different equipment, like claymores and bouncing Betty&apos;s, that let you hold off an area and watch your back, or you can run and gun. With advanced warfare, no options, just run and gun makes for a very narrow playing experience. Multiplayer menus are slow on line, armory graphics look cheap and the selection of guns is rubbish. After owning it for 2 weeks I&apos;m bored to tears with it and just can&apos;t find a gun that&apos;s &quot;fun&quot; to play with. Do yourself a favour and keep your money til next year, hopefully treyarch won&apos;t drop the ball like sledgehammer had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4799582">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>&quot;new&quot; mechanics are nothing but copies of mechanics seen first in &quot;Crysis&quot; and &quot;Titanfall&quot; - they are fun and breath new life in MP games, nevertheless, it remains a CoD ...I&apos;ll probably NEVER understand why they even bother to implement &quot;different&quot; guns... they ALL shoot the same!
<br>
<br>CoD isn&apos;t really a FPS - it&apos;s a reflex test ... basically, whoever shoots first, kills. aiming is optional, something like &quot;skill&quot; pretty much too, IMHO.
<br>
<br>I pirated the game for testing purposes - I am NOT going to buy it and after playing about 50% of the campaign, I deleted it (as I do with ALL games I pirate - either I buy, or I delete and in the case of CoD AW, it was latter).

Its not a bad game for sure, but its just the same as before with a double-jump. The campaign is OK but really predictable.

<br>I&apos;m not a big fan of all the jumping around, but was liking the game.  As the week went on though I became more suspicious of hackers.  I almost always watch kill cams and could easily see them following me through the walls etc. (I almost always have all the camo perks: low profile, blind-eye, cold-blooded, etc. and a silencer to keep me off the radar.  Starting Friday the hacked XP lobbies started. The hacked XP lobbies on PC are very frequent (every 5 or 6 lobbies I&apos;m put into).  If you did like I did and make a kill before you know the lobby is hacked.... your stats will be reset.  This has happened to me twice now. The last time I was &apos;lucky&apos; to get the &quot;First Blood&quot; kill... and was given 65000 points and about 15 levels. I immediately left the game.... but was still reset the next day.
<br>
<br>BO2 with its dedicated servers was much better.  If you like single player this game is good on PC. If you want to play Multiplayer be aware there is no anti-cheat and if you get into a hacked XP lobby you will be reset!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4675173">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you&apos;ve played a COD game before then you&apos;ve played them all. This is no exception except that now you some high tech toys that the game lets you play with when it feel generous. They almost feel like quick time events. Press &quot;F&quot; to use AMAZING TECHNOLOGY. You can&apos;t just start climbing walls or punching through walls whenever you want. Oh no, that&apos;s reserved for special occasions, like when the you need to escape a tricky situation or simply break the monotony of shooting people or drones.
<br>
<br>Now everyone repeat after me, THEY ARE GOING TO INVADE AMERICA!. At least we know that Activision is committed to recycling because they keep reusing the same plot line over and over...
<br>Perhaps their fan base is made up entirely of American survivalists. I don&apos;t know.
<br>
<br>One thing that amuses me about these games is that you shoot, stab and  kill everyone in the usual emotionless manner because it&apos;s ALL ABOUT REVENGE, YAAAAARRRR! But the second that a &quot;good guy&quot; dies, it gets all emotional and sentimental. It&apos;s all ridiculous and childish. By now I&apos;m truly over this thumping &apos;Murican propaganda machine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4691794">Expand</a></span>

The SP campaign is a little new, but nothing we haven&apos;t experienced before in a FPS shooter campaign. New jet packs remind me of playing crysis and titanfall mixed with cod elements of warfare. MP is worse because of the fact your playing cod with mediocre players and bland elements. Run and gun MP with no strategy. Flow of spawn calls all the public MP games unless you get into competitive play. As an ex FPS competitive player and ex Counter-strike player from back in the day COD games have gotten worse over time since I played COD: MW and MW2. I do not hate the franchise, but when you keep pushing our COD games and have no new ideas, it will die and get bland over time. The only reason its still played in competitively is because the MLG and other hosts are either forced to run it in the circuit or paid to do so. A couple more years and COD will be wiped by the battlefield series or another new up and coming FPS. Counter-Strike was so popular and is still played to this day because it has so much replayability built into it, constant decision-making, strategy, and every competitive game is different from the last. COD gets boring after an hour or 2 of me constantly going 30-5, with hardly no perks and running around the map spawning all the other players. Once you figure out the spawn rotation it is like playing Goldeneye for the N64 all over again without the enjoyment of Goldeneye. MP maps are still small as hell and do not have any strategy in them whatsoever. Pointless and for the weak FPS gamers, mostly for the kids</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4693330">Expand</a></span>

<br>- The spawns are the worst ever in a call of duty game. Sometimes you spawn 5 meters    next to 3 other enemies, sometimes you see yourself spawning in the kill cam.
<br>- less weapons (about 30 weapons).
<br>- too much accuracy when firing from the hip -&gt; a lot of spraying kiddys.
<br>- maps are **** only a few are good.
<br>- a lot of features are stolen from other games (titanfall, crysis, battlefield).
<br>- kill streaks are mostly completely useless (overheating guns, slow rockets).
<br>- long loading times (on ssd and hdd)
<br>+ graphics are good but their is better.
<br>+ you can try weapons directly before entering a game.
<br>+ you can adjust your look and your exo.
<br>+ fast updates for bugfixes (still a lot bugs).
<br>
<br>I think this game is quiet annoying. You join a game and you are already dead before the game is completely finished loading. Half of the time you get shoot in the back because of bad spawns and **** maps. Everyone is spraying around with lasers and mps,camping with snipers or hiding in corners.
<br>You spawn and two second later there is already someone behind you, shooing at your back.
<br>The new features like the jetpack and sliding is so annoying you sometimes waist a full magazine on someone, who is moving two times around you and back and killing you by spraying with his laser (seriously I have never seen someone using the sight when having the laser).
<br>Their is so much jumping-sliding-running-spraying, I cant believe I played this game more than 2 games in row.
<br>The campaign isnt totally bad, but the campaign of modern warfare 1-3 was a lot better and its the shortest I have ever played. A few years ago you just needed to destroy a few targets while completing a parkour. This time you get a tutorial about every thing you carry with you, your grenades, weapons, exo, movement; they seem to believe your are a complete retard that has no idea how to use autoaim grenade ( you waist 1 hour of the 5-6 hour campaign for tutorials). From year to year the same: you and a few others fight against hundreds of stupid npc&#xB4;s in ugly designed levels for the glory of America, attacked by terrorists finding that one bad guy (what  did I expected ?), with a lot of watching: military forces walking around, scientist developing new weapons, hostages and bad guys talking, good guys talking to bad guys, hostages talking to good guys, cutscenes, quick time events, its much more a film then every other campaign.
<br>All in all I don&apos;t think its even worth the 50 euros for the pc version and the game still needs a lot of balancing to make it playable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4699445">Expand</a></span>

After 10 hours I can say multiplayer would be quite good with these new movement/exo features, new weapons like some laser gun, single shot sniper rifle, customizable kill streaks (for example killstreak can last longer or be more powerfull, but it requires more points to earn it), but it&apos;s ruined by unstable online service - have difficulties connecting to it since launch and keep getting disconnected while playing.
<br>The P2P hosting is back (lovely host migration pause), so every game I see people with high pings and most of the time lag compensation puts me on huge disadvantage resulting in losing each confrontation. I shot enemy 2-3 times and killcams shows me not even shooting once.
<br>I find it frustrating that these people can spend millions on Kevin Spacey and advertising, but don&apos;t want to spend anything on server infrastructure. What this game really needs is lobby system that matches people based on their location and then assigns lobby to the closest free server.
<br>To sum it up, it&apos;s just another COD that will last one season (with PC version that might actually be one winter) and will be forgotten quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4660699">Expand</a></span>
