As a disclaimer, this game is the first in a series that includes the Still Life games as well, but is not related in plot, and related very little in everything else, so it really doesn&apos;t matter if you play this game before or after playing the Still Life games. With that out of the way, let me say that Post Mortem is incredibly unique in its gameplay, containing a branching conversation system that leads to a multitude of different storylines and several different endings, puzzles that, although might find them frustrating, are at least challenging to the mind and not just one&apos;s patience or the tendons in their hands. However, the best part of the game for me was the atmosphere, which is where it shines over almost every other example of games from this genre. At times, I almost felt like I was playing a psychological horror game, instead of a detective mystery, and not just because of the cult and supernatural elements. In the end, the only drawback in this game is one man: Jacque Helloin. Not only is this character completely unrealistic, even for a Frenchman, the voice actor they got for his character is one of the worst I have ever heard in my life. This makes a sizable portion of the game almost unbearable, but it was well worth it overall thanks to everything else being so excellent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/post-mortem/user-reviews?user_review_id=4255009">Expand</a></span>

Character interaction is also a weakness of this game and it isn&apos;t entirely bug free either. Many nice puzzles, one of them excessively frustrating though. Overall, for the money spent I had a hell lot of fun. And I felt like just having finished reading a novel afterwards.
