When I found out it was going to be different endings, by choosing different choices, I tried it once more. And what I found out, was that it merely lasted 1 hour. The puzzles are simple, and the second playthroughs become so quick because you remember what to do. In terms of the story/voice acting, it is not very special. The first chapter had a better experience and better story in general.
