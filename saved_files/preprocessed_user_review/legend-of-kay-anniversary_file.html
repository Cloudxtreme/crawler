<br>bringing back the good and unfortunately the bad.
<br>Legend of Kay Anniversary is an HD remake of a PS2 game from 2005 and unfortunately this remake feels like nothing but a fresh coat of paint was added.
<br>Legend of Kay is a 3D platformer and pretty fun 3D platformer, there is so much to love about this game, its colorful, the characters have charm and levels are highly varied to prevent repetitiveness.
<br>You start the game out in a catvilliage to learn about these evil gorillas and rats trying to take over the land, so you train with your drunken sensei and you set out into the world to take these gorillas down.
<br>along your journey you&#x2019;ll find crystals that boost your score to unlock collectibles such as concept art and weapon skins at the end of every level, you&#x2019;ll find health upgrades, magic upgrades, and new armor and weapons.
<br>I really loved picking this world apart for its secrets and platforming my way through.
<br>You never know what the end of one level will take you or even where the middle of the level will take you, you could end up in a classic epic boss battle, riding a wild boar, in a swamp, a city, a cliff side,
<br>progression is so refreshingly unpredictable
<br>What isn&#x2019;t refreshing though is the combat
<br>The combat is very button mashy, not too many moves you can do, and enemies really take forever to kill,
<br>not only do they seem to be damage sponges, but they spam the block button like your little sister that doesn&#x2019;t know how to play fighting games.
<br>This usually isn&#x2019;t a problem if the battles are small, but most of the time you&#x2019;ll be lucky to face less than 4 enemies at a time and while you&#x2019;re trying to break their defense you&#x2019;ll be getting cheap shotted from behind.
<br>I didn&#x2019;t have too much trouble until about halfway through the game though
<br>the difficulty spike was intense and hopping right in at nightmare difficulty from the start didn&#x2019;t help either.
<br>There are some lifesaving pickups such as bombs and hornet nests you can find randomly or buy at a shop to bring into battle with you, and there are save shrines that revive your health and tons of extra lives around, but the health revival doesn&#x2019;t even completely replenish your health and neither do the extra lives making them essentially useless.
<br>I&#x2019;m not sure what the developers were thinking with the extra life system
<br>I know you couldn&#x2019;t defeat the spam blocking crocodiles with armor and full health, so were going to let you try again but this time starting with 25% of what you had to begin with.
<br>You&#x2019;re better off backing out into the main menu and reloading your last save point rather than use an extra life.
<br>Speaking of head scratchers, this is 2015 and the game has camera controls from 2002
<br>they&#x2019;re sticky and really give you no freedom, this can be insanely frustrating when you&#x2019;re trying to slice through enemies or platform with the already stiff feeling controls that have plagued 3d platformers outside of Mario since forever.
<br>I felt like I died more times thanks to the camera than my own human error.
<br>It felt lazy to me that the developers wouldn&#x2019;t go into the actual game and make it better, bring it up to today&#x2019;s standards.
<br>I can&#x2019;t imagine the team running around and saying wow, these camera angles are perfect, let&#x2019;s not do anything to them, because honestly, they&#x2019;re crap and out of all things, ruin this games overall experience the most.
<br>Despite the stiff controls, damage sponge enemies and crappy camera, I  still loved my time with Legend of Kay Anniversary and I believe you will too,
<br>I really wish the development team put more love into though
<br>This game really had potential to reach the mid 8s to lower 9s
<br>For What it is
<br>
<br>3D Platformer: 8/10
<br>Overall:
<br>7.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-kay-anniversary/user-reviews?user_review_id=5410026">Expand</a></span>
