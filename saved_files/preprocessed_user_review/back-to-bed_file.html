The graphics and art style are outstanding. It&apos;s like playing a game inside a piece of art that&apos;s half Dali and half Escher. The game is almost worth the low price just for the visuals.
<br>
<br>The gameplay, itself, is a bit more ordinary, but enjoyable enough. Basically, Bob sleepwalks around the level while you control an alter-ego, placing objects in his way to direct him toward his bed. Unlike a lot of other puzzle games, you have to think on your toes and be quick, since Bob never stops sleepwalking. That could frustrate some who like to study their puzzles and not be pressured with time constraints. I wasn&apos;t a fan of it at first, but the gameplay did grow on me a bit as the levels went on. At least you can pause at any time, and the fast-forward feature was also quite handy. By the way, the game recommends a controller, but using the mouse worked out just fine for me.
<br>
<br>To this puzzle lover, the game&apos;s challenge was definitely on the easy side. Most of the levels took under a minute to solve, but some took longer and gave more challenge. In all, it took me only an hour to breeze through the original 30 levels. Completing those unlocks &quot;nightmare mode,&quot; which involves playing the levels all over again, but having to make Bob collect 1-3 keys per level. It adds some much-needed challenge and it took me 1.5 hours to finish those levels. All told, the game gave me 2.5 hours of mild enjoyment. That may not seem like much, but, considering that the game is only $6, that&apos;s not bad. That&apos;s less than the price of a movie ticket.
<br>
<br>In the end, the game&apos;s outstanding visuals and low price are its main draws. There&apos;s not as much gameplay there as you might like, but at least it&apos;s pretty and you can&apos;t argue with the price. Hopefully, a sequel gets made with more levels and/or more challenge per level, because the game has potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/back-to-bed/user-reviews?user_review_id=4403867">Expand</a></span>

<br>Back to bed is a puzzle game where you guide a sleep walker back to bed.
<br>You do this by placing apples in his way to force him to change his path
<br>along your way you&#x2019;ll run into obstacles such as alarm clocks, whale trains, dogs, and manholes.
<br>You can fall off of the edge as many times as you wish, but run into anything that can way the sleeper up and you have to retry,
<br>The game really does a great job of slowly spoon feeding you difficulty&#x2026;
<br>You are introduced to the mind warping optical allusions, fish you can make bridges with, and mouths that of course blow the sleep walker over to a new path.
<br>Unfortunately though I don&#x2019;t believe there is enough real meat to the game
<br>I feel like the game is a tad bit under developed in the sense of continuing to innovate to keep you hooked.
<br>It would have been really neat to have been thrown into more than just 2 different dreams worlds, if the team really played with the dream theme beyond the stereotypical weird geometrics and melting clocks.
<br>perhaps go into different dream cycles.
<br>Maybe my vision for the games potential is far beyond what this game was intended to be in the first place.
<br>a simple mobile puzzle game.
<br>Not here to really do anything other than stump you and tease your brain.
<br>You can complete the games 30 levels easily in about an hour.
<br>After you have completed the fairly simple story mode, you can replay all 3 levels in nightmare mode, and this time, things aren&#x2019;t so simple.
<br>Not only do you have to guide the sleepwalker through the familiar 30 levels, you now have to guide him to 1, 2 or, even 3 keys to unlock his door.
<br>This is really where the challenge is at, and where the game is at beyond the initial experience.
<br>If you love stressing your brain out, Back to Bed will provide some pretty relaxing brain stimulation.
<br>For what it is
<br>
