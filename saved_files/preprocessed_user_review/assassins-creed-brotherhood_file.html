I&apos;d like it more if ubisoft played around a bit more with the character you adopt in the animus rather than fixating on ezio. Sure he&apos;s a great character but I&apos;m getting tired and it&apos;s obvious that Revelations will still feature Ezio... when I wish they moved on. Still it&apos;s their project and not mine, so it&apos;s up to them to deliver what they envisage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1981875">Expand</a></span>

It was a valiant effort to improve on the last one, but I thought they focused too much on adding new activities and not enough on the story. I lost track of the story by spending the large amounts of time required for shop quests etc and getting assassins together and sending them on missions. I also felt more of a sense of urgency in AC2 with the Templars always present etc, but Brotherhood didn&apos;t have this feeling at all. The story in AC2 was quite linear, but with this game, I think they&apos;ve made it a little more like Grand Theft Auto by focusing on extra activities. I like this in GTA4...but for some reason in this game I would&apos;ve preferred a more linear story line...it lost the immersive feeling that AC2 had.... not a bad game at all, but I was a little disappointed and it didn&apos;t live up to the previous one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1697361">Expand</a></span>

This however has more replay value than the past 2 games in the franchise, since you have the multiplayer part. And since in our day and age people are so hooked on social networks, like Facebook, this also &quot;invades&quot; that. Ubisoft really went all in with this one and I shouldn&apos;t be surprised if future AC games will be more and more like this one. In short: Evolution.
<br>And I for one, can&apos;t wait till Ubisoft realeases &quot;Assassin&apos;s Creed: Revelations&quot; which maybe will include the one think that this one doesn&apos;t have; Co-op. And as promised will tie up all loose ends (...and cliffhangers) from &quot;Assassin&apos;s Creed 2&quot; and &quot;Assassin&apos;s Creed: Brotherhood&quot;.
<br>It will be epic!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1652005">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately tough, the battles are very easy and you seem to be able to defeat houndreds of enemies without much trouble if you played AC2. Another bad point is in the Multiplayer mode. Although the idea was great and the execution fine, you will find it very hard to play with your friends online.</span>

If you are new to AC games then you will enjoy this game alot. If your a Hardcore fan, you will enjoy this game alot. If you played the others and thought that they were Ok but not amazing then dont buy this game.

The franchise in general falls short in terms of controls - they are often less than fluid and you will find yourself cursing when Ezio does the opposite of what you wanted him to do. However, everything else is spot on, and exceeded my expectations. The city in which you are thrown, 1500 A.D. Rome, is remarkably large and faithful to history, containing recreations of many famous buildings. There is ton to do in the game, including new features such as calling upon assassins which level up and can be sent on missions for money and experience. You can buy buildings as well to extend your control and guarantee yourself a higher income. With great graphical style, the setting is perfect. The story is also fairly good despite the fact that it pulls a Lost on you at the end, leaving you in confusion and anticipation of a sequel to further explain things. The gameplay is as fun as ever, jumping around rooftops and finding ways to climb and explore the environment, in prince of persia style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=2854212">Expand</a></span>

Still, Brotherhood is not better than It&apos;s predecessor, for It&apos;s disappointing ending and from some glitches. Despite from those problems, Brotherhood is a must have game for everyone. 88 out of 100.</span>

AC:Brotherhood took me less time to finish the story than in AC2. New moves &amp; actions are now available but some new things made me bored like renovating places in Rome, finishing shop quests that will really take heavy loads of time and looting treasures for shop quests (items that are very rare). THE COOL PART is you can raise a brotherhood of assassins and send them to missions, give them contracts, and even call for their help when assassinating. In the Uplay website, there is a thing called &quot;actions &amp; rewards&quot; and by doing these actions in the game, you will earn credits and you&apos;ll be able to unlock rewards such as the character for multi-player, single-player costumes, etc. The environment looks very nice, and it&apos;s somehow near to realistic.The ending will surely tell you whether there will be a next series of AC or not, so buy it now! it&apos;s really worth it. In addition, there is a multi-player wherein you&apos;ll be needing an internet connection. the concept is about, assassinating each other, testing your assassin skills, blending with other people to cover your identity, etc. You&apos;ll be earning experience and level up, unlock new skills and new costume colors. the bad part is... it will take you about 10 minutes just to complete the player slots and start the game but sometimes it&apos;s really fast. Assassin&apos;s Creed Brotherhood is my #1 game :-bd</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1564424">Expand</a></span>

Not only are controls firmer and much easier to understand, but they are also unique and easy to navigate. Unlike the previous ports, there are no random graphical and gameplay bugs and if there were, then I haven&apos;t managed to spot them. The Graphics have been superbly optimized, much better than Assassin&apos;s Creed 2 on the PC. Despite their good intentions of deterring pirates, Ubisoft did away with their DRM settings and offered a much easier to use offline mode. Nevertheless, despite initial issues with the game launcher and connection, a quick look at the Ubisoft help page for the game quickly cleared away all my issues. And despite being 3 months late, ACB comes jam packed with all the DLC thus far as well as all the bonus characters and maps, courtesy of the Deluxe edition. Most other elements of the game are running quite like its counterparts of the consoles. While my only complaint thus far is with some further multiplayer connection issues, ACB on the PC is a stunning port, one that often isn&apos;t seen these days and any issues I may have with the game I trust Ubisoft will do a great job to fix them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1555032">Expand</a></span>

I believe that the actual story needs the carry on a bit more, although a brilliant game overall. Its a real improvement on Assassins Creed 2 and the multiplayer is fantastic.

Phenom II x4 965 BE 3.4ghz, 8gb ddr3 1600 RAM, HD5770x2 crossfire, Win7 Ultimate 64bit. So basically what happens in this game is that the frame rate drops to 29-30fps and it doesn&apos;t matter whether it&apos;s maxed out or in the absolute lowest settings possible, or in between, or whatever, it&apos;s all the same. So what can possibly be wrong with this? as you see by the specs of my PC above, this should not be happening. In other words this is a poorly optimized console port, and it is going to lag terribly on anything below what I just mentioned above (that would suck to have to buy 8gb RAM just to play this game, yikes!). That is why I warn you now, there are no patches or future updates that will fix this issue, EVER. Good luck trying to play it well, if you want to play it with different hardware and you think my hardware is the issue, than you can probably try intel processors and nvidia cards, but as I have heard, the same exact thing happens with those and it doesn&apos;t matter anyway. As for myself, I&apos;ll just max it out because it&apos;s all the same. As for the game itself, its a fun game (for me), but like I said, it may be different for weaker hardware with all the lag, and poor optimization. And if you don&apos;t have at least quad core in the 3.0-3.4ghz range or 8gb ram, or an HD5770 Crossfire (the equivalent of a single hd5870, yikes! those are expensive too) than I suggest you skip this game, because according to my observations, that&apos;s the kind of hardware you require to play it at the minimal 30fps...OUCH!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1570967">Expand</a></span>

Firstly, the story was great and it should have lasted longer, but at least there were enough side missions to keep me occupied for a long time. Secondly, I loved the futuristic vibe the game gave me - even though I spent 85% of it roaming about Rome as Ezio, the atmosphere was so &apos;high-tech&apos; that I could, ahem... feel Desmond and the others all the time. And finally, that plot twist at the very end? Now I can&apos;t wait for the next AC! So, great job, Ubisoft. Well, maybe I should mention that I only recently got into playing games, so I&apos;m not too demanding a gamer, but nonetheless, a 10 for AC:B.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1625236">Expand</a></span>

Something I noticed is that it goes back to the colorfulness of the first title of the saga, since AC2 had darker and greyer colors and made it a little more depressing for my personal taste.<br>The single player campaign is short (i was wondering if i was even half way through when i got to the end) and if im not wrong there are 9 memory sequences. The campaign also lacks of a consistent story, although i really enjoyed it. I didnt find any bugs i can remember.<br>The multiplayer is fun and very exciting, although it could get a little repetitive if you overplay it. However there are different types of MP games such as Wanted, Escort, Chests and Alliance that will mix it up a little.<br><br>If you are looking just for the single player, i would not pay the full price right now, but if you also want to play some fun online games it might be worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1557165">Expand</a></span>

All your favorite characters are here, some a little more....alive...than others. One thing I like about this game is that Desmond spends a little more time outside the animus, this gives the story a little more diversity; my one major AC 2 complaint was that Desmond&apos;s story wasn&apos;t as prominent, because I really wanted to hear more about that. The best new feature  I loved about AC:B was multiplayer. It&apos;s really intense and a great sigh of relief for FPS multiplayer games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1565051">Expand</a></span>

In broterhood  is all good of AC 1 and AC 2 and something else . Cristic&apos;s say&apos;s &quot;story suck&apos;s &quot; but i like him . He was full of twists and atmosphere was exciting.

If they would&apos;ve released this at the same time as the consoles, everyone here would be doing nothing but yelling &apos;port!&apos; and giving it negative reviews. I&apos;m very, VERY glad Ubisoft took their time and delivered us this game in this state. There&apos;s barely any bugs, and if there are any, they can be overlooked. They are not gamebreaking. The graphics are stunning as usual, and I have yet to detect a single drop in FPS. Do note I am playing this game on a PC that is by today&apos;s standards considered &apos;pretty old&apos;, yet I am playing this game on max (except for AA settings).<br>And also, the aggressive DRM has been removed. I consider it a duty for all PC gamers (especially the ones that are complaining about excessive porting) to go out and buy this game. Reward Ubisoft for their hard work to make this PC version not just good, but the best release! Next to that the game in itself is fantastic as well and worth buying even if it was a crappy port.<br>One thing though: I would have given this game a 10, but I detracted one point because I smashed my mouse during one of the jumping puzzles. Automatically adjusting cameras at diagonal angles and keyboard jumping do NOT go well together. That&apos;s my only point of real criticism; that I have to go out and buy a new mouse. The scroll wheel&apos;s busted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1551850">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is improved and have new counter attacks and they or awesome. The only differences, but stupid are little things that you did in Assassin&apos;s Creed II, that you do not do in this.</span>

I liked having sidekicks of my own and let them do the dirty work while I silently kill my opponent. You could say they&apos;re the improvements of the thieves and prostitutes of AC2. Other than the campaign, the multiplayer was also a tense-full, action packed one. You don&apos;t know what might hit you, so focusing on the game is also a key component for the assassination multiplayer. Overall a engaging game I liked, and I will definitely recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1849496">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are great, soundwork and voiceovers are as good as always for the series, the fighting has been improved and you can really use heavy weapons now, etc. I would love it except for one thing that ruins everything: the controls. Granted, this problem has been there in all AC-games, but with all the new moves and abilities in Brotherhood, as well as the stricter requirements on most missions, it is many times more glaring than it was before. Most of the time Ezio does the exact oppsite of what you feel you are telling him to, and with the mouse and keyboard, which I prefer, there is a huge problem with the camera being locked when you are jumping, preventing you from getting the direction right for the next jump, as well as idiotic button configuration. Who decided to make the buttons for grabbing and letting go of walls the same? And who thought it was a good idea to press E to activate tunnels for purchase, but Shift to activate them for use?<br><br>I&apos;m not exaggerating if I tell you that 9 out of 10 times I get hit or fail a mission, it&apos;s because of some bug or control issue. Let me give you an example:<br><br>I&apos;m playing a mission where I have to kill a group of guards without being noticed. I decide to climb onto a pillar and drop down on them, killing them with the dual hidden blade. For some reason Ezio decides to only hit one of them, because of a tiny fault in my aiming, which is impossible to see, and the other guy immediately sees me. Mission failed, start over.<br>This time I try to shoot a lone guard. For some reason the camera suddenly changes to view behind Ezio, the shot fires in the wrong direction even though the guard was highlighted, and the noise alerts him. Mission failed, start over.<br>This time I try to walk up behind two guards and stab them. Again Ezio decides to kill only one, despite being exactly in the middle of them, and again I am spotted. Mission failed, start over.<br>This time I try to shoot a guard with the crossbow, then duck behind a wall for cover. The other guards only start turning around once I&apos;m safely behind the wall, yet they see me straight through it anyway. Mission failed, start over.<br><br>And this happens over and over and over again in every single mission. This game COULD have been great. Instead it&apos;s an exercise in angry hair removal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1694395">Expand</a></span>

Doesn&apos;t advance the series in much other than storyline, so if you&apos;re a fan of the previous games it&apos;s worth playing.

<br>The titular Brotherhood is disappointingly enough a negligible asset, they feel more like an additional weapon,rather then a real team, and their biggest use is to cheat you out of an challenge. In the open city of Rome,there are many Storyline missions and once you get far enough in the main storyline, you get a few choices of side quests to do that mix up the experience a bit,like missions with free running or missions that require stealth and reward you with something very awesome..
<br>and this is just the Singleplayer ! Brotherhood also features a Online Multiplayer Function! so all-in-all,AC:Brotherhood is a fun experience you&apos;ll be busy with for quite a while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1608530">Expand</a></span>

Only 9 sequences in total. I know from reading elsewhere there is alot that goes on between the last two sequences that was left out. :( Gameplay was good, but in order to get 100 synch you had to complete objectives with specific circumstances, which ultimately took a bit away from the game. Music composition was good as always. Kudos to Jesper Kyd. Side missions were very very repetitive (Towers). A bit sad that this maybe the last we play as Ezio as the main character and to leave it on such a note is... dissapointing. Hopefully AC3 we can play as him more. Who the hell does he conceive a child with? I mean he&apos;s pretty old according to the timeline at the end of ACB!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1550428">Expand</a></span>

The AC creed series began at the eve of the new generation of consoles and stunned audiences with its unique platforming and free roaming nature. However, the final game although still fantastic, fell short of the high expectations due to repetitiveness, limited combat techniques and dumb AI. The sequel AC2 made a tremendous &quot;leap of faith&quot; and reached all expectations with a fantastic scope that redefined the AC series among the greats such as Grand theft auto, Halo and Call of duty. Ezio is a rich character with resolve and motives to energize the player to follow his journey. Everything from the first game had seen an overhaul: Cities were bigger and varied with a lot more lively environment; Combat was gritty and fun; Free-running was sped up and amazing for exploration. Overall, the story matched these improvements and the game ended with a fantastic conclusion leaving the player wanting for more.<br><br>As audiences looked forward to a full blown sequel, Ubisoft montreal annouched AC: Brotherhood that picks up right after AC2 in Ezio&apos;s shoes. Players were worried about it being AC2.5. But those fears can be put to rest as AC: Brotherhood is a full blown sequel with various improvements over its predecessor with every bit of care and love by the Ubisoft team that propelled the previous game to fame.<br><br>Combat is now faster with a Batman-AA -esqe combo system allowing you to lay waste tens of enemies at once. The economic system has been improved increasing the value of money in game. Missions have a lot more variety and progression through the game is tweaked for the better.<br><br>Overall, the refinements further bring AC towards being a historic and story-driven cinematic GTA.<br><br>I look forward to further instalments in the series and wait eagerly for them to release on the PC.<br><br>Varun</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1601312">Expand</a></span>

With help from your order missions are too easy. Don&apos;t think i&apos;ve died more then 2-3 times for entire game. Other then that perfect game :)</span>

Smooth and detailed textures, as well as longer draw distances don&apos;t seem to make up for the fact that there is a substantial amount of z-fighting on higher-end cards (that is where textures flicker as they compete to occupy the same display plane).  At times this is just a mild annoyance but at others it distracts from the scene immensley, and on a number of occasions I found myself having missed key dialog because I was so bothered by it.  Furthermore, Ezio and NPCs seem to pass right through each other during animations.  I&apos;ve watched as Assassin Guild members leap easily through their opponents as if they were ghosts, landing far behind them as the vanquished enemy slowly falls to the ground.  In short, it looks absolutely terrible and makes you wince when you see it -- and it happens almost every time.  This is shoddy programming at best, pure indifference and apathy at worst. In sum, I&apos;d recommend that those who own the console version stick to that.  The PC version is too marred with bugs to be worth the money and I doubt Ubisoft will bother to fix any of this with a patch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1563596">Expand</a></span>

In comparison: It took me 5 days to complete AC2 and 2 days to complete AC Brotherhood.<br>The story needs to improve because it just did not get me. Nevertheless great gameplay, but nothing new.</span>

Too many good reviews at magazines, websites. Where is demanding of great gameplay from all people. Why u counting game very high if it so weak and short? I think that people have too many games to play these days, which means that not so long gameplay = more time for other titles = good for them. But not for me, not for person who still is in total love to AC2 game. I am very disapointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1657258">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t know about you kids but I want to think while I play I don&apos;t just want instant gratification when I press a button and this is what this game promotes. The level design could also use some work you should think about your method of approach so there should be minimal scaffolding and all that or at least they should be disguised. 2. The story was interesting in AC1 now the series has made it generic by putting a saving the world plot with a bit of wtfery added in. All in all AC series is a casual game for casual gamers and well I&apos;d recommend it for anyone who doesn&apos;t want to use their cerebellum when they&apos;re playing their video games but I&apos;d rather not encourage that so I&apos;m giving this a low rating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1659564">Expand</a></span>

I hated this game though. When I use the word &quot;hated&quot;, I mean it. The story in this game has &quot;filler&quot; written all over it, except for the ending of course. I didn&apos;t, for one second, take any interest in the story development of this one at all.
<br>
<br>The graphics and such were fine, although I personally think AC2 had a much better environment than this one did. Rome is basically a giant rundown ruined city with some farmland on the outskirts. I like the ability to dye my character&apos;s cloak, but no matter how I dye it he always sticks out. In AC1 his cloak was designed to mimic priest cloaks so he could get around in a crowd. Why is he still wearing bright white cloaks and crazy capes with a pointed hood? Is it really just to look cool? I stick out like a soar thumb when I&apos;m walking around, how am I supposed to be stealthy?
<br>
<br>The gameplay is where the downfall is. I don&apos;t remember any of the issues I had with AC:B being present in AC2. The first problem I have is simply running around. You hold RT+A (yeah I used a controller because keyboard support is dreadful) to run, but that is also the button combo to run up the side of a ledge or leap off a building. So while you&apos;re running, if you happen to pass by a column or building, your character will run up the side of that building and kill your momentum. Then you have to jump off of the building back down to the street and resume running. This can be an extremely annoying process if you&apos;re being chased. Another issue with running is if you&apos;re unlucky enough to run into a group of guards, which you WILL be doing if you go after Borgia captains, your character enters a &quot;combat mode&quot; where he pulls out his weapon and dances around like the guy from Last of the Mahicans. This also stops your momentum, but in a more annoying way. See it takes a lot of button mashing and re-positioning just to get the game to go &quot;Oh he wants to run instead of fight!&quot;. So that Borgia captain you were chasing? Yeah, he&apos;s gone.
<br>
<br>That leads me to another thing: Why can most Borgia captains run like 10 feet before the game decides they&apos;ve &quot;escaped&quot;? He&apos;s right in front of me yet apparently he &quot;got away&quot;? That&apos;s extremely frustrating and cheap. I guess the developers decided that, in order to make some Borgia captains more difficult, they should put them directly next to their escape zone so that if you approach him he needs to only dash a yard or two before the god damn Star Trek Enterprise beams him up. Anyway, I&apos;m going to play Revelations now and hope that this abomination fades from memory. If Revelations is any better then I just might move onto Assassin&apos;s Creed 3, but my god Brotherhood was just terrible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=2782602">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>And yet. And yet there&apos;s something missing.
<br>
<br>This game suffers from a few issues. While they don&apos;t break the experience, they do lessen it.
<br>
<br>1) The characters suck. You feel very little to no connection to the characters in the game. You just don&apos;t really care about them. Yes, they were in ACII, but there&apos;s just... nothing really there that grips you.
<br>
<br>2) The main story campaign is quite short. Like, shockingly so. The sidequests are good and add to the length of the game...
<br>
<br>3) But the collectables still suck. There are ten feathers, 101 borgia flags, a gross number of treasure chests.. and quite frankly its all pointless. Well, the treasure chests aren&apos;t completely useless, though many of them are, but the rest of them are there for the sake of being there, and just don&apos;t add anything to the game. Running around collecting them is dull, and while platforming is fun, the problem is that most of them are not actually difficult to get to in the first place  they&apos;re just difficult to find without the treasure maps. And some of them are all about running for a minute in a direction, then running in a minute in the OTHER direction, which just sucks.
<br>
<br>4) The whole &quot;city management&quot; and &quot;assassin management&quot; thing is pointless. Not only do you end up with gargantuan piles of money, but running around restoring the stores is a time waster, as is sending your assassin recruits on missions. They&apos;re very empty experiences.
<br>
<br>5) Combat. The combat in this game is just terrible. There&apos;s very little variety in enemies, but it doesn&apos;t matter because you can kill almost all enemies by calling in your assassin recruits  the only time you CAN&apos;T is when you arbitrarily are denied them. Worse still, you are ridiculously powerful  your ranged attacks one shot them, your surprise attacks one shot them, your smoke bombs let you murder crowds out of hand... the combat in this game is really trivial and mostly a waste of time, because it isn&apos;t actually fun. Assassinating people is the funnest part, and most of that is about stealth, which is fun, and the stealth kills, which can be alright but often become stupid because you can just use a crossbow or throwing knife or poison to off them from a distance.
<br>
<br>6) The ending is bad. After about halfway through act 8, the game becomes pretty much entirely about combat. For three levels, you gain a totally overpowered item which just says &quot;Press X to win&quot; and essentially cannot die (but likewise cannot use anything BUT said item), and then the final level is all combat without the fun of assassination or stealth. As combat is the worst part of the game, understandably this leaves a sour taste in the player&apos;s mouth.
<br>
<br>7) The game tries too hard to be enigmatic. I understand that they&apos;re trying to seem mysterious, but they mostly succeed in just making everything feel like a let down.
<br>
<br>8) The story in renaissance Italy is just boring. I don&apos;t care about the characters and it feels like a disconnected strung-together chain of events.
<br>
<br>9) Sometimes, the platforming feels a little too choreographed, which becomes especially obvious at certain points in the game, where it feels like I&apos;m just being lead by the nose by level design without any real interesting input on my part.
<br>
<br>All in all, the game is decent, but not amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=3022071">Expand</a></span>

They introduced shop quests where you hunt for hard to find items in exchange for better equipment. Problem is that once you got the items you need for that kick ass bastard sword you were far up enough in the game to buy much better one from the shop.
<br>Few welcome breaths of fresh air was the fact that you actually were in command of an assassin&apos;s guild and you could  call your minions to help you by snapping your fingers. You best not help them fighting though, because if that friend of yours happens to jump in front of your bullet, they die. The developers tried to make you have some kind of affection to the recruits by giving them names and different faces. You also had to watch through their recruitment ceremony (unskippable of course). After having watched 3 of these recruitment ceremonies you went to grab a drink while the same cut scene is being shown.
<br>Single player was okay, but wasn&apos;t as good as Assassin&apos;s creed 2&apos;s long campaign that spanned through many cities. What issues I have with it is mostly nitpicking, but what I really bought the game for was the multip layer, however the matchmaking in PC is just awful.
<br>
<br>Usually you spend more time finding people to play with than to play the game. You cannot grab a server and join in. You have to be inserted in a group and server by the computer. During the progress computer voice keeps telling over and over again you how it&apos;s searching for more players. Can I have my server browser now computer, now that you find how this console port automated match making doesn&apos;t work?
<br>Slowly by raising the search area from your street to your home town you might find 8 players to play with. Then wait for a server to open beings... Once you get a server two people have ragequitted from the lobby.
<br>
<br>If you are lucky you get to play the real game for few minutes and your quarry is jumping on a roof somewhere instead of blending into the groups and trying to act natural. It gets better once you get the hidden gun and throwing knives... When the groups are good the game is playable, but do not bother with the less popular game modes, there are never enough people to play with, unless you have half an hour to waste to actually play the game for 10 minutes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1614362">Expand</a></span>

In all honesty I felt a little let down by &apos;Brotherhood&apos; as I built up this crazy idea that the multiplayer would be something incredible, which it wasn&apos;t. Instead it ended up being very repetitive after a couple matches and was rather easy as well, as maps are quite small, giving your enemy nowhere to hide. On the other hand, the single player doesn&apos;t fail to impress, once again another fantastic storyline from Ubisoft and following the small taste of the modern age at the end of the last Assassin&apos;s Creed, we get to play more as Desmond and use the skills he&apos;s learnt by watching his ancestor Ezio. The one downfall to &apos;Brotherhood&apos; is that the free running over vast scenery had to live up to the last sequels beautiful Venice, but fails to do so. &apos;Brotherhood&apos;s&apos; map soon becomes boring and you will find yourself putting the game down before you complete it, unlike the other two. With all this being said I am rating Assassin&apos;s Creed Brotherhood with a 7 because it is a decent enough game to buy and play, but just make sure you don&apos;t pay full price for it as you may be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1619703">Expand</a></span>

I found it absolutely wonderful. The horrible combat system had been modified (I loved the hell out of the unending kill animations) to make it 10 times better. The melee system was worth something now (sorry, but the final fight in AC2 wasn&apos;t worth much, hardly an epic final fight), and they threw a whole lot of new weapons into the game that made it quite a decent change from AC2. The Assassin recruits were a very nice addition, though at times it didn&apos;t feel much worth it. That being said, there are a few other things about this I didn&apos;t like.<br><br>Obviously the amount of time it takes to beat the main storyline isn&apos;t all too great when compared to AC2. The side quests did feel a bit repetitive at times, but it could have been easily overlooked. The assassin recruits got a bit annoying at times, and a lot of the time you would hardly use them. Of course, I did like some things about the game aside from what&apos;s already been said.<br><br>The customization options were nice, freerunning was slightly tweaked for the better, being able to carry around heavy weapons was fun for a while, the kill animations felt more satisfying, and killing a whole bunch of guards was no longer a chore. Hell, it felt like Ezio could slay an army at times in the game.<br><br>The only major complaint I have about this game is the machines Ezio has access to at times. For example, the bomber sequence was quite honestly annoying, and I found myself playing it multiple times just to beat it. I question the wisdom of whoever put Leonardo&apos;s Machine Gun into the game, because it honestly felt too much like a FPS, and the cannons were essentially useless. I could have liked this things, but they are (for the most part) only used in one or two sequences! Great, I had to learn the controls to flying the bomber, but I&apos;ll never use it again? Ugh.<br><br>All in all, I do like this game. It&apos;s worth the buy, but definitely get it for a console, unless you&apos;re willing to put up with a few bugs. For me, this kinda feels like the comparison of Fallout 3 to New Vegas when comparing it to AC2. New Vegas tweaked a few things missing or damaged from the first game, but it left some things behind, and forgot to fix some of the bugs in the meantime. The same goes for this game. It fixed the bad melee system of AC2, modified the combat system to make it less tedious, and let you use heavy weapons or long weapons for more than one fight or two. It&apos;s good enough to play, just try to ignore the one or two faults and you&apos;ll love this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1649083">Expand</a></span>

First of all, I&apos;d just like to say that I bought the game for the multiplayer aspect, didn&apos;t get any further than 40 minutes into the singleplayer and havn&apos;t continued from there yet. The multiplayer was alot of fun at the beginning, but it quickly became obvious that most people run around on the roofs, making it almost impossible for yourself to take them out unless you venture up there yourself. But any half decent player will see you miles away and understand why you&apos;re there and keep a distance. There is a gun that you can use against them aswell, but it doesn&apos;t net you alot of points. So if you, just like me, would enjoy hiding in crowds and stalking you&apos;re victim, you can forget it. Another thing which really bugged me was the poison ability, a game with Assassin&apos;s must of course have poison in it, but the points which you gain for simply walking past someone and sticking them is ridicolus sometimes. Using abilities also sometimes didn&apos;t seem to have an effect, as throwing  a smokebomb down on the ground when you know someone close to you is about to shiv you, but then just to get a cutscene to see that person jump through it, land on you in the middle of the smoke and then kill you. But, in the end, I had a good enough time with this game&apos;s multiplayer mode for the money I spent to buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1734855">Expand</a></span>

There was only one thing to do: click repeatedly.  It was really slow, so I called in some assassins, but as more guys came, several of them died.  I was helpless because I couldn&apos;t switch weapons and the gameplay was simply terrible during those sections.  Recently I found huge errors where the screen would go to this ugly shade of brown and I was blind.  If I was fighting at the time, it didn&apos;t turn out so well.  You could move around and *maybe* your vision would go back to normal, but it was pretty much a crap shoot.  This happened consistently in several sections of the map.  Also, the ending made me angry.  I&apos;m sure that there will be explanations in Revelations, but as it is, I&apos;m left with a main character who is dead and now Desmond is a murderer.  Now don&apos;t take this review completely the wrong way, AC:B offers a unique gaming experience unrivaled by many other similar games.  The issues that I&apos;ve mentioned and the fact that it is so similar to AC2 are what made me give it a 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=1834173">Expand</a></span>

If you chose wrong on pure luck, desynch, try again, try another way. No thinking, no planning, just run and do trial and error.
<br>
<br>Regular and egregeously stupid camera lock to some effed up perspective you cannot see anything you&apos;d like to see.
<br>
<br>The freerun &quot;railing&quot; usually get&apos;s more in the way than helping, which is emphasized by willy-nilly placed &quot;railing&quot;-structures like walls that break and stop any attempt at freerunning that was not explicitly build as a course.
<br>
<br>Regular occurances of interface failure, where among the three dozen context-selected actions on one button the only sensible and rather required one is not available and your char does something completely stupid instead. (Enemy? Wait, you could... knit, cook, puzzle, hug, read the newspaper, go to the toilet or pull faces. Attack? No. Assasinate? No. Run? What are you, a coward?)
<br>
<br>Open world? Yes, in theory. In practice, most interesting things are only available once you got all regions unlocked and are about done with the game. What you might want with any special equipment once you have no occasion to use it anymore is anyones guess.
<br>
<br>Achievements? Well, yes, but it&apos;s anyones guess what some of them are meant to be. &quot;Kill guards while mounted.&quot; well... it does not count the amount of guards you kill while mounted yourself. And ist does not count guards killed while they are mounted, at least not assassinated ones. And a hit in combat usually dismounts guards instead of killingt them while mounted. Hmm... I have some that triggered, but not the foggiest idea which, how and why.
<br>
<br>Full synchro? Yes, please try. Some of the requirements are stupendously easy, many others are terribly frustratingly difficult. Combined with the above mentioned mission pacing as purely lucky choice parcours, no &quot;redo from checkpoint&quot; option and the frequent control glitches... eff that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=6006147">Expand</a></span>

It continues the story, setting, and characters of the previous game, while introducing a few new mechanics. Unlike the first 2 games, in this one you spend most of your time in a single city, Rome, which is considerably larger than previous cities to compensate for this. While this isn&apos;t a huge problem, it does end up feeling like &apos;more of the same,&apos; and after awhile running around the same location gets a bit boring. Brotherhood introduces a few new weapons and skills, but nothing special. The shop investment mechanic has been expanded to allow you to buy and invest in various shop types around Rome. This is an interesting diversion, but adds little to the game. The real virtue of this game is simple in continuing the story and further developing the characters. It is certainly worth playing, and is plenty fun, but lacks significant originality: it just feels like AC II part 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=2901239">Expand</a></span>

The good is the city and the way the game hero  moves around it. Climbing and jumping is fun and the views from the rooftops are amazing. This game shows the fruits of awesome historical research. Sadly every other feature of the game get worse from there and the final product is tragically mediocre considering the amount of time and effort that went into it.  The combat is mediocre, and confusing. The controls are BAD. The medieval elements of story are great but TOTALLY RUINED by an idiotic and unneccessary added level of madness in the form of a time travel story, which seemingly functions to destroy a made-for-adults plot and reduce the whole thing to a product for seven year olds.  A special observation needs to be reserved for the horrible playstation 2 UI which tries hard to be &apos;cool and &apos;modern&apos; but turns out to be unwieldy ugly and UNCOOL in the extreme. ACB is finally a mediocre game. It can be picked up for around $5 on Steam sale and isn&apos;t worth much more than that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=3042157">Expand</a></span>

The story is good and works as a solid extension on the second game, though the excuse for making Ezio earn weapons and armour from the beginning feels a bit forced and cheap. The integration of familiar characters is spectacular and had me emotionally engaged throughout both in Ezio&apos;s AND Desmond&apos;s stories. The big drawbacks for me are the cut and paste, but less successful, equivalents of assassin&apos;s tombs (they&apos;re fine, but less exciting and make less sense the second time around), and the way in which you&apos;re rushed through the end section of the game. Glyph puzzles are present, and though the intros from Subject 16 are sorely missed, they&apos;re still as creepy, cryptic and strangely informative as ever. While it doesn&apos;t match up to the quality of Assassin&apos;s Creed 2 in my mind, it&apos;s still a game more than worth buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=2694473">Expand</a></span>

The story is mediocre, it isn&apos;t very engaging and unlike most other sequel games, the game doesn&apos;t really do anything to catch you up on what happened in the last game, the game that this one follows directly. You get a few minutes of cutscene at the beginning and that is it, it leaves you with no idea what&apos;s happening in the real world or in the dream world.
<br>
<br>Luckily, the writing in the game is so mediocre you can see straight though the plot, There is no depth to it, everything I thought was going to happen has happened, there has been no surprises yet, the story is just bland, uninteresting and unengaging.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is bad, just... bad. Controls are an outright mess, they are entirely unintuitive and seem to switch function and overlap function on a whim, for instance, when you go up to something, the interact button seems to switch between &quot;E&quot; and &quot;Shift&quot; seemingly at random, and sometimes interact is &quot;Press any button&quot;
<br>The combat is imprecise, boring and at times unresponsive. Yet is still so mind-numbingly easy it is very hard to fail.
<br>
<br>I purchased this game after playing Black flag in order to maybe get some sort of context for the alternate storyline, but it makes as little sense in this one as it does in black flag, it is such a drag every time the game pulls you out of the game and forces you to play through a &quot;real world&quot; mission with Desmund, the characters are boring and the story is badly written and is extremely predictable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=4314560">Expand</a></span>

This confuses me, since I found it to be worse than all of its predecessors. The introduction of assisting assassin recruits is a very positive change, but, in every other aspect, AC:B is slipping away.
<br>
<br>Fighting, more than ever, is now all about button mashing. The original title had some interesting combo dynamics, which I didn&apos;t even get to check whether they were still there. There was no place for them. Luckily, you can call for help and end the battles quicker.
<br>
<br>The controls in AC games have always had a bad rep. For some reason, in AC:B their suckiness is more in your face than ever before. Probably because AC:B is so poor in things to help you feel better about it. Few things can bring you faster to rage than Ezio spontaneously changing direction and jumping sideways towards a wall, causing you to fail your time-sensitive goal.
<br>
<br>The writing is the thinnest it has every been. Master-blahblah is building up, kill his characterless helpers, then kill him. Seriously, was there a single character in this game, besides Ezio himself? And don&apos;t get me started about how they&apos;ve jumped the shark with the alien AI whatever-it-is thing.
<br>
<br>And the title&apos;s trademark, freerunning, became less free and more of a mechanic to solve puzzles, Tomb Raider style. Running on rooftops makes no practical sense anymore. Speaking of which, I always liked the environment&apos;s realistic and lived feel. Well, not anymore. Unless someone can explain why medieval architects would place uniform door switches high on walls and odd beams to help people with superhuman climbing skills get there.
<br>
<br>Tying the whole degression together is the city of Rome, the worst depiction of a city in any AC game. Rome is repetitive, hard to navigate (especially from the rooftops) and visually depressing.
<br>
<br>AC has a lot to capital to burn before becoming a bad game. But it didn&apos;t make to good this time either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=4395940">Expand</a></span>

This doesn&apos;t mean the graphics are any less good, but it does make any aspect of the game feel real. Nothing is real, everything is premitted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=2566888">Expand</a></span>

The way I see it Brotherhood is supposed to have 5 strong parts of the game: 1. Fighting system 2. Acrobatics 3. Story 4. Sims-part 5.Stealth. Well in my opinion they are all broken and disconnected in this game. Fighting is stupid. Where in a decent game you have to carefully think what attack type to apply to every enemy and in what order, here it is enough that you stand in block and counter-kill any opponent and kick in balls every 5-th opponent. That is all. Of course you can diversify it if you want. Use bullets, arrows, smoke etc. But there&apos;s no need. There is always maximum of 2 enemies attacking you simultaneously. You can easily kill a crown of hundreds soldiers given the time of 10 minutes. Which leads to a sad conclusion that you do not actually need new equipment, I didn&apos;t even buy a crossbow for 8th chapter(and I bought it because I wanted to see how it works). You can complete the whole game without new armor, gloves, daggers, swords. And you won&apos;t feel any difficulty without them. So you do not need to invest money into stables, tailors, workshops, because you don&apos;t need equipment, you do not need invest in anything, because you do not need money. Assassins&apos; help is also a tool of differentiating of a game process if you wish. A huge part of a game can be easily cut out without anyone noticing. In the Witcher 2 when I play on high difficulty, I use sharpening stones, craft new equipment, collect herbs, make potions, bombs, oils to survive. I use boosts, magic anything to survive. I feel acomplishment when I get through the area filled with enemies, boss battle etc. Here I never feel difficult. During the game I never died for Christ Sake! The acrobatics alwasy rotate me during the jump. Often you hang down from the balcony even when you clearly push jumping combination. In a whole lot of missions you need precision to meet 100-sync requirements. But the game does not grant it to you. Most of side missions are dull. Yes, I can differentiate them, but I want to be engaged, I don&apos;t want to track and kill a person in every mission. I want to see the story. What kind of a story can be told in few phrases? When it comes down to the main plot it is also a garbage bin. You are never told of the functioning mechanism of eagle vision. You still do not know anything about the main powers taking part in the story, but you are induced to follow their actions and foggy explanations. It all looks like a bad amateurish science fiction. You know what, I&apos;d prefer straight and simple &quot;Dishonored&quot; story to this one. It is the same thing as &quot;LOST&quot; movie series. You try to prolong the story and don&apos;t explain anything up until the end simply because you don&apos;t know how to explain what you have already implemented in the story. You have nothing to say. I never understood what was the point of creating big games combining gameplay from multiple genres, if any part of it is made worse than in the game you took it from. It is like Renaissance Call of Duty: don&apos;t ask, just play! Well I do not agree to that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=2785931">Expand</a></span>

Brotherhood is an oversized standalone add-on, but not in any way a direct sequel. It offers NOTHING new in terms of the plot development (except for Desmond&apos;s storyline, which fits in like half an hour) and retains the protagonist from the sequel, Ezio. I must say that I personally don&apos;t find Ezio such a spectacular character as many seem to do - he is a generic good guy who lost his family and wants his revenge, and here he evolves into a generic old wise master giving advice. The gameplay features some additions, like taking back city districts (dull and repetitive), recruiting assassins (simplifies killing enemies even further, but looks nice, I admit) and a slight change in the combat system - now it&apos;s stupefied to a never-before-seen level: to kill the first enemy you must button mash or counter-kill him as usual, but to kill the next one you just need... to press one button. That&apos;s it, the &quot;press x to win&quot; stereotype going live. In terms of graphics, it&apos;s definitely an improvement, as the game&apos;s got the smooth looks matching or besting AC1&apos;s. My score would&apos;ve been lower if not for the addition of the multiplayer mode. It&apos;s fresh, fun and will surely keep you entertained for a few weeks at least. Overall, this is a totally unnecessary addition to the franchise, a worrying move towards the COD&apos;s &quot;a game a year&quot; system, the Assassin&apos;s Greed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=2727682">Expand</a></span>

Almost unplayable with mouse and keyboard, the controls just feel weird if you use them. Better to enjoy it with a console controller. Other than that, it is worth every dollar you pay for it.</span>

Anybody who enjoys AC needs to play this one. What better than an epic history based action-adventure game? :D</span>

The single player focuces less on the actual story, but more about Rome and how Ezio is restorating it, by destroying towers that will decrease the influence of the Borgia on a certain area, so you can spend money to restorate former shops (the old Blacksmith, Tailor, Art Merchant and the bank, which basicly replaces the role of the Chest), basically multiple Monteriggioni&apos;s. Also there are more faction missions, and you can even buy buildings for your factions to house there, you can even buy landmarks(e.g. The Colosseum). All of these options will increase your income. Though I like these aspects, it&apos;s just... too much. Sometimes when you end up in entire new places, and you don&apos;t want to run all the way back to repair/heal, you&apos;ll have to first buy a store and then use it, you will probably not use it that much afterwards. I actually ignored all these factions and tower stuff and ended up in a very, very short single player compared to AC2 (33 hours on AC2, 13 hours on ACBH, 20 hours less). BH also includes a Multiplayer, a MP I haven&apos;t played yet, I just was not interesting in it. I bought AC1 for an interesting looking story and single player, for the same reasons I have bought AC2 and now BH as well, yet, it seems that a part of the Single Player now had to move to the MP, which I don&apos;t like, I don&apos;t think AC needs a MP, I honestly don&apos;t think it&apos;s possible to create a solid MP based on the AC style that can keep you busy for weeks / months.
<br>But I still enjoyed BH a lot, I loved to see Rome and certain story missions that take place in the Colosseum and the Vatican, the story is tensive and solid. I really really recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=2881811">Expand</a></span>

You are now vulnerable to be attacked during execution animation, and able to use heavy weapon are good points. Assassin recruit idea was exciting at first, but quickly become boring and repetitive to assign meaningless skill points. Game combat is already easy enough with counter-attack spamming, assassin recruit just make combat even dull.

But the game is still plagued by annoying camera and controls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-brotherhood/user-reviews?user_review_id=2829230">Expand</a></span>
