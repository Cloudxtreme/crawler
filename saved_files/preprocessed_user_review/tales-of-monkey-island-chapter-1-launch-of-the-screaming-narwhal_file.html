This is to say it &quot;feels&quot; like playing a classic Monkey Island Adventure...however the original complexity and difficulty is not present. The sheer number of scenes or locals with which Guybrush must interact simultaneously to solve the puzzles is simply not present. Another lacking feature that no one has mentioned to my knowledge. Where did the &quot;Pick Up&quot; &quot;Open&quot; &quot;Close&quot; &quot;Talk To&quot; &quot;Look At&quot; &quot;Use&quot; &quot;Push&quot; &quot;Pull&quot; go? These options added a great level of depth to the previous games, if even in the form of red herrings, which is lost here. In essence to make a strange comparison... I feel that if we might call the original Monkey Islands &quot;Pokemon&quot; then this latest is more like &quot;Pokemon Snap!&quot; Understand that I am not comparing Monkey Island to Pokemon in content. I am comparing Pokemon to Pokemon Snap in order to more clearly quantify the differential in the level of &quot;gaming depth&quot; between the classic Monkey Islands and this latest release. Same theme, same attitude, but shallower.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-of-monkey-island-chapter-1-launch-of-the-screaming-narwhal/user-reviews?user_review_id=83935">Expand</a></span>

All that is good about it comes from the ideas/music/story of the 4 previous games (Yes MI4 included,since it&apos;s very good).  The new island&apos;s design and all the supporting characters are so dull,badly designed and unoriginal that it justs destroys it, even if it has some good puzzles , probably the best Telltale has yet to offer.</span>

It&apos;s clever, funny and will entertain you for about 4 hours, which is good for an episode. If you&apos;re not afraid of thinking while playing and want brilliant humor in your game then this is for you.

Luckily, they grow on you within the first 15 seconds of gameplay. The controls are beyond simple, using WASD to walk is easy and thankfully it doesn&apos;t follow the same control scheme as Escape from Monkey Island, it&apos;s not confusing in the slightest. The story so far (being that we&apos;re only given the first taste of 5 chapters) is amazing, there is so much excitement in the plot. The boyish, smart-alec humour of Guybrush is cheekier than ever and you instantly fall in love with him again. Every puzzle is as entertaining as its end result, consequences of doing your piratey deeds always reward the player, and it&apos;s just that much more fun, and somewhat sinister, in Tales of Monkey Island. Although short, Launch of the Screaming Narwhal does its job as an enjoyable start to a Monkey Island game. It&apos;s not up there with Curse of Monkey Island, but it sure comes close. Dare I say, it&apos;s already more enjoyable than the fourth instalment to the series. At the point you finish chapter one, you&apos;re overwhelmed with joy that there are 4 more parts to come! Thank you Lucasarts, for reviving what is possibly the best game series of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-of-monkey-island-chapter-1-launch-of-the-screaming-narwhal/user-reviews?user_review_id=82957">Expand</a></span>

I would have played it on Wii but I don&apos;t wanna pay twice as much for that version. The game itself is a straightforward Adventure game, point and click, collect items, figure out what to use where and how and that&apos;s basically it. You will listen to funny dialogs for clues (even though the Voodoo lady is cringe inducingly terrible). If you&apos;ve played an Adventure game before you know the deal. The graphics are in the typical TellTale style and therefore a mixed bucket. Some of the designs look hauntingly like classical Monkey Island scenes but if you look closely (especially with the characters) you will see bland textures. Overall it&apos;s a nice looking game but nothing really spectacular. The puzzles are very logical and for Adventurists maybe a tad too easy but it took me 4-5 hours none the less. If the final length of all episodes amounts to 20+ hours of gameplay I&apos;d be more than happy with it. The controls are a bold step forward from the point and click interface and to me they are superior to Sam&amp;Max. You just can&apos;t have a proper click only wayfinding in a full 3D environment like that. As the first episode it did a great job of wanting me to play more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-of-monkey-island-chapter-1-launch-of-the-screaming-narwhal/user-reviews?user_review_id=82861">Expand</a></span>

A lot of people complained about the graphical style that TellTale games decided on but I have to say I rather enjoy it, it looks like a massively revamped Escape from Monkey Island graphically but I feel it&apos;s closer to the older games with it&apos;s humour and silliness. I turned the hints off so as to make the game last longer so I&apos;m unsure of how they effect gameplay at all. I feel that if anyone compains about the 3D style and how these new games &quot;butchered&quot; the classic series may have their nostalgia goggles on a little too tightly. I recommend this game if you are a fan of Monkey Island but I can see how it may be a bit confusing for the first timer of the point and click puzzle games, but thankfully the hint system is in place for just this. Overall, classic Monkey Island.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-of-monkey-island-chapter-1-launch-of-the-screaming-narwhal/user-reviews?user_review_id=82872">Expand</a></span>

There are some good puzzle--I only needed help twice. But the game is held back from greatness by a few factors. One being the bugginess. I&apos;ve had multiple crashes at startup, ingame, when exiting, and it even had the audacity to BSOD me at the end of the credits. Secondly, the new control system is difficult to use compared to simply clicking where you want to go; gamepad support is wonky, also. Finally, the voice acting and dialogue is pretty dull at times. Maybe the newer episodes will fare better, though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-of-monkey-island-chapter-1-launch-of-the-screaming-narwhal/user-reviews?user_review_id=739051">Expand</a></span>

Considering you get 5 games for 35$, you&apos;d be ridiculous not to pick these up. The first one lasted about 3 hours, so on average 15 hours of game play for half the price of COD4 Modern Warfare 2, is a certain buy.

                                        <span>I got this game for $5 for all 5 chapters during the Steam summer sale. Well worth that price. Although childish, it is very well made. Good story, great voice acting, charming, witty, creative puzzles. Takes about 4 hours of play time to finish each chapter so roughly 20 hours total.</span>
