<br>
<br>The playable characters each bring something different to the table and the replayability is really high.
<br>The difficulty is really well done, the curb being a little too steep at times, specially at the last boss, but it gives a sense of achievment right ^^</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4383198">Expand</a></span>

Freedom Planet turns out to be latter, thanks to developers paying attention to detail more than i remember seeing in quite long time.
<br>
<br>Story is not exactly Shakespeare, and voice acting isn&apos;t too good, but atmosphere is still both exciting and charming. Partly thanks to visuals that actually looked slightly better in-game than elsewhere. Music and sound effects turn out to be top notch as well.
<br>
<br>The most important thing, however, is gameplay, which is mix of various classics, without ever using retro-style-indie-game cliches, and it works incredibly fine as long you adjust sensitivity settings to fit your taste. But what is game without it&apos;s meat? Level design here is surprisingly varied and detailed, with lot of interactivity put into worlds. Enemies and Bosses are the main challenge, though, but even on their worst they seem decent. Game even occasionally has some clever tricks and strategies to use against them.
<br>
<br>Extra stuff includes collectible cards in levels to unlock stuff in gallery, mahjong and Shang Mu academy, series of mini-challenges so fun that it must be illegal. And the best thing about this already content packed game is... there is still more to come!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4382179">Expand</a></span>

I heard nothing of it prior to launch but I was interested right away. Freedom Planet is a throwback to the old school Sega Genesis days of mascots like Ristar and Sonic The Hedgehog and it pulls it off fantastically while still being able to stand on it&apos;s own. I can safely say this game is every bit as fun as the trailers made it seem (even more)! The levels are really diverse with different pathways, the physics are great, boss battles are creative and fun, the voice acting is really good and the sound track is top notch!
<br>
<br>Besides the story, the game packs a Classic Mode that strips away all the cutscenes and plays all the levels in order, and a Time Trial mode. More features will be added and free so it won&apos;t get dull. It&apos;s a highly replayable game with huge levels and a lot of collectables. It also comes packed with achievements that let you look at the game a bit differently, for example there might be a different way of taking down a boss so experimenting and going through the levels more than once is highly recommended.
<br>
<br>The controls can be configured to your liking so the button layout is never a chore to learn. The characters are easy and fun to control and it&apos;s a blast to play through each level. Everything pops out and is beautifully colorful, the sprites and character designs are amazing to look at, and every level still feels fresh after continuous playthroughs. I honestly can&apos;t think of anything wrong with this game, it&apos;s the perfect example of an Indie game done right! Do yourself a favor and buy this game! If you&apos;re an old school gamer you&apos;ll love it. It&apos;s highly inspired by the old genesis games but there&apos;s so much to love. It has a compelling and interesting story and it should not be missed!
<br>
<br>I give it a 10/10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4382810">Expand</a></span>

The pixel art is gorgeous, the music is catchy, the story is pretty good and, for an indie dev, the voice acting is actually pretty good. It&apos;s like playing a Saturday morning cartoon. And I mean that in a good way!</span>

<br>The story is simple, but it makes up for the amazing game play.</span>

It will be a nostalgia bomb if you owned a Sega Mega Drive.
<br>Freedom Planet takes place in a fantasy world which was invaded by aliens who want steal the Kingdom Stone, a stone that works as a large energy resource.
<br>The main characters are Lilac the dragon, Carol the wildcat and Milla Basset, all the three characters play completely different and have some exclusive levels. The level design is beautiful and  some levels can be very large. The boss fights are intense and amazing. The Music is another of the strong points of this game, until the point the game OST had to be released. This game has pretty challenging difficulties too.
<br>The voice acting can be amateur at times and some minor bugs may appear., but verything else is nicely done, Freedom planet is on the levels of quality of Shovel Knight, if you like retro games, then Freedom Planet is a must play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4404601">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If Sega were to look at this, say &quot;Alright, we&apos;re giving the Sonic Team resources to these guys&quot;, I would be absolutely thrilled.
<br>
<br>Of course, the game takes more than just after Sonic, visually it is about the same level, and slightly surpasses in some points the aesthetics of Sonic 3 And Knuckles (What many would call the Optimal 2D sonic).
<br>Mechanics are heavily influenced from Rocket Knight, with the blue hedgehog&apos;s pacing and speed, and a level design that works I&apos;d heavily argue better than both.
<br>
<br>Like Shovel Knight is for the NES crowd, this game was made in mind not only with the Sonic franchise, but as a love-letter for the best Sega had to offer, and it shows.
<br>
<br>Each stage is huge, more than often transferring between game and visual themes within the same stage in a seamless manner, every level brings with it a new and easy to use feature that enhances gameplay, and doesn&apos;t restrict it.
<br>
<br>Unlike 2D Sonic games, which had the disadvantage of being made in a time that your playthrough required surgical skills and the good side of about twenty hours simply to complete, not to talk about master and re-complete in the case of multiple characters.
<br>- Freedom Planet has the advantage of being able to be fast paced, never drop its speed down, not to compromise with difficulty (When I choose normal, I can feel the heat, not that it&apos;s not made for Casual / Easy / Hard needing folks as well), and overall achieve the feeling we all want from &quot;Just Going Fast&quot;.
<br>
<br>As you might have guessed, I&apos;m an avid fan of Sega games, and Sonic 2D games, and to all those that are with me there, I have to say - Buy this.
<br>All of you that need further persuasion, I&apos;ll have to boil it down to specifics:
<br>I&apos;ve played Sonic 1, 2 3 and Knuckles, I&apos;ve played CD, I&apos;ve played the Advance titles to a point.
<br>This game takes all that worked in those games, and fuses it into a perfect mix of feel and mechanics.
<br>
<br>Storywise, the game doesn&apos;t force it down your throat, you get the &apos;Classic&apos; mode from the start, and you can just enjoy that and that alone.
<br>The tale itself is nothing new, and yet woven with expertise that would touch those who like the genre, and thus that are so tired of cliche&apos;s done wrong that they want the Feels again of these things done right.
<br>
<br>With so many touches made so Right both storywise and gameplay wise (I don&apos;t want to spoil all the little animations and places GalaxyTrail made this game one of my favorite 2D games of all times), this game, obvious to all, was made with love, something that games like it (looking at you Sonic) lacked for a long while.
<br>
<br>If I had to describe the feel of the game, it would be Non-Japanese developers and storywriters heavily influenced by Japanese culture and storywriting and then fusing in the mix of the Archie Sonic Comics and their TV show, if anyone still remembers that (if no, google those two things, it&apos;s a thing now).
<br>The &apos;We&apos;re just kids saving the universe!&apos; and the Dark if Happy undertones the game is pushing underneath both works, and yet doesn&apos;t work quite as well as, for example, Earthbound (and the Mother series in general). Then again, who could compete with Itoi in these feels and things.
<br>
<br>If there is one thing I have to say it shouldn&apos;t have taken from Sonic, is several small non-game breaking bugs.
<br>That, and some of the voice acting-
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, I have less issues with it than most people who played this game, it&apos;s just that when at times the people talking make you laterally cringe, is when you know that you want to patch the game in the future after making them do a few more takes on that certain line.
<br>And some of the voice actors are perfect and sublime for their roles.
<br>
<br>I have to mention it last, because this is summary and what I want to emphasise as well-
<br>It has been a while since music was stuck in my head from a game. This game made it happen.
<br>It has good music, themes, sound effects. It shows that three guys worked on that alone (don&apos;t take me by the word, I&apos;m doing this from memory).
<br>For my last word, this game has love in it, and it&apos;s perfect despise its flaws.

My first playtrogh cloks over 20 minutes for each level, that&apos;s bigger than Sonic ever was. And it has lot&apos;s of exploration, unlockables and style. 2 diferente playable characters, lot&apos;s to do and see. The 16-bit art style is perfect. If this game were on Sega Saturn, it would be a generation classic. Somehow this game doesn&apos;t get the same marketing budget as, say, Shovel Knight, but don&apos;t don&apos;t think twice; get it!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=5524099">Expand</a></span>

This game is a great buy, and shows a very bright and promising future for Galaxytrail. This is a rare gem in the Indie game world that must not be ignored, and is a nod to the great 2D games of the 90&apos;s.
<br>I highly recommend buying this game, most especially If you are into the
<br>Classic 2D Action Platforming Genre.</span>

<br>
<br>The game keeps things moving constantly, through great levels that most of the time end in a climactic boss fight. However, prepare for a lot of retries and game over screens on your first play-through: the bosses are very difficult and will require a lot of pattern recognition. I know that&apos;s what they were going for, but it can still be very frustrating.
<br>
<br>Luckily, the game is very much aware of that. After a game over you restart at the latest checkpoint, making lives kind of unnecessary, and you can change the difficulty halfway through the adventure if things get a bit too frustrating for you (something I did for the final boss because the second to last one dragged me through 7 or so game over screens). That being said, because they are so difficult it&apos;s extra satisfying when you finally do take them down.
<br>
<br>You get to play as 3 different characters, each bringing different abilities to the table. They all have a few character specific levels, but most levels will be played by all three characters. However, since they all have their own ways of travelling through these, things don&apos;t get too repetitive.
<br>
<br>As for the presentation, this is where this game shines. The pixel art for both characters and backgrounds is just stunning, the voice acting is great and the plot is very entertaining. Don&apos;t care for the plot? Just choose classic mode and you will go from stage to stage without ever seeing it. The music is fantastic as well, though I&apos;ve heard the boss themes enough by now due to my many many retries.
<br>
<br>If my rambling hasn&apos;t made it clear yet, I really like this game and I highly recommend giving it a try. The levels are very well made with many different pathways to explore and lots of secrets/collectibles to discover, while still being fast paced and action packed. There&apos;s a lot of original and challenging (mini)bosses, the music and sound design are top notch and the game is very pleasing to look at.
<br>
<br>Freedom Planet is well worth your time if you&apos;re a lover of platformers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=6004013">Expand</a></span>

<br>The gameplay, the controls, the sound track, the story, the characters... I enjoyed it all so much, I just don&apos;t get tired of it.

There are only 3 games that would reach a 10/10 for me, this being one of them. As a sonic fan, and that being one of my first games, I have a fond attachment to the play style. Freedom planet however, years down the road for me managed to do what the modern sonic I loved couldn&apos;t do, and that&apos;s make a decent fast paced platformer. This genre is dying or in the least becoming less popular and not as well made. Overall I felt alive and responsible for my progress while playing as to not just hold down right and watch the level go by. The physics are a tad messy at times but feasible and it makes it more interesting in a good sense. Story wise, it&apos;s average, unique which I like, but could have been handled better. Adorable, heck yes. The key aspect I love is all the unique features added either in Easter egg, small details to objects, and spending the time to appreciate things like characters and lore despite it&apos;s fast pace. It legitimately feels like the creator put in the heart to make something that works, ran smooth, and was beautiful. In comparison to the other few hundred games in my library, it&apos;s one of the best handled.

<br>Also, Milla is best character.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=5544547">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game has Adventure mode, Classic Mode, &amp; Time Attack. Adventure is the main game, lots of story &amp; such. The voice acting is top notch &amp; sounds great. Classic mode is the main game without the cut scenes, but these cut scenes are worth watching. Time attack is pretty much what it sounds like. Beat each level as fast as you can.
<br>
<br>You can play as 2 starting characters &amp; you unlock a 3rd character through the games Story Mode. Each character plays differently.
<br>
<br>The main character Lilac is a Dragon Speedster who can attack with her hair like a whip &amp; charge a dash in several directions. While dashing she is immune to damage for about 1 second, but it takes a few seconds for it to recharge. She also has an aerial spin that gives her a slight hover double jump &amp; also does damage but can be hard to control &amp; hit with in certain situations so this move is best used on flying enemies.
<br>
<br>The second, Carol, is a Feline that can jump up walls &amp; relies on quick attacks which can take out enemies very fast. She also has a motorbike which you can use after finding gas tanks scattered throughout the levels. This bike enables her to climb any wall &amp; gives her increased mobility &amp; a double jump that also deals damage. Carol is also the easiest to play out of the three characters available.
<br>
<br>The third is Milla, a Puppy who has less health than the other 2 but can fly &amp; charge to create blocks to then throw at enemies or use them to fire a beam &amp; sheild herself from damage. You have to unlock Milla by playing the first 2 levels in the Adventure mode &amp; she&apos;s currently only available in Classic Mode after unlocking. Milla will get her own Story Mode later on from what I&apos;ve heard.
<br>
<br>There are other characters that will be added later to the game as DLC.
<br>
<br>The boss fights are fun &amp; challenging. If playing on the hard difficulty (or even on normal) you will have a rough time. Every boss feels unique in how they attack you &amp; has a strategy to figure out in order to beat them. Some bosses have a chain attack &amp; if you get caught in it you can expect nearly certain death. During the tougher boss fights your friends will show up &amp; throw health pickups your way or help deal damage to the boss with you.
<br>
<br>The only negative thing I can say about this game is the FPS will randomly drop from it&apos;s normal 60 down to 30 at times &amp; it will lock to 30 until you find a level transition. This problem only occurs when running the game at higher resolutions or in 3x Size mode.  That and the game can get pretty hard, especially near the end where the difficulty spikes massively.
<br>
<br>In short, this is the epitome of what games were in the early 90&apos;s &amp; anyone who wants a good old school platformer, action game shouldn&apos;t miss out on this one. 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4382990">Expand</a></span>

Deus Ex: Human Revolution level of badly designed boss fights. With those omitted, this would be an solid 8, as it stands its a 4.5. One of the first things the developers did post launch was to nerf the difficulty of the bosses due to overwhelmingly negative feedback but even without that overbearing level of raw challenge they&apos;re just badly designed which makes them frustrating rather than fun and brings the entire game down. Get it on sale if your a die hard fan of Genesis era platformers or when it hits bundles if you aren&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=4940416">Expand</a></span>

Instead of getting hurt when you touch an enemy like old games, you just fight them with attacks. This game does have a lot of running and jumping, and use of the special moves is required to keep on. The boss battles are more complicated than anyting I&apos;ve seen in the Genesis Era. Its also faster. Levels are long. The artwork is mostly great, but I have some critiques. I don&apos;t like the eyes on the character designs. It just reminds me of MLP (My Little Pony). I think some of the background pieces have annoying color pallette (Dreadnaught level.) I absolutely loved the enemies throughout the game which provided some challenge and each had their own AI and style. I loved all the bouncers and all the level gimmicks. I hope they invent new ones next time. The artwork is not perfect, especially the color pallette in the last level. But guess what I don&apos;t care, because I had so much fun playing this fast and challenging game. Its better than Sonic 3. The design was great, but I wouldn&apos;t say its perfect or classic like Sonic 1 or 2. But that&apos;s how much I liked it. I loved this game. Its almost perfect as you play through it. The levels are all done with care. Good music, but not classic music. Great unlockables and extras make it so you want to play the game more than once. There is a lot of work that went into this game. If even half of this effort could go onto work on Sonic Mania. Will definitely will buy Freedom Planet 2. Finally a good 2d platformer game came out that isn&apos;t what I&apos;d classify as indie garbage. This is the real deal guys.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=6818690">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros
<br>+3 Playable Characters in the main story mode (4th character in Time attack)
<br>+Plays like old school 2D sonic games with additional gameplay mechanics such as attacks and special moves. Also a bit of like Mega Man with the way enemies attack, health meter, etc
<br>+Each character has a unique PoV in their adventure mode
<br>+Visuals done in the same like of Sega Genesis era games and Pixel art animations are nicely done
<br>+3 modes to play with - Adventure (With cutscenes), Classic (no cutscenes, straight to the game), and Time Attack (time based levels)
<br>+Unlockables such as art work, music and sound effects which can be unlocked through finding cards throughout stages (would require to play the game multiple times which helps replay value)
<br>+Different difficulty modes such as Casual, Easy, Normal and Hard all varying based on damage, health, etc
<br>+Achievement system with leaderboards
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-Some lines and voice acting are cheesy or sound bad
<br>-At some points in the game there are parts where the voice acting during cutscenes is low when music is playing</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/freedom-planet/user-reviews?user_review_id=6926843">Expand</a></span>

The voice acting is great (although the recorded quality is low), the soundtrack is fantastic, the boss fights are excellent (if a tad on the hard side), and the general feeling I get from this game is joy. It&apos;s reminds me of sonic, only it&apos;s a really great game. Will buy it again if it comes to a mobile game console. Will buy the sequel.</span>
