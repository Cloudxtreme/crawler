<br>
<br>And I am glad to had bought it. I spent 14 hours playing this game and exploring the available worlds of Avalon and I can say:
<br>
<br>- The game was undoubtedly developed as a first part of a continuous saga, which seems it never came.
<br>- The game play is quite simple and the options limited
<br>- The skills and weapons systems feel a bit unpolished.
<br>- Re-playability is not high
<br>
<br>Anyway, errors are always easy to point.
<br>
<br>Still, at the end the most important thing is to enjoy the experience and definitely that was what happened to me while playing this game. This game gives you the feel the developers actually invested a lot of effort and somehow it just kept coming to my mind that this is one of those games that was developed with passion and love. It might sound silly but that&apos;s my main point.
<br>
<br>Any of you that is fond of not too complex RPGs with a gorgeous environment should give this title the opportunity to surprise you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/faery-legends-of-avalon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4888335">Expand</a></span>
