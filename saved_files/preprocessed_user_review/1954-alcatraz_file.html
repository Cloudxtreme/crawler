There were some minor audio problems: the game or engine doesn&apos;t seem to like multi-core and had frequent audio stutter and pops until I changed the CPU affinity to a single core. In addition, some audio-skipping did not work. I bought the game on sale and played through twice; if you like more casual games and want to honor the developer for their good work with the Deponia series, its a worth buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/1954-alcatraz/user-reviews?user_review_id=4515856">Expand</a></span>

<br>The escape from the world&apos;s most notorious prison fortress based plot is done quite well, the atmosphere and jazzy soundtrack are great and the switching between dual characters approach works well. Voice acting is good for the main 2 characters and average for the rest but by no means poor (I&apos;ve heard a LOT worse even in big budget AAA games). Puzzles are OK-ish, maybe a little on the easy side but mostly logical. Demanding every single adventure game&apos;s puzzles be targeted towards MENSA members, have a plot that turns the player into an emotional train-wreck or be &quot;totally unique&quot; is just as silly as giving every single FPS game 30% score if it includes shooting or &quot;surviving&quot; something.

<br>1954 Alcatraz may not be the best adventure game out there (or even the best by Daedalic), but it certainly deserves more than the joke 35-40% scores some &quot;professionals&quot; are giving (especially when many of the same ones are giving &apos;infallibly perfect 100%&apos; scores to half-broken AAA games that are still barely playable even after 3 months of patches...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/1954-alcatraz/user-reviews?user_review_id=5061099">Expand</a></span>
