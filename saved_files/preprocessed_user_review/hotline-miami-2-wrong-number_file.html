I love how much larger the new maps are but that is also one of the games biggest issues; Much of the game is spent shift-looking far ahead of you to line up the perfect shot while hiding behind cover because a missed shot means a counter-shot from off screen can kill you. Too many of the maps were a complete joke with you spamming walls of shotgun fire off screen in the hopes of killing stuff (and actually succeeding) and rewarding you with a huge combo or punishing you with a bullet in the back from off screen. I guess rooms made out of entirely glass were popular in the 80s because there are also tons of windows this time around, meaning enemies from outside of your vision can shoot to kill from multiple rooms away. Melee is usually an option but with long corridors and tons of breakable windows its often unrealistic to melee everything everytime.
<br>
<br>If the game was in a different engine (with some kind of first person option) or had a zoom feature I would&apos;ve really loved this and it would&apos;ve felt like a significant improvement over the original. New characters, bigger levels, more weapons, and a psychedelic story are great and all, but when the core gameplay is this frustrating and unwieldy it is difficult to recommend. If you enjoyed the original its worth picking up but I wouldn&apos;t recommend it for newcomers to the series despite being completely seperate from the original (outside of lore).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5511292">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you liked Hotline Miami and wanted a longer storyline, more death, more killing, more blood and more weapons. You wont regret Hotline Miami 2. It might be a cheap game but its highly addictive and you wont stop playing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5316563">Expand</a></span>

The whole game is like playing paintball where everyone is blindfolded. The story is not interesting and the music is not quite as good as the first. The AI gets hung up on more things like doorways and itself. Buy the first game; if you like it, buy this one on sale but don&apos;t expect anything. If you don&apos;t like it, don&apos;t even think about touching this one. To make matters worse, the level editor (arguably the most crucial new feature, seeing as how terrible the official levels are) did not ship with the game.

<br>Hotline Miami 1 was so fast paced and fluid, Hotline Miami 2 is fast paced, but it&apos;s different. You no longer charge enemies at beat their head in. You now have to basically hide behind corners and lure enemies to you. It&apos;s just not as fun as Hotline Miami. It feels boring and just has zero replayability.
<br>
<br>The level design has also been pumped down WAY too much. Through the entire game, you will feel like you&apos;ve been through here 5 times already. It&apos;s so disappointing to see that what made the first game stand out and what made it good was completely ripped out and traded for a more focused story. Honestly the story doesn&apos;t interest me at all! That&apos;s not what made me like Hotline Miami 1! I liked Hotline Miami 1 for it&apos;s unique levels and awesome gameplay. The story is okay. It touches up queasy subjects like rape and torture.
<br>
<br>Overall, Hotline Miami is not a bad game if you&apos;ve never played the first one, but it is a HUGE disappointment if you have played the first one. If you haven&apos;t played either and you are interested, buy the first once. You most likely won&apos;t regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5069067">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The tempo of combat is mediocre at best, nowhere close to how fast-paced the first title was. The story is also pretty terrible, there&apos;s not a single likable character, and your options for completing missions/chapters/scenes are extraordinarily limited; even if the game seems to offer you several routes for completion, there&apos;s really only one or two that are viable, and even they are fairly time consuming and RNG-prone.
<br>
<br>All in all, not a fantastic experience. Buy the first Hotline Miami rather than Wrong Number.
<br>
<br>Soundtrack is pretty good though; 49 tracks in the base game, 6 more in the Remix EP for the special edition.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5062893">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s similar, but if Dennaton played different cards, it wouldn&apos;t be a Hotline Miami game. It has a fantastic soundtrack. It is also very good to hear that they are going to release the level editor soon. Overall, this game is a fantastic choice if you wish to bash someone&apos;s brain in.

<br>
<br>Difficulty is artificial, level designs are a big step back, it just took everything fun about the original and snapped it over its leg with a sickening crack. I really, really wanted to like it, the soundtrack is great and the story is as idiotic and crazy as ever (this is a good thing), but the levels are almost all designed to be slow methodical crawls as you avoid bullets shot from dozens of enemies that you can&apos;t see because they&apos;re off-screen and have ridiculous line-of-sight length. You can never just blitz through a level with a melee weapon and a death wish and come out victorious like you could in the first one, and that just kills it. Disappointment of 2015, and I really hate that I&apos;m typing that down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5462953">Expand</a></span>

<br>This sad excuse for a sequel is an abortion of game - incredibly erratic AI, frustratingly terrible level design and a storyline that feels it was written during a game of consequences!  I cannot believe that Devolver have anything to do with this game or, more depressingly, that they take  gamers to be a gullible sack of tw@ts who are happy to part readily with cash for a rushed, half-baked buggy follow ups.

Then toss in 80s inspired music and ultra violence and you got Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number.
<br>Pros:
<br>-People rave about the music and it is a part of creating a unique atmosphere that is distinguishably Hotline Miami.
<br>-A lot of people say there is a lack of variety in dealing with levels. Though what they mean is that a lot of times that variety is imposed on you by the game and not your own choice which I think is fine. Sometimes you&apos;ll play a scene with a fisticuffs reporter and sometimes you&apos;ll be a Rambo esque shotgun and knife wielding jungle commando.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Pretty atrocious AI respond nonsensically at times. For instance when you shoot a gun a select few enemies (seemingly regardless of distance) charge at you and others stay. After you shoot a gun and go into a room the enemies pile into the doorway where you easily slaughter them. But to make up for all the bad AI they have amazing accuracy.
<br>-Offscreen enemies see you before you see them. This is a problem more so in this game due to the bigger levels and longer hallways. And when they do see you apparently they have an auto lock function because they snipe you dead. Not to mention dogs. Run at you from offscreen and bam. Dead. Auto lock jaw on your neck.
<br>-Story has many different characters that is jumps back and forth between and years that it also jumps back and forth between making it very hard to keep up with but honestly it could have no story and that&apos;d sort of be fine.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: I feel like to play this game is to play around it&apos;s inefficiencies. Exploiting the bad AI and avoiding hallways when possible. It is a frustrating experience whereas the first wasn&apos;t even though it pretty much had the same cons.  A lot of times when I died I felt it was because of the faults of the game (AI/autolock/offscreen enemies) and not myself. Though that is not to say that every time I died I felt I had been cheated by the game. A lot of times it was a misplay, I didn&apos;t react quickly enough, didn&apos;t time my stab right, etc. And that&apos;s fine. That&apos;s great even. But to me I was too overwhelmed by the other times when I felt the game was ****</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5092525">Expand</a></span>

<br>the variety in masks actually screw you over since 75% of them i found making the game harder and the 25% had some useless effect,
<br>protip: try taking no weapons mask and all missions are hell.
<br>Like i said the missions are harder and actually way longer then they used to be, still checkpoints are only every map and saves are only per mission, leading to an hour of gameplay and then ragequit, after which u realise u have to do even the easy bits of that mission again.
<br>4/10 truly disappointed as i truly enjoyed first one. :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5092212">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Con&apos;s
<br>- Quite a slow pace.
<br>- Level design is interesting but frustrating at times; being shot of screen after an amazing run is simply disappointing and an unfair advantage.
<br>- New masks...are disappointingly bland.
<br>- Limited new masks, no where near the same amount of masks and unique traits as the original.
<br>- Story...is...extremely confusing, and outlandish. Not in a good way.
<br>
<br>Quick snapshot:
<br>I felt this game was confused, in many ways, in direction, music, story, and just overall narration of what was going on. I may be missing something but from a game mechanic point of view, I must say there are VERY few masks, and none of which really inspire me as Hotline Miami 1 had. The ending left me a bit sour also.
<br>
<br>The 6/10 is really because I respect game design, and this is still a good game...compare this to the original however and I would never have played this. The original has amazing music, masks, gameplay mechanics, and excellent pacing. Play that instead of this to be frank, or play it to see what I mean. I hope this review has helped, and I have purposely included ZERO spoilers.

<br>
<br>The fast, fun and complex gameplay of HM1 has been grinded to a halt with meticulous stages jampacked with random AI enemies thrown in to boringly increase the difficulty. What stops this game from being really fun is all the cold calculation a player must do to take down the enemies on ONE. **** FLOOR. After dying 50 times not because of a lack of a plan but more so because of the free-roam cheap ass NPCs, you begin to see how little much was actually even done by the developers.
<br>
<br>Their are no new enemy types, just re-skins or the same models. Levels don&apos;t feature any new system of travel or interaction. You are actually even limited to how you can play a level since most of the playable characters have their own abilities you MUST use for that certain level. It;s a mess.
<br>
<br>The story... well if you thought the first one was unintelligible, just wait baby. Not only does this story not matter for multiple characters and story arcs, but it&apos;s dull and lifeless as well!
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t even feel like I wanna finish this game. It&apos;s like finishing a level has become a chore, not something you want to do freely. Imagine going to the grand opening of a cool Lazer Tag hall, and for the first trip their are no rules, everyone just shoots and jumps and has fun. Now imagine coming back to the hall, and now the owners have put safety restrictions on every aspect of the game, including interruptions of unintelligible and boring Lazer Tag videos. Yeah, that sums up Hotline Miami 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5064901">Expand</a></span>

For me, it is a Masterpiece, to the point that I&apos;ve completed it 100% and gone through the story 5 or 6 times (cant even remember)
<br>
<br>Miami hotline 2: Wrong number is an extremely frustrating game for the following reasons:
<br>
<br>&#xB7;Mouse Issues:
<br>-&gt;There are some major problems with the mouse handling, the first one, it presents a slight amount of input lag, feeling unresponsive every time you need a quick turn or aim.
<br>The second and most important would be the mouse resetting: every time a locked on enemy dies, the mouse points not in the direction he was before dying, but in the direction he was when you locked on him, which means, that if he ran towards you along with his friends, after you kil him, you will be suddenly aiming backwards at a blank space with your back turned on the rest of the enemies. This happens as well when you perform a roll with Corey, resulting in you rolling right AND places the cursor in the middle of the screen, slightly to your right. You can only avoid this by pressing a movement key while you role so the cursor is placed in the direction you are moving. This is a FATAL flaw, since it leaves you rolling and aiming in a complete different direction that you were expecting, sometimes turning yet again your back on your enemies.
<br>
<br>--&gt; Level design is completely unprofessional. In the first game, the narrow corridor carnages tested both your handling skill and your tactical improvisation: some enemies had ranged weapons and were mixed with melee fighters, so you wanted to get the weapon guys first  while avoiding the melee fighters so you could survive the encounter. This was the essence of their motto &quot;Recklessness is rewarded&quot;, since thinking a thorough plan to wipe the enemies wont work on a 3 vs 1, so you had to simplify the plan, pick a primary objective, and let your skills and reflexes carry out the rest for you, enhancing the combos, since you took on 3 enemies at one time in a split second, and if anyone barged in, you automatically reformulated the process to kill him and anyone that could have seen you. Nevertheless, that gameplay mechanic needed some brakes, otherwise, the whole game would have been a continuous slaugtherfest with little to no difficulty, so they put some stages with windows and huge rooms in order to slow you down, and pace the game artificially. Those stages were really nice implemented, and after the quick battles you felt it was natural to encounter some resistance from time to time, after all you are singlehandedly killing dozens of armed people. Nevertheless, it was the most boring and frustrating part of the game: no room for combos, slow paced, cheaply difficult... It was simply an artificial drag down perfectly implemented. The problem with Miami Hotline 2 is that THIS is the primary gameplay and level choices... You have a WHOLE game designed after the most unfun parts of his predecessor. As a result, the fast paced twitchy combat that made your adrenaline rush is now a CHORE to play. Imagine a mortal combat where every fighter was Goro, and then you fight Shao Kahn... Not fun at all.
<br>
<br>I wont talk about the story because I feel so impotent when playing this game I havent touched it since my first time playing.
<br>
<br>Please: BEWARE OF THIS GAME, IT PLAYS NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL, FEELS BUGGY AND DOESNT IMPROVE A THING, IT MAKES IT WORSE!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5066351">Expand</a></span>

<br>A horribly disappointing sequel to a great game. Hotline Miami 1 was at once rhythmic and spontaneous in its gameplay. It was a succinct shot of adrenaline, bleeding neon visuals and pulsing synth. Hotline Miami 2 retains the superb visuals and arguably has a superior soundtrack. But those are the only two facets where it either matches or surpasses its predecessor.
<br>
<br>The story is a bloated and confused mess. It&apos;s written by people who are not in any way capable enough to devise a plot to hang all the pointless ultra-violence on. That doesn&apos;t stop them trying manfully though, for far too long. They should have just done what they did with the first game, negligible plot.
<br>
<br>The gameplay, unfortunately, often surpasses the plot for tedium and frustration. Gone are the level runs where you&apos;d actually.......well run. In stead, an all to wide and empty vista of a map is spammed with mobs holding guns, mobs behind windows holding guns, special big characters holding guns and dogs holding guns that shoot windows. So you&apos;re forced to find a shotgun, a suitable room corner and lure the enemies in to mow them down in a doorway. You have to become a camper. It&apos;s awful and a massive backward stumble for the game.
<br>
<br>The game is somewhat saved by the levels where you can use the Tony mask and the Writer&apos;s levels. The Writer can&apos;t use guns at all because he&apos;s a non-lethal character. You even get extra combo-chains and points for picking up weapons and unloading them. It&apos;s a calculated risk, but it&apos;s a good and clever change. If only the rest of the game could&apos;ve followed suit.
<br>
<br>The Soundtrack is superb, well worth listening to all the way through. Much better than the first&apos;s, which is also kickin&apos;. The graphic work for the level intros, and levels themselves, is also excellent. A combination of the pros I&apos;ve mentioned here save the game from being a 3.5 (not that metacritic would allow me to post that score) and bring it to a 5.
<br>
<br>My advice to PC gamers is to wait for a steam sale and/or the level editor to be released.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5143354">Expand</a></span>

<br>And unfortunately that&apos;s not an expression contained just within it&apos;s disappointing story.
<br>
<br>The level design in the later levels distances itself from the original &apos;Run in, Get out&apos; standard Hotline Miami had set and is driven towards a typical, un-original top-down shooter. All strategy and melee combat becomes completely redundant as the game starts throwing all of it&apos;s enemies at you at the one time, the placement in enemies and the level design in general has lost it&apos;s quality during the transition of games. The game becomes &apos;challenging hard&apos; to just downright ****
<br>
<br>The story starts very promising til you discover it&apos;s entire narrative is based on explaining the events of Hotline Miami 1,  it would&apos;ve been definitely preferred if the ambigious mystery of the first game was left untouched. The ending serves itself as the biggest insult to fans of the original. A concept which the developers addmitedly enforced into the development of their game.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack and visual aesthetic is more richer than ever, which conflicts with the absolute deteriation of the game itself. If you are indeed a fan of the original, do yourself a favour, wait for The Level Designer and create your own narrative and levels, because the one made for you is nothing short of disappoiting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5065272">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>How is that possible? The developer has apparently decided to emphasize the weak points of the game while neglecting the strong points.
<br>
<br>First of all, the control scheme is mediocre. You can either play with mouse and keyboard, getting better precision, but the problem is that you aim via a near-invisible cursor that easy to lose sight off. Because mouse aiming is relative, you must know which direction you are aiming - and with twitch aiming, this just does not work. Gamepad has the &quot;lock nearest enemy&quot; function that almost feels like cheating, and the analog stick aiming is absolute, but the precision is far worse.
<br>
<br>Another problem is that the game is horribly pixelated and thus the artificially low resolution can cover only a small part of the battlefield. The solution is to SHIFT - peek out of your normal vision range in a given direction that is both clunky and unfit for a fast-paced, twitchy game.
<br>
<br>That all is less of a problem in small, close quarters map, where stealth, melee and careful planning is most important. That&apos;s why the developer has decided to go for large maps with tons of automatic guns, where you get shot from beyond your visual range most of the time, so you must carefully shift-creep through the levels. Frustrating, slow, bad.
<br>
<br>The prevailing theme of the sequel is the prevalent American &quot;MORE&quot; - more player characters, more guns, more enemies, bigger levels, more story threads. Unfortunately, it all results in a worse game - big levels are tedious to play, ranged gun play emphasizes poor controls, too many story-lines shatter the focus of the game narrative without really going anywhere. The gruesome acts of violence get exhausted fast as a shocker.
<br>
<br>4/10 - Disappointing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5070186">Expand</a></span>

This game not just doesn&apos;t live up the hype, but also fails even on it&apos;s own. If you don&apos;t believe me and think I am some kind of brainless hater, okay, then I invite you to try playing the original game right after you finish playing this one, so you can testify with your own eyes how the gameplay, the level design, the plot, the graphics, the mechanics, the attention to details, and absolutely everything else (exept the soundtrack maybe) feels like a downgrade over the original game. For me, this is the biggest deception of the year so far. Do not buy it unless the devs come up with a huge update.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5069314">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s much longer than the previous version, arguably out-staying it&apos;s welcome with it&apos;s gameplay getting a little stale by the end of this game, whereas, with the original, I was desperately cramming for more gameplay by the end. The gameplay is similar to the last but with a few differences. The main one being that the levels are bigger than HM1. This seems like a positive but ends up being a downside. It&apos;s difficulty is ramped up because of this, and the small issues in the gameplay of HM1 are exemplified because of the expanded level design. The trial and error nature of the gameplay becomes quite annoying in this version with you finally beating part of a stage after tons of trial and error, only to have you die to something you couldn&apos;t have predicted or reacted to, bringing in even more trial and error. This wasn&apos;t nearly as much of an issue in the original as the levels were smaller. There also is a few times were it isn&apos;t clear if something is actually there, or simply drawn into the background. For example, there are some 2d objects that you cannot be seen or shot through, but some that are and aren&apos;t actually there, it&apos;s just what the floor looks like. In a game with split-second decisions, this can easily lead to unfair deaths and redoing a retardedly long level. Same thing with off-screen enemies shooting you before you have a chance to react. The targeting is also very inaccurate with it being virtually impossible to consistently target who you want unless they&apos;re very close to you and nowhere near other enemies. Also, as with any 2d game, you&apos;ll find that an enemy will occasionally occupy the same space that you do, in which even if you react first, you&apos;ll likely die. The masks were also changed for the better IMO with almost all the masks being relevant and separate for different character. Unlike in HM1 where 90%+ of the masks were pointless. Still, it is the same core gameplay as the previous iteration so it is still incredibly fun and rewarding trying to find the best route to victory.
<br>
<br>The story has much more emphasis on it this time around. It&apos;s actually not that complicated but with the way it&apos;s presented, you&apos;ll likely have no idea what&apos;s going on unless you look it up presented in a simpler form after you completed it. It constantly switches from past to present with various different characters more than Lost. It&apos;s difficult to tell who&apos;s who due to the 2d top-down nature of the game (and the ridiculous number of characters, making it difficult to remember them all). A simple reference from earlier in the game or HM1 that you may not get because the game throws so many different stories and information at you, will cause a ripple effect of you not having a f*cking clue of what is going on. The number of characters doesn&apos;t help this with many just being filler to the story and making it needlessly more complicated. Despite it&apos;s downsides, I was intrigued and didn&apos;t particularly feel massively let down at any single point unlike HM1&apos;s ending.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack is still great but not as good as the original IMO. But this is so subjective that it&apos;s difficult to criticise this as they&apos;re both considered to be great soundtracks.
<br>
<br>I will say I haven&apos;t experienced many bugs and I played it a couple weeks after release but your experience may differ.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s still a solid game, but arguably out stays its welcome which exemplifies the small issues of the previous game, but the changing of the masks (upgrades) bringing a new dynamic. The story whilst intriguing is also confusing with it&apos;s needlessly complicated presentation and irrelevant characters. The soundtrack is solid and the core gameplay is still highly fun and equally infuriating which is what makes HM what it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5093957">Expand</a></span>

<br>Most of the haters are just mad the levels are much larger and actually take some thought to complete. Unlike in HM 1 where you could just strap on the tony mask and melee combo the entire stage in 30 seconds. While its actually an improvement in overall challenge of the game, their perfected rush down playstyle is no longer viable in every situation. So they claim its &quot;no fun.&quot;  That is far from the truth however, the game is much more refined and offers a lot of really good new qualities.
<br>
<br>Only downside is....we STILL haven&apos;t gotten the level editor that was promised at launch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=6124379">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Sometimes you can sneak up on opponents, without them even having the slightest possiblity of knowing; yet, they turn around and shoot you before you can even blink. On the other hand, it can also happen you shoot at them with a shotgun. Pieces of glass are flying through the air and yet they have no clue there is someone there. It was already much like this in the original but it feels as if this game does even worse.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack didn&apos;t get me pumped like the original did. Now, this is of course different for everyone but in my opinion, it isn&apos;t as good as the original was.
<br>
<br>The storyline... is... not that interesting either. Of course, the previous game had no real storyline. The whole idea was to show people games can be great without a good storyline. Yet, I was intrigued. The dark atmosphere; the feeling of someone losing their mind; it worked. Even though it didn&apos;t really make sense... it felt as if it did.
<br>
<br>This game, everything constantly changed. Then you were this guy, then you were this guy. The story is original, but... It just wasn&apos;t interesting to me,
<br>
<br>The only thing I really like about this game is it&apos;s difficulty. The first few levels are already harder than most of the levels in the original game. This definitely is nice, although it also has a lot to do with the terrible AI.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t help but feel disappointed. A little scammed, even, because I think the original is actually better and that one was for free. Of course the game is still fun. The original was great, so it&apos;s not all that bad it&apos;s more of the same, but with a previous game like that, I expected more of this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5062147">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The music changed in most of the levels trying to create atmosphere. I really like the soundtrack, but the one in the first game focused more in pumping you, which enhanced the psychodelic atmosphere of the game. Now it feels like a real story. And i still like more the way it was in the first game. But yeah, i loved it too overall and is perfect, just my opinion here.
<br>
<br>Its longer, its harder, it has more posibilities, more characters, level editor, enhanced graphics? not sure if i should say it like this since the art style of the game is not about graphics... but its arts  got really much more beautiful and there are many new effects and details which i found totally awesome and kickass.
<br>
<br>Maybe its downside (again) would be its AI... i&apos;d love this to be improved... but oh well, nothing is perfect and never will be.
<br>
<br>For me, 2 of my all time favourite games. And still i know this is the kind of game you love or you hate when you first try it,
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t be an ass like i was, and many idiots are being for hating the game before trying it just because &quot;&quot;it looks like **** because, oh boy, it doesn&apos;t by any means.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5062814">Expand</a></span>

<br>P.S.
<br>-1 point because of buggy gameplay as Alex and Ash. Probably will be fixed sometime soon.</span>

The game is once again complimented with a sublime soundtrack that really adds to the powerful atmosphere. Unfortunately, the game also suffers from some horrific mission design that render many levels infuriating and unfair. If you can overlook this; it&apos;s a fanastic experience but even die-hard fans may be left disappointed at its surprising flaws.
<br>
<br>Players will notice very early on that each mission is substantially bigger and more populated than the ones seen in Hotline Miami. In theory. this should be a good aspect that adds to the overall challenge but more often than not; you will struggle to spot, track and shoot enemies at distance as you can&apos;t even see them. Even with the camera stretched with the shift key to the maximum; some areas of maps you simply wont be able to view which enables you to be killed out of the blue even though you wont see who shot you or where they were. You may need to play a mission 20+ times you to assess where everyone is and even then; you&apos;ll need luck more than skill to succeed at times.
<br>
<br>To add insult to injury; many missions now contain windows in all directions and considering the sizes and openess of some levels; you can only go in set directions which makes some feel very linear and repetitive. Not being able to see large parts of the map also leaves your options limited in how you approach them.
<br>
<br>Despite the dismay regarding the key flaws; I still recommend this game to fans. It is much harder for all the wrong reasons but if you can adjust and learn the levels through endless retires; you&apos;ll be hooked once again. The engrossing story, the terrific cast of characters and the music really improve on the original. The achievements also add to the longevity and when the level editor arrives; players will be able to show the devs how it should have been done!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5063772">Expand</a></span>

Hotline Miami 2 is undoubtedly a solid game. But as it&apos;s a sequel, the important thing is to consider what this game adds to the franchise - being released after the indie blockbuster Hotline Miami 1.
<br>
<br>First things first. Read the comic before starting the game. It&apos;s nice and ties some points between two games. Music: again awesome. Some people may like more as it is more darker now. But, the soundtrack is expensive - it has the same price tag with the game.
<br>
<br>Now, gameplay. Top-down f*ck&apos;em up style didn&apos;t wear up, so it is still very entertaining. As I saw, enemies are more active. There are some questionable points though. Wide rooms make it harder to spot enemies so you will definitely get some cheap deaths. Sometimes, the enemies get stuck during their patrol. I don&apos;t know if it happens to everyone, but when you kill the last enemy on a floor, there is a chance that the game freezes momentarily. I didn&apos;t encounter any stability issues however.
<br>
<br>The plot leads from multiple points. You play as multiple characters, who have different perks and style, replacing mask perks in the first game - and I think that&apos;s a fine change. As I said, I played for a couple of hours so I don&apos;t know if the story ties up well, hope it does.
<br>
<br>Finally, does Hotline Miami 2 suffer from Call of Duty syndrome: no, considering that this is the last Hotline Miami entry and it has some new features. Making a sequel for the first game was undoubtedly hard, trying to reach the sensation it created as it was very unique. There aren&apos;t many substantial changes, so it is understandable that there are some disappointed people.
<br>
<br>Hotline Miami 2 is a fine addition to a fantastic franchise. If you liked the first game, you should definitely get it. If you are new to the series, try the first game, then consider for yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5071033">Expand</a></span>

It may have a reference or two to the old one, but on its own, it differentiates itself enough to be considered on a different level.
<br>You follow an odd 7 or so psychopaths, detectives and soldiers through a grim &quot;alternate history&quot;. The story is phenomenal, with a conclusion a-kin to a dream, asking questions about if anything was worth it. Again, the mystery and speculation from the fist game, is still here.
<br>Musically, the game has been modernised, and this would be a little problematic, if it weren&apos;t for the score being utterly stellar. Music is slow and depressing in some areas, and fast and &quot;violent&quot; in others. Graphically the game is still as OK as ever, besides a few improved visual effects.
<br>The only major problem is that the levels are massive. This is compensated for with the incredible diversity, but I cant help but feel that the drag on, not helped by the fact that they are designed to be harder than the last game.
<br>One final note: I think the developer&apos;s passion was paramount. You could really feel that the game was made by two really inspired guys (and a hundred other musicians). This means I can forgive all the shortcomings to some degree. I think everyone should stop comparing this masterpiece to the cult classic of 2012, because as a whole this is a very different game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5068578">Expand</a></span>

With a more detailed and added story explaining the chronicles of events that took place before the first game, during the first game and finally directly following the ending of the first game, with added comics this poured gas on the fire for a plethora of fans who where already donning their animal masks ready for the next edition to the games two part series. Keeping the soundtrack in the same violent/neon colored overtone Hotline Miami 2 saw returning artists such as Perturbator, Moon and many others as well as some new coming artists to the series such as Mega Drive and El Tig3r adds to the unforgiving nature of the game and the feeling of pure satisfaction after completing such a seemingly impossible task.

<br>
<br>Dennaton Games obviously realized that the sequel to one of the most lauded indie gems ever, would need to be bigger, better and even more over the top in regards to how you approach it. Some of it they succeeded at. Some of it sort of killed the frenetic pacing. That said, expanding the scope of the game was the right approach, and the split perspectives this time around, offers players with a variety of new faces with their own bits and pieces of what is looming in the background of the HM2 world.
<br>
<br>You have The Fans. A group of kids who were inspired by Jacket to go on their own killing sprees, and each one has a unique mechanic. Corey has a diveroll. Mark is a beast with machineguns. Tony destroys people with his fists. Alex and Ash are actually two characters in one, with one wielding a chainsaw, while the other backs her up with a gun. Their missions for me, were probably some of the best in the game, hands down.
<br>
<br>You have Jake. A fat redneck, following in Jacket&apos;s footsteps. Jake can throw anything and it&apos;s lethal.
<br>
<br>You have Evan, a writer who is desperately attempting to finish a novel about the events in Hotline Miami. You have to literally force him to kill, and he won&apos;t use guns, instead, he disables them when picked up.
<br>
<br>You have Pardo, a detective with a dark secret, chasing a serial killer.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s others, but I don&apos;t want to spoil it further for anyone simply wanting to know if the game is worth purchasing it or not. I&apos;ll summarize for you. This game is both frustrating and rewarding, infuriating and entertaining, has a killer soundtrack and offers an unforgettable experience. Once the level creator is released, and the bugs are fixed (already under way) the game will be a worthy successor and sequel to the original. It&apos;s completely worth purchasing and I recommend it to anyone seeking a rewarding challenge wholeheartedly!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5063869">Expand</a></span>

Its really everything I expected out of the sequel. More violence, longer and more engaging story, amazing soundtrack, and more complex and difficult levels. Sure the difficulty can be a bit cumbersome, but how was Hotline miami never difficult?. &quot;Oh i cant go around hitting people aimlessly, i have to actually device a strategy thats why this game sucks&quot; This kind of complaint goes to show how peple want games to be spoonfeeded to them and have all the work done. Like Dark Souls, Hotline miami 1 and 2 prove the real value of a game is in its unique artistic design and not in the quantity of every-other-game elements in it. I highly reccommend this game to everyone who had or played the first one and hope you make a damn bloody mess just like I did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5068781">Expand</a></span>

The story is continuously interesting and the focus on multiple characters also forces the player to try multiple play styles.  Variety is the game&apos;s greatest improvement, yet also it&apos;s weakest aspect.  The game starts with lots of characters, and lots of masks, however later in the game everything degrades into a repetitive game of peekaboo.</span>

Sure the level design isn&apos;t as good and you will be killed by enemies off the screen that you couldn&apos;t have seen coming and some levels are just flat out unfair . But why do I like this more than the first game ? Firstly the story is firstly easier to follow is more interesting and more importantly means it forces you to play the game in a different way for every level (did anyone else just use tony the tiger for the entirety of the first game?) . Secondly the soundtrack is absolutely incredible . It is really varied and  prefer it to the first one (which is one of my favourite game soundtracks ever so this is really saying something). Finally this game takes longer to beat and has way more replay value as the unlock able hard mode is just punishing and I love it. All in all did you like the first one and are you okay with it being quite a bit harder? Then just get it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5070078">Expand</a></span>

It not only expands on everything the first game brought to the table, but adds unique gameplay features and unbridled difficulty. In comparison to the first game, the gameplay is much more varied. Instead of masks simply giving you a weapon to start with or changing your character&apos;s speed they&apos;ll completely change the way you play. From the chainsaw and gun wielding duo, Alex &amp; Ash to using a long range sniper and close quarters knife combo this game really explores the possibilities of a top-down shooter. You&apos;ll hear some complaints about difficulty but as someone who loved the first game, it&apos;s pretty welcomed. The original Hotline Miami was one of my go-to favourite games. I&apos;d just sit down and kill some mobsters for 15 or 20 minutes, Over the course of a few years I put quite a bit of time into the original Hotline Miami and it became pretty easy. Wrong Number realized this and knew that there had to be a steeper difficulty curve. It starts to bar on the difficulty of old NES and SNES games which may seem unfair to some people but was more of reminiscent or nostalgic feeling for me. The game never feels impossible but rather incredibly challenging.
<br>
<br>The music is just as good (if not better than the first game) and alone is worth the purchase. You&apos;ll find the soundtrack pumping you up to clear the next room or just chill you out while you&apos;re selecting a chapter to replay. I purchased the vinyl soundtrack and it was worth every penny.
<br>
<br>As for the story; Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number keeps the retro 1980s (and early 1990s) vibe the first game established and drives it home with a mosaic of eighties and nineties movie tropes. In true Hotline Miami tradition they paint the whole picture through disjointed and hazy visuals in cut-scenes as well as subtle background imagery allowing for you to still come up with wild theories and discuss the story with your friends. The games art is unmistakeably beautiful and tranquil at times while being disturbing, gory &amp; over-the-top violent the rest of time. Dennaton has said this will be their last Hotline Miami instalment and they manage to send the series off in a melancholy, dark and beautiful tone.
<br>
<br>To sum everything up, Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number will probably not appeal to those who are faint of heart or are seeking a more relaxing experience. But will be very satisfying for those who a looking for a insanely challenging retro game. Especially to who enjoy the 80s/90s neon blood-spattered world. Hotline Miami 2 will go down as one of my absolute favourite games of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5066520">Expand</a></span>

Well here&apos;s a phrase - it ties up all ends nicely.
<br>Filled with violence, gore and provocative showcasing, this is indeed a successor to the original. The disturbingly jagged art style is back, it&apos;s even displayed at times in new and more creative ways. It still retains it&apos;s grotesque feel and it uses it well to it&apos;s advantage.
<br>Getting the other obvious thing out of the way - the soundtrack is stellar, again. It will be thumping in your heads long after you complete the game, and for good reason. Some new artists, some recurring ones and loads of MP3-player-worthy material make this OST worth owning.
<br>But let&apos;s get to the core - gameplay. This is where Hotline Miami was at it&apos;s finest, even making a point how important gameplay is as a narrative, not alongside one. Hotline Miami 2, in this aspect, offers more - more weapons, more ways to slay, more levels and they are bigger. And, worst of all - it&apos;s way, way harder. And I do mean this as a negative point. Coming from someone who loves the first game and has beaten it 5 times, never taking more than 6 tries at any level, in any of those playthroughs, the sequel goes to the extreme. Some levels are borderline insane, which sadly makes me say that they are very poorly designed. You can&apos;t expand on level scale and leave everything else as it is! That&apos;s madness! At times I felt as if the game had no QA testing at all! I had to resort to bugs and exploits to get out of some tight spots, simply because the game gave me options that would ultimately always lead to my doom. Some combinations I found to be absolutely impossible. And speaking of bugs, this game has it&apos;s fair share, and the fact that I was searching for them to complete some stages says a lot. And to top it all off - the game crashed on me twice, which is unforgivable when you have to restart the whole damn stage again, from the start (and you were, say, at the last room). Which again brings up the point - if you are gonna have bigger stages, you are gonna need a slightly different save system, because your game crashes. Or just have it not crash. Your choice. Overall, technically, the game feels a bit unfinished. But to be honest - I kept coming back, because it was brutally fun and ... intriguing.
<br>Speaking of intriguing, I, as a defender of art and narrative-driven games, think that Hotline Miami was one of the finest examples of storytelling and art in gaming to ever be crafted. So naturally, Hotline Miami 2 had to do it&apos;s damn best to impress me. To be honest, I didn&apos;t get what I wanted. But I won&apos;t turn back what is offered either. Without spoiling anything, the story answers all questions left unanswered by the first game. The events have come full circle and now we know the absolute and final chronology of everything (for now) and that was pretty sweet to see. Dennation obviously tried to do something different with multiple protagonists and plotlines, and in terms of story - that is cool, but in terms of storytelling - it is convoluted. Very convoluted. Getting things in the right order is a pain, because they are not served in the right order. Piecing the puzzle is, once again, left to the player and it is no easy task, rather an annoying one. But it is worth it in the end. To get back once more to the multiple protagonists - this goes a bit against the game itself, because it often limits the player to playing a level in a certain way, which surely is challenging, but some of us don&apos;t want to use guns, because they make things harder. And making a insanely hard game harder by taking away player choice isn&apos;t the most clever thing I&apos;ve seen lately.
<br>To top this all off - the game isn&apos;t finished yet. The level editor isn&apos;t out, you can&apos;t download custom levels and once again - there is nothing to do after the story is finished, other than hunt achievements and find the few secrets present. I am very eager to build levels and download new ones, so I hope this feature releases soon. If it successfully does and it&apos;s everything that it should be (as in - loads of assets, all previous masks, new additions, the ability to tie levels into custom campaigns, unlimited downloads and - the update being free of charge), I would up the score on this. That would be a very worthy and valuable addition to the game, making it virtually infinite to us Hotline Miami Crackheads. But untill then... I will continue playing the story on hard mode. Because I&apos;m hooked. Again.
<br>Because I like hurting people. And I&apos;m not yet sure why. All I know is that Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number makes it very fun, enjoyable and intriguing. And while it doesn&apos;t do anything outstandingly better than the original, it is at the very least as equally as good and is well worth the requested price.

<br>This story of this game tries to answer a lot of questions Hotline Miami 1 made us ask, though a lot of it is up for interpretation.
<br>The gameplay is a lot like the first one, but this time you play with a lot of different characters who al play slightly different. This differentiates this game from the first one, and also makes for a nice change of pace. There are a lot more levels in this one, and the difficulty on some of them is a lot higher than the first game. There&apos;s also a hard mode after you complete the game if you still feel the game&apos;s too easy.
<br>The soundtrack is even better than the first one and there are a lot more songs to enjoy.
<br>Overall it&apos;s a worthy sequel to one of my favorite games of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5064367">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros:
<br>-Long game (around 8 hours on medium)
<br>-Interesting story
<br>-Interesting characters
<br>-Lovely melee gameplay.
<br>-Only 15 euros, buy it. I SAID BUY IT!!!
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Mask system wasn&apos;t great to be honest.
<br>-Sloppy movement and some crosshair/input lag.
<br>-Gun gameplay kinda boring (sorry).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5066522">Expand</a></span>

The levels were claustrophobic and you needed surprise on your side. Things happened quickly, your reflexes had to be perfect, and if you wanted to get a high score (I&apos;ve got top 100 global on every level of HM1) you had to perfect a strategy and then execute it (haha). There were some AI bugs, engine weaknesses (the pickup delay after executions was just unforgivable), and other minor complaints, but the core gameplay was truly excellent.
<br>
<br>Hotline Miami 2 takes most of that gameplay away and throws long linear hallways and endless large rooms of windows at you, along with more offscreen gun enemies &apos;shooting you before you can see them&apos; than you can shake a stick at. Less melee weapons, less guns, less variation with FAR more emphasis on drawn out gun battles, and more bugs. Even the AI is worse, somehow. The maps are poorly designed, huge, with open spaces galore, and packed with massive amounts of enemies. The combo system has been revamped for the worse. The controls are sluggish, and the game feels far less smooth. Overall the gameplay is worse and more limited in every single area.
<br>
<br>Hotline Miami 2 is the end result of a developer unaware of what made his first game a success. People didn&apos;t buy it because of the marginally interesting story. They didn&apos;t buy it because the developer was a cult of personality. They bought it because it had highly refined core gameplay with violence, violence, and more violence. It&apos;s not even an action game at its best: it&apos;s a puzzle game.
<br>
<br>&quot;How can I hit those two guys in that room and still combo the guy way in the back?&quot;
<br>
<br>Which guy needs to die last, and how to kill him, to drag this 12x combo upstairs...&quot;
<br>
<br>And so on.

<br>The pacing and gameplay of Hotline Miami 2 simply isn&apos;t rewarding or enjoyable at all. The game feels bad, and it plays bad. It&apos;s less game than HM1, and that&apos;s just pathetic. A huge, huge disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=6345178">Expand</a></span>

<br>Instead of focusing on one character and developing him, HM2 introduces 7+ characters and kills them off quicker than you can start to sympathize with any of them.
<br>Instead of sandbox-like ability to play any level with any mask, HM2 forces player to play a specific level with specific character.

<br>Level design has apparently been a major issue for people, and with a heavy heart, I agree. It&apos;s simply too open in some areas, as opposed to the first game where you felt amazing when you charged in and racked up huge combos by beating in heads and gunning down mobsters. This game simply feels like a cover shooter at times, especially with certain Hawaii missions (that damn power plant), with people shooting you through windows off-screen, so you&apos;re forced to move sparsely and poke your head out of cover. I personally feel it&apos;s all in context, however. Many levels are still taking place indoors in small places, like clubs, apartments, drug hideouts. But many of the larger levels are office buildings and skyrises, or huge power plants, which seemed to infuriate players.
<br>
<br>So many good things. The soundtrack is spot-on, if not better, with over 50 songs featured throughout. Every level has a different song. Every level. The gameplay, aside from some shoddy level design, is also brilliant. In the original, you had one character with different masks (and Biker I guess). This game has a huge array of characters and playstyles that are completely fresh and new. For example, Corey lets you dodge and roll through areas to avoid gunfire and look like a badass, while Mark lets you dual-wield submachine guns and shoot enemies side-on. Unfortunately some characters feel the same, like the Writer, who doesn&apos;t have any abilities aside from... not being able to kill people? There are characters without masks now, and simply have different abilities.
<br>
<br>But the main thing to comment on here is the story. The story is what&apos;s been focused on the most in this game, tying up loose ends with the story of the original, as well as providing explanations and making you gasp with realisation and shock at many points. The game bounces back between many characters, where stories may intertwine, with characters seeing or killing each other through missions. The story is incredibly surreal in the first as well as its sequel, but makes a surprising amount of sense by the end of the game, each character being important or serving a role. The ending hits you like a train when it all comes together as well.
<br>
<br>So overall, while gameplay is slightly slower-paced than its original, it still stands as an amazing game, worthy of being a sequel, with everything you could expect out of it and more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5223950">Expand</a></span>

But this sequel is boring, no offense to the creators but you really screwed it up. I do not even think a sequel was needed, the one was a masterpiece and a clearly beloved game. So why did the creators of the game felt like it was necessary to take the risk of a sequel in the first place ?
<br>
<br>The soundtrack and the art direction are still very good, but everything else is dull and boring. The level design make you lure your ennemies most of the time into you, you can&apos;t rush and rely on your reflex/instinct to clear out levels like in the first one. This time, you&apos;ll have to find good spot on the map and play very carefully if you do not want an off-screen ennemy to kill you. Believe me, there is a lot of Off-screen enemies in the game. Plus, this time the game make you play the way the creators want you to play. You almost can not choose masks, you have to play with characters and their stupid abilities. The roll is useless, the &quot;twin brothers&quot; are random and the bear&apos;s ability clearly make him more vulnerable. There is some nice idea, like the reporter who can not harm people or the fact that tony mask can not pick weapon (tony&apos;s mask was clearly broken in the first game) but everything else feel really forced.
<br>
<br>Plus, you have no good new weapons to use. Knives are still the most useful melee weapon and they thought a Sniper could be a good idea. It is not, you can not aim past ten meters with it thanks to the core mechanics of the game. Seriousely...
<br>
<br>I did not had enough with the first game, I spent almost 80 hours into it. But this time, the game was so boring that I felt that it was too long, it was like the game never ended. The game IS longer than the first one, but you will felt like it is way longer than it should have been. Plus, there&apos;s a lot of dialogue and the story is really unintersting. At least, the one did not make you focus on the story, but this one heavliy insist on it and it is really bad.
<br>
<br>Really, stick out with the first one. Do not touch the sequel, it is not worth it at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5374383">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is a sensual feast that leaves me exhausted after a while, even more so than the first game, with a soundtrack that&apos;s even more driving and mesmerizing. The new characters add a lot of variety, but there are some serious balance issues going on and it detracts somewhat from the simplicity that made the first one so smooth. From tight, confined experience to broader and messier, there are still a lot of things here I enjoyed, but it&apos;s simply not as memorable as the first game and remains one for the fans who want a little more. Non-essential gaming but intriguing for the curious and adrenaline-addicted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=5666016">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you played the first one - this one will not surprise you at all. It&apos;s essentially the same game with just a few mechanics added on top, a bit higher difficulty level, and a number of new levels. I think I preferred the original version as it felt fresh at the time. This one feels just like more of the same and while the game is well designed and plays well it lacks the novelty the previous title had.
<br>
<br>Graphically - this is very rough looking, gory 2D pixel art. The camera is constantly bobbing left and right in the rhythm of the music. Blood explodes violently, everything is extremely graphic and brutal. Although the resolution does not let you see the details it&apos;s still pretty gruesome. Did not enjoy the graphic style much, but got used to it in the end and it serves it&apos;s purpose just fine.
<br>
<br>The thing worth of note is definitely the soundtrack - it&apos;s just amazing to listen to even without playing the game. But fits very well - the game would not be half as good without it. It sets the tone and mood so well.
<br>
<br>Mechanically it&apos;s a very fast 2D action shooter. One you will die a lot. The levels are sort of a puzzle, you need to learn what route to take, and where to expect enemies. You need to decide which gun to take, and in which order to eliminate your opponents as this will dictate which new guns you will get. The ammo is very limited and therefore each shot counts.
<br>
<br>What Hotline Miami 2 introduces over the first installment is the need to play certain new characters. While mechanics in the first part were constant throughout the whole game - here you get a number of different playable characters, each that comes with a bit different qualities. For example you get to control a news reporter that throws away all guns until you kill two people with a bat or other blunt weapon or you get to control two brothers - one carrying chainsaw while the other one shoots. The new characters are interesting change to the game paste - but some of the levels seem unnecessarily difficult forcing you to play a certain way instead your own - especially the Vietnam ones, where you can&apos;t change weapon and it&apos;s really hard to get ammo.
<br>
<br>The story tries to be a bit more deep than the first one but I never played Hotline Miami for the story. It&apos;s the game play that sells this game - and it&apos;s still unique and plays so smooth. It&apos;s definitely worth picking up and giving it a go. If you&apos;ve never played the original one though I would recommend the first one over the second - as the game play does seem a bit more focused there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=7390792">Expand</a></span>

They made big corridors filled with enemies, who can shot better than we do. Even if they let us have some smaller rooms they instantly fill that with windows, making it painful to hide or fight with melee weapons. If I was killed by someone with melee I felt like it was my fault, but when w was shoot from across the map by an enemy, only because I wasn&apos;t  able to push trigger and bumper almost at the same time I felt that something was wrong. They also filled maps with gun only killable enemies so we HAVE TO use the guns, to get anywhere. Almost all of the last game bugs are back. They added way too much object that we can&apos;t run through but can shoot through.
<br>Mask mechanic is deleted, you can&apos;t collect them, you just have a character with 3-4 &quot;abilities&apos; to chose from (because sometimes they don&apos;t use masks at all) for me it is scandalous, they cut off a symbol of Hotline Miami. The story is still nice, although to understand it you still need to make an investigation. Overall, if you came here for good Hotline Miami, go back. It has its pluses and, just maybe, you&apos;ll like it more than. I don&apos;t recommend it as a game unless you&apos;re a really big fan of the last one and just have to experience it yourself instead of reading plot online.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=7493324">Expand</a></span>

This makes it a little boring and repetitive, though the levels they did right feel amazing along with cool new mask abilities when you get to use them.
<br>
<br>The story is pretty good but the writing is very corny, needed a lot more work. The art style is great as always and the music is even better than the first one, very well done in that regard. Playing this game more for the ambiance and feel is definitely what you want to go for, the gameplay is fun and all, but if you&apos;re going strictly for gameplay stick with the first one. Worth the money no question, but a little disappointing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=6872272">Expand</a></span>

The magic of the first game seems to be lost in this sequel and there has been not much improvement to the gameplay, so the AI still glitch up sometimes, and killing an enemy can cause them to show up through the walls.</span>

<br>Especially those who say the plot is &quot;a mess&quot;, like the first one wasn&apos;t. You can explore the magnificent plot that is not given but has to be taken by the player.</span>

And step - kill the enemy with a gun stick - and pitch - &quot;put&quot; three - and pitch - the noise ran two more - finished. In this simple mechanics hidden unprecedented in its grandiosity game designer job. I do not remember a single mission, in which we would like to change something, &quot;that&apos;s the door to push a couple of centimeters&quot; and &quot;have enemies out well from the different parties, so it would be more fun&quot; - although usually such thoughts occur during the passage of any games. At the same time when you started to &quot;feel&quot; the rhythm of Hotline Miami, then I realized how simple and logical locations to make each and every srezhissirovanna shootout. And this simplicity is captivating. The Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number it is no more. There is only 2 reasons why I recommend this game. First, it&apos;s end of the HM story and second, Level Editor. Level Editor - it&apos;s a big, fat plus for this game. Do not play HM2 after you finish the story - play your own, or strangers campaings in Level Editor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=7609263">Expand</a></span>

But that in no way means that it&apos;s a bad game. It&apos;s a great game. Hotline Miami 2 doesn&apos;t have very good level design. That is the main issue. The game is great, but the levels aren&apos;t designed very good and it makes them much more difficult. There is still plenty of sections where melee is a viable option, but you will find yourself being pushed to use guns due to the wide open maps/levels. The soundtrack is still amazing, and if anything, it improved from the first game. It still has the same addictive, simple, and fun gameplay. The story is pretty good, and told well. I found myself actually feeling something for the characters at the end (I&apos;ll get back to the ending in a moment.) This is a game where it almost becomes better the more you play. Dead Ahead is a really long and difficult level in the middle of the game, and a lot of people really hate the level design on it, and I did too when I first played it then played it again on hard mode. But now, it&apos;s honestly one of my favorite levels, because I learned how to play the game &quot;right&quot;. This isn&apos;t a game where you take your time luring enemies to your cover spot, it&apos;s a game where you run out and try to get a huge combo line, and the game is much more enjoyable if you play that way. You most likely won&apos;t be having that much fun if you are just luring people to you and being as cautious as possible. I learned this. After I started playing the way I do now, I&apos;ve been loving it. Anyways, I&apos;m gonna move more into the soundtrack. It&apos;s phenomenal. The Hotline Miami series have some of the best video game soundtracks ever. Maybe just some of the best soundtracks. If you like synth music, then you&apos;ll definitely love the music in this game. Hotline Miami has showed me some of my now favorite music artists. Now here are where there are spoilers regarding the ending. Dennaton doesn&apos;t want to make another Hotline Miami game. They want it to be done and over with, which I respect them for. They want to make something that they&apos;re hearts are in, they don&apos;t want to just make these for money. That being said --(SPOILERS HERE STOP READING IF YOU HAVEN&apos;T PLAYED THE GAME.)
<br>
<br>--everybody dying in the end wasn&apos;t a bad ending. People said it was cheap and lazy. I don&apos;t believe that. It was actually pretty sad. I was actually surprised to see that this is the closest a game, or any piece of media for that matter, has gotten me to tears. I actually ended up liking these characters and feeling something for them, so watching them all be wiped away by a nuclear blast wasn&apos;t the happiest thing. It provided closure. It showed that this was it and that Hotline Miami was over. I loved this game and I would definitely recommend it to anyone (plus, if you like the game itself, you can play whole new levels with the level editor).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number/user-reviews?user_review_id=7531105">Expand</a></span>
