This game tends to make you go through many micro transactions just to get the same content, and apparently be better than others. Before Dec 1st I purchased a few weapons which were pretty decent, but were made well enough they weren&apos;t overpowered. Then after Dec 1st they changed all the weapons so they were much less than average. They gave all the players that had recently purchased weapons attachments that gave us our weapon back up to par. In a recent update on Dec 20th, they decided that because of their nerf of the standard weapons, they claimed our weapons were now overpowered. Instead of putting the weapons back the way they had before. They decided to make the already purchased weapons worth nothing... At the present time, all players are feeling cheated and scammed for their money. It&apos;s a disgrace to the formerly renowned company EA/EAsy and I have lost all trust in the business as a whole. I would not recommend you purchase anything from them, as at any time they can change the game content to what they see fit without giving any prior notice or compensation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-play4free/user-reviews?user_review_id=2055718">Expand</a></span>

It used to be an ok game. After the December 2011 updates, there is no balance, and playing is a hair-pulling frustrating experience. As a free player, you use very stripped down weapons, but can rent very over-powered boosters. As a paying player, you can buy weapons, but as the Dec 20th update demonstrates, these can be taken back from you by the developers at their whim. All in all, it&apos;s free, but as soon as it&apos;s not (you buy credits), it&apos;s no longer worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-play4free/user-reviews?user_review_id=2055623">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I suggest staying well clear of this game. The developers cheat players out of their money by selling in-game content which they later change to much inferior versions without any compensation to the customers under the pretense of &apos;balancing the game&apos; just to try and get more money out of them. Stay away from this and any other EAsy titles.</span>

Ive played this game since the first day, and its no longer a play for free game, more like a dump 100$ into various guns just to get a head advantage. In irony, the games company EAsy have taken away weapons purchases when promised to &quot;last forever&quot; two times, one with holosight guns. Basically a holosight gun was just a great gun with little recoil and had a red dot sight, but those guns were taken away after an update that lets you customize your gun. With this update the attachments and customizations are BF buy able, and will not last forever, i believe only up to 7 days. And after that, the company did it a 2nd time by taking away veteran and elite guns, most over bought and expensive guns, and gave people no BF refund, instead a low performance gun that&apos;s recoil makes it unbearable. The game has cheated people of their money buy taking away their good guns and giving them something horrid to play with, in other words its like buying a fancy sports car then in a few days they gave you a plastic foot powered car for 5 year old and took away your sports car. This game is nearly a rip off of BF2 and the company running the game cannot be trusted for they repeat their &quot;mistakes&quot; and take peoples money away. If you want a balanced game, run by a trustworthy company, with fair game play that doesn&apos;t involve paying 20$ for a gun that&apos;s decent, this is not your destination, i do not recommend playing this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-play4free/user-reviews?user_review_id=2056937">Expand</a></span>

Furthermore the attachments aren&apos;t permanent so you have to continuously spend money on the game to use them. They promised no more then a month ago that, with the introduction of their new, apparently improved, changes that those who actually forked out money to buy their &apos;elite&apos; weapons will not lose them. They have basically destroyed what was a great game by &apos;stealing&apos; money off the majority of the player base and going back on promises made to those same customers that keep them in a job.
<br>
<br>I seriously recommend not playing this game as next the Developers will probably take away the apparel that customers have payed for, on their characters which makes them unique, and change them to beggars rags or the equivalent like they have done with their weapons. Probably also make you have to pay to play on their game maps as well, or you can only play in a simple 12m x 12m box or something ridiculous like that</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-play4free/user-reviews?user_review_id=2056940">Expand</a></span>

The new weapon doesn&apos;t have near the ammo capacity, hit damage or stability that the one I originally bought had. The recoil is way off, you take an additional 3 to 4 seconds to reacquire your target if he/she hasn&apos;t moved (which they do 99.9% of the time). EAsy claims they did this to make the game more balanced. Take my advise, if you decide to play this game, do not and I mean DO NOT purchase any additional content. Especially if you buy the item &quot;Forever&quot; because its does not stay that way &quot;Forever&quot;. EAsy will change it so that it&apos;s not the same as you originally purchased it. Buyer Beware!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-play4free/user-reviews?user_review_id=2057178">Expand</a></span>

They have been obstructive and condescending about this theft, one posted on twitter that &apos;You bought a gun, you still have a gun&apos; .  These new guns have stats nerfed 40/50% and massive recoil, they also switched on permanent camera shake to throw the aim further (but are claiming it&apos;s glitch they are unable to fix) - then introduced new hireable gun upgrades to compensate for these changes it now costs around &#xA3;30 per month to get your gun back to nearly the same stats you paid &#xA3;10 to supposedly have permanently. This cynical theft they are claiming will improve game balance??!? improve proffits more likely, do not spend any real money on this or any other EA/EAsy games, flush it down the toilet - it&apos;s quicker and you won&apos;t feel so cheated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-play4free/user-reviews?user_review_id=2059026">Expand</a></span>

All of them happened before the &quot;weapon customization system&quot; came and then the great 20th of december scam. They expect us to pay an average of  $10  US  a day for their weapon costumization to be able to have a decent gun. Even worse they dont reward with any good amount of in-game currency to play the game freely. Combat Arms had the Gear Points that allowed free players to play and play and play without a problem , because they were rewarded in a good amount if you played for a few matches. (I loved that and I ended up buying some NX to thank the developers for that ) Alliance of Valliant Arms provided us with &quot;EUROS&quot; and other ways to obtain them through achievements , and even a permanent gun from the begining of the game so &quot;free &quot; players could keep playing competitively. There were also a few extras that encouraged gamers to get their G coins. But free players were able to keep up and keep on playing ( I also bought their currency to thank them for that)
<br>
<br>Battlefield Play4free ..... ok here we go.
<br>
<br>Free Players are given a basic weapon from the begining , but those weapons are terribly underpowered and truly useless.
<br>Players are awarded credits every game , but only an average of 5-50 credits per game , 80 if you are the MVP and your team wins. And matches are sometimes 15 minutes long. You cant make use of the weapon costumization system unless you own a permanent gun . Permanent weapons range from 45&apos;000 to 90&apos;000 credits each. You dont get credits for leveling up or anything else rather than for playing a game. Renting guns per day range from 300 all the way to 7500 credits, but even like that you cant &quot;costumize the weapon&quot; and receive a terrible weapon with massive recoil, no damage , and mag capacity of 24 bullets on most guns.
<br>Even if you got a permanent weapon , decent &quot;mods&quot; cost at least 1000 credits. There are barrel mods, mag mods, and stock upgrades. There are also holographic sights but are exclusive for Battlefunds users.
<br>So at the end of the day you would need an average of 3000 credits per day for your weapon (if you even managed to get 45000 credits at least) to be able to kill someone without moving your mouse all over the place and tapping it like a pro. There are also boosters available so you can get equipment to work properly. But it also costs from 350 for vehicle upgrades (simply to make them resist more damage) and 750-2500 for inantry and equipment boosters PER DAY!
<br>There are also armors and &quot;uniforms &quot;  but are also exclusive for battlefunds users. Simply put you pretty much need to buy their Battlefund currency in order to play the game
<br>
<br>Im sure people that bought Battlefunds can explain you all the flaws , problems and Scams they suffer from. Conclusion. This game is really bad , unless the developers do something for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-play4free/user-reviews?user_review_id=2068540">Expand</a></span>

Everything is rented by the day at an absurd price, and if you want to buy permanent weapons it will cost you an arm and a leg. The most recent update nerfed all the guns that people PAID for with money and brought them down to regular free gun status. This game is Play4Free, Pay4Fun.</span>

<br>Electronic Arts is more interested in getting their hooks into kids` wallets than on improving the game or doing anything useful with this, supposedly free, game. Their latest blunder was plain bait and switch: they sold a gazillion permanent weapons and then nerfed the specs months after the fac on permanent items, while introducing new system instability and overpowered options. They are constantly destabilizing the game with insane tweaks that make no sense except to make some of the user base feel like they have inadequate weapons or features so they are forced to buy new items or upgrade old ones. In summary it was a game with a lot of promise but inderneath the thin veneer of  `free` lies the putrid reality of greedy developers who like to get paid for not fixing the game. They call them bugs, I call it getting paid in spite of not doing your job. On top of all that, the items got absurdly expensive and playability isn`t there unless you actually pay through the nose for things that used to be free or reasonably priced and accessible to the vast majority of players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-play4free/user-reviews?user_review_id=2064772">Expand</a></span>

This is what killed the game for many people.<br>If the developers would take the game back to how it was before 20 December 2011 my rating will go from 0/10 to 9/10.</span>

Us long-term players had bought weapons which were taken from us, worked to unlock training points which were then removed, spent hours accumulating XP which then just &quot;vanished&quot; overnight. They continue to make it harder to level up, with well over 500k XP separating some levels (and an average earn of 2-4k per round), and even harder to play off the &quot;free&quot; currency of &quot;Credits&quot;, as they removed the bonus from when you level up, reduced how many you get a round, and upped the price of everything.<br><br>I understand that business is business, but this is just ridiculous.

During the times between 30th November 2010 and 14th September 2011 I could give it a rating of 8 or even a 9 out of 10!<br><br>But on the day 25th October 2011, EASY introduced Tier 3 (it expanded the training tree, which gave more gadgets and other stuff, like C4, Mortar Strike, XM25 Airburst Grenade Launcher, a Flare for the Medic class which would made urself and friendlies spawn on it every time they did to increase the teamwork in the game, but could also be destructible, etc.), but they also introduced boosters, like RPG booster, Anti Tank Mine booster, Claymore booster, Grenade booster, etc. which, when purchased, by virtual money gained while playing the game (Credits) or by real life money (Battlefunds), increased greatly the stats of those gadgets/weapons, which actually made RPG and Mortar Strike OP, but also nerfed the same gadgets/weapons when without boosters, which then made it literally impossible to kill with Grenades and Claymores, even when enemies are hit by 2 of them. This greatly damaged a great  game, and at that time I&apos;d just give it a 6, maybe 7 out of 10.<br><br>Then, on 1st December, EASY introduced weapon customizations, which the community had been asking since almost the beginning of this game. Yet, this wasn&apos;t what the community asked for. This &quot;update&quot; nerfed all guns, the recoil is literally now bigger than in all other games and even real life! Also, the accuracy of the guns now is just unrecognizable, they basically fail at LR (Long Range) now and most guns have the bullet count as 20 per magazine, LMGs with 60 or 80 per magazine, and in total, M95 (a .50 cal sniper rifle) has just 12 bullets, except sniper rifles and pistols. Another problem is that EASY released this too soon, so they didn&apos;t include shotguns and pistols on the customization system (thank god), which made them even OP. Also, the community didn&apos;t ask for this weapon customization system because this just allowed to purchase &quot;boosters&quot; like way improved stocks, ammo and barrels, which you need to pay for to get the gun nearly how it was before, yet it was still much better before. What the community asked for were simple things like optics (ACOGs, Scopes, RDS, etc.), foregrips, suppresors, flash suppresors, maybe even different kinds of ammo for shotguns (like 12G Buckshot, 12G Slugs, etc.)! Fortunately, EASY also gave players who purchased guns, before 1st December 2011, legacy attachments, in which the point of them was giving the guns the power they had before that date. Yet these were bugged, causing them to be MUCH more powerful than before. For example, a M95 with legacy attachments, from rly far (like in 250 meters away) doing 83 damage when hitting any body part except the head, where before it just hitted about 60 or 65 damage maximum. Maybe I&apos;d still give a 1 or 2 out of 10 by that time.<br>On 20th December 2011, EASY removed these legacy attachments from the game, and gave the players with the legacy attachments the same guns they had before with a &quot;+3&quot; after their name. These weapons just had more 2 damage at all ranges than their base model (probably a bug, since by logic, they should deal more 3 damage). Yet, these ones still are as awful as their base models. The accuracy, recoil and bullet count of these are still just awful, and those were the things that most matter in a gun, not the dmg (maybe except in shotguns and some pistols), and EASY just ruined them, by simply NOT listening to ALL the community, from the  freeloaders (players who just play without wasting money on the game) to the ones who even pay $50/&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-play4free/user-reviews?user_review_id=2089343">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Alright, I&apos;m not going to lie: this game is pay to win. With &quot;permanent&quot; weapon unlocks taking a minimum of 17500 credits to buy, and the better ones taking up to 90000, the system basically shoves the need to buy premium currency (BattleFunds) straight up your arse. Add to the fact that there are insane, utterly OP boosters up for grabs for the right amount of Funds, and you have a game where every newbie gets steamrolled from the moment they spawn in. Coupled with the arduous leveling system, taking hours and hours of playing time to level up, and you&apos;ll get frustrated pretty quick.
<br>
<br>The class system of BFP4F is also quite convoluted and annoying. You cannot switch loadouts or classes during a match, and thus must exit the server in order to change your weapons, apparel, or class. Also, you start with two free soldier slots and must buy extra slots (with *sigh* BattleFunds) in order to have all four classes on one account. This can be easily remedied by creating multiple accounts, however.
<br>
<br>All this being said, there are good things to say about this game as well. First of all, the gameplay is quite fast-paced and realistic, leaving you aching for the respawn timer to count down and soaring with glee after every kill. The graphics are pretty nice if your computer can handle them, which is always a plus. Lastly, the physics and playstyle of the game do require a certain amount of learning and skill, no matter whether you hold a level 1 or 30 weapon in your hands.
<br>
<br>My verdict? BFP4F is worth a try, but don&apos;t expect to be able to fully enjoy the game without paying through the nose in $$$</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-play4free/user-reviews?user_review_id=4386184">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>The game was pretty good till they updated it on 20/12/2011. All players who bought veteran weapons &quot;last forever&quot; were literals robbed from their money as they replaced the weapons with other with different characteristic. Now, until you rent add on for your weapon, it is impossible to play as they balanced the weapons to be useless without spending constantly money. Another big fail for EA</span>

You have to pay pretty much to do anything IE, if you want a granade to do more than 25 damage to a person you have to spend a decent amount of money to make it actually work.  Total garbage game.</span>

<br>
<br>The entire game is subject to change, logic indicates that a more powerful weapon costs more money, but this power is then reduced to free choice by the developers, at this moment, for buyers of shotguns  its being discussed to reduce power shotguns, as well as it was with rifles, RPG Mortar Strike and others, for this game the money of the players does not matter anymore, is a total lack of respect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-play4free/user-reviews?user_review_id=2287078">Expand</a></span>

I have to give credit where credit is due- the game itself is good.  The graphics are a bit lacking, but there are a lot of weapons with decent variety, the weapons are well balanced (with some notable, but not game-breaking exceptions), the maps are varied, and the vehicles are really fun once you learn them.  The main thing people dislike is that on December 20th, EA nerfed a lot of overpowered premium guns to put them more on par with the F2P weapons.  From my standpoint as a player who has invested (probably too much) money into this game, I didn&apos;t really notice the changes to my guns that much and I read the EA TOS where they clearly state that the game is in beta and even premium weapons are subject to balance changes.  Honestly, it was either balance the game by nerfing the premium weapons, or drive away all the frustrated free players.  Beyond that, I think that EA has for the most part responded to complaints of the community on the game&apos;s glaring issues: the USAS (1 shot kill capable and 4 shots per second in a 12 round magazine), the boosted Mortar Strike (basically 3-10 free kills every time it went off cooldown) along with other broken aspects of gameplay were fixed, and they release interesting new content daily.  In terms of the game being Pay2Win as opposed to Free2Play, the new attachment system definitely makes it lean towards Pay2Play.  The attachments essentially bring the nerfed premium guns I mentioned before nearly up to their pre-nerf levels, for a rather large price.  However, I have to admit that the attachments (Scope, Stock, Barrel, Magazine, and Camo) definitely add a level of variety and customization that the game did not previously have.  For example, you can take your semi automatic M110 sniper rifle and optimize it for long range, with a powerful scope, high damage, and range increasing attachments, or you can attach a no-zoom red dot sight and recoil reduction attachments and run around having a good time at close to medium range.  I would also like to point out that when EA first released scoped weapons as separate weapons, many people who had already purchased non-scoped permanent version begged EA to release an attachment system, and EA responded to the community and voila!  Going back to P2W vs F2P, it&apos;s true that in terms of general weapons, a player with deep pockets will have an advantage.  And yet the default guns are fine, and a skilled player can curbstomp the full attachments premium weapons player just by aiming better, without even spending any money, in-game or IRL.  Without attachments, all the other weapons are more about variety than power.  Not only that, but you can get ridiculous kill/death ratios on the order of 60-5 or more without spending a cent or using a weapon with attachments because there aren&apos;t really any premium upgrades to vehicles, and this is one place where I think the game really shines.  The vehicles in this game are very well done.  The ground based vehicles are mostly about brute strength and armor; they are meant to take hits and will take hits.  They don&apos;t require much know-how to drive, and can be defeated by a few well placed RPG&apos;s or can turn the game around for the driver&apos;s teammates.  The air vehicles have a much steeper learning curve and new players will crash a lot unless they practice on empty servers, and the air vehicles can also be destroyed very quickly, especially by APC&apos;s.  However the risk is rewarded by much more devastating weapons than ground vehicles, and they are quite maneuverable so that if you know what you are doing you can avoid damage in many situations.  However, I wouldn&apos;t call them overpowered because AA emplacements and APC&apos;s can very quickly destroy air vehicles as long as your team knows to use these to their advantage.  My main point here is that without paying a cent you can stick to vehicle maps, and with enough skill, top the charts every game.  In conclusion, I would say that the game is surprisingly balanced considering EA&apos;s money-grabbing agenda.  The engine and graphics are below par but if you get used to them they don&apos;t subtract from the gameplay, nonetheless those are in my opinion the game&apos;s biggest cons.  I really enjoy the variety of weapons and attachments, and for awhile I myself played entirely Free2Play and I still enjoyed that experience.  One thing is for certain though- just because you are F2P doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t do well at this game, but throw enough money at it and it&apos;s depth and customization are increased tenfold without making you an unstoppable killing machine.  I suggest ignoring most of these pointless rage spam reviews and giving the game a try- it definitely has it&apos;s flaws but even for 20 bucks you can buy a bunch of permanent guns and have a good time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-play4free/user-reviews?user_review_id=2670318">Expand</a></span>

Every server can hold 32 players and all maps have the same gamemode: conquest. Conquest is about capturing flags and reaching 1000 points. There&apos;s no time limit and killing enemies doesn&apos;t raise the points of your team.<br>Capture flags, defend them and you win the match. At the end of the match you recieve XP and credits. Your XP helps you to level up and unlock different skills, also specific skills for every class (recon, assault, medic, engineer). Credits are used to rent better guns for a limited time (1 day) or buy bandages.<br><br>The game has pros and cons just like any other game. For the sake of simplicity I will continue with a pros-cons list:<br>PROs:<br>- It&apos;s free. Money isn&apos;t the only way to have fun and to become a good player.<br>- Graphics are pretty decent.<br>- Good mixture of maps. 2 infantry maps and 4 vehicle maps, 3 of those have jets.<br>- Balanced maps. Flags are placed in places that are as hard to take as hard to defend.<br>- Useful skills and redistributable skill points.<br>- Fast paced action, even when servers are half empty.<br>- Every map has needs a different strategy.<br>- Money can&apos;t replace skill.<br>- Weapons are rather balanced. If you want high damage you will need to sacrifice some accuracy and suffer from more recoil.<br>- Vehicles! Jeeps, APCs, tanks, attack helis, transport helis, jets, boats, you name it. It&apos;s pure fun fun and fun. And none of them are overpowered.<br>- You can&apos;t hurt teammates. I think this is rather a pro than a con because there are a lot of crowded and small maps where shooting first, asking questions later is the only way to survive.<br><br>CONs:<br>- Zero teamplay. Seriously. None. Miracles can happen of course. Your best bet is playing with friends using teamspeak.<br>- You can add &quot;friends&quot; and see them which server they are playing on at the moment, but there are no special markings for &quot;friends&quot; on the battlefield! You can&apos;t make a difference between them and other teammate, only when they are almost next to you and the game shows their name above their head.<br>- No voicechat.<br>- The game needs more action emotes. There&apos;s no way to tell someone to follow you, to stay together, or you need reinforcements. How do you coordinate an attack then?<br>-  Players tend to forget about the game is about capturing flags. this could ruin the whole experience.<br>- Sometimes teams are way unbalanced. A team with 11 (out of 16 teammembers) rooftop camping recons(snipers) versus a team with 3 recons on a CQC infantry map is a ticket to ragequit.<br>- Too much hate and bad language on the chat. Sometimes I think everyone playing has tourette syndrome.<br>- Selfish players. Someone sees a jeep? Sprints there and takes it all alone, then gets shot in the face while trying to capture a flag by himself. Repeats it several times.<br>- Medics tend to forget they are medics and don&apos;t heal, don&apos;t revive teammates. Same goes for engineers.<br>- Very low magazine capacity, which leads to the frequent reload of your gun.<br>- Players don&apos;t check the minimap. You can pinpoint the location of an enemy capturing your flag, most of your teammates will probably ignore it. And sometimes attack helis will just launch all of their missiles at a friendly vehicle or group of soldiers just because they don&apos;t check their targets on the minimap first.<br>- Bugs and sudden disconnections.<br>All in all i like this game. It has maps for every style of players, jet pilots, tank drivers, camper noob recon fa... I mean stealthy snipers and machinegun wielding Rambos a like. If you learn to adapt to the features of the game you can become a pretty good player and enjoy every battle.<br>But don&apos;t forget! It&apos;s just a game! :-)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-play4free/user-reviews?user_review_id=2114803">Expand</a></span>

The game has so many options to customize your soldier with weapons, attachments, or clothing that you could play a different one every time you went on there is you like. There is little to no hacker abuse and the community is mostly positive. I personally love this game and will continue to support it.</span>
