Gameplay tends to be slow, with combat changing the player&apos;s fortune rather quickly.  Players can design their own units using a palette of weapons and armor collected and/or researched, but the collection of the components, the number of them, and the relative lack of healing units ensure a fairly tedious cycle of build -&gt; combat -&gt; build again.  Heroes are merely super-powered infantry without much in the way of strategic abilities nor even token personalities, which was a disappointment for me.
<br>
<br>All in all, it&apos;s an &apos;OK&apos; budget game by a budget studio, but don&apos;t expect the few novel ideas in the game to carry the day.  Experienced strategy gamers will certainly be disappointed and strategy beginners are better served by higher quality titles even if they aren&apos;t quite as cheap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/great-war-nations-the-spartans/user-reviews?user_review_id=2602068">Expand</a></span>
