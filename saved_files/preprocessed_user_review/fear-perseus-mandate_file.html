<br>
<br>So underrated game !!!
<br>I enjoy this expansion more than F.E.A.R vanila.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+great level design. Best so far. I haven&apos;t play FEAR 2 and 3 yet.
<br>+new weapons
<br>+great graphic. Evan for today standards. No blur, bloom, HDR to cover imperfections. Great textures.
<br>+it has more feeling than FEAR + EP
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- few enemy types.</span>

<br>
<br>I recently wanted to play F.E.A.R. again but didn&apos;t want to go through the same story over. When I read the plot of this expansion, and how it took place during the events of the original I figured I would give it a go. I fell in love with this just as I did the original F.E.A.R. It is a great fun shooter that I would look forward to playing each day when I got home. Now that I have beaten it I still want more, time to try Extraction Point I guess.
<br>
<br>The bad reviews mostly talk about how it is too similar and used a dated engine with old graphics. In 2013 I am not playing F.E.A.R. for its HD visuals (though it doesn&apos;t look bad in 1920x1080), and more of the same is exactly what I wanted. I could see back in 07 when this expansion was full price why some may be turned off, but for those looking to re-live the joy of the original F.E.A.R. but wanting a new story getting this on a steam sale for pennies is swell worth the  and time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-perseus-mandate/user-reviews?user_review_id=2971364">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> I was happy with this game, it did seem to not be as well made as the other two games. The AI at times is laughable. The story how ever is the strongest in this game of the entire series. If you loved FEAR you will love this as well. If you have never played FEAR before, you probably should look elsewhere for a FPS.</span>

Graphics are somewhat dated, but the game doesn&apos;t really suffer from it, and the bullet-time effects and blood splatter still look great. The story is engaging and is a worthy expansion to the FEAR universe. As stated, great value for money.</span>

It looks worse then the original game, which came out in 2005, and is a total rip off at $30. The multiplayer is more or less the same as FEAR and FEAR combat, except less people are playing. All in all the game is pretty poor and very boring.</span>

There are some good ideas, especially at the end of the game but suddenly, everything is ridiculously left out like developpers was facing a dead end or out of imagination. The 3D engine is totally unfitted to hudge outdoor environments which look more than ever generic and recycled from previous F.E.A.R. Some textures still look good, others are terrible or ugly. Combats are as usual nice and sometimes funny but new weapons won&apos;t change the fact that the gameplay is repetitive and boring at the end. Bottom line : it&apos;s time for F.E.A.R to end this painful and still unexplained story. $29.95 is somewhere a total rip off for your wallet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-perseus-mandate/user-reviews?user_review_id=404832">Expand</a></span>

Whenever I hear some talking about the &quot;engine&quot; being the problem, I know there is something wrong (these are the idiots who still say they play Half Life 1 all the time). Plain and simple, this is a nice shooter for the FEAR series. I still had fun, and still enjoyed the FEAR style gameplay. The latter half of the game had some really spooky weird guys in the floor too! Yes, the scenery looks similar (it is FEAR for goodness sake) but the abandoned subway/city is really cool (I wanted more of that). And the new assault rifle is pretty nice too. The new weapons are not earth shattering, but they are decent, especially the new assault rifle. As usual, reviews are all over the place. What do people want anyway. These are the same folks who said Crysis was amazing, and most of the customer reviews said quite the opposite. Oh well, never believe what you read on the internet I guess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-perseus-mandate/user-reviews?user_review_id=407467">Expand</a></span>

You get some great new characters, weapons, enemies, all that fun stuff. I think the metascore for this is too low.

Released 2 years after the original FEAR, Perseus Mandate shows now effort to introduce anything new to the series. You get 3 or 4 new weapons and a couple new enemy types but everything else is the same. The levels are repetitive and there is still grey everywhere.

So there&#x2019;s more of the tense, spooky atmosphere and more of the enjoyable combat (the slo-mo is still great fun). The graphics appear unaltered, but it&#x2019;s not bad looking for a game for its age. It does, however, suffer from a lacklustre first half, after which the pace and atmosphere suddenly ratchet up a notch and the game comes to life. It&#x2019;s still very much a corridor shooter, with little variation in environment. But it&#x2019;s the atmosphere and combat that make the FEAR games, and once again FPM delivers in both areas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-perseus-mandate/user-reviews?user_review_id=5373467">Expand</a></span>
