And the name Prince of Persia does not belong to this game, it belongs to the 1989 Prince of Persia. Now that was a good game, not like this crap.</span>

<br>ABSTRACT: This game is a 100/100, although I liked, nothing m disappointed, now you can find for less than $ 20, you know, buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=4100475">Expand</a></span>

But what makes it stand out for me so much is that when you make the biggest game decision you never question your choice or it&apos;s outcome and you accept all consequences while saying &quot;It was all worth it&quot; and spilling a little tear at the end. The biggest pleasure i got was AFTER i finished the game and realized what was it about and why things happened how they happened. Its a masterpiece. Simple, but it doesn&apos;t have to be difficult to be good. Its a perfect example of story-based video games that actually put a &quot;story&quot; and a &quot;video game&quot; not running along but depending on each other 100%.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2804585">Expand</a></span>

All I can say the graphics and the non existent DRM are the only positive things I can say about the this game, and I am a huge fan of PoP way back since the first game.<br>First the game, easy, way too easy, highly repetitive and short. You basically run around in various environments and the visually very appealing jump and run sequences basically are a hit the displayed button within 5 seconds quicktime event. The puzzles which always have been one hallmark of pop are virtually non existent, and the boss fights are constantly over and over again to be done. Worse every boss has to be defeated 5 times, 4 of the times there is literally no change in pace or strategy.<br>The non dying is not the worst design decision in the game, there are others way worse.<br><br>Add to that that the voice actors now come with disney like american accents and you have the perfect Prince of Persia designed by marketing droids, where the gameplay simply was forgotten, or there was forgotten that there was a game at all, hence I am giving this game a score of 2, both points for the visual appealing presentation and non existent DRM.  Too bad that the game was forgotten behind the presentation.<br><br>All I can say is games industry, please stop trying to design your games after marketing peoples demands and start again to design games. For me this game was enough reason to quite the series for now, maybe the latest PoP is better, but I am taking an absence from PoP!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=1528720">Expand</a></span>

Prince of Persia puts you in an amazingly beautiful universe: the one that you cannot forget after playing the game. Contrary to what a lot of players think, the game is not easy; it isn&apos;t hard as well, but difficult enough to force you to redo a few checkpoints. There are some sequences that are simply epic. The ones where you&apos;re wondering why they are so short, the ones where you actually go back just to feel that sensation again. The complicity between the prince and Elika is very touching: everything in the game, maybe besides some dialogs, are going towards this. Every move that involves both characters tends perfectly to create a unique atmosphere throughout the game.<br><br>However, the ending of the game (that I will not reveal here) is really disappointing in my opinion: it goes against everything that is built during the whole adventure, and I felt it did not really fit in the story, thus the score. Even though it is poetic, it doesn&apos;t have the depth of other adventure games. Despite a very good (but quite easy) last battle, Prince of Persia doesn&apos;t really end what it has started and will leave a unpleasant taste of unfinished story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=1749532">Expand</a></span>

But it quickly starts dragging. There are 20 main levels plus 4 boss levels. Every single one of them is super repetitive. Not to mention the fact that you have to go through each level twice in order to pick up all the light seeds after you cleanse the level. The fights are also boring and repetitive and completely lacking in challenge, given the fact that you cannot die. If you happen to mess up and get &quot;killed,&quot; you are saved by your companion, the opponent regains some health, and the fight continues. So in summary, for about 30 minutes the game is fun. The visuals are nice, the controls are simple, the camera works decently (occasional screwiness, but on the whole, satisfying). But the repetitiveness, lack of excitement and challenge, the prevalence of annoying and contrived obstacles, and the poor quality of combat drags it all down very quickly. I&apos;m not sure how it got so many high scores from the critics. Perhaps they played it for less than an hour.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=423256">Expand</a></span>

Ehhhhhh.... this is really hard for me to answer. I was one of those who read the reviews and was like, this is just too easy, Ubisoft went too far and this game is basically a quick time event made into 12 hours. At least in Assassin&apos;s Creed they let you chose your own missions and fight multiple enemies at once, this game seems more like a movie with minimal input from the player.<br><br>While I would still say the game is a bit simplified and easy, I had a great time playing it and really feel glad I decided to give it a try, cause the experience is pretty awesome. The graphics and overall craftsmanship of the levels is really well done. You can tell Ubisoft believed this is a AAA game, cause it is very polished and beautiful to look at. Nothing you wouldn&apos;t expect from Ubisoft Montreal, guys behind Splinter Cell. The animations are just as fluid if not more so then Assassin&apos;s Creed, and the boss fights feel suitably epic.<br><br>The combat&apos;s pretty basic in nature and can devolve into quick time events, so it&apos;s not gonna be for a lot of people who want a challenge, but I was alright, since I don&apos;t play platformers as a general rule. And the no death aspect of the game, which a lot of people have complained about, was actually a game design choice that made sense to me when I played through it. Instead of quicksaving every 5 steps like in other games, you can just die by falling off a ledge and there&apos;ll be a quick 3 second animation and boom, you&apos;re right back on solid ground before the mistimed ledge jump. It really takes the frustration part out of platforming and sorta compels you to keep progressing. So ultimately, it just gets rid of the F9 quickload and isn&apos;t really any easier then other games, it&apos;s just presented in a different fashion.<br><br>What really stands out is the beauty of the various levels and the interaction between the two main characters, leading to the ending... which I absolutely love. It&apos;s powerful and moving and depressing but inevitable and **** brilliant. Ubisoft was sending a very meta message with that and I like how it makes a complete fool out of all the people who are complaining about it.<br><br>Ultimately, I can&apos;t really recommend you pay 60 bucks for the game, because the gameplay really isn&apos;t deep enough to justify it. The ease and quick time events... let&apos;s be honest, this is not Game of the Year material. However, if you can rent it for your console, or... obtain the PC version somehow, you&apos;ll be able to play it through in 2 or 3 days and have a very rewarding experience, I feel.<br><br>Maybe worth it for 40 bucks, which I hear they&apos;ve dropped it to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=1762596">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game basicly destroyed almost every aspect of Prince of Persia I enjoyed for the past years.
<br>From basicly the first second I was feeling like a useless addition to the entire story. There&apos;s nothing left of the epic prince I remember. You&apos;re wining little prick that carries a magical princess through the entire country. I thought it was maybe just for the start of the game but I ended up not feeling epic a single second in this game. The game should in my opinion be called:
<br>&quot;Princess of Persia&quot; There&apos;s no serious fighting and you can&apos;t even die anymore.
<br>It became a nice looking platformer for kids. For anyone new to prince of persia and is not looking for serious action, this game might not be as bad as I make it seem. For anyone used to the great action, fighting and challenges from the PoP series, this game will bring nothing but disappointment.

YES,  this game has it&apos;s flaws and (over) simplifications, but it is one of the most stunning and beautiful achievements in next gen platforming games. I expect a game to show me something I have never seen before, this game does it in spades every time I play it. Thank you Ubisoft.</span>

I don&apos;t understand all those bad user ratings, I guess it&apos;s all about how you see things. I simply don&apos;t find anything rewarding or challenging about dying and starting back at the beginning of something, that for me is repetitive. The level design is breathtaking, truly the best I&apos;ve seen this year. The environment is always changing and the graphics are stunning!! Again the best I seen this year.. I ware about on foot just to admire everything, I thought the prince was fast and thank god for that magic guide cause this place is huge. The fights are not without challenge since if you can&apos;t master the combos and blocks you&apos;ll be stuck fighting those bosses forever, some took me too long and gave me frustrations... It is true like some said that this pop offers a less stressful experience in button mashing mastery but it didn&apos;t bothered me at all and I loved every aspect of this game. The story was amazing and if it annoys you, you don&apos;t even have to go through it since you are the one starting most of the conversations. The POP franchise was due for a revamp and I think they did a fantastic job.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=741725">Expand</a></span>

I dunno! I&apos;m just gonna call it Prince of Persia: The Fallen King because that sounds better to me! Enough about the title and to the game. The gameplay is simple and requires little dexterity to use but quite a while to truly master. It is alot easier than the Sands of Time trilogy (or quadrilogy including Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands) due to the fact that you can&apos;t die. Your hot companion will always save you which actually took alot of frustration off of this game for me! The graphics are absolutely stunning with an anime approach to visuals and character design. There are 20 areas and 4 bosses and each area must be purged of its corruption and bosses need to be killed. Simple! Some areas are obviously focused on more than others gameplay wise but they offer some originality to the others. Each area is individually designed (talking about graphics here) to have a different experience to them. The combat in this game can be quite easy as it is a 1 Vs. Prince combo based game with stunning over-the-top animations that really suit the games style! Overall, if you&apos;re a Prince of Persia fan, get this game, and if you aren&apos;t well... Get it anyway! My only main con I can find is the ending got me so angry because after all that effort of me purging the lands the Prince just goes and-oh right!

Yes, moving quickly through levels feels good, but the Prince&apos;s movements are blocky and feel absolutely catered to the lowest possible difficulty. Additional gameplay mechanics added later in the game add a token amount of fun, but end up being frustrating more often than not. There is no way to &quot;fail&quot; in combat or moving through the world, so there is a continual feel of a safety net, and the only real perk to proficiency is preventing yourself a vast amount of annoyance. Furthermore, the story bears exceptionally minimal relevence to the character that is the Prince of Persia, except for a handful of lines scattered throughout the game. I do not suggest it for anyone who appreciates the history of the franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=421126">Expand</a></span>

The Prince was pretty cool in all of the previous games but this makes him look like a funny joker with a new girlfriend.

Maybe i didnt give it enough time?(rhetorical question and the answers no) If a game fails to entertain, then it fails.</span>

The meat and bones of the game, the acrobatic platforming, seems to be pushed a bit over the top with the inclusion of ceiling-running and completly unnecessary power-plate system, but overall turns out to be quite ejoyable. Ubisofts attempt at making the gameplay more streamlined is to be applauded, but it doesn&apos;t mean it turned out for the better - the lack of punishment for failing with little reward for succeess makes the gameplay boring and uneventful for the more experienced players, while providing little incentive in the form of reward for newcomers. Ubisoft is to be thanked for giving other game devs this lesson - attempts at streamlining the gameplay are needed and good, but they shouldn&apos;t look quite just like in this new PoP. Ubisofts fault is in another thing - being stuch to their gameplay design techniques that induce an illusion of freedom and a lot of repetition. This is present since the Assasin&apos;s Creed, and while PoP isn&apos;t as bad as the abovementioned, it isn&apos;t good either. The narrative is terribly cliched and compared to the gem that was the Sands of Time, turns out bland. Hovewer there is a potential for a great fairy tale to be told in the esthetics of the gorgeous graphics - it needs more &quot;magic&quot; to it though. And certainly more diversified dialogues delivered by more fleshed out, complex characters, as americanised accent and their almost sitcom style were really the thing that bothered me the most about the way narrative was presented. Overall though, the ending of the game was very enjoyable, if not unexpected, and provides a good premise for inevitable sequel(s). To sum up: a beautifull, inspired world, slightly too easy and repetitive gameplay, and cliche-ridden narrative that manages to come to its own at the end of the game. It&apos;s no Sands of Time but still quite enjoyable entertainment, if you don&apos;t set your expectations too high.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=421265">Expand</a></span>

The game drops you off into the tutorial, where you&apos;re not really entirely sure what&apos;s going on, which is fine for a tutorial. This, however, becomes an issue when you finish the tutorial and all of a sudden the real story starts without any explanation. Even that was forgivable to me before I realized, just after the first fertile ground, that the gameplay was going to whittle down to the following: 1. Perform easy series of jumps and flips to climb to the Fertile Ground. 2. Fight easy boss with easily executed combos and easily timed counters (By checking your combo list, you can easily find the one combo with the most hits, and keep trying to use it until the boss stops parrying your sword attacks; The combo itself will take a good 3/4 health from most bosses.) 3. Collect as many random &quot;Light Seeds&quot; as you can. 4. Rinse and repeat. So, not feeling engaged in the story and seeing the repetitive gameplay as a problem, I turned the game off and went on about my life. Two weeks later, however, I turned the game back on and played for a few hours, just to give the game a second chance. Somehow, my impression of the game was changed. While my initial statement that the game drops you off in the middle of the story with no real means to engage you stands strong, something about traveling along the (mostly) beautifully constructed landscapes to bash the brains out of the easy bosses became entertaining, and some of the later puzzles were even a little bit challenging. (Ok, one of them was a little bit challenging, but my point stands.) For the record, the never really ties itself up either. My main complaint with this game is the weak story telling, but if you enjoy a &quot;Push Button, Get Positive Response&quot; gameplay style, then go ahead and try this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=421302">Expand</a></span>

You can&apos;t die anymore. Elika will always save you and &quot;teleport&quot; you back. The Prince also does pretty much automatically compared to its prequels. You usually just have to press the jump button over and over again and every now and then a 2nd button to make a longer jump, a 3rd to grap a ring to reach higher areas. When you have collected enough lightballs to enter a new area you first have to fight against a boss. Very boring because you can&apos;t do anything else then blocking (and waiting) when he starts a series of attacks. Then you do your usual prince-elika-prince-elika-prince attack and you are done. No more stunning acrobatics and combos like in &quot;Warrior Within&quot;. Oh, and you have to fight the bosses multiple times ... . The short dialogues are also crappy because they are just meaningless and awkward. They have the same entertainment value like doing your taxes. Plus this game basically has no story at all. I think the only reason it became such high ratings is because of its graphics style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=421410">Expand</a></span>

I wasted 50 bucks on far cry 2 only to find out that you cant have a sound card that is decent (mine is an x-fi fatality from creative) to play the game.</span>

It requires a lot of patience and a willingness to accept that this game chooses accessibility and ease of use over challenging and rewarding gameplay. Once you accept this, you can move on and enjoy the visuals and cinematics for what they&apos;re worth. If you are new to gaming and are looking for a fun, easy game experience without frustration, difficulty, or controller-throwing, this is the perfect game for you. If you&apos;re an experienced gamer, however, you will probably be disappointed with the complete lack of challenge whatsoever. It is somewhat appreciable solely for its story, but nothing else. Overall, Prince of Persia set out to be a work of art, and at the same time be easy and enjoyable for newcomers. It achieved those two things with flying colors, for better or for worse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=421644">Expand</a></span>

Next to Sands of Time this is primitive crap. Figuring out where to go next was a huge part of the puzzle of the old POP, but this one insists on leading you around by the nose as you chase coins (oh,I mean &quot;light seeds&quot;), Mario style. Or you can always have the princess magically show you where to go if you&apos;re too dumb even for that. Gone is the innovative rewind feature, which forced you to realize your mistakes quickly enough to undo them and penalized you by costing you a sand tank. Now the princess just steps in and magically makes it impossible to die thereby killing any sense of tension. Walking into a room full of baddies in the old POP meant you were about to get your ninja on for 10 minutes. That&apos;s been replaced by painfully slow Boss fights where you&apos;re forced to hold the block button 80% of the time instead of, you know, FIGHTING. It&apos;s times like this I seriously wonder if there really might be some payoffs to reviewers. The only thing reviewers should be pondering about this game is why Ubisoft would so completely castrate their franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=422576">Expand</a></span>

However, the utterly woeful dialogue, even worse delivery, the simplistic gameplay (including fighting the same bosses over and over, who can always be defeated easily with a combo which alternates between a prince / Elika attack) and the totally forgettable story which has an ending entirely at odds with the tripe which came before it, adds up to a seriously disappointing experience. If the prince was a silent hero, the gameplay required a little more precision and had more options than just &quot;press key x now to watch action sequence y, then press key z to complete chain&quot;, and less linearity in its ways around the map, it could have been something truly special indeed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=421273">Expand</a></span>

Now, I am a huge fan of the previous POP games, particularly Sands of Time, but initially, I had trouble getting into the game. The game just sort of throws you into the action without much explanation, and leaves you to figure most things out for yourself. That&apos;s fine and all, as you will soon realise that the game is really simple. On the plus-side, the game is visually stunning, and the very cool stunts the Prince can do remains intact. However, this game is completely and utterly void of any challenge what-so-ever. You simply CANNOT die - ever. If you fall into the abyss, or if you fall into the primordial black goo (or &quot;corruption&quot;), or if you accidently press the wrong button in the slowed-down quicktime events in the combat system, your new companion, Eleka, will save you. And then you just run through the very nice-looking worlds, fighting the same boss fights over and over again, collecting shiny balls, and occasionally encountering the random grunt baddy who dies the second you push them to the edge of the battleground. I really would have liked to see more combat sequences, and this new combat system is really unnecessary, as it just adds to the dumbing down and simplification of this already easy game. I liked how in Sands of Time the Prince&apos;s cool moves just flowed together with the combat. Not this time, as your character somehow loses the ability to JUMP in the combat system, and as an alternative, you can just roll over the bad guys, allowing you an opportunity to throw your woman at them as if she were some sort of potato sack, which she actually could have been replaced with as that would have made the game mildly amusing. Another annoying thing about this game is the painfully awkward and forced dialogue that goes on between the two characters - the Prince has become this cynical douchebag who sounds like an 18 year old North American teenager, and Elika is about as dynamic a character as a block of wood. Isn&apos;t this game suppose to be in &quot;Persia&quot;? Why do these people sound like a bunch of Americans? But, to be fair, I am nitpicking. I did get some fun out of this game, and i&apos;m sure fans of the POP series will as well. However, the fact is Ubisoft has gone out of their way to make this game accessible for the &quot;slower&quot; demographic, and the game is over in less than 15 hours. I, my first play through, took the time to collect every single shiny ball (or &quot;Light Seed&quot;), and still finished the game in under 14 hours. So, it&apos;s good, but far from great. Probably best to rent it before you consider buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=421870">Expand</a></span>

And actually I changed my mind a little bit:
<br>1. Yeap, the game still lacks nice storytelling (simple dialogues are not what makes you shiver in story-driven games like this).
<br>2. Yeap, the game still can be a little boring for younger players asking for action (or old solid fans of Warrior Within-like PoP game)
<br>
<br>But what I&apos;ve rediscovered for myself:
<br>1. My initial gameplay was in russian and Elika sounds like a selfish b!tch in their voice-over (Prince voice-over is great), now I replayed the game in original and she seems to be quite a lovable girl with her reasons to be a little bit irritated.
<br>2. The game suffered from its predecessors (SoT trilogy), I wanted it to be similar or even continue the trilogy story. That&apos;s why I was irritated by different references like: Farah-name, change-fate etc.
<br>But now I was able to separate the game and enjoy as a standalone title - and - I think Mechner would prefer the game over Warrior Within and Two Thrones, as it has much more of an orient-tale atmosphere and less violence.
<br>
<br>I add +2 to my previous score, I think 9 is the perfect score for the game, it would be 10 if it can be more actively  story-driven.
<br>P.S. Graphics are so top notch that even in 8 years it looks pretty decent and better than some of modern titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2160439">Expand</a></span>

Traveling around in this world is like playing in a jungle gym, It wouldn&apos;t work in the same environment as an Assassin&apos;s Creed title because the environment is made for these intense parkour tricks. It falls apart however when your AI companion gets in your way and ruins your timing. I absolutely hated the combat in this game, it&apos;s messy and relies too heavily on QTE&apos;s but is impossible to button mash through, you get severely punished if you miss a QTE and the opponent can recover half of their health.. You however do not have a health meter, the fight is just dragged out until you manage to get through the fight without missing one of their extremely demanding QTE events. Possibly the biggest positive for this game along side the traversal is the visual style.. This game still holds up in 2016 and looks incredibly beautiful. Nolan North provides the voice for the prince and some of the dialogue which you can listen to or skip throughout the story is well acted and written, however the story is a little weak. That being said this game has one of the best alternative endings in the world of gaming. I always had a curiosity about this game and i&apos;m happy I finally played through it, I understand however why this game hasn&apos;t had a sequel and will never have a sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6014518">Expand</a></span>

<br>That being said, if you look at it like a 3D platformer, rather than an action game, it&apos;s rather - in fact, very - good.
<br>The visuals are truly incredible. This is now a four year old game, and the graphics style still excels ahead of almost all of today&apos;s games, in my humble opinion. Its wonderful contrast of dark and light, with the beautifully painted scenery, makes it a worthwhile addition to anyone&apos;s collection of arty games. Honestly, I could watch it for hours.
<br>Overall, then, I found it a beautiful, wonderful, exquisitely polished bore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2862977">Expand</a></span>

You can set up insane 10+ hit combos on the bad guys.  A deep fighting system is a welcome relief from the &quot;keep pushing the A button&quot; depth of most 3D platformers.  Unfortunately, the game&apos;s biggest flaw is there is really no penalty for dying.  They start you RIGHT back where you died.  They were trying to reboot the series and keep it accessible, but this was just a misstep.  Still, on a pure gameplay level this is just an incredibly fun game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3838958">Expand</a></span>

In general, the graphics, the soundtrack and the story are something magical (can&apos;t really find another word to describe them better). The gameplay however... It&apos;s like they wanted to do a POP game like the original one. All the acrobatics are done using one button and the left gamepad stick (just like in the old Amiga years). The same goes for the fighting system. You face one enemy at a time, just like in the original POP trilogy, with the familiar block-and-strike-back tactic. There is of course the addition of combos.
<br>The difficulty of the game is quite low. There&apos;s no precise timing needed to perform the acrobatics and in general there&apos;s no way the Prince can die. I don&apos;t mind for the later but I&apos;d prefer the game to be a little bit harder.
<br>As I played the game I got the feeling it&apos;s more about exploring the kingdom (you can go to any place you want without following any specific order) try to find all the light seeds, let the story develop and enjoy the game. It&apos;s long enough even if you don&apos;t try to collect all the light seeds, but it&apos;s obviously longer if you collect them all (took me around 20 hours the second time I played it). Eventhough the gameplay is repetitive, I personally didn&apos;t get bored of it since I focused at enjoying its magic. I&apos;d recommend it to anyone.
<br>I really hope for Epilogue to be out for PC too (have finished it in PS3 anyway) and for a sequel as well. Just with a higher difficulty level please (at least to let us choose between easy, normal and difficult)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=5401078">Expand</a></span>

<br>Every move, every jump feels scripted as if you don&apos;t have full control over the Prince. There&apos;s no way you could steer off course as the game holds your hand for the whole journey. This coupled with the fact that it&apos;s literally impossible to die makes you feel like you&apos;re playing a kid&apos;s game.
<br>
<br>Fighting enemies one-on-one allows for some very cool combos, but you don&apos;t really get to experiment with this as every time you push an enemy to the edge they either fall off or a quick time event triggers and your combo is interrupted.
<br>
<br>The game is basically mapped out from the very beginning and there&apos;s not much that can surprise you because you do the same thing in every area, over and over.
<br>
<br>Despite the game being one giant collectathon, collecting those light seeds still felt kinda addicting and oddly satisfying enough to make me finish it. Also, dem red plates tho.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=7473694">Expand</a></span>

The game is not really difficult, but I think it was made to make us have fun, not to have a challenge. The map and the environment is very attractive, even being made like cartoon and the gameplay is very fluid and varied, because there is a lot of diferent movements.
<br>The story shows us something completely diferent, I&apos;ve never seen something like this, but I hate  the end of the game, because it makes me think: &quot;everything I&apos;ve done during the game was useless&quot;.

This game drove me to a point where i kinda got emotional about it.. for an example like : why dont they put out a sequal? Why did they stop the Prince of Persia franchise in the first place? How can they let go of this types of games? This Game was very very magical. And i fell in love with it at the first run. The characters, the enviroments and especially the musics. Like almost everytime a music played up,, jeez. It gave me the chills. I couldnt even sit up straight after some dialouges with the music at the same time. The story is very engaging and magical (they could make a better ending though) but HONESLY that ending was perfect because: It left a cliffhanger which made room for a sequal to take place but instead they just leave it there like that and do **** about it. That is what makes the ending bad. Like they could&apos;ve just end the game with a really satisfying ending (a non cliff-hangy ending) and just leave the game. Only then would i be like &apos;&apos;o well atleast they ended the game in a really good way, so there wont be a need for another sequal&apos;&apos;. BUT INSTEAD THEY PUT OUT A DLC SEQUAL THAT JUST ENDS WITH ANOTHER CLIFFHANGER. WHAT??????? how is this even fan-delivering? You just released a dlc only to have another cliffhanger? Btw that dlc sucked. They shoul&apos;ve just leave the game at the original ending. I really love Ubisoft but they just lost their aura. Escpecially after assassins creed 3. People are just geting tired of your **** guys.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6304019">Expand</a></span>
