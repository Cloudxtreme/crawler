You get 8 everyday and a half, some new ones opens up, and some are just repeats, it also helps you gain levels and class ranks since you have to fight a lot of enemies.<br><br>The above sounds great and fun, but there are a few problems with the mission structure and balance itself:<br>Problems:<br>Skill points distribution: you get skill points from attacking enemies/heal/etc, this is so far a bit broken as the chances of you getting skill points are not very consistent, there are occasions where you could get really low amount of skillpoints from fighting strong monsters, even if you&apos;re to group with a few other players, which leads to the problem where soloing is a better and faster way to play. Difficulty balance - Low level leve quests were also too easy for a group, monsters die in 2 hits and you get no skillpoints at all, and for some quests it is also very easy to do at 3-4 stars even when you&apos;re 5-6 levels below the suggested rank. While certain quest have mobs with aoe attacks that could oneshot you.<br><br>Lag - With the partying system, when the lag is bad on your server, there are bugs where you can&apos;t target your party members, can&apos;t reinvite, and invite taking tremendously long to process (or not process at all), this gets better as the server load is lower, but the targetting issue still exists, sometimes you can&apos;t see your party members hp. Lag leads to a lot other problems, abilities gets congested, with the long animation your character do, it delays a lot of your abilities.<br><br>Surplus - This isn&apos;t as big of a problem as other players make it out to be, but it is a mechanic that a few might find annoying as it is there to restrict your playstyle and how you want to spend your time. You really can&apos;t progress on just 1 job alone, and if you like running around on your highest level job, you will eventually run into surplus - which gives a penalty to the skill points you gain, this isn&apos;t a problem if the game wasn&apos;t that much of a grind but the skill points required to level at lvl20s is really high, what SE doing here is to restrict people from progressing and forcing them to level other jobs and crafts, if you like that, it is ok, but there is a limitation to the freedom given.<br><br>Crafting itself is more interesting but also tedious, the animations are too long so most of the time it would take 5minutes just to do a craft, imagine having to unequip all your gears, change to your crafting tools and having to access item box to repair them one by one, which leads to the problem of inventory space, and gears swapping, you have to type out lines and lines of macros so you don&apos;t have to unequip every piece of equipments by hand when you change jobs.<br>The lines of macros is also limited. For a game encouraging you to switch between like 10 jobs, it is an annoyance as you also have to reset all your actions/abilities. Fighting enemies - Some enemies have weird pathing which they will run around and regen itself to full. Sometimes you can&apos;t engage your party members&apos; target with a message &quot;Target can not be engaged&quot;. Targetting is also extremely hard and you have to tab through a lot of targets.<br><br>There are other issues people have already listed, most will run into problem that leads to another, the core of the game is great and the classes/ability mix is a great system, but there are too many problems that hinders a player&apos;s enjoyment. There&apos;s nothing to do but grind, there are a few cutscenes every 5-10 ranks.<br><br>It is clearly an unfinished game with restrictions grant upon players so they won&apos;t progress too fast inorder to buy time for them to fix/implement new features. If you take a look at their site, they are still &quot;looking into improve&quot; many aspects of the game instead of already having the right idea and releasing patches. Most of the updates/maintenance are all bugs/glitches related that should&apos;ve been fix during the beta phase, the menu and UI lag infact still exists and I&apos;m not sure how people could tolerate it.<br><br>The game has only been out for 2 weeks, it doesn&apos;t sound fair to judge the game at its current state, but it is also not very fair for consumers to be paying 60 dollars for an incomplete game, and for a better experience they have been encouraged to wait until they fix all the problems, for a game with a subscription fee, it is a really bad business practice from square-enix.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1382577">Expand</a></span>

<br>--FANTASTIC GRAPHICS.- Stunning visuals which make the world and its creatures amazing to look at.
<br>--MUSIC.- The music brings back a lot of nostalgia from the old days of FFIII (US version) and FFVII.
<br>--BATTLE SOUND EFFECTS.- Not great but decent and make you engage in combat.
<br>
<br>*The Bad:*
<br>--USER INTERFACE.- Clunky and most importantly SLOW! For instance, there is no auto arrange on items. I DREAD everytime I have to think about selling something as it takes litterally 5-10 minutes to sell the junk in my inventory. Crafting and gathering literally becomes a chore which makes taking out the trash and doing the dishes around the house seem pleasant in comparison.
<br>--COMMERCE.- An MMORPG is only as good as its ability to make your character look awsome and feel powerful. One of the best ways for that an RPG can do this is by constantly positively incrementing a character&apos;s gear. FF XIV completely and totally FAILS at this. Levequest rewards very very rarely offer any gear rewards at all, this in itself woudln&apos;t be a problem if there were other ways to get gear without spending hours and hours searching the &quot;retainer&quot; wards for gear. Of course you can always craft your own gear, meaning you need to be a blacksmith and and armorsmith and a goldsmith and maybe a carpenter (depending on your class); I don&apos;t need to tell you how that will go over for you since you&apos;ve already read about the UI. It is possible... to get gear using this system but honestly who has the time to spend it wasting away in some video game while they are NOT having fun? The commerce system; the most important part of any MMORPG, in this game is all but broken.
<br>--USER HELP.- I have been playing games for years. I will be the first to admit I&apos;m not the best at them, but I can hold my own and can kick some butt sometimes. This game however trully made me feel like a newb. Something I have never really felt before. This is not in itself a big problem as humility is probably good for me :P. The real problem is that every 5 minutes I have to alt-tab out of the game so I can figure out how to do ANYTHING and I mean ANYTHING. How do you follow someone else? Alt-tab, you can&apos;t follow someone. How do I party up with someone who isn&apos;t next to me? Alt-tab, you can&apos;t party up with someone not next to you. Where can I find a thaumaturge weapon in Gridania so I can switch to that class because after walking around for an hour I couldn&apos;t find it? Alt-tab, Gridania doesn&apos;t have a thaumaturge&apos;s weapon. How do I use sythesis? How do I resurrect my character? How do I use macros? This list goes on and on and on... Oh get this... When you alt-tab out of the game the game automatically crashes. WOOT!!!! This is a common bug btw. It happened on my windows 7 and my windows XP machine.
<br>
<br>This is the first review that I have written for a game ever. However, I felt soo personally compelled to warn the public about this game that I have written this one as well to pop that negative # up one more click. I love video games. I love RPG&apos;s. I love MMORPG&apos;s have played them for years since Ultima Online came out when I was in High School. I am borderline hating this game. Now I know some people are going to think (or say) &quot;go back to WOW you fanboy&quot;. And maybe they have a point. I liked WOW I really really did. But then I liked Ultima Online and LOTRO and AION and EQ and Asheron&apos;s Call. All I am saying is that if you have not bought this game and you are reading this review please please do yourself a favor and ask yourself how much free time you have and how much you are willing to give to a video game which rewards you little for the amount of time you put into it. If you have a LOT of free time and like grinding away and don&apos;t mind a slow UI then this is the game for you. If, however, you are like the majority of the worlds populace please please look elsewhere for your entertainment. For instance Starcraft 2 just came out, so did Civ 5, Fable 3 comes out in 3 weeks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1384095">Expand</a></span>

Square Enix doesn&apos;t understand what they are doing, they are still stuck in 2000 when it comes to making MMA...actualy I think they want back in time. Why did WoW do so well? it was fun and refreshing for players. Everything in FFXIV is a tedius task that is built to annoy the living crap out of a player.</span>

I get almost 50 frames a second, but a ping of over 1000 millisenconds constantly.<br>The gathering pro&apos;s a re great, the crafting ones are hit and miss, some like them - many don&apos;t (they are - again - dull)<br>The need to have the same animation every time you speak to certain NPC&apos;s - with the associated time wasted.<br><br>I know the game is well animated - it looks wonderful.

I cannot comprehend how anyone can give this game a 10.    It simply isn&apos;t</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Ok, so here&apos;s the real deal._____________<br><br>First off, graphically, sonically and aesthetically the game is great.   If games were scored on looks alone I&apos;d give this one an 8/9._______________<br><br>Well, games are like books, don&apos;t judge it by it&apos;s cover.  And what&apos;s inside isn&apos;t prose it&apos;s gibberish.___________<br><br>I cannot comprehend how anyone can give this game a 10.    It simply isn&apos;t rational.  First, the combat mechanics are frustrating in the extreme.   To give you a taste, lets say you are running around in ANY MMO you can think of and you engage a target.   You can move around, reposition yourself or your camera easily, like a normal shooter for example.  Not so with FFXIV.  When you engage you &quot;LOCK&quot; to that encounter and movement becomes severely hampered and your cameras up down view is frozen.  Yes, you heard me, you can no longer change the camera Y position.    On top of that tabbing... tabbing targets ANYTHING including yourself and other players and NPCs and target mobs.... how frustrating do you think it will be to have 2-3 mobs putting the smackdown (oh and even con mobs can kill you pretty easy) only to find that you cannot fight them because you keep targeting everything OTHER than the mobs attacking you.   It is the worst combat implementation I&apos;ve ever seen in any game to date._________________<br><br>Now lets talk about the world.   It&apos;s big.   Big and pretty.  And repetitive.  And virtually empty.  If you are expecting the rich and full environments you are used to in games like WoW, EQ, EQ2, Aion, etc then don&apos;t get your hopes up.   You&apos;ll be running quite a bit looking at grass and bushes and trees with little else to create any sense of story or immersion.________________<br><br>Oh, and don&apos;t forget to avoid that 2 inch drop off!   No you can&apos;t jump!  How dare you ask!   Go around!   What do you mean it&apos;s only a 2 inch piece of tile on the ground?  Of course you can&apos;t walk over it.  What do you think, this is the real world?   You&apos;re in our world now and you&apos;ll play by our rules of physics!  No jumping and no stepping up or down!______________<br><br>Quests.   I have to ask, what quests?  Other than the main &quot;story line&quot; (which btw seems completely unrelated to the stylish opening sequences) and a couple of sidelines I don&apos;t know what quests there are, if any.   For one I am pretty sure they are few and far between.  But for another you are forced to talk to every NPC (and I mean EVERY NPC) just to see if they have a quest, or if they are your next step.  It&apos;s so outdated and frustrating that you&apos;ll give up questing altogether pretty quick.______________<br><br>Guildleves... a very very sad replacement for leveling quests.  They are meaningless, in far to short of supply and add absolutely nothing to the story of the game.  At least in WoW the &quot;kill x or gather y&quot; quests were often written into a series of storyline related activities that made them somewhat meaningful.  Here guildleves are like going to some kind of soda machine and pressing a button for a refill, only to find out that you&apos;ve had your limit on refills for today._____________<br><br>Now lets talk about UI and add further to the interaction mechanics discussion.  Remember the combat lock and camera note above?  Well the same applies for talking to NPCs.  First you have to successfully target them, once you&apos;ve done that and then navigate a few menus just to begin dialog (yeah get used to menus for everything) you&apos;ll be locked into that encounter until you click away (don&apos;t miss!) to end it.   Hopefully that works.    So no, you can&apos;t simply move away to end like you can with every other MMO under the sun.___________<br><br>And how about that snappy UI!   Well there&apos;s nothing snappy about this one other than hitting the logoff button.______________<br><br>Storyline interaction?   Very short paragraphs of text in a very small window with a very small arrow on the bottom to scroll.   You&apos;ll have no idea where you are in the dialog, how far you have to go, nor any way to go back OR see the overall context of the dialog. __________<br><br>Expecting NPCs to talk?    Interact as you walk by with nice general voiceovers?  Nope.  _________<br><br>I can go on.   As you can gather from my post the game has me pretty seriously dissapointed and very frustrated that SE has taken a game that had such enormous potential and has completely ruined it due to their apparent arrogance and complete disconnect as to what the vast vast majority of gamers are looking for out there._______________<br><br><br>I really think that SE should purchase the rights to the &quot;You&apos;re in our world now&quot; slogan since it so aptly exemplifies the attitude SE has taken to the player base in the introduction of this game to the market.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1382245">Expand</a></span>

Originally known as Rapture, the game was said to be the next generation of MMORPG. I would like to preface this by saying I have played more than half of the Final Fantasy titles and beaten them, and on the other hand, I have played a handful of MMORPGs including FFXI.<br><br>The Good:<br>- Graphics: The game looks fantastic. Characters are alive and beautiful, and the armor in the game is incredibly detailed. I&apos;d say this game has the best graphics of any MMORPG to date.<br>- Sound: While not one of the better Final Fantasy soundtracks, the music is definitely solid. Sound effects from attacks to footsteps are very convincing and add to the atmosphere of the game.<br><br>The Bad:<br>- Performance: This game simply isn&apos;t optimized. Many players, including myself, have powerful rigs but still chug along. Granted the graphics are great, but the scalability is deplorable. If you don&apos;t have a recently-upgraded PC, don&apos;t bother.<br>- Interface: I think the best way to sum this up is to say the decade-old Final Fantasy XI had a better UI. Navigation of the interface is unbearable at times, and adds minutes of wasted time. The game has been developed with the console in mind, so navigation with a controller is optimal, but is still incredibly tedious and archaic. You can&apos;t sort your interface, and everything seems to take twice as many steps as it should. Want to sell some items? Well, you&apos;ll have to go through a handful of dialogue boxes just to sell 1 item. Games for the last few years have been using what we call the &quot;right click&quot; on the mouse. Why doesn&apos;t this game in 2010 have it? Oh, and targeting is incredibly bad.<br>- Lag: Inputs take seconds to execute. This adds to a &quot;clunky&quot; experience both in combat and out. Yes, the game is new, but Square Enix should have at least allowed client-side interactions. Everything needs to be communicated to the server in Japan meaning everything you do has to be registered on the server before it executes. Frustrating to say the least.<br>- Gameplay: To enter combat, you have to press a button to take out your weapon. This leaves you standing in 1 place for about 2-3 seconds while your character pulls out your weapon. Animations are slow and must be completed, so if you want to use abilities quickly in combat, good luck. The combat isn&apos;t very fun either. Abilities aren&apos;t very interesting or varied, and interactions are clunky.<br>- No tutorials: This game makes you feel lost, very lost. Square Enix doesn&apos;t seem to have taken the precautions to help people figure the game out. When crafting items, there are no recipes, so you&apos;ll have to use pen and paper. During missions, you&apos;ll be left guessing who to talk to. Instructions are nowhere to be found. Heck, nobody even tells you how to switch classes, you&apos;ll have to refer to the internet for that.<br>- Controls: No key mapping for the keyboard means you&apos;re stuck with some ridiculous keybindings set by Square Enix. Controls are easily the worst in any MMORPG in the last decade and reek of 20th century.<br>- Content: Chocobos are in the game but no way to ride or interact with them. Grinding. Lots of grinding. Quests with no purpose. You can&apos;t see your party members on the map. Very few search options ingame. No /invite command. The list goes on and on.<br>- Market system: No auction house. If you want a specific item, you&apos;ll be left begging in /shout and searching through hundreds if not thousands of bazaars to find the item.<br><br>This game is inconvenient. Very inconvenient. It feels like a game from over 10 years ago but with modern graphics. This game was advertised as being welcoming to casuals, but running around takes ages and the combat is slow. Leveling takes an eternity and the lack of direction is evident. This is the most disappointing game I&apos;ve played in years. I don&apos;t recommend it to anyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1383946">Expand</a></span>

The UI is absolutely horrible too the point that its a stuggle to play fluidly.  There aren&apos;t any servers in the United States so the lag is horrible.  The only nice thing about the game is the graphics.  Which aren&apos;t even close to enough to save the title.  There aren&apos;t any REAL quests.  only 8 simple run and kill &quot;x&quot; creatures a day leves quests.  There is no content in this peice of flaming turd.  This is a warning to you.  Don&apos;t waste $85 like I did for the SE box.  Don&apos;t buy the standard box.  Just stay away from this title.  I have never been so angry at a game in my life.  I can&apos;t believe this unfinished turd was released to the public.  It should be criminal.  And too all of those that try to promote the game.  Shame on you for making people waste money on a game that they are going to rage quit like half the population already has in less than a week.  Metacritic should have allowed us to post reviews when the SE was released so the standard edition peeps could warn them of this ripoff.  And as far as the company that already posted its 84 review.  **** Code Central, shame on you.  You have no taste and are betraying the customers in the gaming market.  People turn to review companies to lead them in the right direction.  I should start my own review company that actually serves the fans and warns them of such horrible titles. Enough said.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1384299">Expand</a></span>

Just like FFXI, the entire basis of the game is the advancement of a linear storyline... and that&apos;s it. The game boasts impressive in-game art, graphics, and cinematics, but the gameplay is boring and repetitive. Once you get through your first few starting quests, you are left to do repeatable daily quests in one of three categories: Battle, crafting, and gathering. So basically you are left doing daily quests in a very similar fashion to World of Warcraft&apos;s endgame play, only that is what you will be doing for the entire length of the game. To make matters worse, the combat controls make working in a group a pain, as they do not allow for point and click casting. A redundant target select is built into the game so that people with gamepads can keep their eye on one target while healing people around it, but this only complicates PC controls.<br>The crafting in this game is a carbon copy of the Final Fantasy XI crystal crafting system with an unintuitive mini-game added on top. You have no recipe list, so you must look up all the recipes online at their website and you also have no way to tell if the item is too difficult for you to craft at your given skill. This also means you must manually put in all the materials for the item into a grid of boxes before you start crafting. Once at the mini-game, new players will be left scratching their heads in frustration as they vainly try to learn the crafting mini-game with a complete lack tutorials. Sure, if the player is smart enough to pick up the crafting tutorial quest back at the city he will have something to work with, but the tutorial fails to explain the intricacies of the game, such as what the pretty light on your crafting tool represents. Also, when you fail at making an item, all the ingredients you meticulously collected are destroyed, only adding to player frustration. The gathering mini-game trades the frustration for boredom, and is just as unintuitive as the crafting mini-game. Thankfully the introductory gathering quest is helpful here, but &quot;hot and cold&quot; mini-games belong in the realm of things to do on long car trips when we don&apos;t have advanced electronic devices available to us, not in a video game. At least not in the unintuitive, and rather dull application it is applied here. The player market is a mess as well. Square went with a Bazaar system as opposed to an Auction House, and since the economy is mostly player run (think like 90%), this ends up creating a convoluted mess. You will be stuck searching through an army of retainers (the npcs that player hire out to put their stuff on) for close to an hour before finding what you want. The costs will also be either out the roof or ludicrously low due to their being no way for players to gauge the marketplace in order to set a good price for their goods.<br>The game&apos;s physics engine is a rip straight out of Final Fantasy XI as well, meaning poor interaction with the environment and no swimming or jumping. You are guaranteed to always be on the ground in this game. The only improvement that this game boasts over its predecessor is the fact that it allows for solo play. This is nothing to be proud about, however, since that has been standard issue in MMOs for at least the last 5 years. So basically we have a game system that is a carbon copy of the Final Fantasy XI system with the only difference being repeatable quests and solo play. The only thing to look forward to is the storyline, but we&apos;ve moved far beyond linear stories with games such as Baldur&apos;s Gate, Dragon&apos;s Age, and Fallout. Nothing to be proud of here folks, and certainly not worth wasting your money on. Pretty graphics give this two stars, but ancient game-play mechanics on top of endless player frustration gives this a 0 in game-play category.<br>2 out of 10 for this one folks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1382646">Expand</a></span>

Even then your loyalty might be questioned. I&apos;ve played FFXI for a number of years, as well as WoW, and this game succeeds in little else but setting the genre back. Gone are auction houses, every player is now expected to open up their own shop. Which isn&apos;t horrible in principle, but it&apos;s an archaic MMO design that was left behind for a reason. There&apos;s no search, so simply shopping can take hours dependent on what you&apos;re looking for. The quest system is the equivalent of &apos;dailies&apos; in WoW, fairly short, uninspired, repetitive quests you can do once every 36 hours. There is a main story quest that I believe unravels once every 10 levels, the rest of the game is grinding dailies or just... grinding. NPC&apos;s rarely say anything useful, the entire world is incredibly beautiful... it just feels like cardboard.
<br>
<br>System requirements are absurdly high, and your results may vary on server lag or server queues, some of this is forgivable for a starting MMO. Stability is actually great, actually... but there&apos;s just nothing there. The game feels like a late alpha going into beta, not a release quality game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1382058">Expand</a></span>

The market wards are a complete joke and you have no idea if the item you are looking for is actually for sale anywhere.  The lack of content is appalling.  The one saving grace could have been the story but even that is falling flat (maybe the others have better but Limsa&apos;s is pretty lame up to 20).  The UI is quite possibly the worst out of any PC game in the past decade.  No drag/drop, clicking on things typically doesn&apos;t do anything, and you have to go thru more menus than an old DOS MUD to get anything done.<br><br>Not even sure this game has potential anymore.  It HAD potential, but given that it&apos;s release and they haven&apos;t accomplished anything of significance and made so many bad decisions already I don&apos;t think they can dig themselves out anytime soon.  The graphics and music are nice but the rest of it can hardly be classified as a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1381068">Expand</a></span>

Crafting is horribly slow and painful and so much downtime waiting for menus to popup<br>5. Fun Factor = 0 NOTHING in this game is fun to do, everything is a CHORE everything requires insane amounts of time to do mainly because of the horrid ui and controls.<br>6. Con system, Has anyone actually figured out how to con mobs yet? Should it be this difficult to figure it out?<br>7. Combat, slow and boring it makes me want to fall asleep its so boring<br>8.Quests are tedious and boring I don&apos;t even know where to begin<br>9. forming a guild/linkshell is a pain in the ass. Do you have ANY idea how ridiculously hard it will be to invite people to a large guild if you have to meet EVERYONE in person to actually do it?<br>10. Chat system is horrible is it even possible to reply to someone w/o having to type there name out all the time ? Should it be this hard to figure it out?<br>11.Death, It took me 10 minutes to figure out that when i died i had to open my menu and hit return...thats ridiculous I had to figure out what to do when I die. Unacceptable.<br>12. Terrain , SO MUCH COPY PASTE its so obvious that they copied so much terrain its not even funny.<br><br>13. The world map, we really can&apos;t zoom in or out? Really? No really?! wow....<br><br>This is quit possibly the WORST mmo I have ever played and that&apos;s really saying something. I&apos;ve been gaming for over 15 years now and this is literally the worst. Even ff11 played better than this and its not that much better. It literally makes me want to spread the word out and make sure no one ever even thinks of buying this horrible excuse for an mmo. How anyone could possible give this game a good score is beyond me. They either are complete and total FFanbois or have just never actually played a good mmo before and are basing this game off of FFXI other than that it makes no sense when there are so many obvious flaws with this game they practically scream out to you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1381221">Expand</a></span>

I tired crafting and harvesting but it&apos;s so boring - take so long time to do anything and I don&apos;t like it. So I have War and Magic to play. I have no choice but to grind mildessly , run kill , run kill  errrr I just wonder I am playing RAGNAROK ONLINE 2010???  ... Also the skill up is buggy somehow or it&apos;s broken... I am Conjuror I suppose to skill up by casting magic such as Thunder , .. etc  but belive it or not , after running around for 2 hour I&apos;ve found that the best way to get skill up is spamming Spirit dart until enemy die even I use cure while fighting is not gain any skill point ... it&apos;s so strange and stupid I feel. Also, I feel sorry for those who don&apos;t have active Linkshell or Friends. They have no one to talk with! Nobody talk anything even in the Aetherite camp. Grats whoever get into LS and have a group going .. oh did I mention, as a Conjuror, in order to gain class skill in party as much as other melee class, I have to spam spirit dart as well! becuz I can&apos;t cast spell. I get aggro immediatly from only 1 heal  or 1 nuke or 1 MPrecoverSkill  - I&apos;ve play EQ1 EQ2 FFXIV and I think I know by now the aggro system for caster or healer or Do FFXIV use other rule for aggro management ? If so they should have it in manual or something. Furthermore, why there&apos;s no Dev team or Community manager that communicate with player. Why SE never talk with their players? Where is official forum?  All they have is Feedback system which won&apos;t be responded and E-mail system that takes about 3 days to get Copy-paste answer ... I can go on with so many disappointed things in this game.  Sorry I feel very bad now I invest so much money to play this game. I bought a new computer i7 960 / GTX 480 / etc  just to play this game and I thought at that time my money is worth it. Even in Beta, my friend told me it&apos;s better to use Controller and I bought it immediately in hope many things will be fixed when its released  but it&apos;s isn&apos;t ....  Map , Bazaar , Trade , even selling item to NPC is terrible .. slow and too much unnecessary progress... and WHY in the world I had to assigned the drop to myself when I am soloing ? I just don&apos;t understand...  This is much worse than EQ2 Launch ... sorry for FFXIV fan ( I am also FF fan too but I had to speak the truth)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1381466">Expand</a></span>

The UI is very complex and not user friendly, the mouse-keyboard support is very poor, the combat system is slow and repetitive, anche the graphics engine is very heavy.

<br>Everything else (i.e. the bazaar system, leve system, macro system, equipment/character level progression...) Sucks big.  I understand it takes a little time for the market to mature and such, but other than that I don&apos;t see a game overhaul happening to fix the other things I don&apos;t like.  0/10

<br>I wouldn&apos;t recommend this game, there are more mmo titles just around the corner.  As a side note, this doesn&apos;t surprise me, I thought FF13 sucked too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1380985">Expand</a></span>

The main story line so far has been blend. The game was touted for its engaging plot and immersive environment. The main quest starts then quickly disappears for a while. The player is left to figure out what to do (the only thing left to do is grinding guildleves and crafting, aside from a small number of quests). I&apos;m fine with allowing players to explorer the world and figure out what to do. But there&apos;s nothing to do but grind here! Then there&apos;s the environment. A large portion of the world is narrow, twisted valleys connecting rather small main zones. Sure, it takes a while to walk from one area to another. But all you see is narrow paths that twists and turns. You generally don&apos;t see a vast area to explorer.<br><br>Perhaps the lack of content can be understood, since the game just came out. However, the issue with UI is unforgivable. SE has had almost a decade to look at and experiment with UI. There are plenty of other MMO&apos;s that have shown how a good UI could be implemented. SE decided to completely ignore that and implement an archaic system of accessing practically everything via a main menu. You want to equip an item? Go to the main menu and open equipped item window. You can&apos;t just select an item from your inventory and equip it. You have to select a body part in equipment window, select an item from an inventory list that shows up, then click the equip button. Did I tell you that the inventory list is not sorted?<br><br>There are plenty of other issues that made me cancel my subscription. You should be able to find them easily online. I&apos;m not the only one complaining about them. My recommendation is, the game has potential, but it may not be realized for another year. Save your money and play some other MMO until then.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1381338">Expand</a></span>

Do not let those singing praises and ringing bells fool you, there are as many negatives to this patch as there are positives. For one, there is no practical hMP (Healing MP) solution in game yet. This is a problem because Cure costs were QUADRUPLED with the recent patch. This leaves mages with limited options as conserving and managing your MP is top priority. Secondly, Behests were completely ruined. Reformatted from large party adventure fun times into another solo grind activity which rewards minimal SP.  Definitely the game&apos;s most fun feature so far was flushed down the drain. Thirdly, overall EXP/SP gain was nerfed down to accommodate the lack of Fatigue now. Unfortunately, you were able to grind FASTER pre-patch while on lower tiers of fatigue than you can now post-patch. The game really isn&apos;t in a position to be messing with new players, or bitter old players like myself, with fake fanfare. The only three good things to come out of the patch were AutoAttack/Stamina bar removal, the instanced dungeons and the CONJ/THM damage nerfs. The rest is objectively bad. Save your disk space. Save your bandwidth. Save your patience. The game is not ready yet. Wait for 1.2 if you&apos;d like.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1381789">Expand</a></span>

I have been looking forward to this game for quite a while. I put up with all the problems in beta because, well, it&apos;s beta. But nearly all the problems made it into the release. The only saving grace in this game is the graphics, however.<br>-Simply moving around is not fluid at all. You can get stuck on 2 inch tall pebbles and even the slightest incline.<br>-Combat is clunky(nothing to do with lag)<br>-Empty world.(Nothing in it but monsters and the occasional crystal camp)<br>-Lacking in story(You literally have to grind four hours on end just to see 30 minutes of storyline every 10 or so levels)<br>-Completely backwards party system(It&apos;s actually better to party up then solo on other sides of the map because of the way you get exp)<br>-Aggro system is broken. A single heal spell can completely peel any mob.<br>-Lack of content, you can craft, do a few daily style quests that are more bland than any WoW kill quest, then you grind until you can do more of those poor quests.<br>-Frustrating UI that requires you to flood your whole screen with menus in order to do ANYTHING even opening a simple door.<br>-Mobs are not balanced, randomly something that registers as &quot;Weaker than you&quot; can kill you in two shots, and others that register as &quot;You don&apos;t have a chance&quot; hardly does any damage -Crafting is the only way to reliably get gear(you very rarely get them from the quests)<br>-Crafting even the lowest level newbie gear requires several crafts and lots of failing and losing items. It should not take several hours just to assemble a pair of level 5 pants.<br>-Many many more problems.<br><br>They rushed the release of this game, and forced through a poorly implemented quest system.<br><br>Don&apos;t believe all the mindless fan boys. Unless you like grinding hours on end and don&apos;t mind a frustrating UI, you will not like this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1381128">Expand</a></span>

REALLY!I say log out because if you try any other way the game crashes most of the time.Oh yeah another thing about crafting is you have to do them all because they all seem to rely on each other.I could go on and on about the many problems about this game it seems very rushed.They needed about a year or two more.The races are the same as final fantasy 11 and alot of final fantasy 11 problems seem to of been port to FFXIV.When 11 came out i could look over most of them but in 2010 this isnt acceptable.Everything that made FF11 great like Notorious Monsters classic class isnt here.So if you think its like a prettier looking Final fantasy 11 you are mistaken.Now i bring up WoW and most fans of final fantasy will ream you for this,but the maker of this game wanted to target the WoW players saying that FFXIv will target a more casual friendly audience and i would say that this game seems only geared for the hardest of core fans.Just playing the game is hard.maybe in 2 years this game will be playable but for now dont buy this let Square enix know that if you make a bad game people wont just buy for thier name on the product. PS:Ive been a FF fan since the start in 85 so please dont get on me for misspells and grammer just because your upset at my review. thank you Sorry i forgot the score in my last review 2 out of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1380814">Expand</a></span>

Oh boy, this game fail on that on all level. Graphic : they are very good. From time to time I stop to watch at the environment. You need a good graphic card, but the result is excellent. Not much to say. UI: HORRID. They very very obviously made this game with console in mind, and quickly rushed the PC version. I can give numerous example of this. As a mage, I have to click/hit a key to cast a spell. But instead of hitting the target, I have to click a second time (only mouse) on the target other wise the spell don#t go out. The map CANNOT be scrolled with the mouse, you have to use the i,j,k,l keys, it can&apos;t be zoomed. UI is clunky you can&apos;t hit a key shortcut you have to open a main menu, hit inventory to see what you got , and a different menu (top one can&apos;t remember how it is called) to ready a weapon. Havign a single inventory and double click to equip unequip ? Not for FF14. Lookin at inventory take a LOT of time many seconds, it is as if UI and the rest was located on the server. Changing action bar is clunky and takes many seconds too. Also to switch class, you have to go in inventory (takes seconds) or use macro ! If you heard of the rest system , well it really is stupid. Not only they limit to 8 quest (battlequest) and 8 work order  (crafting) but also it refresh only once in maybe 36 hours. Do your quest in 5 MINUTES, then wait 36 hours to be able to to remove it from the lsit and do a new one !!! And the limit after which you earn NO XP (faitigue system) is invisible. So you have to guess. Gameplay : I had a lot of fun with the various classes (except mage due to clunkyness) but the crafting / mining miniga,me is Much MUCH too slow. You have to click in a menu to begin gather stuff, then click a second time in a menu to &quot;strike&quot; &quot;chop&quot; etc... Why ? They could have done it a single click. And the wait time are horrid. Crafting is also laggy and you can only craft a SINGLE itme at the same time (I did not see a way to craft stack at least).  But worst is that there is *NO* receipt book ! You have to note them, and manually add ingredients (not even counting that crafting talke ingredients from many other craft skills).  And the menu are too deep. Click on a SINGLE material slot to add a material, do it for all material, then click craft, then click on what you want (if there is only a single possibility you still MUST click that one) then confirm , then confirm again somehow , then start. For a single item I hestimate it could be anywhere around a single minute. Also levelling is sloooooooooooow. I haven&apos;t been able with normal play to go above 7 levels in 24/48 hours before &quot;fatigue&quot; kick too much.  But it felt slow, because you have to stop after a while because you get ZERO XP in that skill. The trick I use is to switch various fighting class, and once I am finished with the last one, level a bit the first one. But it is sub optimal. It forces you to do sutff you might not want to do, or just stop playing for 24/36  hours. There is no auction house, only single vendor which takes hours to &quot;load&quot; the UI, and you can&apos;t search among them. When I tried to find an overpriced item , I had to manually click 12 vendors, then I gave up. There were , I dunno, 40 vendor each side. And you can&apos;t preview or know what they sell. The payment system is not good, but I don&apos;t count that in the review.<br><br>Bottom line : STAY AWAY. Rushed. Clucky. MMO technology wise, older game 15 years ago got much of that right. FF14 did not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1380951">Expand</a></span>

The UI has been bashed its not great, and could be soooo much better but apparently SE didnt take anyone to seriously about the UI in XI either o well. Compared to 11, this game is so much more accessible being able to change classes anywhere just by the change of a weapon is fantastic and the main classes, War or Mage disciplines are fun and enjoyable to play. The game forces you however to build up a craft and gathering profession which IMO. hurt it, Not being able to simply repair all your gear at a repair vendor is annoying and forcing you to either, seek out another player to do so or level up your skill to do it your self is just a pain in the ass. No more long low lvl hikes back from your Homepoint to the zone you died in, dying is much more forgiving now with no exp loss anymore the big draw back of dying is weakness which is annoying enough to not want to die to often. Graphics are good yay. A teleport system is implemented which makes traveling throughout the world far less tedious once you get your initial experience doing it 1000x over is just a pain in the ass thankfully they cut this out. Im forgiving the lack of auction house right now because lets face it, with one RMT would over take the market and destroy the economy right away and prices would be outragous, atm money is easy to make through gathering or crafting, the crafting system is fun and frustrating a huge step up from XI however this and the gathering skills are huge signals that this is not for the casual audience because simply clicking once won&apos;t mine your copper or make your cotton cloth, a little thought and understanding of the system is needed to be successful in either of the two. If you want a simple MMO this isn&apos;t for you<br>If you want something perfect in all aspects and expect nothing less this isnt for you<br>If you love the Final Fantasy series this STILL MIGHT NOT be for you this is not your typical FF<br>If you can come into Final Fantasy XIV with the understanding it has it flaws and is going to eek you the wrong way now and again but in the end the outcome will feel very rewarding give this a try, if your on the edge because of the flaws, wait a couple of months check what SE has fixed via updates through just the first week the UI went from almost unbearably slow to a good speed between windows. They will get some of the issues out i just hope it doesn&apos;t take them too long.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1381253">Expand</a></span>

The game is far from perfect, but it isn&apos;t horrible. The game isn&apos;t designed for power levellers or the people who play all day long. So far the game has been fun. The game is designed to make people craft their own items, and sometimes the crafting can be complex. This isn&apos;t a game where you just go do the &quot;optimal build&quot; and pound on baddies and pray for awesome armors. You have to make your own armor or pay a premium for it. There is no &quot;optimal build&quot; and there are a ton of ways people can customize their gaming experience. You can be a rogue character that can heal.  You can be a caster that can beat the crap out of things. You can make your own items, or team up with a group to make items for everyone. There is almost too much to do right now, and people who don&apos;t have a big bad boss to go after first thing haven&apos;t a clue as what they should be doing and they&apos;ll lose interest. The graphics are gorgeous, naturally. There hasn&apos;t been much of a story line, but then again, the game isn&apos;t complete yet. I have a feeling it won&apos;t be &quot;complete&quot; until the PS3 release, and this is just a bigass beta test. The quests can get kid of repetitive, but there&apos;s a lot of things to do. I have a feeling this game is going to shape up well. It&apos;s not complete and there&apos;s things to do yet to finish it, but I think it will do well.
<br>
<br>Oh, for the whiners about keyboard/mouse control: This is a game designed for gamepad use. Either use one or get over yourselves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1381329">Expand</a></span>

Kids these days have no idea what an mmo launch is like.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1381222">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>When Final Fantasy XI was released the only good MMO ever made was pretty much EQ1. The genre has moved foward leaps and bounds since, but SE pretty much decided to ignore that.  6 months after release FF14 is pretty much a beta build of a bad EQ1 era game with fancy graphics. Nothing more really needs to be said about it.</span>

Worst game of 2011, and most likely of 2010 as well. They should have been ashamed to release this.</span>

Low level extermination Leves more than often have all the monsters you are supposed to kill spawn in a single large group making it impossible to solo on a solo difficulty, now many would argue that it&apos;s an MMO and should be played with a party, but there are two problems with this.<br>1: Square advertises this game as solo AND party based, you can in fact chose &quot;solo&quot; difficulty for each Leve which in theory should let you pass it single-player but is so broken it is impossible.<br>2: Community is awful (and if you mention this on the official forums your posts &quot;disappear&quot;, thanks SquarEnix) when I say awful, i mean absolutely awful, when you start your game for the first time, the first thing you are welcomed by is some gold sellers trying to scam you out of your money, Then nothing, nobody wants to talk, nobody wants to interact, people want you to pay them for any kind of interaction that people in other MMOs would gladly do for free, and when you see people talking, it&apos;s some German, Japanese, or Spanish players who got tired of the same problems on their servers and decided to try the US server to see if its any different, Unfortunately it is not. And don&apos;t even think about having gear you like unless you&apos;re willing to level three or four jobs to level 50 because nobody will repair anything for you, even if you offer to pay them, making you either hunt down and craft the items yourself, or buy them in the marketplace for extortionate prices because the game has entirely player-driven economy, because apparently SE though it would be a good idea to have teens with no concept of finances be in charge of an entire world&apos;s economy.<br><br>All in all, this game is an exercise in frustration, from the moment you log in it essentially does everything it possibly can to make you hate it as much as you can, most people here that gave it bad scores were probably in love with it at some point, rather than just straight-out hating on it, but the fact is, you can&apos;t love something that hurts you so much, at the end of the day you turn on your games to relax from a long and frustrating day, so what is the point of playing if the game frustrates you more than the entire day before it?<br><br>The game does have potential, quite a bit, the problem is Square Enix is more obsessed with introducing more new broken features than fixing the current broken ones, and keep promising to fix the issues without even an attempt to deliver, the concept is fine, but execution absolutely terrible, and SE would do all of us a favor if it would just cut it&apos;s losses and kill this mutated beast that&apos;s choking on its own excrement.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1619959">Expand</a></span>

Long story short, I am a huge RPG/Final Fantasy gamer, I have a lot of respect for FF 1-9, and for others on PS2 and XBox. Please check my reviews as I love the series and give my intake on a few, my lowest game is a 4, and that is SWG. Sadly though, there is one game that I thank my brother for showing me before I almost spent real $ on it, and that would be Final Fantasy 14 Online. I will say right now there are only a few other times in my entire life where I saw my bro so upset, after 1 hour of playing he was appalled that he spent money on this game. After witnessing it as well I felt genuinely sorry for him and told him I would try not to laugh about it. I know this is a superbly late review but I am new to reviewing so here it is. I have no idea what the creators of this game were thinking, releasing it in this condition. Also, having the nerve to charge more money for a supposed &quot;exclusive pack&quot; + $12.99 a month subscription. They refused to refund either of the 2 months that he paid for in advance and definitely didn&apos;t want to use. He literally paid $111 to dry dump a mushroom for an hour and a half. This game is a broken piece of trash and honestly I think all players deserve a FULL REFUND!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2604702">Expand</a></span>

I really cannot even begin to list the problems this game has. In nearly every way except for graphics, it is a massive step-back from even SE&apos;s previous MMO title (FFXI).

In nearly every way except for graphics, it is a massive step-back from even SE&apos;s previous MMO title (FFXI).<br><br>The User Interface is terrible and sluggish. It takes multiple confirmations and clicks to perform even the simplest tasks, such as moving items from your inventory to your retainer (bank). It will take you upwards of 10 minutes to just sell your vendor trash.<br><br>The terrain is copy-and-pasted to such an extent that it will make those who complained about WOW&apos;s copying of caves die of shock. Areas just feel bland and lifeless.<br><br>There is absolutely no reason to do anything in the game (except for it&apos;s own sake) because the game has no content (only 8 copy-pasted kill quests every 36 hours, no end-game to speak of, etc).<br><br>There is absolutely no sense of progression in the game. Many dozens of hours in and you&apos;re still traversing areas that look exactly the same (literally because they are) and still fighting Moles and Rats; monsters that feel like they should be reserved for characters under level 5.<br><br>The item durability system is absolutely terrible. It is impossible to repair your gear up to 100% without the help of an outside player, or you spend hours trying to work through the terrible crafting interface and retarded recipe design philosophy (a level 2 recipe requires level 15 recipe reagents from the same craft) to level up your own crafting skill.<br><br>Your character will even get stuck on 2-inch high walls (I am not even joking), and have to walk around them.<br><br>There are dozens of features that should have been implemented by release, but are still absent (Chocobos, AH, Airships, Company System, etc etc etc).<br><br>I could go on forever but hopefully you get the idea. This MMO is in no way shape or form ready for a commercial release; it&apos;s barely in an Alpha state right now. I cannot recommend this MMO to anyone, but I can recommend you avoid it like plague.<br><br>If it is not dead in a year, check back then and see if it is finally out of pay-to-play Beta.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1388220">Expand</a></span>

The game touts itself as casual friendly, but fails miserably at instilling any sense of accomplishment if one only has a few hours a day due to so much travel between the repetitive landscape. Compared to the Fields of Valor and experience ring bonuses in FFXI, the system in FFXIV appears to be a fluffed up and overcomplicated copycat version with more travel.<br><br>The lack of an accessible Auction House for easy buying and selling of items creates a time sink when trying to find of upgrade equipment navigating the poorly thought out and tedious market wards, aggravating for a player that cares only for questing and monster slaying.<br><br>The graphics nice to look at, and the music is a feast for the ears, but the characters lack a warm soul to them, and the character armor available looks highly generic, the iconic artifact armor associated with final fantasy jobs is nowhere to be found, making this feel like its not a final fantasy game.<br><br>This game is a step backwards from its well aged forebear FFXI in many ways, provoking the question of FFXIV&apos;s necessity in the market place. FFXIV tries to be different in several ways to set itself apart from other games, but frustratingly does so in the worst ways thought possible for those that area already fans of FFXI or more accessible MMOs.<br><br>Given the state of the current game, I would recommend waiting until next year to give this game a try, provided they have heavily patched the game to address the myriad of other nagging issues too long to list that plague this game in its current form.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1388223">Expand</a></span>

I really wanted to like it, and I was totally ready to love this game.  However, after playing it for a few days, it became immediately obvious that almost no progress has been made since 11 came out so many years ago.
<br>
<br>On the plus side, the graphics and sound are stunning.  There is some repetitiveness in the graphics, but the actual visual experience is amazing.  The game compares pretty favorably with the best looking MMOs out there, and as usual, the music of Final Fantasy is incredible.
<br>
<br>The class system which allows you to swap classes on the fly and steal bits and pieces from multiple classes is a great idea, and opens up a lot of potential for creativity.  You can tune a character to work exactly how you would like them to, and end up with something which feels pretty unique.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, that&apos;s about all I can say I liked about the game.  In many other vitally important areas, the game failed spectacularly.  It feels as though the developers of the game worked in an isolated chamber, without the benefit of seeing any of the improvements in MMOs which have come out since then, and without anyone questioning the design decisions made in FFXI.
<br>
<br>The economy of the game is based on a retainer system, in which players essentially set up bazaars to hawk their items.  There&apos;s no auction house or trading post to scan for the items you want, you&apos;ll be coming here if you want something you can&apos;t make yourself.  So if you want a new sword, you&apos;re going to zone into a room chock full of hundreds of retainers.  And if you want to find a sword, you&apos;re going to have too look at them one by one, until you find a guy selling what you want.  I can&apos;t imagine how this idea made it through any kind of design meeting.  And in an economy where almost anything you ever want is made by players, this is not going to to be a minor annoyance, but a constant chore.
<br>
<br>Navigating the UI in the game is perhaps the most terrible, painful experiences I&apos;ve had in an MMO.  Menus are entirely server-authenticated.  I don&apos;t know if this was to prevent exploits or just a bad design decision, but it means that whenever you press a button, you&apos;ll have to wait a short time to see the result, maybe a quarter of a second, maybe a couple of seconds on a slow connection.  If I were going to put this into a game, I would design the UI with this in mind, to make as few calls as possible, but instead, many task in the game require many, many menus, and many calls to the server.  Crafting an item frequently takes navigating a half-dozen menus and opening and closing your inventory 4 or 5 times.  The tiny lag on every menu action adds up, and makes everything take so long as to be incredibly annoying.
<br>
<br>The levequest system one of the more painful questing systems ever put into a game.  You pick up levequests in a large town, go to the correct location at which to do them, and start them up.  You complete whatever goals are set for you, and you get the rewards.  However, you only have a dozen or so of these quests available to you at any given time, and you can easily finish them off in a couple of hours, and then you&apos;re simply out of content until these levequests reset 36 hours later.  And unfortunately, these quests are not interesting or epic.  Most of them are simply requests to kill X of a specific mob and come back.  Once you&apos;re done with these quests, you&apos;re simply out of stuff to do other than grind.
<br>
<br>And you&apos;re not allowed to grind for too long, or else your XP will begin to fall off.  If this happens, the only way to gain XP at the normal rate again is to switch classes, or simply not gain XP for a while.  This leaves the game in an uncomfortable state in which you can&apos;t play for very long periods of time without running out of things to do, but you miss out on opportunities to level your character as best you can without logging on for at least a couple of hours each day.  It&apos;s hard to figure out what audience this game and its mechanics were intended for.
<br>
<br>The game keeps many of Final Fantasy XI&apos;s annoying quirks.  Storyline quests which are available to you are very limited and unmarked.  You have to stumble upon the correct person while you are the correct level in order to find out if you can make progress.  Most fast travel is either not yet available, or you are heavily limited in your use of it.  This would be less of an issue if the maps were smaller.  But some maps and cities are simply gigantic mazes, with ridiculous amounts of dead space.  The menu system is unique to FF games, and painful.  Even as a former FFXI player, it took me over half an hour to figure out how to equip new skills.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t recommend FFXIV at all in its current state.  At best, it is a &apos;wait and see&apos; game, and I&apos;m not too hopeful that the issues will ever be resolved.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1394109">Expand</a></span>

Bugs, glitches, no substance no quests. I would be surprised if this game reviews any higher than a 3, as this game deserves less than a 0. do not buy.  There is a reason that dude sold his SE stock, there is a reason they changed management, there is a reason the apology letter was sent. This game is an epic fail and is really that BAD. Shame on you SE for trying to feed these fan-boys this **** Again shame on you Square Enix. FIX THIS GARBAGE, redesign everything; or scrap it, give us refunds and make another game. This time do not release it in Alpha stage.

The game seems to have been rushed out, to reach shelves on time and quite clearley needs a lot of work before its ready for retail release. Some of the crafting in the game seems like, it could really work, forcing the economy to buy and trade but sadly this method just usually involves people selling items for ridiculously inflated prices. The game also feels like a complete console port and almost no effort has been made to hide it, hence the use of the crummy menu system to do anything and the almost complete lack of any customisation to the controls. With some work this could be a real contender in the MMO market but as it is, very little has changed from beta, and still many of the major bugs exist.  Its a total joke that this was released at full retail price. I know several people who brought in early to the colectors edition, seeing the square enix brand and after the fantastic games they have released in the past I couldnt fault them, sadly they were betrayed by a company with a big reputation. I hope this hurts square enix, I hope it hurts them a lot and scares other companies into thinking about releasing unfinished junk into the market.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1389718">Expand</a></span>

The whole system is very slow, the crafting system is an improvement: can get you exp AND crafting skill levels, however it is far too slow and makes it kind of boring (too many windows to have to be opened before actually get into the craft itself). The fact that you can set abilities from another job to you mage allows to customize the type of characters you want and make it unique, which can be good and kind of frustrating for people that like class specific. The party system, however, is a fail as everyone is just doing is thing on his own and not really relying on each others class specificity. The lack of quests is another bad point. The fact that you have to spend hours looking around bazaars in the hope to find what you&apos;re looking for is a time sink and very annoying. The auction house should have been implemented and the excuse of avoiding RMTs doesn&apos;t make any sense because they will be some anyways (already seeing them appearing) and they tend to actually put the economy down because of the massive amount of items they bring into the market so that it differs from overpriced items sold be players. A step back from FFXI in my opinion instead of an improvement (they could still have made a different system but keep players-friendly users). Now, instead of having the stress/fear of being killed while running to you grinding spot (and the time it took also to reach it, which all together made a nice experience until you could move faster with teleport/chocobos), you can just teleport around to go grind but have to spend hours just to try to gear you up. I&apos;m not even telling about the uber rare piece of gears, just basic equipements are just a pain in the a.. to find. i think that just the use of an AH or a similar system would decrease player&apos;s frustration a lot. How the skill/exp gain in a party has still to be adjusted so that it is not just &apos;soloing with a group of people&apos; and more based on cooperation (teamwork, yes please!). A function to sort inventory also should have been there from the start. The lag and/or slowness should also be worked out so that it doesn&apos;t take 10/15 just to sell the junk in the inventory (because you don&apos;t want to spend 1 hour putting those into your bazaar...). I am not far into the game yet but I kind of regret the huge maps where you can just explore the world and not series of tunnels leading to small areas. The graphic although are very very nice and deserve a thumb up. Not much talking in the &apos;/shout&apos; chat for the moment going on but this seems just a matter of time. No problems with the linkshell system, works like a charm. Don&apos;t indeed expect a game taking you by the hands (NPC with marks on their head to say HEY I have a quest for you), you have to talk to NPCs to actually see if they have some available (as far as I know, none anyways so far). So in the end, because of the problems of the system, the only enjoyable thing is to grind/guildleves and crafting a bit until gets too boring to wait 5s to 10s between each windows to open (and 5 minutes to craft one item). I would recommend to keep an eye on how it evolves but not to play right now if you are currently playing other MMOs that you like. If you seek a new MMOs to play, give it a shot (or go to a friend&apos;s place playing it) but surely do not expect the big revelation or the MMOs of the century. Take it as a new firm trying out to make a MMOs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1390032">Expand</a></span>

Yeah well I paid dearly for that. Truthfully, there IS a good game somewhere deep inside this devilish little game.. Unfortunately, the minds employed at Square Enix have proven again that they can create great concepts, but don&apos;t think through the consequences.<br><br>User Interface: AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. It is slow, clunky, tons of menus, no tutorials to tell you how to use it, and you constantly need to search fan sites to figure out how to add weapon skills, change equipment, etc. Once you understand it though, its not so awful, but WOW its bad.<br><br>Combat: Really kinda fun, but slow and honestly has a sluggish feel to it.<br><br>Crafting: I honestly don&apos;t know.. See the markets section.<br><br>Markets: This is where Square Enix had a swing and a miss. FFXI was nearly ruined by gil sellers/RMT&apos;s. So Square Enix decided that they would create this retainer system and have no auction house whatsoever. Basically this means, there are items for sale on individual NPC&apos;s that must first be loaded (and there&apos;s thousands of them) before you can browse their wares individually. No search feature.. Say what? NO SEARCH FEATURE. I searched for over an hour for a freakin&apos; hammer to become a blacksmith in the Market Ward (actually the Fieldcraft Ward since the update hit). I finally found it only to discover that the moron who was selling it wanted 30,000 gil for the crappiest hammer. WHAAtT?! So basically, you have no money, no hammer, and can&apos;t do anything. Resulting in the need to find a gil seller. OOPS SQUARE ENIX! Exactly what you were trying to avoid just got encouraged by your process. I applaud their effort to innovate, but internet technology needs about 10 years for this to work as it should, and even then it&apos;d be a pain because the user interface is so terrible. How did this get past the idea board?!<br><br>Verdict: People said the lack of tutorials made this game exceptionally difficult. I, a savvy MMO player thought i&apos;d be fine.. Nope, I was wrong. Even with a quad core processor, 4 gigs of RAM, and an EVGA nVidea GTX 460, the game can&apos;t run above 30 fps. The programming is just baaaddd here. So, I think this game has the potential to eventually fix itself. Square Enix said that major updates would be released once every 3 months................. WTF?! In all fairness, SE extended the trial period to 60 days instead of 30.. but that was just because they knew their game was busted as all hell and players were cancelling subscriptions and returning the game as defective. The 60 trial will return to 30 for new registrations after October 25 though. I do not think I want to spend money waiting for Square Enix to fix such basic problems as the UI, the map, the markets, and more. They aren&apos;t even going to fix the UI with programming, they&apos;re just gonna split zones up onto multiple servers and hope it helps. Really, this is an insulting excuse for an MMO, and for a Square Enix product. I think it&apos;ll be over a year before this game is really fixed to the extent it should be. Square Enix has officially become an awful company, incapable of looking out at consequences ahead of their decisions, and completely content with releasing bad products. They even admitted FF13 could have been better (that&apos;s a whole other can of worms), the 60 day trial affirms they know this FF14 is garbage, and I&apos;m pretty sure this ruined me ever buying FF13 Versus. Buyer BEWARE! This product is not prepared for market. Consider in one year when it is less than 25 dollars to buy (if SE ever goes that low. they don&apos;t even know how to properly price old games).<br><br>I will say this, if you have 4 to 5 friends willing to figure this out together.. Maybe you&apos;ll have fun. But playing this alone, and trying to get involved in the community.. omg, near impossible.<br><br>This review boils down to a great quote by the comedian Lewis Black: &quot;So I took a spoon.. and I shoved it in my a$$.. because, if I&apos;m gonna hurt this much... I&apos;m gonna do it to myself.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1391156">Expand</a></span>

Apparently you just check back every once in a while and hope for the best.  To be fair, there are a couple of quests, one when you begin, and one when you hit level 10, the latter giving you no indication that you should go get a quest.  From 10 to 20 you are on your own with Guildleves, that you can only do 8 of every 36 hours, and grinding.  Once you get to 20, you can expand a little bit and have a few more options.<br><br>Crafting in FFXIV is unnecessarily difficult.  I can appreciate that you don&apos;t just click a button and you magically have an item, but not being able to complete crafting leves you are several ranks higher than because of consistent failures is quite unreasonable.<br><br>Combat is boring and uneventful.  Engage, stand there, hit basic attack button until you can use another ability.  The whole time 1/3 of your attacks miss and another 1/3 are evaded, and even with advancing gear and stats this seemed to be all to prevalent a problem.  I played an Archer, and I might as well have been a melee class, every monster ended up in my face and the most effective way to kill it was to just stand there.<br><br>The UI is absolutely horrendous.  It is slow, clunky, and completely counter-productive.  It takes 5 minutes to clear out a full pack in FFXIV, whereas I can do that same task in 5 seconds in every other MMO.  The map is useless, since quests aren&apos;t tracked on it unless you go through the journal, which in itself is useless.  There are no indicators that an NPC might be important or have quests or missions.  You simply have to check every NPC you come by, every time you run by them, because there is no guidance as to when you might get a quest.<br><br>There is a simple fix:  Play Vanguard, Saga of Heroes, that game has an entertaining, challenging, and productive crafting system.  Play WoW, see how combat is fluid, fast, and entertaining.  I might recommend taking a look at WoW&apos;s UI as well.  And why the hell can&apos;t the characters jump?<br><br>I don&apos;t want a WoW clone, that is the last thing I want.  But the simple fact is that other game&apos;s UIs, gameplay, and social capabilities work.  I understand the need to be different and refreshing, but you can do that in other ways without making a nonsensical UI and a poor combat system.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1398443">Expand</a></span>

FFXIV does a few things right, but so many wrong it&apos;s downright baffling. Visually the game is in the top tier of MMOs, with nice high fidelity scenery, very well done player and item models. Unfortunately, that&apos;s about the only praise I can give it. It has beautiful scenery, but that scenery is copy pasted all over the world in such blatant fashion it&apos;s painful. You will walk through numerous areas where the exact same monsters are in mirrored positions from where you just came, and every rock/tree/bush/hill is in the same place as well.
<br>
<br>Performance is spotty at best on my high end gaming PC. Controls are sluggish if you use mouse and keyboard, almost forcing you to resort to using a controller. (Works well with 360 controller at least.) But the real meat and potatos of the game is the real problem. FFXIV took gameplay mechanics from FFXI that were already inherently not well balanced, and makes them worse. Gameplay is bogged down with tedium and artificial ways to increase time sunk into the game. Trying to craft a single item could take you hours upon hours, or 3x&apos;s+ the actual valve of the item.
<br>
<br>So, you say to yourself, FF games are about story! This is true in FFXI, the only MMO I know of where I cared about the story going on. Shame this is not the case here. There is almost no story content in the game so far as much as a small handful of scenes per city, and then nothing but the big experience cap wall to chip away at. In case you hadn&apos;t heard, FFXIV introduced a series of systems to restrict your experience gains. The first is an 8 hour limit per week, account wide, that any time past 8 hours means you start to lose out on experience. The second being more party/powerleveling related, where if your healer heals more than 5 times, exp is reduced or nullified.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s an honest shame. I actually enjoyed FFXI, regardless of it&apos;s flaws. I was truely hoping that SE would learn thier lessons from FFXI and carry them into a beautiful, well crafted, and enjoyable game. I can barely give it one of those three.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1385319">Expand</a></span>

I prefer a game which is fun to play, with a good story and good game play over the graphics. FFXIV Online sadly only does OK in the graphics department. I&apos;m saying OK, because the graphics aren&apos;t as amazing as some fanboys would make you think it is. Ofcourse, the CGI/cutscenes are great as expected from Square, however you will notice that most of the environment is the same and gets very boring quickly. The graphics are comparable to Eve Online, amazing but you&apos;ll notice the same everywhere.<br><br>I won&apos;t even go in detail regarding the other aspects of the game. I have played games made by ONE SINGLE PERSON and they were better in all the other aspects. I wonder how big Square&apos;s developer team was, but in my opinion and I am being serious, I believe it consisted of trained monkeys. No offense, OK maybe a little, because I was really looking forward to this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1385356">Expand</a></span>

I really don&apos;t like the fact that I can&apos;t even see the recipe that I have learned. Crafting looks cool but takes way too long to produce a single item. It&apos;s not the actual crafting time, it&apos;s the three second delay to do anything. Gathering is cool, but really, really cumbersome. Changing classes takes way too much time. You have to open your gear bag, mouse or joystick over to your slot,  find the weapon in your inventory, and then change the weapon, then delay...... class changed. It&apos;s annoying. The combat is slooooooow. I don&apos;t like how you can only take 8 quests every 48 hours. Sometimes you need to walk for 20 minutes just to get to the quest starting location. It&apos;s annoying. I guess I&apos;m really not impressed.

I&apos;m actually redoing my review in light of these new changes. The easiest way to explain how poor this game is, google &quot;Is FFXIV Ready to Play?&quot; Its a youtube video and it shows the simplest of bugs and as of this date it is still not fixed.<br><br>They&apos;ve finally added airships but those of us from FFXI will know its still not enough. &quot;The airship ride is over in a matter of seconds.&quot; Wow, even in FFXI you could see the area below but a year later they still can&apos;t implement it in FFXIV. It seems to me that this was a last minute ditch effort to at least be able to claim they have airships.<br><br>And chocobos. I&apos;m sorry but if it takes a whole year to implement chocobos... how long will it take to make the game playable. Too little too late.<br><br>The last time I logged in, the busiest city, Limsa Laminsa was bare. Only three people responded to my shouts. This does not bode well. When I asked where everyone was the reply I got was &quot;They&apos;re taking a break until the new update&quot; (chocobo update). We&apos;ll see. If they&apos;re smart they won&apos;t be on at all.<br><br>There is a reason this game was awarded &quot;Most Disappointing game of 2010&quot;. There&apos;s a reason it has the metascore it has.<br><br>If you like this game and you rated it a 10 it only goes to show how blind you are. I&apos;ve been playing Final Fantasy since Final Fantasy 6 on the SNES. After spending $80 on the Collector&apos;s Edition of FFXIV all I have to show for it is a stupid hardcover book. The Adventurer&apos;s Certificate never showed up and I&apos;m realizing now, almost a year later, it never will. Not that I care at this point, I&apos;m embarrassed to let any of my friends know I was ever interested.<br><br>If you want to be frustrated and then spat upon by Square Enix, give it a try.

I have read that SE took the time to observe what made WoW such a HIT; yet, SE failed to deliver. Even with the great graphics in this game, I cannot rate the game any higher than a 1. In addition, the game lacks an actual auctionhouse or something similar. All the FFXIV servers are located in Japan. Total letdown if you ask me! LAGGGGG much? You are also limited to a certain amount of questing/experience gain a day or so, which is dumbfounded. Terrible! Also creating additional characters seems to be frowned up in this game. There seems to be more work involved with actually adding new characters... and it is supposed to cost money too to have more than one character...

The graphic, music, and cutscenes are the only redeeming qualities but you won&apos;t even enjoy them since you&apos;ll be aggravated by almost everything else about the game.  MMO thrive on making its players feel the need to better their character, explore the world and do battle with the monsters it harbors.  The problem is that character development doesn&apos;t go farther than just giving new attacks with the same animations, the world is repetitive (cut and pasted) and lacking interesting vistas, and the combat is unresponsive, boring, and simplistic and you&apos;ll probably spent more time doing battle with the interface than monsters.  The time spent just waiting for menus to appear is just staggering.  It will take a major overhaul just to make this title enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1390151">Expand</a></span>

Being a SE Fanboy myself, i had high hopes for this game, sadly the clunky User Interface hampers any hopes of doing anything in a quick manner. Getting to your inventory alone takes forever, as you have to wait for the server lag to open your menu, then you have to wait for the lag once more, just to open your inventory.<br><br>Issues are still everywhere, with casters having the biggest one I&apos;ve found; Sometimes your spell will just not cast. In a game with no auto-attack, a spell being devoured by the lag spells death for a caster. The lack of an Auction House is  easily overlooked, as most games lack an AH at their release, but the Market Wards, SE&apos;s main way for players to sell their wares via Retainers, is a cluster mess of annoyance. Walking in alone, you wait for a minute before the Retainer NPCs load, and you proceed to go through each bazaar, hoping to find the item you seek. Crafting in the game is fun, for a whole five minutes. Once you realize to make anything, you&apos;re required to branch out into 5 other crafts, the weight of their system really comes crashing down. To make a single cloth armor piece, it requires the yarn to be made into cloth, the cloth is then made into back piece, front piece, and sleeves (if it has any). along with any materials from other crafts. Seems decent, right? Wrong, if it requires a dye, you have to find the dye to buy it, or go find the material to make the dye yourself (an Alchemy synth) most require leather, normally dyed. so you&apos;re picking up Leathercraft. Nothing is ever middle of the road in this game, you spend hours upon hours crafting to make a piece of gear.<br><br>Leveling in the game is a joke, at the start you gain ranks and physical levels like there&apos;s no tomorrow, but after hitting rank 10, the learning curve steeps up so drastically you&apos;re spending the next couple hours praying you gain SP off a mob. and at 20? well, i hope you enjoy your day long grind sessions.  Mob scaling is done so poorly, a blue dot next to the mob&apos;s name is meant to mean it&apos;s easy prey, something you can kill without an issue, while a red dot means it&apos;s very stronger than you, and it&apos;s best you don&apos;t mess with it.  Yet, a blue dot monster can easily kill me, while some red dot monsters are quickly skewered with my spear.  FFXIV has great potential, but the rushed half-arsed release that Square did, has greatly damaged the public&apos;s belief in their game. I cannot suggest anyone goes out and buys this game right now, but i do suggest you keep an eye for updates and forums to see how people&apos;s attitude changes. Maybe come PS3 release, Square-Enix will have gotten their rears in gear enough that the game&apos;s actually something to positively write about</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1392841">Expand</a></span>

Old PCs not up to par with XIV requirements, buy 2 $1100 PCs &amp; 2 $75 copies of collector&apos;s edition ($2950 total). Plan 1 week vacation for Sept. 22 - 29 for release date. Play for 4 weeks all the while literally rotating turns at forcing each other to get on and level in game we wanted to love. In short we didn&apos;t even &apos;like&apos; it, just simply put... not fun at all. Our final decision: /flamerage, quit, delete characters &amp; account, delete XI characters &amp; account and vow to never, ever ever give SE another penny. On an up side, we are loving Aion for the last week.    CONS: Game isn&apos;t fun, UI is bad, Buying/selling, lag, not fun, ZERO quests @ start to pull me in, virtually no story @ start to pull me in, fighting was a pain, guildleves were boring and repetitive, game itself not helpful and not fun, lots of copy pasted terrain that you cannot ignore after awhile, gear that can be worn by any level any job doesn&apos;t give me any drive to level to look/be a &apos;great hero&apos;. There are more for the con side but I cannot always remember everything about this broken lame game. The looks of the game itself and character creation are awesome features that I am going to put in the con section due to them being attached to such a bad game in every other way. (Besides I recently learned that Aion creation and world look just as nice if not better)    PROs Who cares? Not enough things to like about this game to out weigh the bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1398972">Expand</a></span>

Once you get past the pretty graphics theres really nothing. Story is predictable and boring, the quest system and limits on.. everything is ridiculuos. It has none of the staples that make a good MMO. The interface... I cannot believe they let that out the door. Sqaure Enix just released a stinker in everyway imaginable and the pricing model is predetory to put it kindly. I cannot say enough bad about this game. I ignored all of the reviews and traded in Drakes Fortune and Demon Souls to get this craptastic title and I wanna cry that I cannot return it to Game Stop. Worst of all theres nothing to do in this game... at all, no raids, no dungeons, no bosses.... nothing. I admit I only played for a few days, but I was dying and there was no lite at the end of the tunnel. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! Ignore the fanboys becuase that is just what they are. The kind of people Who would buy a brick if Steve Jobs called it an I Brick.

Myself and a few LS members from FFXI Bought the game and rolled on Besaid.<br><br>Sadly we were greeted with issues from the start...<br><br>Setting up an account was pretty painful (not as painful as dealing with PlayOnline, but a pretty close second). Patching up the game uses probably the most annoying torrent system I have ever used.<br><br>Once in game performance was OK, but the UI lag was pretty bad. The menu navigation is best described as tedious, as pretty much everything in the game requires you to sift through several menus and menu layers to get anything accomplished (add in the UI lag and you get frustrated really quick)<br><br>Combat: I have read everywhere from various fans how the combat is deep and engaging... I have no idea what game they are playing, but it is quite the opposite. Slow and cumbersome come to mind when describing the combat system in FFXIV. Melee combat isn&apos;t too slow, but slow enough. Spell casting on the other hand ends up being a lot of *Click target, click spell, click spell again to actually use the spell (sort of a confirmation that &apos;yes, I want to cast this&apos;) and then wait 5 to 20 seconds for the skill to go off, rinse repeat*.<br><br>Character advancement is pretty poor. You are presented with 8 guild leves every 36 hours, as well as a few local leves. Once these leves are completed (about 3 hours tops at around PL 22) the rest of your time will be spent grinding XP from mobs (which are few and far between and mostly controlled by grind parties) or crafting (which can be really expensive and even more tedious due in part to the plethora of menus/sub menus you have to trudge through for each step).<br><br>The community in the game is pretty elitist overall. While there are a few players who are willing to help others out or answer a few questions, a majority of the players we encountered usually replied with a &apos;This isn&apos;t WoW&apos; or just totally ignored us and our question.<br><br>Basically after several days of playing we decided to head back to FFXI. We were going to burn out the rest of our 30 days that came with the CE, but then decided it just wasn&apos;t worth the headache.<br><br>If you are interested in the game, grab a buddy key from a friend or wait until the have a free trial. I would not recommend buying the game unless you have tried it first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1385023">Expand</a></span>

After the cut scene, however, you&apos;re basically dropped off in the city with a &quot;good luck&quot;  The graphics are well done, too well, perhaps,  as even some high end gaming computers will struggle with it to be even semi-smooth.  The sound has two settings, off and loud, and gets very repetitive very fast.  The user-interface is slow and horrendously designed, to change weapons you have to open the main menu, and once you find the gear section, it doesnt only bring up items that can be placed in said equipment slot, it brings up your whole inventory, so you have to scroll through and find what you want.  The main quest line, which seems interesting, has quests that are too few and far between, and it relies on a system of &quot;levequests&quot;, of which you can only do 8 every 36 hours.  These are your standard MMO style quests, go here and kill x monsters, but leaves nothing to backstory about the world, or stories about characters, or anything.
<br>The crafting system, which Square Enix has clearly placed a lot of emphasis on, is neat and refreshing at first, but quickly becomes exceptionally irritating.  You have to either have their players website open and alt-tab to view recipes, or write them down yourself, as the game provides no in game recipe book.  Another downside to this, is that the only way to get gear is either to buy it from someone else or craft it yourself, the emphasis being on crafting it yourself.  This can be a horribly confusing and aggrivating process, as after farming for materials for hours, you finally go to make said item, and it breaks while you are crafting it, costing you both the materials and the time you spent gathering them.  Overall, while FFXIV is a visually beautiful game, the poorly designed menus, slow and shoddy targetting system, the almos impossible to read maps, the over-emphasis on an insanely coplex crafting system, and overall lack of feeling like you are actually a part of the world make this game not only feel much more like work than a game, its an insult to the many great games of the Final Fantasy series.

The game runs at a snail speed and it&apos;s so linear that you can&apos;t skip anything. The crafting system is decent if you care to figure it out.<br><br>I thought FF13 was boring, but this simply sets a new high. I Probably never watch on a final fantasy game the same way any more. Even free asian mmorpg&apos;s can beat this crap!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/final-fantasy-xiv-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=1387121">Expand</a></span>
