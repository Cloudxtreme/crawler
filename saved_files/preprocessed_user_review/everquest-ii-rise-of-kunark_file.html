Meeting new friends to journey with is easy to do in this new addition of EQ2. The daily player base is vast and the people you meet are loyal and courageous. PVP servers are very active and the combat will have you on the edge of your seat. Finding a party of players to head into the dangerous lands or to fight players is always just a few key strokes away. Just head into the cities and assemble your teams with the classes you wish to fight in your group. Player classes are diverse and the population is great in eq2. A well rounded group will sure find victory and glory on the battle field against players of the other cities and the inhabitants of the lands. With 6 types of Fighters, 6 Scouts, 6 Mages and 6 Priests Player classes are second to none in any MMO. Look up the classes available in EQ2 if you want to see a outstanding class set in any MMO I have ever seen. 24 in total, all very unique. Also the ability to fight on mounts like horses, magic carpets, rhinos, and wear wolfs. Fight in raid vs raid on pvp servers is very exciting. 24 players vs. 24 players all fighting and clashing swords or casting massive spells. Raid instances for 24 players and 12 players are included in RoK, as well as the solo raid mobs found in the back of huge zones at random. EQ2 is very graphical and the ability to tax even dual 8800 cards on max graphics in a raid setting. Enough said EQ2 rocks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/everquest-ii-rise-of-kunark/user-reviews?user_review_id=409653">Expand</a></span>

The Expansion RoK opens up new awesome looking areas, for all levels and up the level cap to 80. This expansion i think has brought me back for good. Visuals, New huntinggrounds, and character balance has been improved greatly, and theres tons of new gear to get, indefinetly the best expansion yet. :D (*Coughs* Fairys suck *coughs*)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/everquest-ii-rise-of-kunark/user-reviews?user_review_id=406558">Expand</a></span>
