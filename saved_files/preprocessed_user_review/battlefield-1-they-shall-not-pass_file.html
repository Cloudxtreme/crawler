For a small cost we have the French army is simply a skin; 4 new maps (they are beautiful, play beautiful, at the level of the original maps. VERDUN HEIGHTS I particularly liked), in General maps as maps that you can play on the original maps. If the original card you tired, then of course new maps you pribude to taste. Added New Game Mode - FRONTLINES. New mode I liked. But! He can be very lengthy (2 hours! in this mode, it is normal). Interesting and sweaty mode. Added 2 new tanks, stationary weapons, and a new elite class. Also we have a 6 new weapons (they are quite nice, but to open them you need to perform tasks, task light, but it would be without them, I&apos;m still paying for). A single company for no French (but this was expected). For the money, not very much, so be recommended to not can. But! If you play a lot of BF1, then of course buy. Others wait discounts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1-they-shall-not-pass/user-reviews?user_review_id=7197064">Expand</a></span>

That said, I will try to pin-point the main elements of this DLC:
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>- Frontline mode: Its a really nice touch. BF crew said several times they watched over &quot;Verdun&quot;, the game, when doing BF1. In this mode thats showed. When we all played operations in the main game, we saw some of the best elements of conquest and rush together. Here in frontlines we see the same, but in a smaller and more chaotic scale. Some people like the fact that there is no time limit, some ppl hate it. It doesnt matter. Frontlines as well as Operations capture the frenzy that is playing a BF game, and it also captures a lot the WW1 feeling, of pushing and falling back in the same attack.
<br>
<br>- New operations:
<br>- &quot;Devils Anvil&quot; (Verdun Heights followed by Fort Vaux): Best operation to date. No tanks, no planes, only infantry. No behemot, you get 4 elites. There is also a Siege weapon (big mortar) that fires up from attackers base or defense last sector if the team is failing. Verdun Heights its something just amazing. Really WW1 feeling, with all the smoke, the fire, the dust, the foxholes, the trenches, the ruins. Fort Vaux is a great close quarters map. As you probably remember when operation locker improved from operation metro...well, Fort Vaux improved Operation Locker idea.
<br>- Beyond the Marne: Cool operation, tank focused. Neither my favorite nor the worst. Too many tanks and airplanes and too big maps some would say, but all in all, a nice and fine operation.
<br>
<br>- New weapons: As usual, weapons of a just release DLC are usually a little OP. Its normal, not only because of the lack of massive testing, but bc DICE wants ppl who suck to buy the DLC to get some leverage over the other players lol. I dont get mad at that, its just bussiness ofc. But they are ok.
<br>
<br>Now the cons:
<br>
<br>- Really DICE...why not a new chapter of the awesome (but short as usual) campaign? For the first time a BF shooter focused on the people rather than the war, and this made the single player campaign something beautifull between so much horror the WW brought. Why not give us a chapter from the French side, who suffered so much? Why not give us a German or Austro Hungarian chapter, to remember us that there were no good and bad guys in this war as u said since minute 1? There is absolutely no explanation for this. They cant blame the team, they cant blame the money, they cant blame anything. They are charging us 50 USD for premium (60 for all DLCs bought separately). Thats the whole full price of the game. At least i expect 100% more content, and i think we are not gonna get that if we dont get single player campaigns.
<br>
<br>Hope you guys think this review is usefull. Ignore as usual those reviews that give the game a 1/2/3/4. Its pretty obvious those are rage trains. I think this is one of the best DLCs of a BF game for the last few years and i was pretty much suprised too see what DICE delivered. A little faith restored after so many dissapointments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1-they-shall-not-pass/user-reviews?user_review_id=7145596">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>They should unlock these weapons that people already paid for, and give the maps to everyone so that the player base isn&apos;t stupidly split. If they did that, I might consider recommending it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1-they-shall-not-pass/user-reviews?user_review_id=7098336">Expand</a></span>

Frontline is just beyond awesome, for first time i felt like i&apos;m in WWI warfare from Battlefield 1. DICE really needs to add Operation server browser and Frontline mode for maps like Quentin&apos;s Scar (trench area)</span>

Maybe this will be a great DLC once EA decides to just give them as part of the game, but I don&apos;t see how $60 for premium is worth it if there are no lobbies to play... I called EA and asked them for a refund because it was stupid to buy a game if you can&apos;t play it...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-1-they-shall-not-pass/user-reviews?user_review_id=7361613">Expand</a></span>
