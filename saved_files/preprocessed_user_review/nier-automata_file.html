<br>
<br>So, yeah, Nier: Automata. Sequel to 2010&apos;s Nier, which was a spinoff of the Drakengard series. Announced during Square-Enix&apos;s bizarre E3 conference in 2015, this game went under the code name Nier: New Project until its full reveal at the Paris Games Week show later in the year. It was delayed from its initial release window of November 2016 to give the team more time to work on improving gameplay balance the overall quality. Finally releasing in March of 2017, it has gone on to sell well over a million copies, making it one of Platinum&apos;s best-selling titles.
<br>
<br>I admit I didn&apos;t know much about the game until I noticed the demo available on the PS4 store. Seeing that it was a Platinum Games title, I kinda knew what I would be in for, and that I would likely enjoy it. I decided to give it a shot one night and, needless to say, I was more than impressed. I bought it for PC right around release and have been enjoying it since.
<br>
<br>As I said before, if you know Platinum&apos;s style, you know what to expect from a game like this. Frantic combat, a varied and dynamic soundtrack, a brilliantly-crafted story with memorable characters, and epic boss fights. But seeing as this is a Yoko Taro game, it has just the right amount of &quot;what the &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;?&quot; sprinkled in. It&apos;s equal parts heartwarming, heart-rending, hilarious, and horrifying, sometimes within the span of a few minutes. This game will mess with your emotions. One minute you could be fully engaged in a life-or-death struggle against a boss, and the next minute, the story will be tugging on your heartstrings.
<br>
<br>Now, there are a few things that I have to mention that keep it from being 100% perfect in my eyes:
<br>
<br>1. The PC port is bad. It&apos;s not terrible, and I&apos;ve seen much worse, but it needs work. For a while, I and many others couldn&apos;t play it due to a bug in graphics drivers causing the game to crash just from swinging around 2B&apos;s weapon. This was eventually fixed with a future driver, but there are still lingering issues that can be at least duct-taped over with the Far mod. If you get this game on Steam, you NEED the Far mod. It fixes some issues with fullscreen resolution and with stuttering during cutscenes. There are also some misc options and tweaks.
<br>
<br>2. The second playthrough was kind of a bummer, mostly because the character you play as is weak when it comes to combat and thus relies on a separate skill to take down enemies. Basically, you better hope you&apos;re good at twin-stick shooters. If you are, well, it just gets kinda tedious.
<br>
<br>Other than that, I can highly recommend this game. My best suggestion is to go in as blind as possible and do as many of the sidequests as possible to get the best experience. Also, the DLC isn&apos;t all that essential, but it has some fun extras like outfits and hair dyes, and a special boss fight.

<br>
<br>During the first ~10 hours of the game, i might&apos;ve given Nier: Automata a solid 7 / 10. Good gameplay that suffers from its out ambitions in a rather underperforming enviroment. Fun, but lacking in some aspects. Especially after the first few hours the game starts to get somewhat mundane and it needs a few hours to catch up with itself.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s difflicult to rate Nier: Automata without spoiling it, so let me put it that way: It doesn&apos;t feel like a focustestet product that&apos;s developed to match a certain target audience. This game was made by people who don&apos;t give a **** about the player and who just wanted to make the thing they wanted. Depending on how you vibe with those people, you either enjoy Automata tremendously or not at all.
<br>
<br>My 9/10 comes from a feeling i didn&apos;t had in a long time. It&apos;s most similiar to the feeling i had playing jrpgs as a child. Moving trough a foreign world in which everything could happen at any time. And that&apos;s worth quite a bit to me. For others, it might not worth be anything at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7092999">Expand</a></span>

<br>It steals your heart with a great soundtrack, with lots of &quot;occasional&quot; minor details and precise, smooth, almost flawless, characters moves.
<br>Unlinear in choices and alluring in way the world is seen, NieR Automata consuming you for hours, and then let&apos;s you think about possible alternatives, leading you back to the game.
<br>So it have my score of 85 which suffered for technical part of PC release, and lacking of implemented environmental effects on foliage, grass, sand, etc. (which are costly in performance issues, but can make game even more immersive)...
<br>...but!
<br>As long as metacritic have no such userscore and i still have ways to explore this game more
<br>- it&apos;s solid 9 without any doubt.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7098935">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>+ Interesting story, great atmosphere (if you care about post-apocalyptic worlds) and astounding music.
<br>+ Fast-paced gameplay, presented as a mix of different genres.
<br>+ The game supports all resolutions (e.g. 3440x1440) and has MSAA anti-aliasing, which is a pretty rare thing for console ports (be careful to properly configure your settings: x8 or even x4 MSAA* is extremely demanding* thing).
<br>
<br>- There&apos;s a chance that some people will find this game less enjoyable without a gamepad. While a keyboard/mouse support is not that bad, it&apos;s still far from perfect.
<br>- At this moment (20 March 2017) there&apos;s an issue with fullscreen mode. If you have a monitor with resolution higher than 1920x1080, you need to:
<br>
<br>a. Enable windowed mode and use &quot;Borderless Gaming&quot; application. Please remember to not download 3rd-party software from any suspicious websites &#x2212;&#xA0;either buy it on Steam or get it for free on GitHub.
<br>b. Use a fix for fullscreen mode. To install the fix, search &quot;FAR (Fix Automata Resolution)&quot; on Steam forums.
<br>
<br>*If you have a low-performance PC, be sure to disable anti-aliasing and use post-processing AA instead (SMAA or FXAA via Reshade).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7098904">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The fans insisted that this game was going to be a revelation in the endings after A: that it would completely turn my understanding inside out; that I would face astonishing philosophical ideas; that I would cry multiple times at the heart-wrenching story. None of those things happened. It&apos;s a very typical anime-esque story that ticks every box on the Typical Anime Plot Points list. The examination of violence in games is about as light and straightforward as it can possibly be. The character I&apos;m meant to care for the most is absurdly stupid, as is the Real Story about how YoRHa works.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s undeniably stylish, and it plays with game design standards in some delightful ways at times. The combat is not so great. At least it becomes entertainingly spectacular later on, but there&apos;s a problem at the core. You have plug-in chips that radically improve your fighting abilities. On one hand, it&apos;s up to you if you use them and make the game very easy. On the other, if you die you&apos;ll have to hunt for your body and reabsorb it, otherwise you&apos;ll lose your inventory. This is enough of an annoyance that most players are going to load up their best chips simply to avoid that tedious hunting.
<br>
<br>Despite how shallow it turns out to be, it&apos;s impossible not to become fond of its world. There&apos;s a strong design language to it all, and once you&apos;ve played it you will never forget it. Even so, I wasn&apos;t enjoying myself in the first dozen hours and I spent most of the final stretch attempting to race through it because I just wanted it to be over. Maybe I shouldn&apos;t have done as many side quests as I did, but 38 hours is way too long for a game of this type. Many of the side quests were mind-numbingly bad, and the game would have benefited greatly from having most of them removed, plus many of the main missions.
<br>
<br>I wanted to like Nier:Automata much more than I did. There&apos;s no question that N:A has many touches of brilliance. It&apos;s a great example of the benefits of an auteur creator being given the green light to make a very personal vision come to life. However,  I can&apos;t give a higher rating to a game that made me plod through so many unenjoyable hours. It&apos;s still good, on balance, but &quot;balance&quot; is the operative word. This is a 9/10 game whipped together with a 5/10 game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7208203">Expand</a></span>

<br>Second review after having spent more than 15 hours in the game.  I had given an 8, almost a 9.
<br>Down to 6 because of the uneven framrate throughout the different areas of the game.</span>

Square Enix has long locked the game from Asian region while serving the fanbase in western countries. And when it came to the release day for China eventually, the game sold well like hell with a price of 199 RMB, but in the wake of strong sales, SE pumped up the price to a heilish 412 RMB, which happened two hours right after the unlock in Chinese region and this new price is even higher than that of its global day-one release! If you think you&apos;re so wealthy but have no place to spare your money upon, then you&apos;re more than welcome to come to China and buy this game, because in China, the price for this one is the most expensive among all nations in the world!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7273918">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Nier is overhyped, everyone knew that though, some people will love the game, most people will find it fairly generic
<br>
<br>The first portion of the game up until defeating the first boss, i had to use my melee attack a massive 3 times, and those 3 swings were during the boss battle, for the first portion of the game i could have used electrical tape to hold down my L1 button and not had my experience diminished
<br>
<br>Graphically speaking the game is ok i guess, as a PC gamer its hard to be &quot;impressed&quot; by graphical quality that you&apos;ve seen in numerous places before, level design was pretty bland for the section i played but i apreciate that this is mostly a tutorial section, that being said its all you had to win me over and it didn&apos;t, and thats before you mention the horrid 30FPS during cutscenes, what is this, 2006?
<br>
<br>Audio, the music, what little i&apos;ve heard was fairly decent, noting stood out as bad and the sound effects seemed ok, someone actually put some work in to that so i&apos;m impressed, the voice acting, well i get that they are robots but even for robots the acting was bland, i couldn&apos;t tell if it was just the voice actors being bored or not
<br>
<br>Gameplay, having only experienced the first section of the game i can&apos;t comment on the rest, but it must have changed genre about 6 times, there was 3rd person, top down, sode scrolling shooter, vertical shooter, twin stick shooter and platformer that i counted, the constant changes between genres was jarring, on top of that it didn&apos;t really do any of them particularly well, it wasn&apos;t engaging and it makes it feel like nobody could settle on what this game was meant to be
<br>
<br>All in all i would probably give this game a 5 out of 10, if you can pick it up for cheap during the christmas sale then its alright, but at &#xA3;40 i expect a little more, although considering square-enixs love of mediocre games recently, i can&apos;t say i&apos;m overly surprised
<br>
<br>If you like constant transitions between genres and generic gameplay then you might enjoy this game, if you&apos;re expecting something more engaging then you probably should look elsewhere</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7286057">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I am rating specifically PC version quite low. The game looks interesting, but it&apos;s seriously unplayable on PC with keyboard and mouse. Camera auto-focus, typical for consoles, is super annoying for a PC game. Given all that and the lack of saves, I was not even able to complete the first mission in like 5 tries, until I switched to Easy. And then it was basically &quot;mash a button&quot; game.</span>

<br>mostly I binged this game because for the most part while I was playing, I felt like I had to keep playing to get to the meat. There were some points where I felt like I was really enjoying it and made it worthwhile to keep going. in the long run though, I really feel like the developer wasted a lot of my time.  It seems like this game has so much padding and it&apos;s really not fair.  The developer tries to be &apos;clever&apos; by reusing set pieces to tell the story from a different perspective, but honestly, these different perspectives could be done in a much more fun and enjoyable game. not by forcing me to play through the entire game again.  It&apos;s like a lot of the game was &apos;held back&apos; for playthrough number 2, when it should have been right there in the game the first time round maybe as optional missions or as exposition.  It reminds me a lot of devil may cry 4, where it required you to play the game again backwards in order to get to the end.  In retrospect, I feel like I wasted a lot of my life playing this, I got too involved and it was actually quite bad for my mental health.   I recommend against this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7202250">Expand</a></span>

<br>The performance is stable, with no frame rate drops below 40 on heavier action scenes,
<br>Great port, kudos to platinum.
<br>The full screen bug is there, hope it gets fixed soon. Temporary fix will be to use Borderless Gaming App.</span>

<br>
<br>Played for around 13 hours and the game is incredible, 10/10 soundtrack, really good fighting system easy to learn and satisfying that feels fast and smooth at the same time, the main story is excellent and the secondary missions really helps you (not like other games where secondary missions are filler material).
<br>
<br>Overall the game is Game of The Year contender and is a strong 9.5/10, the only issue is in some cutscenes that go down to 30 fps but aside that the rest is perfect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7093950">Expand</a></span>

Sebbene infatti pecchi un po&#x2019; a livello tecnico per questioni legate al frame, tutto il resto invece &#xE8; impeccabile e riesce a farvi dimenticare ogni problema. Le musiche sono coinvolgenti e rievocano in voi delle sensazioni fenomenali, quasi come se, invece che giocare, foste l&#xEC; a seguire quelle vicende. La trama poi &#xE8; davvero piacevole, il connubio uomo-macchina che da sempre riesce a farsi spazio nel cuore degli uomini, quella domanda: le macchine saranno mai come gli uomini? Una questione dalle mille sfaccettature che ci viene presentata sotto una luce intrigante. Il tutto contornato da ambientazioni favolose e un gameplay davvero ricco e ben strutturato che non ha nulla da invidiare, un hack and slash con sfaccettature da GDR, arricchito da mini-giochi e cambi di prospettiva. Insomma un titolo da avere assolutamente all&#x2019;interno della propria libreria. Per non parlare dei finali; credevate che la prima volta, fosse tutto finito?

<br>
<br>Or is it?
<br>
<br>Nier: Automata is a game full of plot twists, though some are rather predictable, as well as a number of big epic moments and a lot of attempts to pull on the player&#x2019;s heartstrings, with varying degrees of success. Featuring three protagonists and almost two-dozen joke endings, as well as a couple of real ones, this is a game which goes on well past its welcome, and then some.
<br>
<br>But I&#x2019;m getting ahead of myself.
<br>
<br>As an action RPG, this game has a fairly reasonable set of mechanics on the surface &#x2013; you can run around shooting at enemies with your pod, a floating machine which follows you around, or cut them up in close combat with various weapons &#x2013; spears, short swords, large swords, and gauntlets. Each class of weapon has its own attack pattern, and two of the characters can wield two weapons at the same time, allowing them to combo the weapons together, while the third character has a hacking ability which causes them to play a brief shoot-em-up game to deal their opponent damage.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, while these mechanics all sound well and good, it quickly becomes clear that the game doesn&#x2019;t really work mechanically. The abundance of healing items means that you can pretty easily prevent your death by simply using them at will, and you get &#x201C;plug-in chips&#x201D; which can include various abilities to give yourself more hit points or regenerate by killing enemies, dealing damage, or simply standing around without taking damage. Given you can deal damage from range, it is pretty easy to kite most enemies around, and it is very easy to either be underleveled for the content (which makes it take a while to wear down enemies) or overlevelled (which trivializes the combat even more, though it is not actually all that hard to take down enemies even 20 levels above your own, though it is tedious to do so). There is a crafting system based on combining the plug-in chips into better versions of themselves, as well as upgrading the weapons and pods to deal more damage, and gathering the materials for such can become rather tedious, doubly so as you must upgrade all your weapons to the maximum level to face the optional (and hardest) boss in the game.
<br>
<br>Alas, the game&#x2019;s enemy variety leaves something to be desired; there&#x2019;s maybe a couple dozen kinds of enemies in the game apart from bosses, but most of them are fundamentally either &#x201C;stab you in close combat&#x201D; or &#x201C;shoot you from range&#x201D;. Most of the machine lifeforms are slow and clunky, making for pretty samey combat and making it easy to simply run around kiting them and shooting them to death while avoiding their slow projectiles. By the first time you&#x2019;ve beaten the game, you will likely be tired of the normal enemies, but don&#x2019;t worry &#x2013; you&#x2019;ll get to fight them even more later on!
<br>
<br>Because, you see, this game has an interesting definition of &#x201C;beating&#x201D; it. The first time you beat the game, it coyly encourages you to keep playing&#x2026; at which point, you start the game over, except from the perspective of your sidekick character. This means that most of the content you experience will be the same, with only the beginning and end really differing, though you get even more tedious side-quests on his route (and the opportunity to finish up any you failed to finish the first time through).
<br>
<br>Once you beat the game the second time through, and see  ending, the game ends with a screen seeming to promise a sequel&#x2026; but it is not, it is actually the other two endings of the game, which you get through by playing through the game a third time, though this time, instead of replaying the first half of the game, instead you&#x2019;re actually playing all-new content which you could only access by effectively playing the first half of the game twice. Joy.
<br>
<br>If this game was nothing but the main story, and if it cut out a lot of the RPG mechanics, it would actually be a lot more interesting &#x2013; the bosses are, on the whole, of fairly interesting design, and the core story is fairly decent, even if some of the characters you&#x2019;re supposed to care about feel a bit underchracterized in the anime sort of way, where they suddenly get some focus right before they die. The second half of the game focuses half on a character who previously had gotten almost no focus at all, which feels kind of weird, and while by the end you do care about her, it ends up feeling less than tight in terms of writing. I would have liked to care a lot more about a lot of the characters, but they don&#x2019;t get enough screen time for it, despite the game&apos;s 50 hours of run time.
<br>
<br>My advice? Skip it unless you&apos;ve got a lot of free time on your hands. The high points are good, but you have to wade through a lot of junk to get there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7442752">Expand</a></span>

Its an okay console port. The graphics are ok, but nothing special. The world looks empty and sterile. The game itself is a 3rd Person Action/Slayer wit RPG elements. Smaller parts of the game are played as a side scroller or as a top-down 2d shooter. That concept is fun, supportet by the good camera work. The controls are horrible on PC. The well known console port disaster. Please play it with a controller to have more fun. The sound and music is in good quality, the music annoyed me after some time because of its style. The fights are fun, you got some &quot;Oh my god&quot; Moments when giant Bossmonsters enter the fight.
<br>Storytelling is good so far. I think its just not 100% my genre and got some minor flaws. Dont buy it full price, maybe for 30-40$, if you are a fan of games like Nier. Watch some gameplay trailers to get a look at the gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7318391">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Graphics: 8 Technically the graphics are ps3 but the artwork is amazing and builds excellent atmosphere.The game has performance issues though and the optimization for the pc is bad.Nothing game-breaking but you will get dips below 60 fps even with high end cards while the graphics don&apos;t seem so demanding.Artwork&gt;graphics so 8/10 here
<br>
<br>Sound: 9 The soundtrack is truly memorable,one of the best i have heard in years in a videogame and it really compliments the mysterious setting of the game.The fx sound of the game is good, could be worse could be better.Not every dialog is voice acted though.It gest a 9 mostly for the amazing soundtrack
<br>
<br>Gameplay: 7 Serious balancing issues for the difficulty levels.Very hard=one hit killed.That makes the different enemies irrelevant. Weather u get him by the smallest enemy or from the largest robot it&apos;s the same and it kills any purpose of having different enemies and different levels of enemies.In normal u have to try hard to get killed.the camera is bad in this game.You don&apos;t have lock on on hard and very hard and i had to move the camera far away from me because u constantly get attacked my mobs and u have to be aware of your surroundings 360 degrees.That creates another problem and that is that u can&apos;t really see the animations of the opponents when the are ready to strike.This and the fact that u always get attacked by mobs makes the combat more like hit,hit evade and repeat repetitively without really reacting to whats happening on the battle.Combat can be satisfying but it has these serious problems that truly hold it back from being great and deep.
<br>
<br>In conclusion i give it a 7/10 it is a game with fresh ideas, excellent setting and atmosphere,engaging story and there is some fun to be had by the combat but at the same time it is severely flawed in the battle department,difficulty imbalance and performance issues it has.I find it quite good but certainly overestimated and judging by the scores it got and from the fact that it is developed by a company that i absolutely love, i must say i am a little bit disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7188419">Expand</a></span>

<br>Me and many of my friends had the issue where the game would render at 720p when set to fullscreen and there were really bizarre framedrops on high end systems that greatly exceed the recommended specs.
<br>
<br>The PC port is a mess, seems to work for some, some choose to live with the issues, some seemingly have none, but I have yet to see any evidence from those people.

<br>The game itself might be good, but when it doesn&apos;t even function. It gets a zero.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7092512">Expand</a></span>

<br>- First this isn&apos;t really an rpg. Its far closer to a platformer. the &quot;rpg&quot; elements seam to be tacked on and slight at that, to appease people that no longer want platformers. &quot;oh look its an rpg!&quot;
<br>- The camera constantly changes perspectives from side stroller (ya no jokes, side scrolling.. really!) to top down, to over the shoulder. This game has no idea what it wants to be.
<br>- The pc controls were so bad that they gave me cancer. I was healthy yesterday but after playing a few hours of this, I got cancer. I have never played a PC game with worse controls. people have said &quot;blaw blaw blaw controller blaw blaw&quot; If I had wanted to use a controller I wouldn&apos;t have gotten it on pc. And even so, there is no excuse for how poor the controls were.
<br>- The voice acting is terrible. Just BAD. The story was poor the dialog was terrible. The entire thing felt like a kick starter venture with slightly better graphics.
<br>- Then there are the swords.. The hell is up with the swords? news flash if you have a gun, you don&apos;t need swords. I didn&apos;t use them once, not one time, EVER. they just floated along behind you. No one is going to be stupid enough to send you into battle with a giant clunky inferior weapon when you have something better.
<br>I seriously regret the little time I put into this game, I would like that part of my life back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7445656">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been playing video games for around 18 years now and all this time has left me jaded towards the medium. I&apos;ve found it increasingly harder to find games that can capture my enjoyment and provide me an awe inspiring experience that can take me away from the real world like when I was younger. Nier Automata is one of those rare gems in gaming that brings me back to why I fell in love with the medium in the first place. Nier is the only game since the Witcher 3 that had me blink and 10 hours had passed without my noticing. Yoko Taro and his team have created a masterpiece that nobody should miss.
<br>
<br>I will start by saying that I haven&apos;t played a Yoko Taro directed game before, but I have heard a lot of great things about his weird world that he has created that links between multiple games and franchises (Nier/Drakengard respectively) so I was really excited when I heard that Square decided to give him a good budget and a very well known studio for their character action games (Platinum) to make a sequel to the original Nier from the previous generation. So without any doubt and after hearing that it got a PC release I instantly purchased it, because I was fascinated by what Yoko Taro could do.
<br>
<br>And what a fantastic job he and his team at Platinum Games have done. A game that shouldn&apos;t be passed on by ANYONE, because it does something that I, personally, haven&apos;t encountered in a game before (which I won&apos;t spoil here, because you HAVE TO experience it yourself).
<br>
<br>Imagine a Platinum game that has exquisite combat, a director that is so masterful in how he presents the story giving small information and tidbits as you go along and a soundrack by a composer that is well known (Keiichi Okabe) that you take a few moments from playing the game just to listen to the music..it&apos;s THAT GOOD.
<br>
<br>I won&apos;t go much into the story of the game, because it&apos;s very easy to spoil, but the story and overarching plot is so well done and it makes you question a lot of things about humanity, emotions, life itself and many other things.
<br>
<br>This has been an eye opening experience that I will never forget. From the amazing soundtrack by Keiichi Okabe to the wonderful directing and story by Yoko Taro and the combat by Platinum games..they all mesh together to create one of the best Action RPG&apos;s that I have ever played. Yes, the fetch quests can be tedious and grinding can be a pain at times to achieve everything this game has to offer, but I did not waver and was fascinated by this world.
<br>
<br>I will now post a quote from Jim Sterling&apos;s review that resonated with me so much that I cannot state it better as an ending to this lenghty review:
<br>
<br>&quot;Nier itself is important. It is, as far as I&#x2019;m concerned, historically significant in terms of its design and the way in which it uses the framework of a videogame to tell an evolving story. If I had my way, every budding game developer would play this game to the point of acquiring endings A, B, C, D, and E before acquiescing to its final and alarmingly direct request.
<br>
<br>Few games are able to showcase the power of the medium like Nier: Automata.
<br>
<br>If history forgets this game, then **** history.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7138200">Expand</a></span>

<br>Ses 10 Neden?
<br>Diyaloglar,m&#xFC;zikler,d&#xF6;v&#xFC;&#x15F;&#xFC;rken vuru&#x15F; hiss hepsi olduk&#xE7;a doyurucu olmu&#x15F;lar ve bun burada hata g&#xF6;remedim.

<br>
<br>Genel ortalamas&#x131; 8.1
<br>Oyun g&#xFC;zel ve bu sorunlar &#xE7;&#xF6;z&#xFC;lecek sorunlar ama kesinlikle fiyat&#x131;na g&#xF6;re bir AAA oyunu gibi durmuyor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7094049">Expand</a></span>

<br>NieR: Automata is a curious game. And she immediately felt made by the Japanese - in a good way.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a slasher with RPG elements. The combat system works fine, from fighting with robots get pleasure from a good slasher without the hundreds of combo. Oh, and the robots themselves sometimes quite funny. Their design is nice as the design in General of all characters in the game. Of course, everyone likes the main character 2B - it is the main sex symbol in the games this year. Even girls will find their favourite.
<br>
<br>In NieR: Automata we travel through the open world. And it is time for developers to deviate from this trend. How much can you make empty open worlds? In this game the world is moderately interesting to explore - yet it is the Earth after the disaster, but it would be possible to make it a little more alive. To overcome the large space, and animals that well, especially the animal must first lure.
<br>
<br>Graphics. We returned in 2007. The game doesn&apos;t look modern. For this reason, optimization should be elegant, but it is commendable. Not terrible, and thanks for that.
<br>
<br>We overcome this open world for the sake of interesting stories. You can even skip the side quests and only go for the main plot - nothing to lose. To the PC version, I have read the game - Yes, for the sake of this plot is to beat the game. But not once - 3 times. It is necessary that to know the WHOLE story. It&apos;s an unusual approach, but it is interesting. Under the new passage, they give you no loot and story elements.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7093406">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s a very confusing game. But it&apos;s very, very good.  I&apos;m actually having trouble making myself attack some of the &quot;enemies&quot; because I would feel bad about it afterwards.  And I play Dark Souls.  So yeah.  It&apos;s one of those games.</span>

A2 was okay character the only interesting character in the game. the music? that wasnt bad at all, but nier1 music is still way better! i never understand why everybody love platinum games gameplay mechanic in nier automata have full of irritating things in combat, and gameplay,Ai is a joke i dont even want to mention that.. overall its a boring game! overhyped/ overrated as hell, NIER1 was better than this, the only interesting part of this game more or less was the story.The minigame hacking was *** irritating, i really hated it! it was like a good concept but in reallity was a bad mistake. the PC version of this game is nearly unplayable, bad frame rates on machines what can run witcher3 on ultra with nvidia hair effects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7331743">Expand</a></span>

<br>+Interesting story

<br>A game that plays itself.
<br>Nier Automata is a 3rd person hack and slash open world action adventure rpg game where you play as android 2B accompanied by 9s and a droid
<br>This game takes place after Nier, though this is a spin off, there are nods to the past game here// but other than to appreciate those moments, playing the past games is unnecessary..
<br>This continues the human vs robot war in a post-apocalyptic open world where robots are beginning to feel emotion&#x2026;
<br>2B and 9S have an endearing relationship here... 2B being programmed to be more calm and composed, while 9s is more emotional&#x2026;
<br>Leads for some great moments and dialog in the game,, its just a shame theyre so few and far between because watching their growth is the best part of the game..
<br>The game takes around 8 hours to complete&#x2026; though there are multiple endings and perspectives the game shows you if you&#x2019;re interested in checking them out...
<br>After playing through Automata the first time though... I was fine with that ending being my final ending&#x2026;
<br>Because unfortunately neither the story nor the world enticed me enough to want to play again
<br>The world is tiny, dull, colorless, lifeless, not fun to explore&#x2026;
<br>And the entire 8 hour journey is spent revisiting all of these locations over and over&#x2026;
<br>There were very few moments I thought wow... this game is beautiful or this section is really cool&#x2026;
<br>It looks and feels generic throughout&#x2026;
<br>I did enjoy the fact that the camera is constantly pulling in and out, changing game perspective, to where at times the game feels like a 2d platformer.. I just wish more was done with it than give us the typical grey and brown rusty structures to run through&#x2026;
<br>For the most part you get a task, go to the location on the map, turn in your progress, go to a different location... fight a boss that all but maybe 2 are just spongier hack and slash battles&#x2026; rinse and repeat&#x2026;
<br>The world feels connected&#x2026; but back to the point that it feels generic&#x2026;
<br>Nothing feels like you haven&#x2019;t seen it before&#x2026;
<br>Making your journey back and forth feel like a drag&#x2026;
<br>the combat here is fairly fun&#x2026; I wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily call it satisfying though&#x2026;
<br>Not much to it other than light and heavy attacks&#x2026;
<br>You can find new weapons in the world and upgrade them with the parts and materials you find in the world and off of robots to make the battle grind a little quicker&#x2026;
<br>but much like the world... the combat was just there. It was good&#x2026; the world is good... but again, never felt fun to me&#x2026; just existing
<br>plus there&#x2019;s a setting in the game where all you have to do is move your character... The game does the attacking for you&#x2026;
<br>Almost turning this into a twin stick shooter hack and slash game if you want&#x2026;
<br>I dipped my toes in both styles
<br>but after fighting enemies that all felt the same over and over... I actually started to prefer the autopilot mode.
<br>I&#x2019;m sorry, I know this dislikes are coming... I&#x2019;m in the minority here&#x2026;
<br>But I don&#x2019;t see the upper 8s and 9s this game is getting by everyone else
<br>Nier Automata has great characters in B2 and 9S...
<br>But the story of these robots feeling emotion is never told in an impactful way&#x2026;
<br>the world is no fun to explore..
<br>the bosses feel uninspired and the combat is just there&#x2026;
<br>This is a good game, I had fun&#x2026;
<br>you won&#x2019;t regret playing through&#x2026;
<br>but I don&#x2019;t honestly believe you&#x2019;re missing anything if you choose to skip this one&#x2026;
<br>I give Nier Automata
<br>a 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7095233">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The gameplay is a master piece, the controls are great, the background music is marvelous, the characters have a good design(2B is pure love) and the artistic details are good, the graphics are well, not like a Witcher 3 or Rise of Tomb Raider, but they work perfect.
<br>
<br>I own a good PC with a nvidia gtx 1080, and I don&apos;t have until now any major issue with this game, the fps are constant on 60fps, I use a 2k resolution to played, and everything works perfect.
<br>
<br>What can I say? Buy it, if you like the rpg and action games, these game is a master piece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7146720">Expand</a></span>

Weird FPS drops during cutscenes (have 50-60 [that thanks to editing config file, cause yea, without I would have 30 max, and 15 during cutscenes.. - do not understand the logic why it is blocked..] during boss fights, but when main character clench her fist, I have drop to 15FPS? Everytime, reloaded this moment 3 or more times. And that&apos;s not the only one moment. Somehow cutscenes are really bad made). (major)
<br>4. After getting out from bunker elevator weird things happens. Cant run right/left on my pad. Fixed by clicking keyboard button (Whaaaat?). But there was workaround, now, that pushed me the most to put this negative: Now after leaving elevator in bunker, I have to reset game, cause running again does not work left/right and keyboard does not help. Nor camera works at all, so somehow my character run behind camera ... (critical)

<br>I am updating this review after.. 4 months? Well.. Square Enix.. worst studio. I am writing refund letter right now. That is a joke... no simple patches, they abandoned it, still they want money!?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7137154">Expand</a></span>

This definitely doesn&apos;t look like a Playstation 4 gen game, don&apos;t let fake images and videos fool you. I do like the setting/theme of of the game and even though the graphics are bad the world has a certain charm to it.
<br>
<br>The story this far (8 hours playtime) is nothing special. Even though most of the side quests are standard fetch quests, they all have little twists and funny dialogues so they don&apos;t feel as bland as in many other games.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is where the game shines however and anyone who like Bayonetta will like this as well. The constant switch between third person, top down and side scrolling feels really fresh and unique as well. The games switches from a linear robot smashing prologue to an open world MMO-like game and then to something completely different. They have done a really good job of merging different genres into one game. Bosses are well designed and I seriously don&apos;t even want to know what goes on in the head of the designers, it&apos;s messed up, but in a good way!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7096981">Expand</a></span>

<br>Nier Automata is one of the greatest game I&apos;ve ever played; the story is so much engaging with a lot of hidden messages and plot twisted; open world feel great, the combat system is one of my favourites, you can create as many combos as you like. Also, the thing that keeps me playing for hours without getting bored are the soundtracks; I can&apos;t find any others game that has this kind of music that is so epic. The game running 2k/60fps smoothly in my PC
<br>Resolution fix: Download Borderless Gaming and Enjoy
<br>Gameplay: 10/10
<br>Graphic: 10/10
<br>Story:10/10
<br>Soundtrack: 11/10
<br>Overall: 10/10 ( If I can grade 100/10 I&apos;m still giving it 100) best game ever
<br>This game by far is the greatest Yoko Taro game that I enjoyed
<br>I&apos;m not recommended this game if you have a job or school, u will get addictive enough to drop all your life behind and finished it
<br>Best game of the year confirmed will play it again and again and again, money well spent

<br>
<br>The system of managing your characters stats as chips is really cool. You have a finite area to plug them in, and the more special chips (with a diamond symbol) can perform the same routine while taking up a smaller number of &quot;slots&quot; so you get the same stat boost more efficiently. The game allows you to re-arrange and swap out chips to rebuild your entire character&apos;s spec as needed. I really enjoyed remapping the whole stack for boss encounters - really unique system and I hope other games steal this idea.
<br>
<br>Two of my favorite gaming genres are fighting games and shmups, I love arcade style action. Platinum managed to blend those styles of play into a JRPG of all things. Very impressed.
<br>
<br>I just finished playing 3rd play through (2nd is a different perspective same timeline, 3rd is continuation of the story so at least 3 needed, don&apos;t stop!) and wow - it shot to the top 5 games of all time for me. Don&apos;t miss it - what a surprise. Masterpiece. These don&apos;t come along that often.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7154180">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Cons
<br>
<br>Optimization:Sadly another failurie port for pc they should look how well gta 5 did this idk is it so hard? why there is too many failed games
<br>Graphics(small con): i expected better also 30fps pre-rendered cutscenes really ? cmn pc is master race dude level design is also pretty empty not that good.
<br>Combat:  its decent hack/slash style fun to play for sure but dodge system (double tap) is cancer  you cant expect good combat with fail optimization anyway.
<br>
<br>&#x130; would probably rate 9 if i played well optimized version its really shame they are ruining this beautiful game with ignroing fixable problems</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7328064">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is pretty satisfying for most of the game however, and slightly underwhelming when playing as 9S. However the soundtrack, the songs, and the plot are great. It would be a bit better I think if they left some major plot points less ambiguous, but I guess that&apos;s Yoko Taro for you.
<br>The bad thing is the ending section with the credits needs to be easier offline. I am pretty good at bullet hell games, but for the ps4 controller it was hard for me to navigate the last scene. I had to go onto multiplayer.

<br>I got some hours playing and not finished the game. I&apos;ll try to make it simple and short for whoever will read this, with my pros and cons:
<br>
<br>+ Beautiful music
<br>+ Good playability and nice (and fast) combats
<br>+ Nice butt (XD)
<br>
<br>- No skill tree, so you lvl up and can&apos;t do a s**t with that, it just add status to your character
<br>- Locked at 60 fps and still horrible stuttering when moving around the map or in combat
<br>- The worst point is that after some hours of gameplay the game starts getting boring, repetitive, and with no skill tree I lose motivation for killing machines
<br>- Secondary missions are (again) repetitive and simple
<br>- Graphics are simply not good, there are tons of games with 5+ years old and they look much better, and the colors in this game are bad
<br>
<br>So, maybe it&apos;s a good game for people that&apos;s new in this kind of game or PC gaming (mainly for the fps cap and graphics, oh and the frame drops) but not for other people, especially when a game gets boring, because It is the opposite of what you are looking for in a game.
<br>
<br>Note that you can upgrade your weapons and add chips to your body, improving status and getting some abilities, but even then I feel like I was playing the same battles again and again. Just my point of view.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7171347">Expand</a></span>

<br>NieR: Automata&apos;s PC porting has not been one of the best, though it didn&apos;t affect my experience (note that I have a very high end PC).
<br>Graphics are not outstanding, but I&apos;ve never seen any Japanese developer caring for realistic graphics, so shove off graphic-complainers.
<br>The gameplay is fluid, fast and really enjoyable, with different mechanics and it&apos;s really challenging, especially at the very beginning.
<br>But now let&apos;s talk about the reason I personally love this game: the story. I mean, the storytelling is amazing, and it is only the mask of a deeper, hidden meaning and moral that shows itself only after a few hours and becomes more consistent and influencing as the plot progresses. Yoko Taro gave his characters, machines and androids, who should be emotionless &quot;dummies&quot;, the capacity to evolve, to experience sensations, to investigate the meaning of life and of death. I won&apos;t go further to avoid spoilers, but I think this game, if fully understood, is easily Game of The Year due to the perfect combination of a great storytelling with high levels of deepness, outstanding gameplay and also a great soundtrack, placed to perfectly fit the situations and giving the scenes a moving atmosphere at times.
<br>Give it a try, it&apos;ll change how you see the world!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7174481">Expand</a></span>

Best game i have played.., there is simply nothing other like this game.. I do not want to say any more.. a word to those who haven&apos;t finished the game yet, enjoy every moment of it..
<br>
<br>Pros :
<br>- Great fluid and seamless combat
<br>- Mind blowing music (best soundtrack in video game history)
<br>- A simple plot turned to be a very complex one laid through multiple endings
<br>- Great game design with 2D,3D everything combined well
<br>- The concept/theme of game is great, some of the characters are very memorable
<br>- Skill progression system in form of chips is unique and offers lot of playstyle combined with the large amount of weapons available
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Few side quests are boring
<br>- Have to use Borderless window software to go fullscreen properly
<br>- Discrepancy between standard and hard difficulty
<br>
<br>The thing is non of these cons are major enough affect your experience of the game.. After playing for a while you won&apos;t even notice any of these issues, since the game is so engaging.  At the end of the game you are left with the amazing feeling and lot of sad emotions . This is simple a masterpiece and has become one of my most favorite games of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7207792">Expand</a></span>

With that being said I must say I was very much impressed with this game. Nier Automata is a game that takes place in the distant future where you take the role of a character named 2b and fight through a seemingly endless wave of &quot;mindless&quot; robots to complete your mission.
<br>
<br>The story in Nier Automata isn&apos;t one your likely to forget anytime soon as it plays out similarly to something straight out of an anime. While you may like anime this type or story telling leads to some cliche character personality and behavior making my personal experience a little less enjoyable. Even so throughout the whole game i never once felt bored of the characters, yes they maybe a little cliche but its handled very well through great voice acting and seemingly perfect soundtrack execution. Throughout my experience with the story I can say that Nier provides a great sense of direction and gives a peculiar sense of wonder as you hope to discover a deeper truth as to why the machines on earth are acting the way they do.
<br>
<br>Game play feels very solid and smooth and gives a great sense of accomplishment when taking down a hard boss. Though combat is buttery smooth I feel like there too much to spam instead of having well timed dodges I found myself just kinda spamming the dodge button while being attacked by a boss or a handful of enemies. My problems with the combat is that even after 12+ hrs of game play i still find spam to be the most effective way to dodge and counter attack my enemies. Nier Automata&apos;s combat mechanics pulls straight from the books of a dark souls game, be it this game is more forgiving through your skill and upgrades, once you die you will lose them unless you go back to your body and retrieve your skill chips. This death system made me feel like I actually had something to lose if I died and provided me some great incentive to not just Rambo and die, but think about my next attack and if I should be saving my missile salvo for the next wave or use it now. Nier Automata&apos;s combat in game play I can say has given my the most fun I have had in gaming in awhile
<br>
<br>Other things to note would be the performance of this game and how the PC port doesn&apos;t seem to run smoothly and needs more optimization
<br>
<br>in conclusion I can confidently say that if you are not planing on picking Nier Automata up for your PC/console in the future that your are doing yourself a disservice</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7148394">Expand</a></span>

<br>Quiero empezar por lo m&#xE1;s importante en un juego, antes que la experiencia de juego su apartado t&#xE9;cnico y de m&#xE1;s...
<br>Optimizaci&#xF3;n: No es visto una tan mala en mucho tiempo, de tal punto que los usuarios han tenido que sacar su propio parche (lo cual me parece vergonzoso por parte de la empresa, en este caso Platinum Games) que en cierta manera mejora la experiencia de usuario. Nos enfrentaos nada m&#xE1;s y nada menos a que el juego al ponerlo en pantalla completa autom&#xE1;ticamente se pone en 4:3 cuando lo l&#xF3;gico es 16:9 y para m&#xE1;s inri a una resoluci&#xF3;n inferior a la que tienes puestas en las opciones gr&#xE1;ficas (las cuales son muy escasas), para que vaya a la resoluci&#xF3;n deseada y la pantalla a 16:9 tienes que poner el juego en modo ventana, algo incomprensible e inc&#xF3;modo a mi punto de vista ya que no te da la opci&#xF3;n de poner el modo ventana sin bordes. Framerate decentemente estables aunque se notan ciertos tirones en zonas espec&#xED;ficas de mapas, al haber muchas part&#xED;culas en pantalla, etc. Cinem&#xE1;ticas capadas a 30fps (Me imagino que habr&#xE1; sido para darle un toque m&#xE1;s cinematogr&#xE1;fico) pero que dan unos tirones que el juego se queda tiritando, personalmente creo que no le sientan bien y para colmo los subt&#xED;tulos de los di&#xE1;logos van retrasados respecto al sonido.  El juego en ciertas ocasiones crashea y al no tener guardado autom&#xE1;tico vas a tener que volver a hacer cosas que ya hab&#xED;as hecho con anterioridad. No s&#xE9; c&#xF3;mo esta empresa ha sacado el juego en estas condiciones la verdad y lo m&#xE1;s sorprendente es que es Platinum Games que no es que estemos hablando de desconocidos.
<br>
<br>Jugabilidad: Resumidamente la veo simple y casual, me explico, antes de nada estamos hablando de un g&#xE9;nero Hack and Slash en el que apenas hay combos, solo tenemos 8 &#x201C;Combos&#x201D; posibles (Spamear X, spamear Y, mantener pulsado X, mantener pulsado Y, mientras corremos pulsar X, mientras corremos pulsar Y, en el aire pulsar X y en el aire pulsar Y.) sin time in ni combinaci&#xF3;n entre comando y comando ya que no existe en este juego cosa que me parece rid&#xED;cula a diferencia de la mayor&#xED;a del mismo g&#xE9;nero, tambi&#xE9;n podemos esquivar con el bot&#xF3;n RT y si lo hacemos en el momento justo seremos recompensados  elevando al enemigo por los aires. Como veis para ser del genero hack and slash es bastante simple y sin variedad lo cual puede hacer mon&#xF3;tono y repetitivo los combates, pero hay que recalcar que seg&#xFA;n las armas que llevemos equipadas tendr&#xE1; diferentes animaciones y estas son bastante buenas.
<br>El juego tambi&#xE9;n tiene toques RPG lo cual le sienta bastante bien, nuestro personaje 2B (de la que hablaremos despu&#xE9;s.) ira adquiriendo experiencia seg&#xFA;n venzamos enemigos y completando misiones y se ara cada vez m&#xE1;s fuerte, a esto le sumamos que disponemos de unos chips de ampliaci&#xF3;n (que iremos consiguiendo comprado a mercaderes, repartidos por el mapa o venciendo a enemigos) que mejoraran la capacidad f&#xED;sica de nuestra protagonista que iremos a&#xF1;adiendo a nuestra barra seg&#xFA;n la ampliemos compr&#xE1;ndosela a los distintos mercaderes que hay repartidos por el mapa.
<br>Una cosa que me ha sorprendido mucho de este juego es que en distintas zonas del mapa o seg&#xFA;n por donde estemos pasando la c&#xE1;mara cambiara de una vista en tercera persona a una vista a un juego bit em up o a una vista desde arriba. Me a parecido muy interesante y la verdad es que funciona bastante bien.
<br>El mapa se siente vac&#xED;o y la verdad, no dan ganas de explorarlo y es muy mon&#xF3;tono. Este se separa en varias zonas, por ejemplo tenemos la ciudad en ruinas del principio del juego y el desierto. Las zonas se diferencian mucho entre ellas.
<br>La banda sonora del juego es bastante buena y hace bastante acto de presencia lo cual me parece muy positivo pero solo le veo una pega, al pasar por diferentes zonas del mapa cambia y no se molestan ni tan siquiera en hacer un fundido para pasar de una canci&#xF3;n a otra y esta cambia de repente, lo cual contrasta mucho y pierde encanto.
<br>
<br>Personajes: Nuestra protagonista es un androide femenino llamado 2b y tendremos una acompa&#xF1;ante llamada 9s. Los dos tienen grandes dise&#xF1;os y muy bien planteados al igual que su universo pos apocal&#xED;ptico y bien estructurado. La direcci&#xF3;n de arte en ese aspecto es magn&#xED;fica.
<br>Los enemigos no tienen un gran dise&#xF1;o y son simplones y siempre ejecutan los mismos ataques una y otra vez, pero los enemigos finales dan gloria con ataques muy variados y se hacen combates espectaculares y muy disfrutables.
<br>
<br>Conclusi&#xF3;n: Estamos ante un hack and slash con toques de rpg simpl&#xF3;n y casual pero que si te engancha la historia (no la he mencionado porque creo que es mejor descubrirla en primera persona) y te atrapa su universo es disfrutable. (Recomiendo jugarlo en consolas ya que en pc el juego se cae a trozos.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7291502">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But first, here are the good things:
<br>
<br>ALMOST EVERYTHING.  And I mean that quite literally.  The combat isn&apos;t as detailed and technical as Dark Souls, but it is better than Shadow of Mordor and the Batman series.  I place it nearly perfectly between the two.  You won&apos;t be timing almost every single attack, dodge, and parry as meticulously as you would in Dark Souls, but you&apos;ll also not be spamming 2 buttons non-stop as the previously mentioned games either.  Dodging is very simple yet not at the same time.  You can spam it if you wish, but you&apos;ll be missing out on counter opportunities and you will also be spending much longer than necessary to defeat enemies, and it flat out won&apos;t work on Hard difficulty or above.
<br>
<br>The graphics are great.  I wouldn&apos;t say perfect, but they are impressive enough.  I am not going into that more, because graphics aren&apos;t all that important to me these days.
<br>
<br>Customizing your character, while a bit arduous at times, is really deep and worth the investment.  Do you want to be a ranged hero?  Ok, put those chips in.  Do you want to be a defensively minded speed demon?  You can do that as well.  Do you want to have higher drop rates and exp?  Also doable.  Whatever you can imagine, you can do if you just spend time customizing your chip loadout.  On the flip side, if you do not like how time consuming that can be, you can use the 3 automatic options (Balanced, Attack, and Defense).  They do a good job of maximizing your potential with the chips and space you have.
<br>
<br>The humor in the game is just about perfect.  I don&apos;t like games that border on slapstick, unless that&apos;s what I&apos;m specifically playing, but I also don&apos;t like games that always take themselves too seriously.  This one hits the nail on the head.  The Pods&apos; dry wit is always enjoyable, while the Easter Eggs are perfectly placed and the incidental humor from some quests is obscure enough to feel proud of yourself when you get it but not so obscure that only Dennis Miller would enjoy it.
<br>
<br>My last positive, but not the last positive this game has, is the story and replayability.  There is so much depth to a game with only 10-15 hours of play through the first time you get through it.  Even when that is done, you get to come back an watch the entire main story line a second time through another perspective, and when that&apos;s done, you get to play further into the future to see the consequences of the main story and develop out the lore of the entire series just a bit further.  This is where Platinum and Square Enix nailed it, and where I think they&apos;ve improved upon the genre for all times as Dark Souls did with its ambiguity.  I highly expect to see many other games in the future take this route as well:  save money by reusing graphical assets and maps, but develop the story more by making second and third play throughs flesh out the main story line and other characters in those same areas.  They perfectly nailed it in Nier: Automata.
<br>
<br>Now for a very short list of cons...
<br>
<br>There is no ramp up from Normal to Hard.  Normal is really simple.  It may as well be &quot;Easy&quot; except that it doesn&apos;t allow you to use some of the automated gameplay chips that Easy does.  Hard and Very Hard are nearly the same difficulty.  Trash mobs are worse in Very Hard, but even then, they are still just Trash.  Bosses, on the other hand, nearly always can one shot on both difficulties.  If you&apos;re going to play hard, just set it to Very Hard so you can feel a bit better about yourself when all is said and done.  A positive of all of this is that Easy allows for people with disabilities or those that do not like challenges in games to still enjoy the story, which is well worth the price of admission.
<br>
<br>Another thing you&apos;re going to find awful is a certain part during the 3rd play through.  I won&apos;t get too in depth about it, but let&apos;s just say stumbling around with almost no abilities for 5-10 minutes could have been better accomplished via a cut scene rather than making everyone play through it.  It was absolutely awful and unfun.  Just glad I didn&apos;t die.  I can&apos;t imagine having to do that again.
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;d give this game a 9.5 out of 10.  The worst part about this game isn&apos;t really something that can be detrimental to the review score:  it is over and done with.  The developer has already said we should not expect any meaningful DLC, if we get any at all.  That&apos;s very sad.  However, with the success this game is seeing, I cannot wait to see where they take a sequel, and I&apos;ll be anxiously waiting to throw my money at it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7153448">Expand</a></span>

Otherwise a near flawless game.  What ever errors it has are more than made up for in concept and execution of story and gameplay.
<br>
<br>Multiple playthroughs don&apos;t feel like a chore, and right about when you&apos;re not sure you have the energy to keep slogging through the beginning segment (playthrough 3) is when the game unlocks chapter select, and allows you to swap characters.  Which is useful for finishing side quests, etc.
<br>
<br>Honestly, the biggest thing that hit me is Ending E&apos;s final combat segment, and what getting &quot;help&quot; means.  I was selfish, for now, knowing that dlc will be releasing at some point (those bunkers you find never open up during gameplay as of the time of this reviews writing). But afterwards if I 100% the game. I think I&apos;ll replay E, just to sacrifice my save data to help someone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7204803">Expand</a></span>

<br>NieR: Automata couples Yoko Taro&apos;s amazing direction/writing together with some of the best gameplay PlatinumGames has developed to date. The story is emotional and engaging, and spans over multiple playthroughs of the game. The characters in NieR&apos;s universe are believable and have motives behind their actions- the androids and machines have more personality to them than actual human characters in other games. The combat has a ton of depth, as expected of any game developed by PlatinumGames. You could spend the entire game mashing heavy and light attacks, or you could dive in deep and learn combos and different chip builds. It offers plenty in terms of difficulty settings, from the game nearly playing itself up to being killed in one hit from any enemy. NieR: Automata provides as little or as much challenge as you want it to.
<br>
<br>However, the PC port is where things are more than questionable. The game doesn&apos;t have the best graphics out there, and the port is iffy at best. Running it on a GTX 970 at 1080p, I often struggled to get 60 FPS above medium graphics. Hopefully we&apos;ll see a performance patch from Square Enix in the near future, as it would pretty much perfect the entire experience.
<br>
<br>In the end, NieR: Automata is the big break Yoko Taro finally deserves. This game is the best he&apos;s directed to date, and hopefully we see more of his work in the future.
<br>
<br>Final Score: 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7193545">Expand</a></span>

Game deserves solid 9/10 aside all performance issues. Compared to MGR:R, NIER have a too simple combo system that didn&apos;t really touched my hearth. Still miss those combos tho. Thank you very much &quot;Platinum Games&quot; for such amazing game.</span>

I can think of maybe 2-3 other games that I had this much fun playing through. It&apos;s story is far deeper then any western RPG I have experienced.
<br>
<br>What you can expect:
<br>
<br>-The game has a brilliant, unique storytelling. You should know, that playing through the game multiple times is a MUST. The 1st playthrough is little more then an extended tutorial. The second playthrough is mostly the same story, but from the perspective of a different character, with new mechanics and informations available, so it doesn&apos;t get boring. It is in the 3rd playthrough where the real story begins.
<br>
<br>-The combat is extremely enjoyable. The PC version does have some control issues during hacking mini-game sessions, and the occasional flight missions however. You can get used to it fast, but it might cause some annoyance.
<br>
<br>-The soundtrack is amazing.
<br>
<br>-The graphics are average, It&apos;s apparent here that the game didn&apos;t have a AAA budget.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7130102">Expand</a></span>

<br>Nier automata is an overrated mess of a game. Its story might, just might appeal to 12 year old anime lovers, but for the rest of us is a waste of time. The gameplay is boring as well. Graphically it is nothing special. And the PC port is abysmal.
<br>
<br>All in all, a mediocre game. I am giving it a 0 to counter the Square Enix employees.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7481845">Expand</a></span>

While this is good on its own, it should really be noted that the game expands way beyond that, and most of the actual story is from the third play through onwards. Keep that in mind if you plan to play for the story as it turns a 10 hour game into a 50+ hour one. I won&apos;t spoil anything in this review, but please play until route C at least.
<br>
<br>The game follows the story of three androids - 2B, 9S and A2. They are sent to Earth to take back control of the planet from the machines who almost wiped out the humans (at least, this is what you&apos;re told initially...). The game mechanics are very slick and combat is incredibly smooth and satisfying, as expected by a game by Platinum.
<br>
<br>The game world is barren but very atmospheric and the soundtrack by Keiichi Okabe is easily one of the best I&apos;ve ever heard. Boss fights are multi-layered and extremely epic, and the game switches genre seemingly on the fly between an action RPG, twin-stick shooter, top-down shooter and side-scrolling shooter.
<br>
<br>The real magic of NieR: Automata is the story though. On the first playthrough you&apos;ll get to the end and think &quot;there has to be more to this&quot;. You&apos;re then greeted by a message saying that the game has multiple endings. Sure enough, the 2nd play through is similar to the first but with a few key changes. It&apos;s not until you get to the third play through that you realise there&apos;s so much more going on. In fact, I would consider the first two play throughs to be more like an extended prologue.
<br>
<br>A very significant event happens at the start of Route C which will hit players hard. You&apos;ll soon realise that the game is an extremely emotional one with twists and turns that leave you reeling. Definitely try to keep away from spoilers where possible and stick with it and you&apos;ll experience one of the greatest games of this generation. Yoko Taro loves to toy with his playerbase&apos;s emotions and some of the things that happen (particularly in Route C) will tear your heart out.
<br>
<br>There are a couple of technical issues with the PC version currently. 1920x1080 fullscreen actually upscales 900p so it looks blurry. This is a bug but it hasn&apos;t been fixed at time of writing. This can be solved by using a Borderless Window program. Some users are also experiencing some freezing and white screens. I use a GTX1060 and have had a couple of 1 second freezes but nothing too major. Just be aware that it isn&apos;t a perfect port, but it is a playable one.
<br>
<br>Once some of the technical issues are worked out, I genuinely believe that this will go down as one of the greatest games of the last 10 years. The story is that good and I would seriously recommend anyone on the fence to give it a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7189057">Expand</a></span>

Not so good are the low quality textures and the crazy framerate, but overall the graphics get the job done. Artistic direction is a bit of a mixture, with really nice character design and some original stages, that contrasts with a quite forgettable world. 7/10
<br>
<br>Music: It&#x2019;s been a while since I found a videogame in which I actually stopped playing and started listening to the music. It is impossible not to notice how flawlessly the beautiful songs are blended with the scenery. The english dubbing is not bad, and the japanese is amazing. 10/10
<br>
<br>Gameplay: 1 word - original. The game is presented as an action RPG, but the &#x201C;action&#x201D; element plays a big part. The combat mechanics have nothing to envy to the best action games and are clearly inspired in Bayonetta, meaning they are fun and difficult to master. There are several weapons with their own movesets (including flawless transitions between weapons mid combo). I needed around 35 hours to complete the game, and the hard and extreme difficulties were a hell of a challenge.
<br>
<br>But it&#x2019;s not only about the combat, the game keeps surprising you throughout the adventure, it will suddenly metamorphose into a side scroller beat em up, and at the next moment into Space Invaders. Despite the variety, the game can get a little bit repetitive sometimes. The major gameplay flaw is the camera, which can be all over the place sometimes and seems impossible to manage with a joystick. Another thing that the game doesn&#x2019;t get right is the open world: a medium sized place with not much to do besides mindlessly practicing your combat skills against loads of repetitive enemies. Finally, the lack of autosaving for long periods of time can really be a pain. 8.5/10
<br>
<br>Story: the story is interesting enough to keep you hooked until the end, and interesting too is how it is conveyed piece by piece (and playthrough by playthrough). Sometimes you will feel it&#x2019;s a little bit melodramatic or childish for your taste, some others that you are being presented with these anime clich&#xE9;s you already know too well, but luckily those moments don&#x2019;t last long, and the whole thing, without having many (or any) major moments, still manages to stay interesting and mostly unpredictable until the end. About the side content, you have your typical fetch quests mixed with some that are more story focused, but ultimately most of them are not very entertaining. 8/10
<br>
<br>In summary, Nier Automata is full of fresh action oriented gameplay, with a beautiful OST and a technical aspect that gets the job done. But a boring open world and a plot that lacks climax somehow jeopardize what could have been a masterpiece. 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7291393">Expand</a></span>

The problems vary immensely from user to user, even between those who have virtually identical PC setups, but I assure you that it is playable on every minimum requirement PC, you just have to...find the particular problem your PC has(I needed to drop to lowest resolution, set my game to high priority and disable all the odd numbered cores through task manager every time I launched). I can also verify that this game is 99% playable with mouse and keyboard: you do NOT need a controller to enjoy yourself. Just to reiterate, if you have a PS4 and a PC, get the game for PS4, but it is very possible to have a satisfactory experience on PC once you fix your crashing problem.
<br>
<br>Game breaking bug/crashes normally keeps me from reviewing any game to be 10 stars, but after playing through to reach &apos;the true ending&apos; of the game, I have to say... from a story perspective, this just might be the single best game I&apos;ve ever come across, and it would be a tragedy if the world forgot about it. This is the &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; of video games. This is &quot;The Witcher 3&quot; of 2017. The existentialist plot is about as deep as &quot;The Matrix&quot;. The game is devised of 3 (different) playthroughs, but even hinting at what the tone of each ending is becomes a spoiler. This is a beautiful game, and all the hardships that come with playing it on PC masterrace...are ultimately worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7301117">Expand</a></span>

While not flawless, Nier is undeniably a work of art that is greater than the sum of its parts. With a wide variety of gameplay styles, a remarkably well-written story with incredibly deep characters, and a memorable sound track complete with a proprietary language, Nier is a definite contender for Game of the Year awards.
<br>
<br>PlatinumGames, while not known for deep complexity in their combat systems, have still managed to form a brand for themselves in the past few years thanks to big successes such as Metal Gear Rising and Bayonetta 2. Their heavily-stylized &quot;character action&quot; game design fits perfectly into the anime-esque world of Nier: Automata: characters swing and throw teleporting greatswords twice their size with ease, slow down time to teleport-dodge enemy attacks, and run with an acceleration that feels like a 2-legged racing game. This also extends into the flight sequences, where you command a transforming airplane mecha with a moveset not dissimilar to your grounded counterparts. While the ground combat is even more simplistic than MGR (you can often just hold the &quot;light attack&quot; button [while dodging] to auto-combo normal enemies), there is such a huge variety of gameplay that you never get bored. Flight combat, hacking sequences, creative use of locked camera angles, and even mini-VNs all break up the hack &apos;n&apos; slash to create what is probably the most creative mainstream &quot;AAA&quot; game in the past two console gens.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s hard to talk about how good the writing in Nier is without spoilers. To put it simply, Nier is broken into two parts, each being played across two characters. One character, who surprisingly becomes the focal point of the story, has a gradual mental health degradation which even the game&apos;s support characters make it a point to notice. Most Japanese media seems to take characters who are &quot;supposed&quot; to be evil and has them instantly snap under pressure, typically caused by one traumatic event like a loved one dying. This game&apos;s character goes from a happy-go-lucky straight shooter and suffers multiple depressing events that I felt affected me more than him at times. His decline into insanity isn&apos;t a simple breaking point but a good dozen hours of misery that was so well written that it became the main driving force of the story. While replaying portions of the game again as a different character can become tedious, their story line splits provide a fresh look at each character and the main story itself.
<br>
<br>So many great ideas and designs are incorporated into Nier: Automata that its hard to cover all of them in a simple written review. Nier frequently defies player expectations, creatively breaks the fourth wall, paints a rich sci-fi lore with excellent world-building, and leaves enough room to fill in the blanks with your imagination that I expect a fanbase similar to Undertale to crop up around it. Nier is the best game I&apos;ve played since The Witcher 3 in July 2015. Hopefully it receives the attention it deserves because games like this are really once a gen masterpieces.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7254929">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s part RPG, part spectacle fighter and part bullet hell, but at the same time it&apos;s none of the above.
<br>When people tell you that you need several playthroughs to get the entire story, it&apos;s not exactly correct. You&apos;re not finished when you&apos;re finished. Your second playthrough is not like your previous playthrough. That&apos;s all I&apos;m saying.
<br>
<br>This is a sad game. That&apos;s not to say it doesn&apos;t have comedy, and it does, but the overall story is tragic and sad, and there will be parts that will break your heart, but persevere because the real ending is nothing short of magic, life affirming and thought provoking.
<br>
<br>This is a masterpiece. Not technically (the PC version is buggy), but an unquestionable triumph of storytelling, game design and character development.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7335878">Expand</a></span>

This game consists of the most perfectly executed genre blend ever: JRPG, Action, Shoot &apos;Em Up, Platformer, Hack and Slash and so forth, all tied together by a breathtaking and deep story. The post apocalyptic open world that is presented is full of secrets and interesting characters. Any further explanation about the plot and how it works together with this insane amount of genres that are being interchanged between each other would be a spoiler, and the bosses that you encounter deserve the same treatment; they are unforgettable. If you buy a game in 2017, it should be Nier:Automata.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7314563">Expand</a></span>

<br>One of them is almost a &quot;secret&quot; ending, and this one is the true ending of the game. The ending &quot;E&quot;.
<br>
<br>It has some technical issues as bugs, res, crashes etc, I had to solve it with Borderless Gaming software, hence I&apos;m giving 9 out of 10.
<br>
<br>The game basically has three story arcs:
<br>- First, you play as 2B
<br>- Second, you play as 9S
<br>- Third... things go wild.
<br>You really should finish the third arc before even thinking about giving a score for this game.
<br>
<br>As for 9S in your second gameplay, it is the story in his perspective, so a lot of new story details are shown. For the third arc, everything changes and this game will make you really feel. If you are stupid and get bored because reasons, you can literally ignore all his exclusive side quests and rush to the third arc easily. For more insight as why you should complete side-quests, see below.

<br>The gameplay is good, the mechanics don&apos;t make you feel bored. They change cameras in a good way, the scenarios are **** amazing and they offer new perspectives and mechanics here and there to change your experience with the game.
<br>
<br>The SIDE-quests are really important in this game. They are not &quot;go get some bread for the homeless guy for no reasons&quot;. All of them are either connected and give information about the world or, after beating the game, you will remember that NPC that said or did something and you will relate really hard to it. The weapon stories are connected to the deepest feelings of the characters, in a poetic form. Many things and conversations between the characters will have a deeper meaning after you beat the game, which makes you wonder a lot. The collectibles (archives etc) are of major importance to clarify so many things and give insight about the world around you.
<br>What I&apos;m saying is: everything in this game exists for a reason.
<br>
<br>The OST is incredible, one of the best I&apos;ve ever seen. And somehow, they will touch you. I don&apos;t know how, but the songs are just... deep.
<br>If you go to youtube and look for the main theme in japanese, even the singer cries by the ending of the song. You know something is f*cking amazing when even the singer is crying over it.
<br>
<br>Graphs are ok. Nothing master race, but still you will enjoy them. The art concept of the game is incredible, I have no words to describe it, it&apos;s a work of a master.
<br>
<br>Price? It&apos;s worth it, I don&apos;t regret for paying the full price. You must have this game in your collection.
<br>Though I disagree with the high prices of SE on Steam, this one I can say I&apos;m glad to have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7178154">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story and world is told in an artistic way that I cannot describe in text. It is something that you need to experience first hand and I will proudly say that it is a game that every gamer should at least play once in their life time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7302360">Expand</a></span>

There is 5 real ends to this game so don&apos;t stop after the first one you&apos;ll not understand the story... you really need to do the A, B, C, D and E ends to understand. C,D and E are available after the third run and you can do them in about an hour.

<br>J&apos;aime particuli&#xE8;rement l&apos;alternance des phases en beat them all et en shoot them up alors qu&apos;en temps normal, je ne suis pas du tout amateur de ce dernier. Mais ici, tout a &#xE9;t&#xE9; savamment dos&#xE9; pour que l&apos;exp&#xE9;rience soit toujours digeste, jamais trop longue. En plus de cela, j&apos;ai &#xE9;t&#xE9; profond&#xE9;ment touch&#xE9; par l&apos;histoire et ces personnages au destin tragique. 2B, 9S et les autres... si aucun d&apos;eux n&apos;est physiologiquement pas humain, cela ne les emp&#xEA;che pas de d&#xE9;gager une profonde humanit&#xE9;. Celle-ci se d&#xE9;voile progressivement et avec ma&#xEE;trise, d&#xE9;voilant tout le spectre de la complexit&#xE9; humaine, avec tout ce qu&apos;elle a de plus beau et sombre. Amour, haine, vengeance, d&#xE9;votion, sacrifice, foi... autant de facettes qui nous sont d&#xE9;voil&#xE9;es par ces &#xEA;tres dou&#xE9;s d&apos;&#xE9;motions.
<br>
<br>Par-dessus tout, j&apos;ai &#xE9;t&#xE9; touch&#xE9; par le message d&apos;amour adress&#xE9; directement aux joueurs par PlatinumGames et Yoko Taro. Selon moi, NieR Automata restera dans les m&#xE9;moires (en tout cas, &#xE0; coup s&#xFB;r dans la mienne) pour un tr&#xE8;s long moment, m&#xE9;ritant d&apos;&#xEA;tre analys&#xE9; et trait&#xE9; plus en profondeur, avec plus de recul... celui du temps. Peut-&#xEA;tre que tout le monde ne sera pas touch&#xE9; comme moi je l&apos;ai &#xE9;t&#xE9;, mais ce jeu est &#xE0; faire au moins une fois, vous passerez &#xE0; coup s&#xFB;r un bon moment avec lui.
<br>
<br>Merci PlatinumGames, merci Monsieur Yoko Taro, je tiens l&#xE0; l&apos;une de mes perles de cette ann&#xE9;e 2017, et sans h&#xE9;sitation... de ma vie de joueur.
<br>
<br>&#xC0; vous de jouer !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nier-automata/user-reviews?user_review_id=7236243">Expand</a></span>
