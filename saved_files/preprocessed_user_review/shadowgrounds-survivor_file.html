The graphics are a step up from the previous game and look pretty darn good for an indie developer. It has fast-paced action and a serviceable storyline for people not looking for a lot of epic storytelling or tons of depth. It&apos;s pretty standard space opera fare, but that doesn&apos;t mean that it is not truly enjoyable. Voice acting and dialog are cheesy and fun, exactly what I want from a game that lets me play out a cheesy sci-fi action movie. The addition of physics is a nice touch, but it doesn&apos;t really alter gameplay, but that is okay. The RPG-lite system of character upgrades is back in full force and incredibly fun. Overall, a great action game for people looking for a nice diversion for a few hours. Don&apos;t pick it up looking for the best game ever made and you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowgrounds-survivor/user-reviews?user_review_id=406324">Expand</a></span>

<br>This sequel is terrible on a few level. What a disappointment and a few steps backwards from the first. In this sequel, the developers have adopted typical decisions you see these days with companies, thinking these sort of features are a requisite for good games these days (they&apos;re not at all!). Story is pathetic and thin with painfully (!!!!) cliche&apos;d characters, horrible horrible voice acting (what were they thinking?!) and generally where as in the first game you had all weapons to choose from and slowly discover, with this sequel the SAME weapons with SAME upgrades are distributed (read: limited) between each of the 3 characters. Aside from this, the game was boring this time round. Very boring and repetitive.. Who cares when nothing new is there to discover? there is no &apos;suspense&apos; in this sequel. No atmosphere. Graphics are slightly nicer than original, as are improvements of physics - but again, who cares when the core is now rotten?!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowgrounds-survivor/user-reviews?user_review_id=69964">Expand</a></span>

A game from 2007, its graphics have aged poorly, but not nearly so poorly as its predecessor; still, close-ups on faces look quite terrible. On the whole, it is a great improvement over its predecessor, with superior pacing and voice acting, and it feels less like a low-budget title. Still, it gets repetitive at the end, and unlike the first game, it lacks boss fights. As such, I would generally recommend Alien Swarm, which is free on Steam, over paying for this game.
<br>
<br>Story
<br>
<br>A base on Ganymede has been attacked by a horde of aliens. Three survivors work together to save the world:
<br>A soldier, who is the last member of his platoon and is trying to work his way back to the colony.
<br>An old Russian janitor, who seems to enjoy setting things on fire.
<br>A sniper, who keeps a count of every kill she gets.
<br>They are assisted by a scientist, saved early on in the soldier&#x2019;s sections, who helps them set up the defense of the colony.
<br>The game&#x2019;s story is very bare-bones and exists to serve the gameplay, and in that role, it is adequate; the voice acting is fine and not phoned-in, unlike the first game, and on the whole it serves its purpose, though why the aliens are there is never clarified &#x2013; though on the other hand, maybe it doesn&#x2019;t matter.
<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>
<br>The game is a top-down shooter. Each character has three weapons plus grenades, and each character has a special power that only they can activate. As you kill aliens, you find upgrades for your weapons, which makes them more powerful and gives them alternate fire mechanisms, and gain experience, which allows you to directly upgrade your characters&#x2019; abilities and stats.
<br>On the whole, the gameplay is reasonably engaging, and by switching between different characters with different weapon sets, the game keeps its gameplay somewhat fresh. Unfortunately, by about halfway through the game you have encountered every type of alien present in the game, and as a result the second half of the game is mostly greater and greater numbers of aliens, with the odd &#x201C;defend the area&#x201D; or &#x201C;ride around in a mech shooting things&#x201D; or &#x201C;sit in a turret shooting things&#x201D; thrown in. As a result, the game does wear a bit thin by the end, though the game on the whole isn&#x2019;t terribly long.
<br>There is a secret hidden in each level, a S lying around on the ground, which adds a minor exploration aspect to the game, but on the whole, I didn&#x2019;t really feel driven to find the things. Still, it was nice that there weren&#x2019;t an excessive number of collectables.
<br>
<br>Graphics
<br>
<br>The game was made in 2007, and while it looks okay when you are looking from the third-person, well-above-the-character perspective, whenever the characters speak their faces are shown on-screen and look absolutely terrible. On the whole, the graphics are serviceable, but it has not aged well and nothing looks really spectacular.
<br>
<br>Final Summary
<br>
<br>The game is a competent third-person shooter, and you could do worse. However, Alien Swarm is still probably a better game, and it is free on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowgrounds-survivor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4425668">Expand</a></span>

Survivor shows huge improvement in writing and voice acting, as well as adding a choice of three characters to play. There are some nice new special moves for each character (including the brute execution, where the marine hauls himself onto the head of the enemy and shoots them in the back of the head) and new character upgrades on top of weapon upgrades. The action remains heavy and challenging, perhaps even more so than the original, and the soundtrack has undergone (in my opinion) some great improvements. The graphics and physics updates are also excellent, and the ability to shift crates and barrels and the like to where you need them adds a whole new tactical layer to combat, as does the inclusion of hand-thrown grenades. The game also seems to run better on low-end machines than the original, suggesting superior exploitation of resources by the programmers. Survivor also nods towards replayability, which the original really lacked, with the addition of secrets in the campaign and the &quot;Survivor&quot; mode, where the player is pitted against wave after wave of aliens. The sections are also smaller and more numerous in campaign mode now, meaning less chance of the minor frustration of the original as you have to play through an hour or so of the same mission because you failed at the end. Although the game was so fun to play it wasn&apos;t a real issue. The negative points are that the campaign feels rather short, and Frozenbyte still hasn&apos;t implemented online mode. There is a co-op from one computer that allows for two mice and keyboards, though. All in all, survivor is a grerat achievement and improvement on the original, retaining and building on tremendous gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowgrounds-survivor/user-reviews?user_review_id=405275">Expand</a></span>

The reason I gave it a 7 is because the story part was pretty lame, but most games are. Also the chapters seem too short and too easy. But for what it is it&apos;s a great game, and when you can snag it up for 5 bucks do it.</span>

On the flip side the story is bad and the campaign is even shorter than the first one and ended up taking me a whopping 3 hours to finish. Another bland game from Frozenbyte, would not recommend it.</span>

Has the same strengths and shortcomings as the base game, so if you&apos;ve played that, you will know wether or not you want to play this one. I enjoyed it, but there are much better top-down shooters out there.</span>
