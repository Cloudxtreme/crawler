<br>
<br>I was very disappointed with this game, and was so looking forward to it. It had great reviews, and an interesting looking trailer, so I&apos;m not sure why I disliked it so much. The voice acting was OK, but the director of the sound wasn&apos;t too good. It&apos;s as though they didn&apos;t have a firm understanding of the English language, or the context of the words they were speaking. Where some lines were questions, they spoke them as statements and vice versa.
<br>
<br>I think the biggest problem was that I didn&apos;t like the main character. Generally, he simply wasn&apos;t a nice person. I didn&apos;t see anything at all that made me want him to succeed in his quest. Imagine Guybrush Threepwood, who only wanted to save Elaine because she was hot and could get him to an Island full of riches... that&apos;s it. Now imagine him screwing over every single person on his way, and having no likeable characters. No Wally, no Haggis McMutton, no Murray, heck, no LeChuck!
<br>
<br>Plot holes, loop hopes, and plenty of bugs. I managed to activate the same cut-scene 4 times, each showing me succeeding at a particular moment in the game. At one point, German subtitles appeared, and at another point, the main character spoke a series of sentences, rather than the correct one, showing that the audio file wasn&apos;t correctly edited.
<br>
<br>Point and click adventure games are all about the puzzles, and these were just messy. No real direction. I took a break from it for a day, came back to it and had no idea what I was doing. I managed to start a conversation with a man, asking for help on a puzzle I managed to finish a few hours previously. Luckily they had a &apos;skip&apos; button for many of the most bizzare puzzles, but in all honestly, the majority of the time I just used a walk-through, and that&apos;s unheard of for most games I&apos;ve played through, and I usually try not to, but some of these were so complicated and strange, that I had the choice of trying every possible combination of objects in my inventory with objects or just use a walkthrough. There was very little in the way of logic.
<br>
<br>The most disgusting thing was that the game just ends. Again, take Monkey Island for example. Imagine the game just stopping half way through, with no result with a &quot;The End...?&quot;
<br>
<br>I will not be buying the second game, and am so angry that I bought this one. It confuses me so much that it&apos;s getting such great reviews. I grew up on point and click games, so as I said at the beginning, I am so disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2562830">Expand</a></span>

<br>Conclusion: I really want to like this game more than I did. I like the world and I like the tone of it but the frustration of the puzzles had me seeking walkthroughs more than I&apos;d like to admit. I would suggest playing the game with a notepad. Taking notes on every little thing you see and every little thing the characters say because usually there is a hint contained in them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3838905">Expand</a></span>

<br>There are a quite a few of things to like here. The graphics are classic cartoony 2D done great, the setting is great, the humour is funny (although lame points exist), the UI works well, even the plot is fun to follow and has a nice spanner in the works near the end. Most importantly, although this one&apos;s hardly a nosebleeder, is that the game doesn&apos;t spoonfeed you everything. Granted, this is always been a significant part of the genre, but games of today are have made me wary. That&apos;s not to say that the game leaves you hanging, it just tells you what to do in subtle ways.
<br>
<br>One thing I&apos;m feeling weird about is voice acting. Everyone else seems to do a decent job, but the main character just sounds... offbeat. Then again his personality is that of a jackass, so I&apos;m assuming that&apos;s at least partially intentional. Some of the robo voices in this game are hilarious too. My first impression with some of the music tracks was that they felt a bit out of place too, but in the end I actually ended up liking them a lot.
<br>
<br>As for the bad things... there isn&apos;t really anything outstanding. The game is maybe a bit short, but given the genre I&apos;ll let that slide. Perhaps the biggest flaw of it is that there are simply too few interactable flavour items AND actual quest items. The ones you have see plenty of use. This is something I&apos;d normally think of as an indie dev issue, but it&apos;s not really like the other elements in the game suffer from this.
<br>
<br>Deponia is a game filled with soul, that any fan of the point&apos;n&apos;click genre should try out. It&apos;s not as good as the classics, but who says it has to be?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3570399">Expand</a></span>

<br>It has a very Monkey Island feel to it, more so the third monkey island due to it being a 2d animation game which are rare nowadays, but Daedalic Entertainment have been bringing them back and well worth chasing after if you want a fun and entertaining adventure game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3406920">Expand</a></span>

The game is building on humor, unconventional, but still more or less reasonable solutions to puzzles and loads of dialogue to create and maintain the atmosphere.
<br>Even though the main character is an obnoxious egomaniac this didn&apos;t disturb me much since they made it clear in about the first 10 seconds of the game. The other characters are fairly good with a few exceptions  I found Toni a bit overdoing her part (seriously there is no reason behind giving home and food to your ex who you utterly hate from the bottom of your heart in my book) and the secretary in the Mayor&apos;s office is getting annoying fairly quick.
<br>I was a bit disappointed with the fact that the main game was taking place in the town and the other two scenes went really fast once you got there, but the story ran smooth and had its moments (even though quite predictable in general).
<br>The artwork deserves some extra praise  it is really well executed and the music is pretty good too. If you like adventure games and you are into steam punk (or at least one of the two) then by all means do pick up this game  and keep in mind that there are a few others in the series. A few others that I am now interested to try as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3803907">Expand</a></span>

There were some parts of the game that were genuinely funny, which was the goal of the developer of this comedy-based adventure game. There were some puzzles that were really fun and challenging. Unfortunately, there are some major problems in this game that made me consider abandoning it at several points. Some of the puzzles try to be cute and absurd rather than logical, which make them hard to solve other than trial and error. There are some puzzles where the cue to the player is not obvious enough. There are also parts of the game where it is not clear what you are supposed to do next. For example, in many adventure games if you talk to characters in the game, they will tend to point you toward your next task. The characters in Deponia will tell you tons of jokes and wierd stories (I clicked through a lot of it), but 90% of the dialog has nothing to do with helping you finish the game. There are some out-and-out bugs, including a minigame that was flat broken. I used a walk-through more for this game than any other I have ever played (that includes Myst, Riven, Siberia I/II, Machinarium, The Longest Journey, etc). The hero of the story was a little too detestable to be funny. The artwork, style, and creativity were all there for this to be an excellent game, but somehow the developers did not learn from other great games of this genre. The result is a disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2861300">Expand</a></span>

Colourful cartoony graphics, and wacky humour should make for a solid point and click adventure.  Two gaping holes however, made me give up in frustration.
<br>
<br>What starts with some decent puzzles and clear storyline in the first act leads into a shambles of a second act.   I found myself wandering around a town with no idea what I was trying to do, clicking random inventory items on everything in sight.  Wake someone up?  Brew coffee?  Find a lockpick?  Who knows?  Of course, I don&#x2019;t expect a game to lead me by the hand, but when I have to read a walkthrough to even know where I&#x2019;m going, let alone what to do, then something is wrong.
<br>
<br>The second problem is that the main character, Rufus, is fundamentally unlikeable.  He&#x2019;s mean, lazy, rude, and downright unpleasant to be around.  The kind of person who in real life you&#x2019;d do anything to avoid being near.
<br>
<br>I gave up after an hour or two.  Maybe it gets better, but who knows?  I&#x2019;m got better games to play that don&#x2019;t involve following a complete jerk around while he purloins random garbage.
<br>
<br>Verdict: not worth it unless you really, really, need a point and click fix.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3215125">Expand</a></span>

I found it very reminiscent of the classic Lucas Arts adventure games, more so than any other game I have played in years. The great humor, wacky characters, imaginative, detailed environments, and inventive puzzles make this a game that no adventure fan should miss. I for one can&apos;t wait for Rufus&apos; next adventure.</span>

<br>You know when you WANT to like something  I had that feeling when I started Deponia. The first hour or so I was amazed by the enviroment. The sounds and voice work seemed strange, but I like em anyway. The artwork is great, which helped keeping me imersed on the game but, the flaws started to came up. First of all, I fell tempted to mute the game everytime an Organon was speaking. Their voice work is hedious. Second, the puzzles are, in general, bad. Some of them don&apos;t have a sense of logic. The pace of the game might seem allright at the beggining, but then you realize it&apos;s actually kinda....random. I personally didn&apos;t think that the game is very intuitive, which makes it harder for the player to guess what to do next. Of course, it&apos;s a point and click, there can&apos;t be that many places to go and you can just high light the interactable objects, but, still, it should be more intuitive sometimes. The biggest flaw in my opinion is that our hero isn&apos;t very likeable. If I coment futher on this matter, I&apos;l have to mark it as spoiler.
<br>
<br>Anyway, even though I&apos;m giving this a 5, Deponia is a fun game and it&apos;s worth to be bought on a steam promotion or something like that. I probably paid 5 bucks, and it was worth every penny. I just wouldn&apos;t spent more on it. I bought the sequel and if it has a third release (I believe is a trilogy) I&apos;ll buy it too, but also on promotions and ony if they work on the issues that make this game a bit ordinary in every aspect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3021701">Expand</a></span>

The payoff is that everyone else hates him, but that&apos;s just not enough for me to spend such a long time with this guy. It&apos;s also pretty short and the ending is a real insult. Few minor problems with misplaced subtitles (happens quite often) and sometimes crazy solution to a problem or pixelhunting. That, sadly, is a tradition to adventure genre.
<br>
<br>Overall, I suggest avoiding it. Adventure games are played because of the story and this one just isn&apos;t good enough, plus the hallucinating moron as a &quot;main character&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2863939">Expand</a></span>

It wasn&apos;t too hard, as well as not too easy and obvious to the player, so there is a fine balance that keeps you addicted to this title to the end. Pros: amazing animation, graphics, design of the levels, humor, character voices, unique responses of the character to each thing you do. Cons: a few bugs I encountered, like English subtitles suddenly switching to German for a brief moment, animations bugging out to the point where a game restart is required, a few characters had really loud voices. It&apos;s nothing too serious to ruin game-play.
<br>Try this game, you won&apos;t regret it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2560898">Expand</a></span>

The main character was interesting enough, the biggest egoist around but strangely likable and with the best stupid grin ever. Only downsides for me were a couple of strange bugs and a massive memory leak (experienced the same with Chains of Satinav) along with the music that felt a little generic, but that all wasn&apos;t very bothersome. I really hope to see a sequel as the ending was a little inconclusive. Great game, really enjoyed it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2577458">Expand</a></span>

<br>WHAT I DID NOT LIKE: two main thing.  The game is still a little buggy (unpolished): for example, there a some puzzles which after you complete them, will not move you further in the story.  This happened to me twice, and second time was unacceptable (happened when i completed the puzzle with railroad track manipulation)  the movie played, but after the movie sequence played all the way through, my rail-cart returned back to the garage instead of moving on in the story to the next area.  I had to to initiate the puzzle 4 times, and on the 5th, after the movie played  my cart moved on.  Lame.  Second thing which bugged me all the way through the game was the issue with sound, which is a minus to the American translation/sound design crew, and probably not to the German developers of the game.  The sound sequences are not normalized in terms of sound level  sometimes the main character&apos;s voice is barely audible, while the &quot;police&quot; voice-overs really hurt my ears.  So, even though the translation is nice, there was no final mixing i assume?  A job 80% done.  Come on.  Also, some of the sound effects were annoying to the extent of a tooth-aching pain!
<br>WHAT I LIKED: Loved the art  although it could have been deeper and better, given more detail would be added.  Still  cartoony (Oblongs-Style), happy, hand-drawn style.  Enjoyed it a lot.  Humor  so, since this is a German game, i did not expect much, however, in terms of translation, and humor this game come pretty solid, and even though you will not fall down from the chair in spasms of laughter, the game will make you smile.  Story  a good projection of an ancient science fiction theme (don&apos;t want to spoil anything for people who are yet to play this game, but if you read, you will find references to several popular themes of current writers and writers of the past).  Puzzle-wise  a Normal difficulty (i&apos;ve played quite a few adventures, and cannot say Deponia is a mind-twister, and it does not make you do some irrational things).  Also, a ton of dialogue in this game; some pretty funny, some not very, but all  pretty well-written.  Characters: some characters are just thumbs up!  Lonzo is my favorite one!  Amazing voice-acting!
<br>RECOMMEND to any adventure lover and a newbie who enjoys a walkie-talkie and a good smile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3457896">Expand</a></span>

I have never played a game with such an unlikable protagonist in all of my years of gaming. I played for about an hour, and just could not take his personality. Why somebody would want to make a character so horrible is beyond me. I suggest that you never buy this game.</span>

<br>
<br>Pros:

<br>Story build up is wonderful and there is going to be a sequel so I can&apos;t really judge just one game.
<br>The puzzles had a mix a mix of difficulty. Mostly easy, though wish it was harder. The dialog is funny and always makes you think of Guybrush or pink panther. I loved the voice overs (English version) the voices totally fit the characters.
<br>
<br>Cons: There are two things that bother me but not by much.
<br>Audio balance was wrong with the guys in the mask. They were much to loud for anything else.
<br>Animation at some times looked rush and horrible. But other times were beautifully done. 9/10
<br>
<br>P.S: I never do reviews, this game is special and deserves one even if you think my reviews sucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2559012">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Cons: Two major gripes!
<br>Not enough items to make it harder. Remember in Monkey Island how there were a ton of items, some were useless, some were to be combined several times etc. In Deponia, the puzzles are fine, but the items are fairly limited and it makes the guesses far easier. I think the searchable areas could have been a bit less linear. We should have been able to go to the town AND mine area at the start and have intertwine the puzzles and items between both locations - this would have made the game harder, and more items in your inventory.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563676">Expand</a></span>

The art is good, but still the animations are not very fluid. The puzzles are so so... i mean, i guess unbalanced. Sometimes, as for many games in this genre, i couldn&apos;t get the reason why something should merge with something other... Some other times the answer was way too easy. The ambient is well thought, still not innovative nor particularly enjoyable. The general feeling was of, sadly, boredom. i was repeating to myself over and over, &quot;oh! one other clich&#xE8;!&quot;.
<br>The story it&apos;s a bit messy. I just feel the things where going on whitout really caring.
<br>Also, i couldn&apos;t avoid a thought: The music is uninspired and ugly. If only music could be better, the game would have been better too.
<br>I would have rated this 6, but i believe this game could still be enjoyed more by others, for the mere fact, for example, that influences of great games of the past are present. The main character and the kind of jokes, resembles those of Guybrush Threepwood and his legacy... Not quite at that level, but still: nice effort. Sometimes you smile... i mean, you don&apos;t really lough (except once, for me). You smile.

<br>it&apos;s a 7 for me </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2941955">Expand</a></span>

It shows how a point and click can be very simple; however, it also takes away the very thing that really makes these types of games unique: trivial discoveries.  There are a handful of things that you won&apos;t need to interact with, but it still is far short of the standard assortment of useless objects to observe and play with that I expected.  It takes away from the humor and from the puzzles too.  When you walk in a room and only 2-3 things can be interacted with it really simplifies any puzzles in that location.  This game felt more like a light version of what a point and click should be.  I still enjoyed it, and by the end I realized that it had a more than decent story to it.  It could have been much better though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2683765">Expand</a></span>

It sometimes takes a few clicks on an item to properly select it. Second, the Organon voices are very loud and grating. You might not want to play at high volume.</span>

<br>
<br>I found it rather boring with endless boring chatter, nearly falling asleep playing it. And after completing it and now trying to get the achievement Droggeljug makes me dislike this game even more, having to play through the entire game again in droggeljug mode is terrible, instead of usual speech all the characters can say is droggeljug repeatedly and everything is labeled droggeljug instead of the usual object name or location etc. &gt;&lt;
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t reccomend as the only interesting thing is the world and art style. Don&apos;t like the story, dialogue or characters.(especially Rufus) Rufus is annoying and I wish I could kill him off somehow.
<br>It&apos;s a rather average game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=5528785">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only downside i found about it is bugs, will explain : some times you get stuck in a room and not able to move to another room... fixable by loading a saved game before it happened. (made me remake a new game at first because i didn&apos;t know this bug is in the game.)
<br>don&apos;t think that i ever spent so much time playing a single game as i did with this one.
<br>really loved this game and can recommend it to others.
<br>
<br>Giving it a solid 8 (would have bin 9 without bugs)
<br>This bugs are not present in the follow up games of this series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6389854">Expand</a></span>
