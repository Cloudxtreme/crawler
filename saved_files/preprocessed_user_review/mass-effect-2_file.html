A true roleplaying game, with choices you&apos;ve made following you to the end, instead of just the hollow leveling. Makers of Fina Fantasy should play this game to learn how to write good and believable characters and outcomes.</span>

Another problem was that the game just didnt seem to flow as well as the first, bioware said that they wanted to make you always know where you were in the game but I personally don&apos;t think of more loading screens as the answer to this, the first one the lifts were annoying but they always kept YOU in the game, you could walk over ot the normandy and go inside on your own free will rather than have to rely on shuttles to always take you there. Now to move onto the small annoyances, firstly is this ammo system, didn&apos;t like it, cant say anything more other than that, on harder difficulties there just isn&apos;t enough ammo and no-matter how bioware try ot explain it in the backstory it just feels like technology has moved backwards. Continuity is my final moan, whether its nobody anywhere else outside the normandy caring that youve completed your &apos;suicide&apos; mission after returning and talking to them if you choose to play on after the main storyline has finished, or if its the deranged survivors of a crashed spaceship that have been stranded for 10 years with no outside contact but still seem to have all the same &apos;up to date&apos; technology that you have. It may seem that after all that I&apos;&apos;ve said against it that a score of 8 is generous but I will sa that everything else that I havent moaned at the game does right, the story is good, team-mate interaction and backstories are integrated will and the missions do have a very good variety to them. default game controls were dreadfull so I had to retone them back to being as similar to me1 as I could. One final point is that the final mission just didnt feel as emotional as bioware had promised, on the contrary I found myself using biowares chosen method of player choice during this mission to bump off all the team members I didnt liek and ended up feeling quite pleased with myself about it so I wont say its a bad thing, just not what was promised. Definately worth getting but not as good as the first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745032">Expand</a></span>

Better than the first in almost every way. The only major problem is the controls, thanks to [insert curse word here] consoles. There is no mouse wheel control at all (except weapon toggling), you can&apos;t double-click anything, even single clicking menu items wont do anything when you expect it to, which means that you end up clicking a menu item, then clicking the button at the bottom.. repeat and rinse until clean. Plus you cant move left or right when you are sprinting, weapon selection is slow and tedious, general menu navigation delays, and other control related problems ruining the whole experience. But other than that, the game itself is great! Awesome story line and characters, interesting locations and missions, unlike the first game where planet exploration was repetitive and boring. One thing that does get tedious is the planet scanning. You need to spend 5 minutes scanning each globe to gather minerals for upgrades, which becomes quite tiresome after the tenth planet scan. Another problem is moving your character around in the levels. You end up &quot;snapping&quot; to cover when unexpected, and its a pain &quot;unsnapping&quot; from cover, and you tend to get stuck on corners for no apparent reason, and sometimes you become completely stuck in a wall, resulting in you having to reload the last save point. It would have gotten 10/10 if it wasn&apos;t riddled with consolitis.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745600">Expand</a></span>

<br>After you get playing</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This game was my first in the Mass Effect series. Unfortunately I discovered the series way after it was popular. So at first I didn&apos;t know what the hub bub was about. If your new to the series at first it just seems a little flat. It seemed it was more about graphics and such. And the series seemed to be a more modern and not Star Wars universe rip off of KOTOR.
<br>
<br>After you get playing you see what the series  is about. It has a lot going for it. First it is a first person shooter for the average Joe. Then they throw in coordinated squad combat. They up the anti by giving you a character that can allow you to chose good or bad actions, as you choose without ruining the storyline. They wisely have you playing the title character but allow you to customize your story and looks. They also have you choose a class, but allow you to chose the way your character levels up. Which can greatly alter your game experience when you choose to replay the game.
<br>
<br>Then they allow you to upgrade weapons, your ship and even choose how your squad mates level up. You can even just let your squad mates help you in fights or command them who to attack. But to make the game better they add mini games. Which just adds an entire new level of enjoyment to the game.
<br>
<br>But the big draw is probably story. The game has a story line for you. You make choices that can affect the way your companions see you. And may subtly affect other aspects of the story. On top of that story you get other stories very much like the KOTOR series does.
<br>
<br>In the end the game seems to take the best of the KOTOR series and change it up enough so that you have similarly great aspects. But with enough changes to make the system seem fresh and exciting.
<br>
<br>Because you can choose to go in so many directions the game has great replay value. Certainly a game worth owning. And probably should be in any RPG fan&apos;s collection.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4012798">Expand</a></span>

<br>Production values - best character animations and voice acting I saw - closer to AAA movie than a game  - but the story is really lame and shooter gameplay bored me to death. Halfway through I deleted my Origin account to never see this again.</span>

Bioware, unfortunately, took a few steps in the wrong direction for me. Story? Epic quality was still there from the old game. A wonderful ride and build up. Looking forward to ME3 and seeing how this all works out. Gameplay? Ehhhh...I have a few issues with it. The gun battles had far more the feel of other console shooters than what most would expect from other RPG type games...no health bar, no needing to heal your health, you just...healed if you found cover and stopped getting shot. It makes the battles easier, but...I&apos;m not all about the easy. inventory. Whyyy did you do this Bioware? Looting and customization and the like are bread and butter! Without those, it&apos;s just another shooter where you&apos;re trying to keep your ammo up and money rolling in. I love looting, never knowing what you&apos;ll pick up next, how well it&apos;ll protect you, mod your guns/armor, or kill the enemy even better. Current &apos;inventory&apos; system or lack thereof is a definite lose for me. Flying around the galaxy and scanning planets. C&apos;mon!! This is tedious and boring! Shepard is the commander of the crew...Joker is the pilot of the ship. You should be able to say &apos;scan this planet&apos; and they do it. You should be able to say &apos;go here&apos; and it happens. You should not need to fly the ship and manually scan the planet with the equivalent of a metal detector. Fails on both of those issues. The Mako. I loved it. it was awesome! They completely removed that element from the game...no new vehicle to drive around in and explore...just the shuttle to ferry you from the ship to the next shooting battle and back. Ammo - I have no issues with having ammo in the game. But it really doesn&apos;t make sense to implement that story-wise after Mass Effect, except for the heavy weapons. Yes, I know they&apos;re &apos;disposable heat sinks&apos;...but that really doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense. Why go with a gun that could run out of things that let it shoot, when you could get a model two years older and shoot the night away? Also, the whole thing of &apos;everyone&apos; using universally sized heatsinks is just...laughable. Different aliens developing different weapons...even if you say it all became sort of conglomerated together after they became spacefaring, how do you explain the more advanced or isolated alien spacefarers using &apos;the exact same thing&apos;?? Minigames...great change from the previous hacking/bypassing mechanic. All good there. Overall, giving it a 7 for storyline, overall playability, and the fact it doesn&apos;t seem to have come out before it was ready like so many games seem to do nowadays. Lost points for some of the changes they&apos;ve implemented and really hoping they don&apos;t continue down this change path for ME3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745354">Expand</a></span>

This all ending with the most funny final boss I have seen in a decade. Sorry Bioware, but an overgrown Terminator may scare 5 years old kids, other people just have to laugh... ME2 is the biggest disappointment I have ever had in my 20 years of playing games.

I&apos;d like to still say it&apos;s a 8/10 but it doesn&apos;t feel as engaging as ME1, the art/lighting direction/atmosphere (sounds,music) seems weaker. I installed ME1 at the same time to do some comparison and ME2 on-planet locations or the stations aren&apos;t quite as compelling. The battles have improved and I like that I could start on the most difficult setting immediately as the first game was rather easy except for couple boss fights, ME2 with Insanity the difficulty is just right. Where in ME1 there was too much easy money and drops of weapons, here atleast with the Insanity setting I feel compelled to get tech upgrades. The down side to this is the new planet scanning minigame, which is ridiculous. First, the scan speed is relative to mouse sensitivity and second it&apos;s just completely boring. Star Control 2 did everything* better (*where comparisons can be applied, mainly the exploration/scanning and non-linear feeling story).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745006">Expand</a></span>

Most of the traditional elements of RPGs, like exploration, character development, and loot have been &quot;streamlined&quot; out of the game. What&apos;s left is a very pretty third-person shooter with a good story. In sum, great for shooter fans, but RPG fans might want to think twice.</span>

As I have played 100% PC and only PC games in all my life, I am able to smell &quot;CONSOLE ORIENTED GAME&quot; from ten miles away. This game is so rank of CONSOLE that PC gamers will need to plug their noses with cement to avoid the that vile substance of CONSOLE from creeping up their nose and leading to the explosion in to tiny gooey bits of one&apos;s poor head. EVERYTHING about this game has console caked all over it like a raging infestation, from the uber-clunkazoid controls and the lack of any engaging or all-too-useful RPG elements, to the lack of any challenge whatsoever (on any difficulty). In short, if youre looking for an RPG with interesting, fluid gameplay and a satisfying array of RPG elements, you might want to avoid. Otherwise, if you&apos;re looking for a general run-of the mill shooter with a nice blockbuster story, pick it up, you wont be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745186">Expand</a></span>

Reviews of this game have been astoundingly good but honestly I didn&apos;t find it to be anything special or groundbreaking. ME2 continues Bioware&apos;s legacy of great RPG games with a deep, intriguing storyline as always. However, it doesn&apos;t flow as well as past Bioware games. The one word that pops into my head while playing this game is &quot;formulaic&quot; because every level is designed the same. Every planet you go to, it&apos;s &quot;find some person&quot; or &quot;kill this dude&quot;, which results in you having to do some trivial task. The task usually is just &quot;survive from point a to point b.&quot; As you travel, it&apos;s one hallway leading to an open area...guess what it&apos;s an ambush..another hallway, hallway, open area again, elevator, repeat it all again. I don&apos;t really know how to describe it but it just feels super repetitive. Yeah each &quot;mission&quot; has a story that goes with it but in terms of gameplay/level design it&apos;s all identical. On the bright side though, I loved the fact that there are 10 members in your party (11 with DLC) and each is very well developed. Gun selection is surprisingly diverse for an RPG...close to 25-30 weapons in all. Oh and unfortunately for PC gamers, the UI has been overhauled and is more friendly for consoles so yeah. Mass Effect 3 is in production but the ending of ME2 is really lame...it&apos;s like ME3 is really ME2 part 2. ME2 didn&apos;t have an ending really like ME1 did. I know my thoughts have been a little scattered throughout this but hopefully my review sheds some light on the strengths and weaknesses of this game. If you take anything out of this review, take this advice: don&apos;t expect anything groundbreaking or you&apos;ll be disappointed. It&apos;s definitely a fun game but a 94/100...really?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=745469">Expand</a></span>

Coupled with a faster pace than a traditional RPG you are sucked right in and dragged along. With an ending dramatic enough for the movies you won&apos;t be disappointed playing it all the way through. But do take time out to explore and find the hidden missions in the outer systems. Team AI is on the whole pretty good, theres a few points where your squad gets stuck or runs forward like an idiot into a wall of bullets. But generous quantities of medi-gel make it more of a task just to revive them rather than a game breaking issue. For a PC release you really do feel this was developed for the consoles, lack of a basic screen shot function is very obvious. But the simplified interface leaves you more time to focus on enjoying the game and not just juggling stats.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=746079">Expand</a></span>

I did not like the restrictive environments (you can&apos;t really go anywhere on the Citadel for example), but in general if you liked the first, you should give this one a chance.  Planet scanning does suck though.</span>

The second game has improved a few of the niggling gameplay issues in the first game, but still has a little room for improvement. It&apos;s easy to forgive any minor flaws in the game though, simply because of its finesse and style overall. The Mass Effect games so far have been two of the most evocative titles released in the last 5 years. If you&apos;ve played the first game, you probably already bought the second. If you&apos;ve played neither, start now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1369727">Expand</a></span>

Beat it twice- Once time Good- One time doing what i would do in real life. So, the Good: Great Graphics - Superb Story Line - Great Characters  The Bad - The RPG elements have been downgraded from ME1. It just doesn&apos;t feel the same, strategic feel, of the first ME. I can just run around pressing (spacebar) on everything. With that aside, only small glitches in acting/voice appear rarely. I&apos;ve had only 2 problems like this since it came out - 1) Miranda -on her loyalty mission- was floating above us when we came out of the elevator. 2) The sound of cars (In Lair of The Shadow Broker) kept continuing after i crashed the detective, and fought her guards. So, besides the RPG elements and rare glitches, this is a very, very good game. With the captivating story line, and stunning graphics, i only wonder how they will beat this with ME3 (It IS a trilogy, and ME3 WILL come out, in-case some of you did not know). The only thing they could&apos;ve done better, was tone up the RPG element, which i believe they will do in ME3. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is thinking about getting it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1390656">Expand</a></span>

I, for one, genuinely believe this game is a ground breaking game that beautifully combined shooter gameplay with a role playing storyline and it&apos;s also the best game Bioware offered so far after Baldur&apos;s Gate series. The most problems people complained at are actually what makes mass effect 2 truly shine. I understand die hard RPG fans are very hard to please, but the game has to evolve to get better. Mass Effect 2 did it and did it brilliantly. First, the removal of redundant inventory makes mass effect 2 a very well paced game. One of major bad design in mass effect is its painful inventory system. so you are a distinguish soldier and a spectre and you still have to kill mobs to loot better weapons and armors or sell those stuff for credits? why the council does not supply the best gears and funds to you? Also, dont you feel weird that a human being can carry dozens of guns and armors with him. Mass Effect 2 did it right, shepard can only carry several guns on mission and every weapon you start with is still viable in later game, also you get funds directly from Cerberus. Those changes are made for better experience. One thing I do miss is the weapon mods. they could do it like deus ex that gives a small and limited space to store some extra stuff.  Second, character development is still a huge part of gameplay and the skills and abilities are still necessary for combat and social especially when mass effect 2&apos;s shooting mechanics is actually not that great. Some people think that role-playing means running around for meaningless side quests (mass effect 1 comes to mind) and keeping track of stats. I would those are not what defines role playing game. Mass Effect 2 gives the player the true immersion that you can expect from a role playing story line. That means taking a role and feel your role not plodding with meaningless exploration and stats.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1594653">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Great storyline: worthy of Star Wars series
<br>-Detailed background history
<br>-Great character psychological profiles
<br>-Fluid and intensive action

<br>-Good sound-tracks
<br>-Many hours of game

Its quite simply really, there are some small flaws. I will try to explain them, but know the game is really an extremely well designed experience. With that said; I find there are two flaws in this game. First, the number of comrades you pick up in the game is to large. Now, you might ask why this could possibly be a problem. This is quite simple, all of them have a &quot;loyalty quest&quot; - and with so many comrades all the sidequests feel a disconnected to the main plot. Add to this that with so many comrades, you never get a special feeling for any of the comrades - like you did in the first mass effect where you had a more limited number of them. Its a shame really.<br><br>The second flaw, is the whole weapon system. This problem is more compounded by several smaller issues. First off is the &quot;new and improved&quot; ammo system, which blows to be honest. The first game had a heatcooldown system, which was actually fine. Now you have what they call &quot;heat clips&quot; that are universal, yet you cant shift them between the your weapons - this is just plain odd. besides the weapon selection is dumbed down to much. You have a severely limited amount of weapontypes to choose from, and the way you upgrade and find them feel.... well to be honest, mildly retarded. But even though the games have these flaws, I will still rate it a 9 for the solid script, plot and surperb gameplay.<br><br>Score (9.0)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1568436">Expand</a></span>

Developed characters, epic story, interesting plot.  However, i must point out - i feel that the decision between good and bad choices (Paragon vs Renegade) affects the progression of  the game in no way whatsoever.  Yes, if your Paragon (goodness) is high enough, locked options will become available to you in dialogues; but as to the effect on the overall story - whether you are an angel or a bad ass - has no effect whatsoever.  I wish in some way it did, and an alternative path could be taken by a Renegade than the paragon fan.  It is not the case, unfortunately.  The rhythm of the game is, too, a little bit off - it seems every character (from your gathered team) waits until the very end of the game, to pour his entire life&apos;s story on you.  Very anti-climatic, considering how the ending picks up the pacing of the story.  These are the only negatives i have for this game - otherwise, a solid blockbuster for me!   Enjoyed highly!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5244741">Expand</a></span>

Also, the main plot was illogical (Derelict reaper that popped up out of nowhere, no one thinks to show it to the council; the final choice has no impact on what happens in ME3).  Aside from that, this is a fairly solid third-person shooter, with much improved music, graphics, and game mechanics over the first, but with a weaker plot and less RPG elements.  Oh, and for those who want to get the Kasumi DLC; Don&apos;t.

This game was very enjoyable in all facets - story, amazing music, game play, leveling, everything is interesting and fun.  They did a great job with the game and the only thing keeping me from giving it a 10 is that parts of it felt a little rushed, it was mildly buggy at times, and it was abused with some rather stupid DLC .. weapons/armor packs anyone?  That&apos;s EA at work, though, not Bioware.  God, I hate EA so much.  Everything they touch is tainted with bad, greedy marketing and the taint of stockholders who care more about profits this year than long term.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2147525">Expand</a></span>

Two points were taken off for these reasons: 1) Looting system is gone. This is not cool (especially when they decided not to bring it in ME3); 2) DLCs involve story-critical missions. I had to go back and get all the DLCs before I start ME3. These years this has been a game publishing trend - (FFXIII-2 I&apos;m talking about you) using DLC as a lure out of hard-working (or playing) gamers&apos; pockets. We&apos;d pay if it&apos;s an excellent (or is a fanboy of) game, but not through these little DLC packages. There should totally have been a GOTY edition made to include all DLCs so I didn&apos;t have to collect them one by one painfully through the Cerberus Network. I am saddened today to learn that the Mass Effect series ended up like every other (pinnacle at 2, tragedy at 3): Uncharted, Gears of War, God of War etc...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2253131">Expand</a></span>

There is a decent amount of character customization, but far less when compared to the previous installment. Exploring the different planets is a fun affair, but lacks solidness.<br><br>Also, the fact that the game is bogged down by countless DLC snippets of storyline leaves a bad taste in this gamer&apos;s mouth. I am all for more content, but the majority of it felt as though it were being ripped out from the main game on the disc. The days when video games were video games, instead of constant sources of income for companies that already have billions of dollars are long, long gone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2168825">Expand</a></span>

The story is... ok for the most part, a bit stupid and nonsensical here and there but it&apos;s nothing big. Now for the bad: exploration is completely gone. Instead of improving it like they did with the combat they just removed it completely. The replacement for it, the mining game, is not any better. The galaxy seems smaller now but the multitude of hub worlds sort of fills in the gap left by it. They also removed the inventory system (which was very bad in ME1) and replaced it with an upgrade system. It&apos;s good but it still would&apos;ve been better to have an inventory. Conclusion: Small problems here and there but the good parts outweigh them. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2579142">Expand</a></span>

Like most Bioware RPGs, it featured above-average writing and character development. Throughout the game I felt invested in the story and the characters, who I grew to care about and (eventually) mourn their deaths. The gameplay in general was fun and the environments were interesting. My main complaint is that there is little you can do to customize your characters: your main character can wear different armor pieces which are slightly different, and along the way you collect weapon upgrades which are automatic. The only real customization is in your talent points, but there are few of these and they do not generally affect gameplay as much as you might expect. I ended up taking these limitations with a grain of salt and just enjoyed blasting things instead, but I could see this being a significant setback for some players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2540641">Expand</a></span>

Perhaps one of the greatest features of this game is that every shepard is different, not just aesthetically but in the advancements, weapons and classes. I spent close to 36 hours playing this game with all the DLC and enjoyed every second of building up a squad and slowly playing through their loyalty missions in order to leave no one behind at the final mission. My only criticism is that it is it is less open world then it should be as after all you are given a galaxy to explore and yet can only walk around on a small number of them and 3/4 have no purpose other than mineral gathering. But overall the style of this game has one me over 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2543510">Expand</a></span>

This is a must play for any RPG fan. ME2&apos;s development started right after EA acquired Bioware, but had a mostly hands off approach to the game.
<br>
<br>ME1&apos;s main flaw was it&apos;s battle system. It was lackluster and needed improvement. Bioware decided to take the risk and incorporate a &quot;real&quot; FPS system in ME2. Well, that risk payed off bigtime in one of the best blockbuster RPG&apos;s of our time.
<br>
<br>Other traditional RPG elements such as inventory management are eliminated helping to streamline your experiences. And you know what? It works, it fits. It helps you focus on more important, and more enjoyable things in the game. Having a simple upgrade system works much better.
<br>
<br>ME2 takes the game to all new levels. A deeper, more interesting battle system. The character interactions are excellent. The development, the actions you take, the choices you make really do affect the outcome of this story.
<br>
<br>As in Classic Star Wars fashion, the second movie raises the stakes even higher, is darker and more serious than ever. The real possibility of your teammates dying in the final, suicide mission was a brilliant move by Bioware. The game climaxes at the best point  the end  where you see all your work, all of your choices unfold, leaving some to the next and final part of the trilogy. The raise in tension is felt throughout the game, and drives the player forward.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack is excellent and accurately reflects such high stakes.
<br>
<br>ME2 really surpassed the bar for RPG&apos;s. It had me glued to the game. When I am glued to a game playing it every day from start to finish, I know its a hit.
<br>
<br>Its just such a shame that it&apos;s sequel, ME3 was unfortunately a lackluster, rushed finish and a real letdown. Obviously, EA had involved themselves in the final game, which really screwed up ME3.
<br>
<br>Most gamers will recognize ME2 as the real climax of the series and the best out of the 3.

Mass Effect 1 was more focused on RPG elements and choice based plot, with less focus on shooting sequences. Mass Effect 2 changes that. Since ME2 was a very anticipated release, I think Bioware tried to make it a more crowd pleasing game. ME2 thrives in it&apos;s combat elements, graphics, and plot, but lags in being an RPG. Leveling up was toned down, along with various other elements. Other than that though, I feel Mass Effect 2 is a great game, with good gameplay as well as a plot and characters that makes you care for others on your pixelated screen of choice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2906769">Expand</a></span>

Mass Effect 2 is a Action third person shooter first and foremost.
<br>ANYONE thinking ME2 would continue on the deep and compelling Universe and story lines set up in Mass effect will be greatly disappointed. Even the save game transfers from ME are mostly meaningless as all the carry over choices (with exception of 1 but ill not ruin that here) are minimalized and finished off with NO future adventure or interaction (beyond a short conversation here and there).
<br>
<br>In short the Open World Storyline design of Mass Effect is removed and replaced with a singular Linear Third Person Shooter design.
<br>
<br>now none of that is terrible (well other then short length of game, thats unforgivable), if thats what you went in expecting. Sadly EA marketted this game as the spiritual and RPG expansion of the first to up box sales at release. Typical EA.
<br>
<br>Mass Effect 2 is a Sci Fi third person shooter. Its has semi interesting characters and you even get to decide who you romance (WOOT, from choosing if a alien speices lives or dies in ME1 to who you get a black screen with in ME2).
<br>
<br>In the end, If you like the Mass Effect Universe and like shooters, you will like this game
<br>Just dont go into it thinking your getting the next installment of the original Mass Effect RPG. That franchise stopped production after #1</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3166985">Expand</a></span>

The story in the game is full of as many plot holes as a cardboard box after you took a tommy gun to it, and the characters, although good, have no purpose of being there for the most part. if you want a nice TPS this game is for you, otherwise just find something else you will thank yourself latter. There is no connection to the main plot and the events that transpire are pointless. How this game is considered one of the best ever is beyond me but for a TPS it is passable. Overall a 6/10 a above average game that can only be recommended to some shooter lovers of games like Gears of War.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3174019">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Mass Effect went from being a wonderful, epic RPG that was very unique, to a poor cover based shooter. I don&apos;t hate cover based shooters, but Mass Effect 2 did a terrible job with it. The enemies are predictable and do the same damning thing every time that it just becomes boring! I can&apos;t recommend this game, but it doesn&apos;t mean it was bad. Just very disappointing if you played the original.</span>

<br>Story and characters are so well done!
<br>
<br>Cons:

<br>No coop </span>

<br>Rating this one slightly lower than the original even with the improvements.  The story seemed to shift slightly, and there wasn&apos;t as much influence of the background lore.  The RPG elements may have been clunky in the original, but they were mostly streamlined/stripped from the second.  Did not feel like the character progressed much in strength outside of weapons.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3800608">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It is not a dungeon crawling RPG anymore. The inventory management was &quot;streamlined&quot; to oblivion. Same goes to the stats.
<br>
<br>The maps still look nice but they are absolutely linear, COD style.The designers even removed the map function altogether in case of combat maps. If you hit M, a compass will point to a direction and that is it.
<br>
<br>The combat system was changed for the worse. I absolutely hate the ammo system. The overheat system of Mass Effect 1 was way better to control the damage output. I run out of ammo from the primary and secondary weapons frequently because the enemies seldom drop anything.
<br>
<br>The story is smaller, less interesting and somewhat forced. It doesn&apos;t feel too connected to the events in Mass Effect 1. Some background stories of the characters were nice, but the character development doesn&apos;t really fit a 2nd part. Mass Effect 2 story would have worked a whole lot better as Mass Effect 1. Then the story of Mass Effect 1 would follow.
<br>
<br>The ending is very weak compared to ME1. You spend 60+ hours to build up the team for the heist. And then, it is over in 45 mins. Whaat? And the last enemy is just silly. I can&apos;t find a better word for it. If it was ME1, then it would be OK. However, after ME1 ending, it pales in comparision.
<br>
<br>The replay value is still low. I know I will not force myself through the storyline as a renegade just to see some slightly different plotlines. The game is just too long to redo it for 10-20% difference in the outcome.
<br>
<br>The interface is worse than in ME1.
<br>
<br>The planetary exploration interface slightly more useful. However I would rather have a mix of ME1 rover maps and ME2 scanner minigame then just this or just that.
<br>
<br>All in all, I don&apos;t know what the idea was with ME2, but it doesn&apos;t do service or add improvement to the fans of ME1 on any level.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6927359">Expand</a></span>

It is a Third-Person Shooter with RPG elements and levelling system, seem similar to Bethaseda&apos;s Fallout 3 and Gears of War. It is developed by Bioware and Produced by EA.<br><br>To start off with the advantages to this game brings is it&apos;s newly improved user-friendly GUI than the one previously used in Mass Effect 1 letting players decide their custom characters and their &apos;powerups&apos; that they may use.  but reductions in custom armour might disappoint fans. Bioware has introduced many optimizations, making performance better. Visuals are on a high standard, giving low-poly models a high-resol look. Gameplay is frantic and fast yet feels less of a challenge than that of Mass Effect 1, it fails to become more strategic and more Gears of War-esque fighting. Landscapes are lush and surreal giving the player or user that xenophobic feel. Artificial intelligence is realistic if a little untactical, if any player hides it does not move if it has superior damage it simply stays put on any difficulty.<br><br>Mass Effect introduces innovative quasi-Fallout dialogue choices, giving the user to become more of a &quot;Paragon&quot; or &quot;Renegade&quot; soldier, deciding the overall afflictions decided in the running franchise. Characters have interesting backstories and plots but yet feel somewhat impersonal to the player, disrupting their curiosity to know more about the fictional characters, leaving the interaction a little dry during cutscenes, leaving players to read about them using &apos;Codex&apos;.<br><br>Mass Effect 2&apos;s minigames, while novelty in their own right, give the player larger abilities by extracting minerals for different planets, somewhat supporting the lack of customization mentioned before, the armour cannot not be changed but can be coloured to suit the players taste. Overall, I&apos;d would rate this game a 7, it is not as good as it&apos;s predecessor ME1 but definitely improves and elminates niggles that would otherwise, frankly, irritate the player. It&apos;s lasting appeal is little though, giving the player little reason to play it again on a harder level. Difficulty is sustained well but not enough for extraordinarily hardened players such as myself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769517">Expand</a></span>

Mass Effect 2 presents a solid narration, framed by a deep and compelling sci-fi universe, further enriched by an epic Vangelis-like soundtrack. Most important, the game is not as dull as it has been portrayed. The information you are given throughout the game about the lore and the various civilizations are just accurate and interesting; the dialogues, though not within Bioware standards, are well-presented, even though they do lack a more precise choice system, sometimes making the player look awkward.<br>On the other hand, the plot is consistent and at times rises to the greatness of the true legend, even though there&apos;s a couple of side quests (companions related ones) are definitely below-par.<br>Technically speaking, the graphics have been enhanced if compared to the first episode, while the game engine runs flawlessly without any noticeable frame-rate drops. The weapons you are equipped with play just fine and, along with the biotic powers, give the player some really exciting combat sequences (provided you play at least on hardcore more). The overall experience will not be forgotten, as this game will stay with you for quite a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2271995">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t understand how anybody could like this game better than ME1.  I guess the visual style was sleeker?  People thought the controls and fighting mechanics were better?  Here&apos;s what I&apos;ve come to realize.  Mass Effect was a great RPG, with some action/3PS (3rd person shooter?) elements mixed in.  Mass Effect 2, was an action game at heart, with some pretty shoddy RPG elements.  Gone are the multiple tiers and classes of armor, with corresponding types and tiers of upgrades.  Gone is any tactical setup of your squad for combat.  Just spam all of the abilities you can at the enemy.  Gone is a much more detailed and better implemented leveling point system.  And gone is planetary exploring, which I think would have been cooler if they fleshed it out instead of getting rid of it entirely.  People say the combat in ME2 was better.  Not to me.  I read all the codex.  What they had implemented in 1 made sense with the lore.  Didn&apos;t like overheating?  Too bad, get a *better weapon* or *better upgrades*.  Jesus it&apos;s called customizability.  That&apos;s what an RPG is all about.  There were some *really* cool things they implemented in 2, however.  So here is the good part of the review.  Just the plain fact that you could actually continue a character on from 1 was amazing to me.  However, I thought ME2&apos;s characters were better than 1&apos;s anyway, so I&apos;m glad you got to work with an almost entirely new cast.  (Although they kept my favorite Quarian :D.)  Planet scanning was also way better than that side quest to find minerals from ME1, and I appreciated that you could actually integrate resources you find into your ship and customizing your character.  Although once again, I would appreciate more options.  Finally, there were things I thought were better and worse about the story.  I really liked the loyalty missions, but I think it would have been better to have a central questline instead of making the loyalty missions the central component of the game.  The problem here was that the story lacked focus, as there was literally no plot up until the end when you finally did the suicide mission (which was awesome!!!)  ME1, by comparison, had an extremely focused central questline, but lacked in detailing the side characters perhaps a little bit more.  So that&apos;s pretty much it for this review.  Overall, I think what really got to me was that they took what was supposed to be an RPG series and kinda did away with all that.  I didn&apos;t appreciate that very much.  But since I am all about story, I will say that Mass Effect continues to have a strong story and character design, just perhaps not at the same time.  I am still looking forward to ME3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2152516">Expand</a></span>

<br>Mass Effect 1 wasn&apos;t a pure open world game, but hey, compared to Mass Effect 2 you could call it just as open as GTAs. I mean Mass Effect 2 is so linear, so that a monkey with a controller could complete this game on easy (you&apos;d have to teach him to shoot and collect ammo if you&apos;d want him to beat harder difficulties).
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, the story is great and all, but the gameplay is awful at this point. The second time I played it I used mods to make it feel more like the first game.
<br>Another annoyingly stupid thing is the DLCs. There are too many of them. Ok, maybe that&apos;s not the biggest problem point. They are to expensive for what they are. You wont get more than 2 hours of gameplay with each of them, but they sure cost like if they were at least 10 hours of gameplay. And the fact that the characters got released one by one after release, you had to replay the game over and over again, if you wanted to have the full experience with each of them. It&apos;s just frustrating, if you want to know every little bit of the story, which is the best part of the game.
<br>Essentially, this game was a big disappointment for me, and didn&apos;t feel like a Mass Effect game, at least gameplay wise. The removal of all the best stuff from Mass Effect 1, was the worst part for me, that really hurt the franchise in my eyes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3152605">Expand</a></span>

The big problem is that I have played so many games that no story has felt even remotely original since KotOR. Since then, that story has been redone a few dozen times (Atlus I am looking at you lol). Since stories are no longer original, I depend on RPG elements to give me something to enjoy. Without them, I get bored quickly. Even Mass Effect 1 felt like RPG lite to me but it was still good.
<br>
<br>That said, let me point out that there is some good here for an adventure game. Voice acting was fine, graphics look good, combat was fun (relatively speaking from my perspective) and there is a lot of content. The bad news is that without heavy RPG elements it felt like a FPS MMO (hollow). Characters didnt really have a lot of &quot;character.&quot; Quests... well we have seen them all so nothing new here. Areas were too static and nothing from ME1 seemed to change anything important in ME2. I felt especially bored and dreaded going to the citadel. Other areas are linear which was nice for me because I didnt want to linger out of boredom.
<br>
<br>Overall, its a good game. It is highly overrated but sales numbers speak louder than words.
<br>
<br>ME1 (new IP) - 3.6m (on only PC and XBOX)
<br>ME2 (riding ME1 reputation) - 5.2m (on PC, PS3 &amp; XBOX)
<br>ME3 (riding ME2 reputation) - 5.3m (almost no change)
<br>
<br>Clearly, by looking at the above. The franchise became stagnant as of ME2. If there is an ME4 I would expect sales to drop.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4898401">Expand</a></span>

Its quite simply really, there are some small flaws. I will try to explain them, but know the game is really an extremely well designed experience. With that said; I find there are two flaws in this game. First, the number of comrades you pick up in the game is to large. Now, you might ask why this could possibly be a problem. This is quite simple, all of them have a &quot;loyalty quest&quot; - and with so many comrades all the sidequests feel a disconnected to the main plot. Add to this that with so many comrades, you never get a special feeling for any of the comrades - like you did in the first mass effect where you had a more limited number of them. Its a shame really.<br><br>The second flaw, is the whole weapon system. This problem is more compounded by several smaller issues. First off is the &quot;new and improved&quot; ammo system, which blows to be honest. The first game had a heatcooldown system, which was actually fine. Now you have what they call &quot;heat clips&quot; that are universal, yet you cant shift them between the your weapons - this is just plain odd. besides the weapon selection is dumbed down to much. You have a severely limited amount of weapontypes to choose from, and the way you upgrade and find them feel.... well to be honest, mildly retarded. But even though the games have these flaws, I will still rate it a 9 for the solid script, plot and surperb gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1567862">Expand</a></span>

The plot is mediocre at best, half of the game you will be just looking for your future team members and only some of them (like Samara, Garrus or Tali) are interesting, the rest are boring or even annoying. The game is also pretty short for an RPG- about 25 hours if you complete every sidequest and explore half of the galaxy. Exploring planets is for resources is extremely annoying and ruins all the fun. Also there is almost  no freedom of choice and it is purely cosmetic. The replay value is also pretty low: you will be doing the same thing again and again and changing classes will only make the game harder. So why not just stick to the soldier class, which is virtually unbeatable? The shooting also felt boring and on some levels, i thought i was playing some mediocre  third-person shooter with hordes of enemies to beat, rather than an action RPG. By the way, there are almost no RPG elements left and as for what&apos;s left, it doesn&apos;t have  any significant impact on gameplay. Graphically, the game is also a major disappointment. After so many critics praised the game&apos;s graphics, I thought the game would look near photorealisitc. What a letdown! Models look generally good, but textures are bland and the game lacks details. As for positive sides, the voice acting is good, storyline has it&apos;s good moments, music is excellent, the world, where the game takes place, is also very interesting. In all, the game is worth playing once, but without the replay value, it quickly becomes boring and dull.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1472146">Expand</a></span>

First game laid some great foundations on which the sequel could build on while at the same time the few annoyances from the first game could be improved on or removed, thus making this game a true masterpiece. After watching every publication give this game 9+/10, and in general higher marks then the first game, excitement was high. Well, it took me over a year since purchasing the game to complete it, and not because it was particularly difficult, but rather that I would have to take some serious time away from the game every time I was dissapointed, and there were quite a few of those moments throughout.<br>First, the good.<br>Cut sequences are longer and better than in the first game. Music, the atmosphere during these scenes are on par with any major movie production and it can be quite breathtaking.<br>No more vehicle levels. The biggest annoyance with the first game was the grind that one had to endure while driving the vehicle around for 10-15 min at a time (but it felt like hours).<br>There is certain epic feel to the game, that you are a part of a grand story. Writing/action/feel of the main story line is very good.<br><br>However, negatives are many.<br>It seems that Bioware took the first game and decided to dumb it down in every aspect. Character build went from 10-18 unique stats to 4-8, depending on the class. Weapons have no stats. Weapons can&apos;t be moded  (other than generic &quot;all rifles deal +10% damage&quot;). Game truly does feel like a less polished Gears of War with few dialogue options and illusion of choice.<br>Main game itself is very short. Maybe 3 hours total? The rest is spent assembling the team (and waiting for the timed event to allow you to finish it) and doing very short and straight forward side quests... and mining. Mining replace Maco levels from the first game and its fun for about 12 seconds. You need to mine to upgrade weapons/armors/gear/ship, thus you need to keep doing this. And it ain&apos;t fun at all.<br>Finally, the illusion of choice. Your actions from the first game don&apos;t matter. Your romanced Liara or Ashley, yeah you get 4 seconds of different interaction and that is about it - you still get to do everything exactly the same. Wrex lived in the first game? Little different dialogue, but still the same game with 100% of the options available. Also, while ME1 may have been somewhat revolutionary in a concept of an adult romance story, in ME2 you are on a ship with bunch of single humans and aliens that at the same point in time will let you make a move on them and every love story is exactly the same arc with cut scenes that are little different (with the exception of the Asaris).<br>Finally, the final level, while intense and fast moving, ends with a boss fight that gets introduced to the story in the last 3 minutes of the game. It seems that they felt the game needed something massive at the end and so they created this lame and relatively easy fight against something big.<br>Overall, not a bad game. It just is not an RPG, let alone a great RPG. Its a dumbed down ME1 with the same epic feel and few brilliant moments, but less of everything that made ME1 so good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2290417">Expand</a></span>

Can&apos;t even customize the weapons themselves anymore.  Mirnada is walking around in a catsuit with high heels in space!  Come on!  Ammo powers passed off as skills by class?  What a joke.

It&apos;s incredible. The story is great, so is the amount of content. The graphics are gorgeous, the maps and design is great. There is only one problem for me - the gameplay, which isn&apos;t captivating enough to make me particularly enjoy it. Basically, the gameplay is always the same from start to end and changes little in the entire experience. You duck behind objects and shoot enemies. I find this game to be overhyped for this reason, along with the fact that ME1 did everything this did. The game deserves a solid 8, overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2444158">Expand</a></span>

Exciting and visually orgasmic, but only the first time around. After that, you see past the special effects, notice it&apos;s flaws and decide it wasn&apos;t that great after all. The worst part is that ME2 looks exactly the same on every playthrough. Freedom of choice or non-linearity? Forget it! The only choices you can make are whether you want Shep to be a jerkass or a slightly nicer jerkass when talking to people. Even paragon Shepard isn&apos;t really someone you&apos;d want to meet. The only thing I really liked about ME2 were the squad members - while they aren&apos;t exactly nice people, they&apos;re all well written and generally likeable. Overall, ME2 is a dumbed down ME1 (which was hardly a complex cRPG) stripped of it&apos;s non linearity and fitted with better graphics and a more Gears of War style combat system. Good for one go, but no more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2482177">Expand</a></span>
