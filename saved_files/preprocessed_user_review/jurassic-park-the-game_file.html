All the characters are hard trope-bound archetypes, and when TellTale was dealing with cartoony games ala Sam &amp; Max  or the heavily stylized Back to the Future adventure games, it was easy to get away with that. The graphics are bad, and even though TT have demonstrated their ability to frame their games attractively, there&apos;s a lot of places where the weakness of their engine is put in center stage even though it looks like it should something in the side or behind the parts that have more than 5 polygons in them. Also, yes, the gameplay is heavily derivative of Heavy Rain where it&apos;s nothing but Quick Time Events, but it&apos;s done BADLY. In regard to Heavy Rain, say what you will about the game, the motions you were directed towards actually translated quite naturally to the actions of the characters. In Jurassic Park, the actions are tedious, you will be tapping the same two or three buttons rapidly OVER and OVER the moment you start the game. When you&apos;re not running from dinosaurs, it plays very similar to TT&apos;s adventure games where you have to accomplish a goal by click on certain things in a certain order before you find a cutscene (lots of tapping) and move on. But one consistent  annoyance is when you look at something, the camera will want to pan up/left/right to acknowledge a clue. To pan the camera, you have to tap a button for 5-6 seconds fast enough EVERY time. Whether you&apos;re looking at footprints or a window, whatever else, the game finds a way to annoy you with repetitive, immersion breaking button tapping. You&apos;re also given dialogue options, but it&apos;s all filler until you find the one that actually moves the story along and it&apos;s usually one off lines to reinforce how much of a jerk a character is or is some callback to the movie. The game has some charm to it, but the style and actual gameplay do little but suck away what enjoyment I could have for the game. It&apos;s through and through a love letter to Jurassic Park, from the faithful music to the Dodgson jokes, taking place alongside the movie, and it tries hard to be likable, but playing it is just not fun and cannot be recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=1939925">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are console friendly, meaning crappy textures, crappy lighting, crappy models. Voice acting is average at best, with no great performances but a few horrible ones. The worst part of this game though is the dialogue which is bad throughout but at some points so awful it&apos;s comical. While it does feel like a Jurassic Park movie, I paid to play a game, not a movie and even as a movie it&apos;s a fairly boring one at that.  If you want a good dinosaur adventure find Dino Crisis, if you want a good cinematic adventure go play King King.  Both are much better time spent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2472098">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game itself is just simple buttonpressing, which works ok for the most part, not allways ( YOU HAD ONE JOB!). Graphics have a comic style which is average at best. Sound randomly resets to maximum level and is way too loud.
<br>
<br>Since i can&#xB4;t finish this game, i will try to get my money back from TTG and i am allready pissed off that i bought The Walking Dead as well, because the TTG Forums are full of people complaining about that game as well. I guess you should just never buy a game from these guys, they are very bad at troubleshooting and are generally only interested in generating money and don&#xB4;t care that their games are a buggy mess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2560376">Expand</a></span>

I admit it is fun, but I find myself just sitting at my desk, head in one hand at times, and watching the game unfold, and when prompted I press a buss or two. Some times I even get to move my mouse to investigate, but this is definitely not a action RPG. It&apos;s a story-driven action-prompting interactive movie and I cannot recommend nor can I recommend. My personal opinion is to try a demo first or go on youtube and see how the game works. this game might not be for everyone, unless you&apos;re a real jJurassic Park fan. I like this game for the aesthetics, entertainment  and storyline.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2684499">Expand</a></span>

Their work on the &quot;Walking Dead&quot; was a refreshing surprise.  I&apos;m not a fan of that franchise, I don&apos;t like quicktime-based gameplay,  and I snickered upon seeing the bad graphics, HOWEVER the writing was fantastic!  It had excellent narrative pacing, realistically intelligent characters (which you could truly care about), and it made you sweat every tiny decision because each had a consequence, be it subtle or dire.  Yes, &quot;Walking Dead&quot; was like playing a movie  a very good movie with superb story-driven interactivity, which made up for what it lacked in the gameplay and graphics department.
<br>
<br>Now, about &quot;Jurassic Park: The Game&quot;... oh dear.  The graphics and animations are just as crappy as &quot;Walking Dead.&quot;  Many quicktime events are ridiculously menial, and are more about basic motor functions than about exploring and investigating (the worst sequences seriously reminded me of QWOP).  The characters&apos; motives, actions and reasonings often defy logic and/or are downright obnoxious  so instead of rooting for them, it&apos;s a relief if they fall unconscious or die.  Your in-game decisions don&apos;t really matter, and you&apos;ll still do the same thing (or something even dumber) regardless.   Basically, this has all the depth and intrigue of &quot;Barbie Horse Adventure&quot;... just with more quicktime events, boredom, plot holes, and dinosaurs.
<br>
<br>To sum it up, don&apos;t waste your time or money on this poor excuse for a game.  The ONLY thing they did well were the dinosaur models and dinosaur animations  nothing else.  If you&apos;re still morbidly curious, just watch a Let&apos;s Play of somewhere in the middle of the game  since the first act is sort of okay, but it goes downhill rapidly from there.
<br>
<br>...Tetris has a better plot:  everything fits together without defying logic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3084459">Expand</a></span>

The graphics aren&apos;t show stopping, but they are clean, clear and effective which is exactly what you want. The problem is in the gameplay. Telltale have dropped their usual Point and Click / Third Person hybrid gameplay in favour of the Interactive Movie type gameplay we saw in Heavy Rain. How much you enjoy Jurassic Park will depend very much on how much you like that kind of interaction. Personally, I found it limiting. Too often you feel as though you aren&apos;t really in the game, merely offering limited input when things get rough. It&apos;s not awful, certainly, but it feels more like the sort of Mid-90s Multimedia CD-ROM Merchandise rather than a modern Triple-A video game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=4326944">Expand</a></span>

Remember those interactive FMV movie games from yesteryear? Stuff like Dragon&apos;s Lair, Silent Steel, or Rebel Assault? Oh, that&apos;s right, we all willingly forgot about that crap.<br><br>What we have here is a dramatic departure for TellTale games. Instead of a fun, scary, rewarding adventure game, we have a B-Movie that looks like a 10-year-old videogame and which occasionally requires you to hit buttons on your keyboard. I see what they were going for - they wanted this to be Heavy Rain with Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, they have no idea what made Heavy Rain engaging. For starters, professional quality storytelling, branching storylines (based on your actions or inactions), and legitimate problem solving and decision making.<br><br>Instead, Jurassic Park plays out as a poorly written, cheaply designed cartoon with Dance-Dance-Revolution layered on top to in an attempt to give you the illusion of participation. It&apos;s neither fun nor engaging. In fact it&apos;s outright boring. If the story had been great, some of this may have been forgivable (to the tune of 2/10 instead of 0) - but the characters are ridiculous, unbelievable, and unlikable, the prevalence of some strange new hallucinogenic dinosaur is awkward, and everything about the game feels tedious.<br><br>Games are fun and interactive, Jurassic Park does not qualify as a game. Next time I have a choice between playing Jurassic Park and doing dishes, I&apos;m going to make sure those dishes sparkle.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=1975016">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are pretty ugly in portions, with jagged, pixelated messes in various scenes. The gameplay is entirely made up of quicktime events which are extremely awkward to do with a mouse and keyboard. You&apos;ll find yourself, at best, repeatedly pressing Up Down over and over to do even the most simple of tasks.<br>The plot is pretty weak and the characters are all shallow archetypes. Cut-throat merc that is totally not Michelle Rodriguez, her cowardly evil boss, Not Alan Grant as the dad, and his annoying, too dumb to live daughter who is totally not a mix between the two kids in the first JP.<br>The most enjoyment you&apos;ll get out of this is failing (the death scenes can be hilarious) and spotting the countless JP references.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=1944126">Expand</a></span>

Previous titles of Telltale were epitomes of the adventure genre and, despite how I would prefer they ditch episodes in favour of full games, I have enjoyed their releases very much so far. Jurassic Park is almost nothing like an adventure game, but rather more a continuous Quick Time Event (QTE) game in the same stretch as old-timer Dragon&apos;s Lair. Most of the game consists of you having to press the WASD-keys in indicated order or repeatedly pressing them to fulfill some action. Failure in doing so can result in your character dying and a death toll being increased. Long standing adventure series players might remember that the Lucasfilm/Lucasarts adventures stopped with deaths in adventures when the Monkey Island series started. In that way it&apos;s a step back, especially as your performance gets graded in each section. The game&apos;s video settings forces you to wait through each resolution mode change before you can move on to the next. If you have a big resolution monitor, be prepared to wait for a few minutes before you finally arrive at your desired resolution. The game&apos;s graphics/art might have worked for the more cartoony/comical games they previously released, but for Jurassic Park is seems to fall short a bit, yet the game &quot;feels&quot; very heavy. And then there&apos;s the multitude of graphical and game glitches that constantly jar and interrupt the storytelling. It&apos;s even more annoying when you are in a static scene and can scroll the viewpane around, only to wonder why your movement is forced to some specific part, in a misguided attempt to help the player find a clue or the next step to text. I am really surprised things like these were not even picked up during Q&amp;A. A serious letdown in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=1945143">Expand</a></span>

The title, Jurassic Park: the game is a lie. I felt that deep, dark feeling of being ripped off even after paying half price. It did teach me to always check youtube for game-play trailers before making a purchase. Thank you Telltale games, for a title with so much potential that turned into disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2072812">Expand</a></span>

Let me start out by saying that The Jurassic Park: The Game is a GREAT game. It&apos;s actually one of the best games that I have played in recent years.
<br>
<br>I had been putting off buying this game because of the negative press that Telltale was getting (i.e., the &quot;Jeep&quot; incident and the metacritic allegation), but finally made the purchase on Steam along with Batman: Arkham City at 50% discount. Guess which one of these games I found myself coming back to again and again? Yes, I enjoyed playing JPTG even more so than Arkham City, which I felt was basically a rehash of the excellent first game.
<br>
<br>Now to the game itself. First off, to me this game is the epitome of cinematic storytelling done right in a video game. I can&apos;t say enough about how immersive the gaming experience was. I haven&apos;t played Heavy Rain or Uncharted series since I don&apos;t own a PS3 (although I did play Fahrenheit), so I can&apos;t compare the game to those established franchises known for superb storytelling, but as far as I am concerned, the plot, cinematography, music, and dialogue were all excellent. This was no doubt possible only through JPTG&apos;s heavy reliance on the &quot;quicktime&quot; game play, which I understand has a lot of detractors. However, after playing through the game, I think this type of gameplay was the best (and possibly only) way to tell this story effectively since the JP franchise is so synonymous with thrills and actions. I admit that some of these action sequences were quite challenging and I died a whole lot. But even some of the death sequences (i.e., getting eaten by dinos) were satisfying to watch. The interface also allows &quot;narrating&quot; the story from different perspectives at the same time, which was quite interesting and ingenious in my opinion. Some adventure purists may feel that the inability to move the characters directly restricting, but I personally didn&apos;t mind this at all. I played JPTG with my XBox 360 controller and I do highly recommend playing with one. I&apos;d imagine doing those quick time sequences with a mouse/keyboard would be significantly less enjoyable somehow.
<br>
<br>The puzzles are extremely well designed. They are logical and realistic, and are seamlessly integrated into the plot. As such, the puzzles don&apos;t require cartoonish logic (No &quot;apply molasses to cat hair to make a fake mustache&quot; type of nonsensical puzzles) and often objects that behave realistically like their real-life counterparts.
<br>
<br>One of JPTG&apos;s strongest suits is its dialogue. The game overall is very well scripted. Although you won&apos;t mistake it for a Sorkin flick, the quality of writing is far better than some of the drabs you find in today&apos;s Hollywood blockbusters.  The characters are both varied and interesting. Each character has a back story, which gets developed slowly  throughout the game, and plays an important role to advance the overall plot. The story is face-paced and thrilling at some points and emotional and thought-provoking at others. The scientific tidbits that are introduced throughout the game are both interesting and consistent with the JP lore. One interesting thing that Telltale attempts to do in JPTG is to correct some of the scientific inaccuracies that were introduced in the original movie by explaining that the frog DNAs that were spliced into the dinos by Dr. Wu had introduced these &quot;anomalies&quot; in JP&apos;s dinosaurs.
<br>
<br>Now for the bad parts, which aren&apos;t that many. The most obvious one is its graphics, which is the biggest gripe that I have had with virtually all of Telltales&apos; titles. It&apos;s definitely not top-of-the-line. But, then again, it is certainly &quot;serviceable.&quot; The animation is quite fantastic in many areas actually. I don&apos;t know if they used motion-capturing technology, but the animations in a lot of the action sequences are top notch and the facial expressions are certainly good enough to covey the emotional depths. But the character models themselves lack the details and look &quot;plasticky&quot; under certain lighting conditions. The jungle, which is pretty much everywhere in this game, looks quite cheap if you look closely. The swaying grass and bushes are simply 2D textures moving side to side. That said, this is certainly the most graphically advanced game that Telltale has created so far. (I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s supposed to be a commendation or an indictment, but hey.) For those of you who are fans of adventure games, scientific fictions, or just dinosaurs in general, I highly recommend this game. For the Jurassic Park aficionados, JPTG is truly a worthy (and might I say &quot;essential&quot;) addition to the beloved but aging franchise that is in sore need of its own &quot;resurrecting.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2072477">Expand</a></span>

I got this terrible game for reupping my PS+ but if i had paid i&apos;d probably be seeking a refund. The &quot;gameplay&quot; is a joke. Imagine if heavy rain ended the game after every mistake rather than change the story to fit what occurred. Now imagine if Heavy Rain gave you no control whatsoever, you simply did quick time events to progress everything, with basically no choices throughout the entire game. Now imagine if Heavy Rains framerate was so bad that you could easily miss a QTE happening (in fact i had an entire scene where no button prompts even showed up, i simply had to restart.)<br><br>I&apos;m not just being rude, its really that bad. It makes a complete mockery of the book/film, the voice acting is horrid ( and seemed to have very little direction in the actors defense), the few throwbacks to JP humor are so poorly presented that you may think its some 4th wall breaking satire. Its not. Its a development house thats used the very last of its creative juices, and long ago at that.<br><br>The framerate isn&apos;t the only technical problem. The game hangs on the end of nearly every scene. I actually thought it had crashed a few times only for it to recover and chug along. I can&apos;t imagine it EVER reaches 30 fps. When restarting some checkpoints, a QTE will start and never show the button prompt, leaving you to guess while you burn through lives.<br><br>All in all this is an absolute embarrassment for TT, and they should be ashamed. This game would take another 6 months to polish, but the concept is so bad that it wouldn&apos;t have been worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=1943982">Expand</a></span>

Honestly, reviewing the game itself, ignoring my preconceptions, it wasn&apos;t that bad a game.  Yes, this is NOT the traditional adventure game with lots of difficult puzzles or even an inventory.  This is a game full of QTEs and some minor puzzles.  It feels like more of an experience than a game in many ways, and it kept me engaged the whole time because I knew that, at any moment, I&apos;d be forced to quickly respond to a QTE.  I felt the story was done justice, though I haven&apos;t read the book or watched the movie in a VERY long time (haven&apos;t read the book since before the first movie was ever released!), and if I wanted to watch the movie again I&apos;d do that instead of trying to play this game.  The game is a separate story arc, happening at the same time as the original book/movie.<br><br>My gripe with the game is that sometimes the QTEs are just plain not fair.  There is no indication to what you&apos;re going to have to be hitting in some cases, and you&apos;d just have to blindly guess and have a lot of luck to ever get them right on the first try.  For example, a left arrow with a single ring always means hit left once.  But a left arrow with a double ring SOMETIMES means hit left twice but other times means hit left followed by a different direction.  And this I would forgive if there was some tolerance for wrong keys in this system, but there are times where if you do not hit the right sequence within quarter second, you fail.  Telltale, if you ever do another game with QTEs, go look at Fahrenheit/Indigo Prophecy.  It&apos;s another adventure game relying HEAVILY on QTEs, but they never cheat the player.  I enjoyed the QTEs for the most part, but there were times I just got pissed off and stopped having fun because I wasn&apos;t even clued in to what was going to happen.<br><br>The other small problem I have had issues with is my mouse disappearing if I pause.  I don&apos;t even have to alt+tab out of the game, and my drivers are all up to date.  It&apos;s just a rather random glitch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2063213">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are sub par and the dialogue is cheesy and the quick time events can be infuriating. Its actually quite short as well, my first play through was completed in around 7 hours. So with all these things going against the game it should suck right? Well that depends on your personality and what you&apos;re hoping to gain from an experience like this.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not a typical modern game in that you are never given the opportunity to control any of the characters directly and the gameplay elements all play out like a cut scene with QTEs (Quick Time Events). Like most gamers I find QTEs to be a tired and frustrating element in gaming, so why is it that I found this game so playable? Sure it infuriated the hell out of me on numerous occasions and often on top of the general annoyance of QTEs the system is finickity as well. Sometimes you&apos;ll swear to god you hit the right keys but it&apos;ll stick reward you with a big fat cross and a surprisingly bloodless death scene considering the being torn apart by a dinosaur part. When you do succeed though it is mightily satisfying and often pulse pounding because of the thrilling action playing out on screen. I know, I know &quot;its not a proper game because theres no game play blah blah blah...&quot; but you know what, I really don&apos;t care. I had more fun playing this than I have done playing most triple A games recently with apparently awesome gameplay.
<br>
<br>Story and Characters:
<br>
<br>Now as I mentioned before, the characters are your typical &apos;tough guy&apos;, &apos;joker&apos;, &apos;tough girl&apos;, &apos;annoying teen&apos; etc. With this in mind though, this is a Jurassic Park game. Films like Jurassic Park thrive on character cliches and its not even that much of a bad thing sometimes. This is a real &apos;popcorn&apos; game much like the film its based on, the characters can get annoying and say some dumb things but at the same time you&apos;ll probably find yourself warming to them. Not because they&apos;re particularly well written in a lofty &apos;makes you think&apos; sort of way but in a good hollywood blockbuster sort of way.
<br>
<br>Overall:
<br>
<br>So after finishing the game I felt like I&apos;d had a really good time and really enjoyed the story for what it was, there&apos;s a bit of a surprising element to the plot which I found to be quite nice, it made the story more than just a total re-tread of the original film&apos;s plot. The game is not going to be for everyone because I can be a bit slow at times and there&apos;s very little challenge beyond the occasionally infuriating QTE&apos;s, the puzzles hold your hand all the way. However, in a way it doesn&apos;t really matter because you&apos;re always looking forward to seeing what happens next in the story.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t go into this expecting it to change your life or provide you with a deep gaming experience because you&apos;ll come out feeling disappointed. Go into it for what it is, a thrilling joy ride that doesn&apos;t require a lot of thought but has a story that&apos;s a lot of fun. Also, if you&apos;re a Jurassic Park fan then there&apos;s a lot of easter eggs to enjoy and the feel of the world is spot on. I&apos;d go as far as to say I&apos;d rather have seen this as a sequel to the first film or at least instead of Jurassic Park 3 (I do like that film btw, I&apos;m not hating).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3109332">Expand</a></span>

This game is a huge, huge let down. The game has practically nothing to do with the film other than finding the Barbasol can and discovering Dennis Nedrys corpse at the start of the game. The voice acting and dialogue in this game is atrocious and cheesy, the Characters are either boring, annoying or just don&apos;t belong in a Jurassic park game. Telltale missed so many great opportunities to make this a great game for Jurassic park fans to revist and explore key areas of the film.... What about discovering Robert Muldoons SPAS-12 shotgun and his hat that he removed just before his famous last words? Or revisting the Tyrannosaur paddock and finding the trashed tour cars and Gennaro? Discovering what happend to Ray Arnold in the maintenance shed? or evan finding a frozen raptor that was trapped in the freezer in the Kitchen scene? The great locations of the film are hardly seen, insted we vist ridiculous areas such as a rollercoaster in one of the most pointless and dumbest scenes in the whole game. For a game that considers itself to be faithful to the original film, it is a massive failure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=1941601">Expand</a></span>

I found it similar to Dragon Age Origins, with its amazing story line and characters that you get attached to. Do NOT expect a game where you control every aspect of it, but enjoy the characters and the story, get up on the edge of your seat, and prepare for a visual roller coaster.</span>

Its very cinematic, with good (IMO) animation and art, and a great way to translate a cinematic action/thriller movie to a game. A combination of  quick time events, puzzle solving, and story telling in a nice blend. It is very linear, which some may not like. Also, it has very stylized graphics, which others may be turned off by. This isn&apos;t a great game (few are), but it ist a very good one.  Not everyone will like it though. Its an interactive story telling experience, not quite a movie or a traditional game. If that sounds interesting, you might want to give it a try.<br><br>Long review:<br><br>The game is best described as an interactive story. The goal I think was to get you to &quot;experience&quot; a Jurassic Park adventure. Almost (but not quite) a long cut scene with Quick Time Events (push buttons in response to prompts). Usually the pacing works like this: a) Conversation with someone, using conversation wheel a la mass effect (or some other Tell Tale Games).<br>b) Puzzle solving bit. Usually nothing too hard.<br>c) Action sequence. Respond to various button pushes, controller movements, and simple minigames in response to prompts. Make a mistake and your &quot;score&quot; for the sequence goes down. Screw up at a really bad point and you get viciously killed. By itself, this would be glorified simon says, but in the context of the story and the animated reactions this is more exciting than it sounds. Generally, the pacing seems good between action, exposition, and  puzzle solving. Sometimes the puzzles seemed to take a little too long to me (not hard, just several steps to complete), given the nature of the game. I prefer the action or conversation bits. Sometimes these all can be mixed. Sometimes an action sequence has some pauses with puzzle bits too. I liked this approach. I think it is a very good way to translate the feel of the movie to a game. The movie had lots of scares from Dinosaurs jumping out at the characters, and the characters using quick thinking and resourcefulness to survive. I really don&apos;t know how else you&apos;d translate this. Typical action game controls wouldn&apos;t give the same feel. A traditional adventure game isn&apos;t very &quot;exciting&quot;. I think the QTE method gives the FEEL of the action parts of the movie.<br><br>That said, it does make it highly linear. There also isn&apos;t much in they way of alternative routes through the story (like Heavy Rain). If you fail badly enough, you die and restart the sequence. I think this is sensible given the nature of the story, which is one of survival. Not as complex as Heavy Rain. Graphics:<br><br>Fairly stylized, and a tad cartoony.  Realistic graphics would have been preferable. Hoever, actually doing something photo realistic would have required a much larger budget than I think can be poured into this old franchise, so going stylized is understandable, and I got used to it pretty quickly. The dinos themselves are fairly realistically modeled, if a little low poly count by today&apos;s standards. One thing that impressed me was how much animation was packed into this. Mostly all unique animations are used for each action sequence (I wasn&apos;t scrutinizing this much, they probably reused animations, but it was done so I didn&apos;t notice in my playthrough).  Story:<br>Again, only the first episode here, but I thought it was good. The characters are traditional tropes, but likable ones. I felt bad every time I got one of the killed anyway :-).  The story so far is one of survival, which is what I was expecting.  I&apos;m impressed at how seamlessly the whole thing has fit into the movie storyline so far.<br><br>Sound:<br>Good. Uses movie soundtrack.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>This was a labor of love. That is pretty obvious. Its too bad its not being well received, but that&apos;s understandable I guess. Many people don&apos;t like quick time events, and the cartoony graphics can be turn offs. Its important to go into this expecting what it is: an interactive cinematic movie experience. Neither movie nor traditional video game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2062976">Expand</a></span>

The point was to create an adventure that had the look, feel and atmosphere of the original Jurassic Park movie, and I&apos;d say that they succeeded. The gameplay, I understand, is a common point of criticism due to being made up of point-and-click exploration and quicktime events. But I think it works for a movie-game like this. If it&apos;s supposed to have the feel of a movie, it wouldn&apos;t be as authentic if you were able to control the characters directly.<br>Story is where Telltale is really in its element here, and that&apos;s really the primary selling point of the game. Every character is realistic and morally ambiguous, with ulterior motives that prevent them from being mere caricatures. The story mainly revolves around the characters&apos; attempt at survival, stranded on Isla Nublar, but there&apos;s also a little subplot about a &quot;secret&quot; dinosaur that was never put on display in the park due to reasons InGen would rather keep secret. The story takes great care to tie up all the movie&apos;s loose ends - it even explains why all the dinosaurs have anatomical inaccuracies.<br>Many of the game&apos;s detractors say that the story is linear and that no choice that you make affects future events in the long run, but that isn&apos;t completely true. There are multiple endings that you can choose from, and there&apos;s even one where only one character survives. And besides, you don&apos;t choose how the events in movies play out, do you?<br>The average graphics are pretty forgivable - Telltale is a very small-scale, low-budget studio, so you can&apos;t especially blame them. The music is taken directly from John Williams&apos;s original score and all the original dinosaur sounds are reused here, so no complaints there.<br>In the end, this will only really appeal to the casual demographic due to the interactive-movie gameplay and the unimpressive graphics. But if you love the original Jurassic Park movie, I think you&apos;ll find something to enjoy in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2075398">Expand</a></span>

While the graphics are a huge improvement from their past titles they seems to be a huge discrepancy between graphics and gameplay here. The gameplay, to put it simply, it just laughably bad.<br><br>Don&apos;t waste your time on this game.</span>

I really liked this game. It certainly had issues, but I enjoyed it. Let&apos;s break it down into the various aspects of the game.<br><br>1.Story<br><br>I loved the story in the game. It was my favorite part, and what kept me playing the game until I beat it. I wanted to see what would happen, I wanted to see how things worked, and I wanted to see how things ended, when all was said and done.<br><br>This was my favorite part of the game, and what kept me going after dying ten times during a level (discussed in the Gameplay part of my review). I don&apos;t wish to discuss many details, because it would spoil the game, and I&apos;m sure there&apos;s plenty of resources out there to get the game spoiled if you want to know everything about it.<br><br>The only real downside is that I found myself getting too sucked into the story...and when the time came to actually play the game, I&apos;d find myself floundering or missing those first few Quick Time buttons at the beginning, being thrown into it with little warning at times.<br><br>2.Gameplay<br><br>The gameplay...needed work.<br><br>While there is a brief tutorial at the beginning, the gameplay needs to be figured out some, which is annoying. I want to know how to play the game properly.<br><br>Additionally, I&apos;m forced to either use the WASD keys or a controller. I&apos;d like to be able to either customize them, or use the arrow keys on the keyboard instead. But no go there.<br><br>Many times I feel like I&apos;m given no time to react to what I need to do. By the time I see what I need to press, it&apos;s already too late. Thankfully, the game does realize when you&apos;re sucking, and will make it easier, by having less you need to press in a row.<br><br>Perhaps this is an issue with my frame rate, or something to do with me, but I&apos;ve never had any issues like that with other games.<br><br>It is, however, a neat idea, and I like how you&apos;ll see how you&apos;ve screwed up when you do, such as getting killed, or just stumbling. But when more often then not that I end up dying or stumbling then doing it right, and that&apos;s just frustrating to someone who has been playing video games for most of his life.<br><br>When not doing these Quick Time events, the game gives a bit of a Phoenix Wright feel. You can to investigate the area and figure out what to do, what to say, and where to look in order to continue. While this can be annoying figuring out what the sequence of events you need to do, it&apos;s not especially difficult.<br><br>Finally, the Quick Time events can happen suddenly without warning, as stated in the Story part of my review. It would have been nice to be given a little warning, but that may just be a personal issue with me.<br><br>3.Characters<br><br>I liked the characters. I liked how a very minor character from the movie got a chance to shine, and the new characters were fun as well. I truly believed these were real people, and I loved their different motivations for surviving or any ulterior motives they had.<br><br>I wanted to know about these characters, I wanted to see how they&apos;d live or die on the island, and it was interesting to see the motivations change or reveal themselves throughout the story. The characters grew, and in a believable way.<br><br>I certainly hope to see these characters again, sometime in the future.<br><br>4.Graphics<br><br>The graphics were good. They weren&apos;t mind blowing, but they were good. The characters conveyed emotion, and I was never pulled away from the world by a character or dinosaur moving weirdly.<br><br>Considering this game seems more like an interactive movie then a game, I would say the graphics are good for a movie. If it was a movie, I would hope they&apos;d be more polished, but for a game like this, it&apos;s good.<br><br>5.Miscellaneous<br><br>Many times my mouse cursor would simply disappear, and the only way to get it back was to exit the game and start it up again. This was very annoying.<br><br>The length of the game...was pretty short. It took me eight hours to play through the game, and while there is replay value, I can&apos;t see this game being worth more then maybe 20 or so hours worth of play time. Considering the game costs about 30 dollars, the price is a little steep for a short game like this.<br><br><br><br>Overall, I have to say the game was good story wise, but needs more work on the &apos;game&apos; part.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=1951522">Expand</a></span>

The music is fantastic, and felt just right for the Jurassic Park franchise. While I&apos;m reviewing the PC version of the game, I can only recommend that you plug in a good Xbox 360 controller and play it with that, as I found the experience with the controller to be more fitting this particular adventure sub-genre.<br><br>The dinosaurs were all utilized well, and the battle and escape sequences were exhilarating. Everything from fending off a pack of dilophosaurs to killing a lone raptor or trying your best to avoid a &quot;battle of the beasts&quot; between the park&apos;s T-Rex and a triceratops. It really got the adrenaline pumping.<br><br>I knew that this game was going to be Heavy Rain-esque from the start, and I&apos;m glad I took a chance and sunk my big dino teeth into it. I now feel much more inclined to give Heavy Rain an honest chance, because Jurassic Park was without a doubt a great game. Don&apos;t let any amount of abuse of the Metacritic User Reviews (be it from Telltale employees or the herds of minimum score spammers) convince you otherwise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=1959759">Expand</a></span>

But there is a bit of puzzles involved has well. The story is amazing, running parallel to the first movie (which I believe to be the superior one) and concludes the story involving Nedry&apos;s can. (This has actually always bothered me that they gave it such a huge &quot;final&quot; scene in the movie, but never followed up with it.)
<br>
<br>Yes, the graphics aren&apos;t 100% next generation, but they are done well enough that you feel immersed the whole time, so can&apos;t argue. Besides, the story and the gameplay is what you are buying. All in all, great game, enough to pull me off of Skyrim for a while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=1939011">Expand</a></span>

A game that has brought me much joy for about 10 hours I think.
<br>Some people mention that the graphics are poor, well I have to disagree. Ofcourse the graphics aren&apos;t top notch, but they still make the dino&apos;s and jungle realistic and impressive. I would say graphics are about an 7,5 Sound is superb, just like the movie. The soundtrack and the dino sounds are bone chilling. The voice acting is what is should be: believable and not stereotypical ( you know like in most shooters they have a super bad ass sounding macho man ugh) Sound is a solid 8,5 I think maybe even a 9
<br>
<br>This game is NOT however a DINO SHOOTER. I think many gamers were disappointed by that. I have thought about it, but giving guns to the lead  characters would have destroyed much of the tension and fear you experience as a player. It would then have been another shooter, but with dino&apos;s. The thing many people didn&apos;t like was the lack of gameplay freedom: you can&apos;t walk around with keyboard and mouse like in gta 4 or games like fallout, far cry, or whatever.
<br>It bugged me a bit in the beginning, though I was aware of it because I read some reviews on here. I thought about it, and have come to the conclusion that this gameplay is the only way to make a game with dino&apos;s and WITHOUT guns possible. When the lead characters can&apos;t defend themselves, they can only run and hide. So either you make hundreds of points where people can hide: let&apos;s say narrow caves, or climb trees or whatever. Or you make the game scripted, which Telltale have chosen to do. I personaly feel scripted works out for this game, though I would have liked the &apos;hide and climb tree&apos; way too.
<br>
<br>The game feels like an interactive movie, like a 10 hour movie of jurassic park, and that is what I loved about it. You still have dialogue options, though you can ask them all or just press the one that continues the story. It is not like in role playing games where your actions significantly change the story. Am not sure whether some conversation options changed something, will have to play it again to see that. Which I will probably do, just not now, I wan&apos;t to savour the second play through, so maybe in a year or so.
<br>
<br>So the thing is that the game isn&apos;t as active as most shooters, mainly because it isn&apos;t a shooter: it is a psychological horror story with dino&apos;s which captures the spirit of Jurassic Park the movie part 1. The other Jurassic park movies were garbage and luckily the game doesn&apos;t emulate those.  I bought it for 15 euros about 20 dollar which I think is a fair price for this game. If you liked the movie you will like this. Unless ofcourse you are a hardcore shooter fan, than this game is not for you. My final verdict, an 8, or maybe 8-</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2079235">Expand</a></span>

If your looking for a interactive jurassic park story (like i was)... then buy it, from what i have seen its not that heavy on the pocket anyways.

Same graphics &amp; sound as the previous Back to the Future games so if you liked the style of them you will like the style of this. Obviously not gonna win any awards but that&apos;s not their goal. 10/10 for pure enjoyment. Makes a change that you can die in a Telltale game too.</span>

<br>Jurassic Park has a good idea, telling the story behind the story. The story and characters are kinda clich&#xC3;&#xA9; and cheasy but I like it like that it works fine. The action is what got me, the tension when you have dinosaurs behind trying to kill you is like the movie. You really feel like playing a part of the first Jurassic Park movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2120315">Expand</a></span>

Maybe they were expecting Turok with more adventure and puzzle solving.. maybe they were expecting a Telltale Games adventure, even though Telltale clearly said that this game is different and explained the differences. I don&apos;t know.. after I played &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, I wanted more of the same while I waited for the remaining episodes and this game fits that bill nicely. Yes, there&apos;s a lot of QTEs.. but then so does &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; and that gets a lot of high marks reviews. I think the poor reviews of Jurassic Park are based on people&apos;s expectations and not the game itself. Is it a perfect 10 out of 10 game? No.. but it&apos;s certainly not terrible as many would have you believe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2507424">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Knowing that Telltale games only makes one style of game, I had already expected it to play more like an interactive movie than any other game genre.  Gamers of the arcade generation might remember Dragon&apos;s Lair which is pretty much the father of this type of game.  I loved Dragon&apos;s Lair.
<br>
<br>There are 2, seemingly balanced gametypes in Jurassic Park: The Game
<br>One type is an action sequence where one must hit buttons or hold buttons when prompted in order to avoid dying.  The thing I love most about these sequences is that if you miss the buttons or hit the wrong ones, you get to see some of the most brutal dino kills ever imagined, along with a fair amount of reaction shots from other characters.  Really, guys.. People crushed, bent it half, bitten, shredded, chewed-on, dragged away, and that&apos;s just the tip of the iceberg.  Death is rarely censored and I think you can even see shadows most of the time if the camera pans away from the CG characters.
<br>
<br>The other gametype is more investigative.  Telltale does a lot of this and very well (i.e.: Back to the Future, The Walking Dead)  You play as pretty much every character in the game to try to figure out how to get in and out of locked rooms, sticky situations, etc. but there isn&apos;t much off a challenge.  Instead of conrolling any characters, you swap between &quot;scenes&quot; and then sort of pan around and hit the buttons that fade in when something interests the character.  There&apos;s also a speech menu that lets you talk to other characters or call to them to maybe throw a switch or check for dinos.  It&apos;s not as fun as being able to walk a 3rd person character around with the thumbstick, but it&apos;s much more artistic and since the game feels like a movie, that&apos;s pretty cool.  I give it an A for effort but it kinda blows compared to the way you control characters in other Telltale games.
<br>
<br>The game is long enough for what it is.  Don&apos;t pay much money for it.  Buy it on sale on steam or rip it from a friend or something.  Each episode is written by different people and you can really tell if you play the game start-to-finish in a few days time (or one sitting for that matter).  Some of the character&apos;s personalities are different in some episodes than they are in others.  The result is you picking choices in favor of a character you like but then hating yourself for it when they turn out to be a dick later.  This may have been their intention but something&apos;s off.  I might not be describing it right but I&apos;m pretty sure it would&apos;ve felt right if one person or team of people wrote the entire game and didn&apos;t have the responsibility separated into full episodes (of which there are 4)
<br>
<br>I was pleased to hear and recognize the voice of Jason Marsden (voiced the dragon in Miyazaki&apos;s Spirited Away, and was on pretty much every teen sitcom in the 90&apos;s) but I hate his character.  The rest of the voice acting is either stinted or really clich&#xE9; and it many times cheapens the story.  I&apos;m sure that&apos;s the director&apos;s fault.
<br>
<br>Episode 1 is the best one because it starts you off linking you with the 1st JP movie.  You get to investigate where Newman from Seinfeld got ate by the spitter.  I knew from the movie exactly where to find the shaving cream can the whole time but i had to get my dumb character to figure it out for herself before i could dig for it.  The homage is fantastic.
<br>
<br>Music and sound is great.  Love the dino sfx.  The t-rex roar is on point!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jurassic-park-the-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3231042">Expand</a></span>
