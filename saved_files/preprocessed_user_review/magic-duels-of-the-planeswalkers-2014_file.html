I understand that a good amount of the game revenue will be generated through the dlc&apos;s.  I have no problem with that.
<br>However, the interface was made poorly.  They made it look better, but function slower, and generally harder to navigate.  It&apos;s very easy to play the wrong thing, or select the wrong card (they slightly shade the one you are selecting, and there is a delay so you can mess it up easily).   I play the PC version with an xbox controller.  You get to see an awesome example of poor programming this way.  If your mouse moves at all, your controller stops working.  You can keep playing with the mouse, but that should not occur when the game is set up correctly.
<br>The game itself is tedious, and far less entertaining then the previous.  The encounters are set up to be extremely repetitive and unimaginative.  I get that the matches are meant to have patterns, but with as few matches as there are in the game, those very limited patterns get boring quickly.  The puzzles are a joke as well.  I know the last one had pretty difficult puzzles, but these are just too easy.  They involve such difficulties as &quot;play something from your hand&quot;, or &quot;attack with a creature that can get through&quot;.
<br>They give you a very limited selection on your decks, which again, I understand as they make money off the expansions.  However these decks are very close to the last duels, so again they are pretty boring.  I find it frustrating to play against a deck I unlocked completely, and see the computer pull out cards that deck doesn&apos;t have.
<br>Overall, I see where they are going with this, but the execution was poorly wrought and the game had the biggest fault I can give a game  it was not fun.  I hope they address the issues in upcoming patches and dlc&apos;s or release a better game in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3281182">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>However this is still a good magic game, and it is an excellent product as an introduction to the game for beginners or the curious. If you are a veteran magic player you may wish to avoid it. But if you are an outsider who wants to see how this famous game functions this is a good place to start. And of course the way around the high price of DLC is PATIENCE. Wait for the inevitable Steam sale.
<br>
<br>9/10 as a great demo for magic.

You can play a number of pre-made decks against computer or human opponents, which unlocks more cards that use can use to tweak the decks.
<br>
<br>The big improvements to this version are the music, which is pretty good now, and the story, which reveals something about the greater MtG storyline for a change. The graphics are nice as always, and the control is decent as always. The new decks are fun to play with, but most of them are very similar to decks in Duels 2013. New encounters make the single player campaign more interesting. Sadly, the challenges are much easier this time.
<br>
<br>A new addition this year is Sealed Deck mode. There&apos;s a huge caveat that they don&apos;t tell you, and it was almost a dealbreaker for me: you can only play Sealed twice. I mean, you can use your deck from Sealed as much as you want, but you only get two pools to make decks from. The rest will cost you $2 a piece. Unfortunately, I was done with Sealed very quickly, and it didn&apos;t add much to the game for me. At least it&apos;s better than Magic Online?
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re going to buy a Magic: the Gathering game, Magic 2014 is the bet one so far, and it still had tons of content for the $10 price. It&apos;s definitely worth getting, but don&apos;t buy any DLC for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3260901">Expand</a></span>

Sadly, this is just another marketing ploy, a shallow attempt at introducing casuals to the limited Sealed Deck format. You open up boosters composed of cards available in DotP 2014, resulting in terrible mish-mashed decks (with still no non-basic lands available!) that you have to use against mono-colored decks. If you &quot;unwrap&quot; a terrible set of boosters, there is no reset button; after the initial two decks you can make you have to buy additional slots at $1.99 each. This game also features the worst decks in the series: STILL no non-basic lands and a terrible core set (m14 is incredibly bland with casualified slivers).

<br>Once again locking you out of all but two decks at the start (Chandra &amp; Garruk&apos;s again), DotP 2014 is a terrible introduction to MTG for new and casual players. Featuring the worst decks, the worst UI, easiest challenges, an awful campaign comprised of static decks (enemies pull the same cards no matter what, making the campaign little more than long challenges), and the worst game modes, 2014 is the worst DotP game since the original and not worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3441224">Expand</a></span>

New thing is Sealed Campaign.  I might be the only person who liked this mode because for the first time (except Micro-prose&apos;s Shandalar) it gave me some room for experimentation. I never got bad booster out of it. I think it is an essence of limited that You construct playable decks from mediocre cards. I made few competitive decks out of this and I&apos;m pretty satisfied. Sealed campaign is pretty short but it is only testing device before You go MP.... if You are lucky. Luck is absolutely the most important factor when You struggle to join the game. If You played MP in Magic 2013 I can say only one thing. It&apos;s worse. Connection problems, hang-ups, and complete helplessness make this part of game a complete disgrace. I hope it will change but for the moment it is the biggest problem. I know it costs only 10$ but Magic 2010 was way better with MP than current version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3257272">Expand</a></span>

Drafting and Sealed were 2 of my favorite types back when I played MTG, so when I heard this would have sealed, I immediately pre-ordered
<br>
<br>At first I was fairly unhappy with what I considered false advertising with &quot;unlimited sealed&quot; play. The way it works is: you open 6 booster packs and they give you unlimited basic land for you to make your sealed deck. Finishing the Sealed Campaign nets you another 3 sealed decks. From then on, that is your sealed deck, and you can play &quot;unlimited&quot; amounts of games with that deck.
<br>
<br>YOU DO NOT OPEN UP CARDS TO MAKE A DECK EACH NEW TIME YOU START A SEALED GAME.
<br>
<br>You do get 2 &quot;Sealed&quot; sets with the game (2 x 6 packs  2 x 9 packs when you beat the campaign twice). You cannot mix the cards between your sealed sets to create 1 ultimate pool of cards.
<br>
<br>Now then, I am actually finding this game very enjoyable.
<br>- I&apos;ve probably played 20 hours online against other opponent&apos;s against their sealed decks, and it has brought me several very close and enjoyable games. Everyone I&apos;ve played against has also been very nice and polite.
<br>- I did experience the game crashing twice when trying to invite my RL friends to play against them online, but it wasn&apos;t too bad, and we did get several games in after a reboot.
<br>- There is an option to buy more sealed slots beyond then 2nd for $2 each, or 5 for $9, and I ended up buying 7 extra slots simply because I&apos;m having fun online and want to try making different decks

<br>- Now this year&apos;s preconstructed theme decks for the normal campaign are MUCH MUCH better and a lot more fun than 2013&apos;s (with the one exception of the monogreen starting deck). I definitely enjoyed going through the campaign more than the previous year&apos;s
<br>
<br>- Unfortunately, all the puzzle &quot;challenges&quot; this year are way too easy.
<br>- They&apos;ve also removed the &quot;Planes Chase&quot; mode to FFA. Now it&apos;s just regular FFA.
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;ve spent about $21 on the game, and I&apos;ve had 30 hours of game play, and I expect around 50-60 hrs until I start to get bored.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3259415">Expand</a></span>

The only new thing that came this year is draft play called sealed campaign. Other mods includes include classic campaign through planes, two-headed giant and custom game. If you compare this with MtG: DotP 2013, you find missing planechase mode. In the multiplayer there is high number cheating players thanks to open deck creation that came thanks to sealed campaign.
<br>
<br>In short MtG DotP 2014 brings on plus side this years card editions, draft play and deck building and is better optimized for mouse and keyboard.
<br>On cons side it&#xB4;s missing planechase mode, has some unwelcome UI changes, and there is cheating in multiplayer.
<br>If that&#xB4;s enough for you to buy the game is up to you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3390874">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s just sad to see MtG utterly ruined in such an awesome, flashy piece of coding that really could have excelled, but it&apos;s only for promoting one new line. The only way to truly excel at the deck puzzles is to actually pay for the decks. I&apos;m sadly not joking. They allow you to pay for virtual cards that have no bearing on anything other than &quot;I can finally beat this one guy&quot; and they expect you to shell out the cash, especially if you want to beat everyone for the shiny achievements.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s just a re-skinned, re-worked, re-marketed clone of everything that is wrong with MMOs, and it&apos;s not even an MMO. I&apos;d rather buy the actual physical cards. At least then I can play with those with more than one person and not something that is obviously rigged from the start.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3855469">Expand</a></span>

The advertized &quot;deck customization via booster packs you unlock ingame&quot; is absolutely disappointing and lackluster,you essentially get 2 chances of 6booster packs each (which can&apos;t be exchanged,you just unlock the random cards you get in those 6 packs on one of the 2 free &quot;sealed deck campaign slots&quot;,which you cannot delete or &quot;try again&quot;,you would have to buy more slots to get more chances) and if you happen to not get decent synergy cards or just cards that wont work well versus the first enemies you&apos;re forced to fight against in a set order, you&apos;re screwed or at least won&apos;t have a good time at all. Your only way of unlocking new booster packs is by defeating every second planewalker in your &quot;path&quot;,which you cannot change,it is randomly set for you,with a chance of certain planewalkers not appearing or others appearing multiple times. Again,you cannot choose who to fight in which order. The game makes the decision for you. If you cannot get past one of these planewalkers (which have a fully unlocked mono deck each from the very start with beefy cards and good synergies) you will not progress and you will not get any more booster packs until the luck is on your side in a match. What sealed deck mode essentially boils down to is: If you&apos;re lucky on your first 6 boosters and you get enough creatures and synergy to make it work against the randomly chosen enemies with fully unlocked decks and strategies, you might get to a point where you can actually make a deck to your liking or develop a strategy that *you* chose,not that the game or rng chose for you.
<br>Still sounds acceptable to you? Here comes another bombshell.
<br>The screenshots and steam description of the game made it look like you could unlock booster packs by defeating certain enemies,which is only true *FOR THE FIRST TIME* you defeat that enemy. What.the.hell!
<br>Now,this *would* have worked if they just added a way to actually unlock booster packs by winning versus a certain enemy several times (and getting a booster pack each time you defeat an enemy) ,or hell,if they even allowed you to pick your enemies so you&apos;re not stuck on the same planewalker you cannot defeat because of the random card distribution. But no. You will only unlock a new booster pack if you defeat a certain planewalker for the first time. If you happen to not get any cards that compliment your existing limited number of cards you got from your first 6packs...you guessed it. You&apos;re screwed or won&apos;t have a fun time until you painfully unlock the next booster pack if you can manage to defeat 2 more planewalkers with fully unlocked decks. You can repeat battles versus planewalkers you defeated...but it doesn&apos;t give you anything. nada. And after defeating the first enemy on my path I was already at 17% completion. so if the system of unlocking ONE(!) booster pack every 2 enemies continues to be existant, you will unlock a whooping 3 booster packs in your sealed deck &quot;campaign&quot;. 3.packs. 9packs in total. there is no way you would get enough cards to actually build and customize a deck to your liking/personal strategy. The game makes that choice for you,so pray to the rng-gods that you get enough creatures and cards to make a deck you somewhat like,to then fight against the same 6 enemies the game chooses for you over and over for nothing.
<br>This is ridiculous. Sealed deck mode sounded like it could have potential to finally bring deck customization and the fun of unlocking booster packs to the Magic Videogame series. Unfortunately,it seems it was just a way of tricking people into thinking the game finally has proper deckbuilding yet again. Sealed deck mode is essentially &quot;fight 6 planewalkers,which the game chooses for you, in a row with an improvised deck of a very limited number of total cards.&quot; It isn&apos;t a campaign. And it sure as hell isn&apos;t the deckbuilding via booster packs a lot of us have hoped for.
<br>
<br>A non-fanboy can&apos;t help but to feel ripped off. The normal campaign is the same as previous games. You have prebuilt mono decks you can &quot;choose&quot; from (usage of the word choice in this game is an overstatement) and you work your way through often predictable AI until you get bored and hope for the next game to finally have proper deck customization and personal strategy planning. They goofed it up again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3246134">Expand</a></span>

I want to play a casual game of Magic online once or twice a week, and I would not appreciate to be beaten by 12 year old kids who can afford to sink hundreds of hours into the game to unlock a gazillion booster packs and beat me 100% with their &#xFC;ber-decks. It is also ridiculous to ask for new boosters each time you beat an opponent in SP again. If you want a new deck for whatever reason, open a new slot, and get a new chance at your 9 booster packs, nobody forces you into microtransactions as was stupidly alleged here. Single player sealed deck is challenging but fun  I have not played magic for 20 years, but had no issues finishing single player campaign with a win rate of about 40%. It is challenging but fun, just ignore the whiners and go for it, you won&apos;t regret!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3255916">Expand</a></span>

That being said, I think this one is the best yet. It&apos;s nicely polished, the decks are interesting, the presentation has been improved,  and the introduction of sealed play is a welcome addition to the series. Unlike others I don&apos;t have ridiculously high expectations, I don&apos;t expect there to be a full deck editor and I was aware of the limitations of sealed play before I bought the game. Seriously people, it&apos;s a $10 game! When you compare what you get here with what you&apos;d get in physical Magic for $10 this game is an amazing deal. If you have enjoyed the other games in this series, or just want to give Magic a try in a casual way, you can&apos;t go wrong with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3247972">Expand</a></span>

<br>That said once you get into the game it works and the AI opponents are very challenging (as others have pointed out this is mainly due to the decks being completely unfair in sealed mode). Campaign mode is just as dull as dishwater as the opponent is completely non-random. Actual gameplay pace is frustratingly slow with no option to speed it up so in the end the game is just DULL.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3256101">Expand</a></span>

<br>A amazing game for 9$ This game compares to other titles priced at 29-59$  All the dlc,s are optional and only unlock the items you get for playing? Do people really buy a game unlocked and not play it? Unlocking the decks, and cards is the best part. There is a new game mode, that is separate from the game itself, and you have a option to buy extra deck slots.. This game is 9$ and is a better value then most games at 59$ price point. But that goes to show you  that trolls and morons  and fanbois, Still wright negative reviews that have no TRUTH.
<br>
<br>PS. I never thought I would be into Magic, but im hooked. It also teaches you the ropes well  for us beginners.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3262585">Expand</a></span>

It takes after the trading card game produced by Wizards of the Coast. Whether you are just learning how to play the game, or have already mastered it, this game tailors to your skill level. In this game, you are a planeswalker; traveling the multiverse and conquering other plansewalkers. Who you battle and defeat is up to you, it could be a computer for practice, a skilled live opponent or a rival friend. The goal of the game in campaign mode is to defeat all of the other computer controlled plansewalkers and scenarios. Whilst online, the ultimate goal is to beat the other player.
<br>
<br>Magic: the Gathering 2014 introduced a very interesting concept with this game as well, sealed deck mode. Sealed deck is where you start off with 6 booster packs. Inside each of these packs, is a random set of cards. You have to build your own deck, and compete against others to unlock more and more booster packs. The goal is to unlock all of them, and tailor your deck to perfection.
<br>
<br>The tutorials aren&#x2019;t boring and frustrating long either, it puts you right into a duel and teaches what you need to do to survive and flourish. After dueling some of my friends, I&#x2019;ve come to the conclusion that Magic: The Gathering 2014 has a very clean and well-presented interface; its simply beautiful.
<br>
<br>The graphics and audio were surprisingly good as well. The animation during combat damage, or when you zoomed in on a card was a pleasant surprise. The epic background music during duels helped orchestrate an immersive experience
<br>
<br>Synthesing, Magic: The Gathering 2014 is an awesome game. It is a great introduction into the wonderful world of trading card games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3322409">Expand</a></span>

Thats even after playing two of the previous planeswalker video games.</span>

I have been playing Magic since revised ed and is a huge fan, which adds to my huge disappointment to this poor excuse of an adaptation of what is the greatest game ever.
<br>You can download and play for free, but for very limited features. I paid to unlock the game but it&apos;s just not worth it. Like many reviewers have pointed out you can only play the sealed game 2 times; you&apos;d need to pay to &quot;unlock&quot; subsequent games. Unlike conventional sealed games, you do not get to &quot;keep&quot; the cards as the cards are solely for the very sealed game, which is useless after you completed that game.
<br>Oh and there is no customisable deck; you just get cards to add on to the pre-build decks. And these additional cards are just additional copies from the same deck. Imagine Magic where deck construction is non-existent... Wha?
<br>The interface can be frustrating occasionally, especially for cards that &quot;search card from library&quot;. It sometimes does not select the card you want. The drag to cast motion can sometime be hard to execute, for reasons unknown, and can ruin your game when trying to play instants in reaction. (Good luck with counter spells).
<br>The most annoying bug has got to be the constant crashes. (I have read this in some reviews but chose not to believe it was that bad, guess I deserved it). I must have attempted the raving prophet like 5 times, and it always crashes when I have the upper hand. Guess the app is a sore loser.
<br>I still love the original game, but just stay away from this horrendous app. It&apos;s not worth even downloading for free. If you must, do not spend any money on it. Don&apos;t let this ruin your opinion of MTG.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3768914">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s almost impossible to enjoy a casual game against the computer, as the CPU always has enough lands, gets a perfect draw every time, and whips through synergies faster than you can read them. Half the time the CPU had flyers, tokens and artifacts out before I could even summon a spider. To make matters worse, when a card is played in the center and you try to read it, half the time it&apos;s zoomed off to the graveyard, making you find it, reselect it and THEN you can read just how  you are. To make matters worse, it starts you off with this slow-ass green deck that takes forever to get going (if it gets going at all), followed by this clunky red deck with no card synergy whatesoever and very little direct damage. The best part is when you first log in, they ask you how much MTG you&apos;ve played; meaning if you&apos;re new to the game, you&apos;re completely baffled, and if you&apos;re experienced you&apos;ll be outraged.

<br>
<br>The only reason I don&apos;t give this game a strait zero is that the usual amount of polish is on display; the UI works more or less correctly 95% of the time, the sounds and visual effects have a charming appeal, and it &quot;feels&quot; like magic.  Still, the single player AI is a joke, the card unlocking is tedious and designed to get you to pay them to avoid it, the flaunted &quot;sealed deck game&quot; is just a cash grab, and it all plays like a commercial for magic the gathering.
<br>
<br>This game and it&apos;s developer are an absolute joke.  There is nothing here worth recommending unless you like giving money to greedy developers who have somehow managed to do less in the less three years that the Madden franchise..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3924573">Expand</a></span>

Obviously not from magic fans. Well Magic will always be best played in real life with a real deck etc. However this game fills the area of wanting to play from home. For what it is, and for the price, it does it perfectly. Mainly focusing on the multiplayer, getting a couple of friends together for a match of free for all or two headed giant is so much fun! Also hopping into the multiplayer on your own is a breeze because I find the community so friendly and mature (when not over free weekends etc), they chat to you through team chat and I have even made some friends over it. Magic is challenging; no doubt about it. Put the time in and you&apos;ll do well. People complain about &quot;OP&quot; decks, all you have to do is look on the forums and there is a thread for just about every deck saying it is OP. When in reality you can easily counter each deck. For a game that is only &#xA3;6 ($10 roughly) and only &#xA3;1.74 on sale, it is so worth it. Pick up a few copies on sale and play with friends!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=4267146">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The base decks and card selection are interesting enough, I felt the campaign was a little lacking compared to previous games but still enjoyable for the most part. I would definitely recommend getting this over the recent 2015 version of the game. Its better in just about every aspect. Unfortunately this will probably be the last enjoyable game in the series unless they make a serious effort to distance themselves from their current design philosophy. Originally the game was supposed to be a stepping stone for people to get into the magic universe and gaming community without shelling out tons of money on booster packs or decks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=4365813">Expand</a></span>

<br>The mechanics are OK, they do the job, but my biggest problem is the interface, at least on PC (can&apos;t speak for the tablet version). Like seriously, &quot;Let&apos;s play a cardgame on opposite sides of the room.&quot; Great, now the cards on the board are distant, indistinct, blurry non-entities. Oh, but there&apos;s a top-down view? Let&apos;s try that. &quot;Let&apos;s play a cardgame... From ORBIT!&quot; If this is on the iPad or whatever, these cards must be microscopic. There is SO much wasted space everywhere. It&apos;s absurd. Why don&apos;t the developers take a look at Hearthstone, which is frankly a superior experience in almost every single way in terms of interface and user-friendliness, and remake this game to be more like that, where you can actually see the cards you are using and read what they do, and see what your opponent has. Does it even show you the graveyards? I wasn&apos;t able to see that, although it was so far away I might be forgiven if I couldn&apos;t spot it.
<br>
<br>Wake up Stainless Games, you have a mediocre product that needs a serious overhaul. The idea is alright, even with the very limited level of customisation (Hearthstone is also superior when it comes to that, too... Did I mention that HS is also free to play? I&apos;ve not dropped a dime on it) it&apos;s just... Ugh. It leaves the sour taste of wasted potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magic-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=4384299">Expand</a></span>
