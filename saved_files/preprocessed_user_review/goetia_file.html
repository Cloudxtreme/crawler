<br>1. Information needed is often scattered to very distant parts of the game, or, it&#x2019;s unclear if the information needed is near or to a completely different zone. Sure, that could in theory be not a problem for some people but I believe recent history has proven games have advanced from complete disconnection to a more tidy fashion for collecting information and at least for most people parts of the game may prove frustrating.
<br>
<br>2. The inspected items that are almost completely irrelevant to the story do not disappear after examined once, or at least they are not shown with an altered color. Sure, like 1, that could be considered good, but mainly by elitists and a minority.
<br>
<br>3. Some puzzles seem almost nonsensical, though point 1 might be to blame since even if the information is available, it might be unclear where that is to be found in scope. In general, it seems to flood the gamer with more info than it should.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/goetia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6897008">Expand</a></span>
