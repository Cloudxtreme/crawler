The balance is much better - no more sitting in your base and building mass fabs for an hour! Map control becomes much more important because you need to control as many mass extractors as you can. Each faction has differences that definitely affect the way they&apos;re played. The campaign wasn&apos;t too bad, but this game is all about the multiplayer. The game is definitely more enjoyable with actual humans than with AIs. There is also less lag online, since your computer does not have to calculate all of the AIs. The game will take a bit of getting used to, but once you get into it, it&apos;s great. If your computer can run it, then you&apos;ll love it. (the recommended specs for the game are a bit low - you&apos;ll want to have a dual core and 2 gigs of RAM to run the game.) Also, if you have questions about the game, the official forums are a great place to come to. Just make sure you use grammar in your posts, or you won&apos;t be taken seriously.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-forged-alliance/user-reviews?user_review_id=415022">Expand</a></span>

There is no set BO you have to do and no you have to use this unit to counter this unit  You dont have to babysit factories as you can leave them on repeat forever. Completley the oposite of starcrat. It has a drain rate based economy where you have to spend resorces as you get them and as you build things. This game is about stratergy not APM.  There are no ends to the stratergies you can do. It is the most complex RTS ever produced.   4 years on I still see stratergies I have not seen before. This game is also cheap. &#xC2;&#xA3;5 from Amazon for gold edition that includes vanilla SC as well. AT release this game required a very decent computer to run but now most computers are able to run it with a few thousand units onscreen with no lad<br><br>As a beginner online you will be steamrolled online as the AI sucks hardand those turtling tactics dont work. This is not much of a problem however as you can get AI mods and play against people of your own rating. GPG net aint so good but you can use forged alliance forever that is a fanmade, fixes bugs and dont crash so buggy and slow GPG net is also a non issue. It still has a few hundred active players. I have to stress this game is not for people who are knew to RTS games. It is as I said the most complex RTS ever and when you lose if your commander is not sniped you get steamrolled. It has quite a steep learning curve. Once you get past this however an get to an average level online it becomes much more Fun. Dont be suprised if you lose your first ten games completley online. It will happen. I lost my first 7 games online and got steamrolled. But now I am in the top 50 players.<br><br>http://www.faforever.com/<br><br>The gameplay is also completley diferent from all other RTS games I have played. The units cost ranges from 8 mass to 300000. The unit cap is normaly 1000 units online not 100 like other RTS games. This makes games all the more epic and exiting as hudge armys face each other off.Completley unique. The maps are  raning from 25km2 to 6561 km2.  The time games last depends on maps. Games normaly last anywhere from 15 to 45 mins. There is up to 12 players in one match online with forged allaince forever.<br><br>A MUST HAVE for any RTS gamer</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-forged-alliance/user-reviews?user_review_id=2010328">Expand</a></span>

This expansion pack includes a new faction to play as and a ton of general improvements on what made vanilla SupCom such a unique experience. Forged Alliance really pulls off what it attempts to do. It is face-paced by nature but games can last well over an hour. Economy plays a massive role and players have the option of bunkering down in their starting location or can simply pour all their resources into spamming cheap units. There&apos;s also the option of sniping; selecting a group of units, quite often bombers or gunships, and assassinating an opponent&apos;s ACU. There really are more strategic options than any other RTS I have ever played. The FAF multiplayer community makes this a 10/10 experience and has really kept the game alive. SupCom 2 simplified the formula and was generally panned by the fan base so it&apos;s great to see FA doing so well today. A classic game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-forged-alliance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3496159">Expand</a></span>

The UI improvements are the biggest change to me, and nothing could help more in a heated online game fight to control your forces. If you are a single-player gamer, id say definatly pass on this expansion. The AI has some issues where it takes up vast vast amounts of your system resources, and since I wont get into my systems specs here i&apos;ll just say I built my own super-system for $6000 in December &apos;07. SupCom FA bogs down horribly in single play on any system, where as the original SupCom does not. Seems like some internal software issue they havent worked out yet, according to the forums and my personal programming experience. Multi-player is awesome, and the new units are a whole lot of fun, not to mention a lot of the new balance changes to keep players from spamming lots of engineers to end a large map game. However, if you are running a high-end system like me, you will be disappointed with this game in another way. The graphics have been toned down a lot, and the game no longer supports DX10. Might not seem like a big deal, but after viewing the comparison screen shots &amp; FRAPS videos first hand, on max settings it doesnt hold up to the original SupCom. Check the web, there are some comparison shots. Understandably, it was toned down to match the average game player. Was a bit silly to cater towards a small percentage of the market with higher-end systems. For a single-player gamer, and/or someone with a high-end PC looking for good graphics, id reccomend the original SupCom. The new software makes it is playable, but not very enjoyable. 5/10 for them. For the multi-player strategist, id definatly reccomend it (no-AI players or you&apos;ll shoot yourself in the foot online!), because its the best thing since sliced bread, 10/10 for them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-forged-alliance/user-reviews?user_review_id=411427">Expand</a></span>

Pathfinding, sim speed, and visuals are vastly improved making it possible for my Pentium D to play a massive 4v4 at full sim speed although my graphic card is now lacking. The most important change in FA is the shift from SimCity style gameplay. Offense is the best defense in Forged Alliance; without initiative, victory is impossible. Mass fabricators are nerfed and mass extractors are now the primary source of mass, thus expansion and aggression is the only way to victory. Superweapons, with the exception of game ending artillery, are all cheaper and easier to produce, introducing a previously missing strategic option. Players now have the ability to build a strategic missile launcher without stalling the economy and unit production. There are far too many changes in FA to list completely but I can say with confidence that balance and gameplay are almost perfect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-forged-alliance/user-reviews?user_review_id=408082">Expand</a></span>

The balance between the 4 factions is perfect. I think the critics totally under-rated this game. I hope the next expansion adds alot more kick-ass content to an already kick-ass game.</span>

<br>The expansion Forged Alliance adds new gameplay features to the game, several new units for the three preexisting factions, and is further optimized for increased performance.
<br>
<br>Gameplay in Forged Alliance is largely the same as in the original Supreme Commander. The player uses a giant bipedal mech called an Armored Command Unit (or ACU) to build an army with which they can conquer their opponents. Forged Alliance expands on the original gameplay mechanics, adding new units, modifying old ones, and introducing other improvements to the user interface.[4] The most notable addition to this expansion is the addition of a new faction, the Seraphim. In addition, the three original factions  the United Earth Federation (UEF), Cybran Nation, and Aeon Illuminate  also receive a number of new units. Other new content includes new maps. Several improvements to the controls and behind the scenes mechanics have been made as well. The interface has been revamped, as well as improved pathfinding and aircraft flight dynamics.[4]
<br>The original Supreme Commander allowed the player to employ all four traditional battlespaces  air, information, land and sea. Forged Alliance adds the ability for the UEF faction to construct orbital weaponry which the player can control. These satellites are impossible to harm directly, forcing opponents to find and destroy the control centers maintaining them.

<br>Guys, you should really play this game. It&apos;s the best of it&apos;s class, hands down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-forged-alliance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3451840">Expand</a></span>

As others I am a fan of Total Annihilation (the starting game of it all) but you don&apos;t need to have played it to enjoy this game. It&apos;s unique, clever, and has long lasting re-playability. The ideas that originated in TA and in this game have really set the standard for other RTS games.</span>

One of the best expansions this year, and it should be for 2007.</span>

But the graphics and gameplay are still absolutely up to date. Forged Alliance is a massive RTS game with 4 factions, giant maps and up to 12 players and up to 12.000 Units on the battlefield. Getting really good at the game will take you a while. But the community is really friendly and helpful and since you mostly play in large teams sorted by your rating (Use community based Forged Alliance Forever!!!) this is not a problem. The good thing about this great game is: It gets even better. For one the community still improves the game regularly. Secondly, the greatly improving hardware with quadcores being common today, allows for even bigger battles with no slowdowns. Buy it, enjoy it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-forged-alliance/user-reviews?user_review_id=4127117">Expand</a></span>

However, there has not been another game that can compete with Supreme Commander FA. It still has an active community on the community driven platform Forged Alliance Forever (FAForever.com) featuring chat, map and mod vault, live replays and even money tournaments. The game itself is still under development and gets regular improvements (bug-fixes, slight balance changes, new UI features). Overall a very unique strategy game with an UI that is designed to assist the player without taking away the option to control the battlefield. The game features up to 16 players (in FAF) and allowing every player to control up to 2000 units. Combined with the friendly community this game yields a fun experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-forged-alliance/user-reviews?user_review_id=6623567">Expand</a></span>

It saddens me, but this is our last great game guys so buy it on steam and keep it alive.
<br>
<br>This is one of the greatest RTS games I have ever played. I love Starcraft games but I&apos;m a slow clicker and that works against me in games like that. However, I&apos;m a very good tactician and this game is amazing at allowing a person to strategize. The scope of this game is breath taking, you can zoom out and literally see hundreds of units or zoom in and see an individual unit.
<br>
<br>The variety of units are awesome too. You like air? Well then you can make interceptors, air to ground attack aircraft, or bombers that bomb little bombs to mini-nukes. Want to launch stratetigic missiles? Awesome, but remember your enemy could build anti-missile defense lasers or shields. You can also nuke! BoooM!
<br>
<br>Did I mention this game&apos;s visuals still hold up after all this time? In 2007 when it was released most computers choked on the computations needed to run this game, but today&apos;s hardware can handle it rather well. It looks good, very good for an 8 year old game.
<br>
<br>I still play the campaign. I miss playing on GPG net multiplayer and the fun games. This game is 8 years old and I still love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-forged-alliance/user-reviews?user_review_id=1559660">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>supreme Commander is supreme real time strategy game. The best strategy game i have ever played in fact.Greatest RTS ever! Resource system is ingenious, at least i think so. The game is very complex, has so many units, four factions total, GIANT units, great command structure, incredibly massive scale, Naval battles, and air power the likes of which I&apos;ve never seen in another RTS!</span>

FA is to Homeworld 2 as Supreme commander is to the original Homeworld, in that you will spend most of your game time repelling invasions and rebuilding, and not actually playing the bloody game. Only until you build experimentals do you actually stand a chance at pushing forward... and at this point, the campaign missions are over in a hurry. Speaking of experimentals, there is not one mission where you don&apos;t fight an experimental, or have to repel an experimentals early in the game. Resource management is just as stupid to manage in FA as it was in SupCom; however, it is even more so in FA as the enemy loves to rush, and without adequate resources in the first place, you will be unable to defend yourself. Being able to choose a campaign and go through that faction&apos;s unique story and struggle has disappeared in favor of a single, similar story (and missions for all three factions) with the option to be different factions during said mission. The only difference in these missions might be one objective. The Dev&apos;s have unlocked the tech tree for you (no progressing as you complete the campaign anymore) and have given free rein on how the player approaches the mission. But given the amount of rushing that the A.I. does, the only choice is to spam units of your own, turtle, or build experimentals. Tactics have gone the way of the Dodo, and brute force has taken it&apos;s place. In regards to the story, it&apos;s worse than the original. Unlike the original, battle plans on how to defeat the enemy are not discussed; it&apos;s just &quot;go here, turtle up, steamroll the enemy, and gate off planet&quot;. Other story elements are weak and predictable and don&apos;t convey much of a story, let alone a unique FA universe. Just &quot;oh no! we&apos;re losing! hold the line!&quot; like many other sci-fi stories that have come before FA. The A.I. is horrible, often targeting the same three defenses over and over again. Often, it will take 20 failed raids before the A.I. realizes the strategy isn&apos;t working, and will spam new units against another section of defenses until it slowly realizes once again that said strategy isn&apos;t working. Because the A.I. is too stupid to target wall sections, all one has to do is build a wall surrounding your base and laugh as they sit there like hungry puppies at a door. Once tech 2 turrets are up, you can snipe said puppies. And don&apos;t get me started on performance. The damn game requires modifications to run properly on multi-core systems; otherwise you get massive slow down. Modifications help to alleviate this problem and turn an average game into a good one; however, i must judge the game on what the Dev&apos;s did, and not what modders can do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-forged-alliance/user-reviews?user_review_id=1603589">Expand</a></span>

Along with balance changes and new units, it&apos;s like a whole new game, rather than an expansion. My favorite part of this game is how it offers a mesmerising view of a futuristic battlefield. How it allows you to zoom up, watch individual parts of an unit move and fire true projectiles. That might not seem to be not that special, but the level of amusement I get when I see projectiles hit things they&apos;re not supposed to hit is goofy high. I can spend hours zoomed in just to watch the animations of units, even small things like energy storage growing taller as more energy is stored, and how engineers tilt their wheels to float on the water. I wish every game had strategic zoom like this game, with such polished visuals.
<br>
<br>The user interface is still rather basic, but much improved over the original, giving you much more space to see the battlefield. It requires 3rd party add-ons (UI mods) to allow things such as keybind remapping, to display health bars all the time, managing templates easier, and upgrade helpers. I highly recommend at least getting GAZ_UI (I used version 6.1). I had to adjust my build order with the changes that took place, such as starting with a factory first. It wasn&apos;t until FA that I seriously started to look at deciphering all the + and - numbers on everything, and learning how to balance energy income with mass income, depending on what I wanted to build. A lot of reading tooltips, looking at unit stats in the unit database web page, and a bit of math helped me out, which is akin to doing spreadsheets.
<br>
<br>This game seems to love Intel processors, or those with great &quot;single-thread&quot; performance. Playing on a laptop or AMD CPU will result in some slow-mo action before the end. Even if you have a good CPU, playing in a game with another with a slow CPU can make it agonizingly slow for you, especially if you&apos;re used to it being faster. The game doesn&apos;t run smoothly at full speed if there&apos;s someone else in your game with a poor or unreliable connection as well. I felt like I couldn&apos;t play big 8 player games with air battles and 1000 unit cap, until I got my PC upgraded (from AMD X3 720 to i2600k).
<br>
<br>The gameplay itself is a handful. It&apos;s a challenge to multi-task. The objective is simple, to destroy the enemy commander, but achieving it is another story. You should manage to progress your economy, never settling with a certain amount as &quot;enough&quot;, and considering how there&apos;s 3 tech levels of it and the hugeness of how maps are, you quickly find out how difficult it is to keep track of anything spread out. Staying compact will allow you to progress through tech at a manageable pace, but this is not an ideal way to achieve victory. Until you get used to things, to the point they become subconscious actions, your strategies will be extremely limited. I resorted to gambling with basic strategies, such as building up dozens of tanks, outnumbering the enemy, and using an upgraded commander to spearhead the assault, looking to surround the enemy commander. At first it was successful, but as maps get bigger and enemy teams get more members, this becomes less effective. Using a dozen tech 2 bombers or gunships to just simply fly in and bomb the enemy commander was a gamble that was easily countered by a shield and a few flak units. Once I got the hang of quickly upgrade my mass, I tried getting out an experimental as quickly as possible, but this strat could be beaten by a zerg rush. Sneaking a T3 commander with a transport as soon as possible was a huge gamble, but seemingly was the only strat that worked if I could land it where I wanted, without endless practice in other parts of the game.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer is still barely alive. I was able to register my product serial on Steam to play there, but a competing 3rd party lobby seems to be sucking players away with its advertising. If you choose to play multiplayer on that other lobby, &quot;FAF&quot;, I hope you have thick skin and have great luck! I&apos;d describe it as being an active volcano. Be extra cautious and watch out for eruptions. Go in with low expectations, else you may be disappointed, as their advertisements are clearly biased. They lose as many users as they get new ones, due to how toxic and unwelcoming they can be to some, especially those who go in expecting too much. Stick it out and endure the frustration and you&apos;ll be able to play one of the most noteworthy RTS games with some actual players.
<br>
<br>After playing this, I haven&apos;t found another RTS that has impressed me enough. SupCom2 was okay for a short while, fixing some issues I had with Forged Alliance, but was not close to being a FA killer, since it just didn&apos;t have the same scale and felt cheapened overall, such as with the cheesy sound effects (ex. commander explosion) and Aeon unit names that sounded cheap and unoriginal. I can&apos;t wait for a real update to SC:FA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-forged-alliance/user-reviews?user_review_id=4909448">Expand</a></span>

First of all, if you have units attacking, they will not move if there&apos;s an obstacle in their way and will attack hills, walls, etc. This results in the pointless and frustrating loss of units. Second, The fog of war effect is sort of poor in some regards. For an example, one of my enemies sent a Galactic Colossus at me, and started shooting my commander. I had no clue what it was because its laser beam not show up on the screen (it just looked like my commander was dying randomly). Another very annoying thing is the fact that missiles cannot be destroyed with tactical missile defense systems, unless they&apos;re &quot;tactical&quot; missiles. The amount of times I&apos;ve had the AI turtle in their base spamming air transports, missile launchers, and turrets is insane. I swear, the only air vehicles they ever make are air transports. Lastly, your AI &quot;allies&quot; screw you over all the time. I have had them send engineers straight off the bat to take all my extracting points and hydrocarbon plants. They also love spamming engineers, Tech 1 tanks, etc in your base. When the AI puts their units on your factories, they stop producing units. Just imagine it. You&apos;re defending your base from a spam of armed air transports, missile launchers, and Tech 1 assault bots. After you kill them, you notice two of your mass extractors were destroyed, and replaced with a Tech 3 mass extractor your ally put there with that engineer that&apos;s blocking your factory production, causing you to lose buildings and units. Of course, you can reclaim their units, but it takes forever to reclaim their Tech 3 extractors. Most of the time I get carried away and forget I sent an engineer to destroy the mass extractor they stole, and then come back later to see them rebuilding it. In general, this game is wonderful, but these are crippling issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-forged-alliance/user-reviews?user_review_id=4071068">Expand</a></span>

Forged Alliance is the next stand-alone iteration of (vanilla) Supreme Commander. It offers a single player campaign, non-functioning (!) coop-campaign, skirmishes and multiplayer options (players vs players). There are only 6 scenarios in the campaign, but they are lengthy. You almost always use the same tactic: you build up your army, finish the first part of a quest, take the scripted incoming counterattack and repeat the process.
<br>
<br>The AI is entirely uninspiring, but that&apos;s often the case with Real Time Simulation games. Meaning the AI keeps spamming attacking units , and you pump up tanks to counter them until you have enough units and static defenses to end it once and for all.
<br>
<br>The game is a little bit more intelligent than, say, the StarCraft series and other RTS games, but not much. When it&apos;s player vs player, it&apos;s still a matter of frantically clicking all over the map and interface. And that is my biggest grief. It&apos;s all about knowing the map and fast clicking like there&apos;s no tomorrow.
<br>
<br>I have played about 1200 one vs one PvP matches, and it&apos;s always the same: using your build-order (you must have one) for that specific map (which you will learn by playing) and clicking like a madman. The level of individual players can be so high that a few miss-clicks or minor hitches in the build-order causes people to forfeit a match. This is my very biggest grief: it&apos;s hard to compensate for small mistakes with &quot;original tactics&quot; because there really aren&apos;t that many. (I&apos;m not referring to &quot;tricks&quot; because everybody will learn those eventually.)
<br>Each match is a matter of spamming units, keep attacking and performing reconnaissance whilst slowly collecting resources and buying you some time to upgrade one or the other thing. Follow set procedures at the highest pace or lose.
<br>
<br>By the way, downloading FAF is absolutely a must for PvP play, but no worries, it works great and is a no-nonsense environment.
<br>
<br>Graphics aren&apos;t up to date anymore, but very doable. Story-line of the campaign is maybe laughable. To me it was. It looked more like a teen soap opera than anything else. Sounds and whatnot is OK.
<br>
<br>The strength of this game is it&apos;s resource system. It&apos;s original I have to say and changes a little bit how to think, and you&apos;ll get used to it so fast, so don&apos;t worry.
<br>
<br>The verdict is 6/10. For RTS-fans I can recommend it for sure. But from a top-down view, SC :FA doesn&apos;t offer something fundamentally new compared to RTS games. But make no mistake, it&apos;s a great improvement of vanilla Supreme Commander. The resource system is something different indeed. But frankly that alone is not enough to claim this game is that much better compared with other big names.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/supreme-commander-forged-alliance/user-reviews?user_review_id=6325042">Expand</a></span>
