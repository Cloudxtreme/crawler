This game has charm coming out the wazoo! Quirky fun AND memorable characters. So many games. So forgettable. This one is not. I suggest you pick it up. It was the first point n click adventure puzzle game I have played. Honestly. Yeah. I know. Terrible. Apparently it&apos;s a genre I may have a thing for and it&apos;s thanks to this game. BUY IT!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-next-big-thing/user-reviews?user_review_id=3186382">Expand</a></span>

Pendulo Studios are responsible for the amazing Runaway series (which likely brought the adventure genre back to life) and I can&apos;t get my head around how they failed at this so badly. The writing is poor, the characters aren&apos;t memorable and there is very little captivating about the game except for amazing graphics... which is a shame because it&apos;s a waste of a massive potential that this game had. Not worth it unless you pick it up during a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-next-big-thing/user-reviews?user_review_id=2612378">Expand</a></span>

Well, this is not one of those.
<br>
<br>&quot;The Next BIG Thing&quot; looks awesome. It has a very good user interface. Dialogues are well written, and often very funny. Voice acting for the two main characters is excellent and at least tolerable for the others. The game has a goofy plot and quirky characters, on a level that would make even Japanese raise an eyebrow in appreciation, but that was only refreshing. There is enough content to justify the price. However.
<br>
<br>The puzzles are horrid. Often they do not even make an attempt to be logical; literally the only way to figure out many of them is the age-old chore-fest of trying to use everything with everything. A very minor spoiler as an example: you are supposed to use a juicer on a fire extinguisher to gain a bottle of red color (there is no in-game logic for that either, the protagonist simply comments &quot;oh well, this is the kind of weird thing I do&quot; afterwards). So yeah. With that, what should be a fun and exciting joyride frequently bogs down to a menial search for the one combination you have not yet attempted. And to top it off, there is one &quot;puzzle&quot; that stands tall among the most annoying and non-sensical puzzles of all time. I&apos;m looking at you, tango flowers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-next-big-thing/user-reviews?user_review_id=7394701">Expand</a></span>
