Now its time for the game to play tricks against you : (a) button lag: the player who was supposed to pass the ball keeps on dribbling and takes the ball across the line. (b) buggy team AI: the player control shifts to some other player who absolutely cant receive the ball instead of striker supposed to receive the ball. (c) cpu cheating: even with players like gerrard and xavi on the ball with no defenders around them, if you play a through ball to a striker who is also relatively free in space, 9 out of 10 are the chances the ball either goes to the goalie or simply crosses the line. (d) wicked referee: referee is okay with my players getting slide tackled from behind inside the opposition penalty area but if my players do as much as apply pressure on the opponent for a few seconds the referee gives a yellow; the slide tackles on good dribblers like messi or ronaldinho is invariably red. (e) free kicks are unrealistically difficult to score while penalty shots dont show any meter for any help on length of button press. (f) keeper ai is so terrible that once when once when i rushed the keeper forward to collect a lobbed through ball, the keeper could not even simply catch it and it went by his side into net (ball was at shoulder height when it crossed the keeper). and I could go on for hours... So the verdict: if u r a truly a football fan and dont own a console then better spend your bucks to buy a decent football boots (and obviously a ball) and spend some time on the field.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2010/user-reviews?user_review_id=745016">Expand</a></span>
