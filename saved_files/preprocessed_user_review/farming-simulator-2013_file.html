<br>The game runs great on my Win7 system  I haven&apos;t encountered any bugs in hours of gameplay. I found the graphics and sounds very pleasant, but the interface is not intuitive or handy because it&apos;s kept out of sight most of the time  you&apos;ll have to press keys repeatedly to bring up certain info on the screen, which I found annoying. Aside from that only gripe, I found the controls of the many vehicles good and easy to learn.
<br>Running the farm is fun and relaxing, with lots of stuff to do once you have several fields going (you&apos;ll have to hire some workers to keep up). You can also change the game speed and enable/disable missions (mowing grass pays off) at anytime during gameplay, or download a free ATV to drive around at high speed.
<br>Really enjoying this game  a totally different experience from anything else I&apos;ve played on the PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2958802">Expand</a></span>

The game plunks you down in front of a cozy looking home overlooking your farm:  a compliment of empty sheds, barns, and a field ready for harvesting.  I strongly recommend playing through at least several of the tutorials before you jump right in, because like games of yesteryear, there is no &quot;hold-your-hand&quot; and &quot;everybody-wins&quot; introduction.
<br>
<br>The tutorials show you how to prepare fields, seed them, and harvest them.  All essential if you want to be a farmer in Farming Simulator 2013, and I assume that you do!  Once you get the basics down, and you&apos;ve harvested your first field, you start the wonder how things might have gone with better equipment.  The sandbox world of farming is what you make of it.  The game wants you to use the funds gained from selling your crop to expand your farming enterprise.  You can purchase new and more efficient gear, more fields to cultivate and farm, or even self-producing income generators like solar power collection, greenhouses, or bee farms.  The self-producing income generators leave much to be desired however, as once you place them there is very little to no interaction afterwards (and the return is not even that great).
<br>
<br>More funds affords better equipment, better equipment affords more productivity, so and and so forth.  It quickly snowballs into an inordinate amount of cash flow from your series of a dozen or more plots around town.  The end game becomes a matter of organization and timing doing the same old thing: farming.
<br>
<br>Livestock is an interesting twist to break up the monotony of farming.  You learn about harvesting grass, preparing it for different uses, recycling crop byproduct into food or silage, all of which contributes to the efficiency of your livestock production.
<br>
<br>The one saving grace of this game is the incredible modding community.  Without mods, this game quickly loses its lasting appeal to a gamer whose not necessarily in love with farming to begin with.  You will surely want to spend time looking for interesting mods to give your save game a kick in the butt.
<br>
<br>The game is monotonous, grinding, yet incredibly rewarding (surely an accurate simulation of farming?).  I&apos;m very happy to have played this game, and look forward to the new updates and mod creations from the community to keep it fresh.  I think in the end, more than the depth of the game itself, the exposure to farming and it&apos;s basic processes was the most enjoyable aspect of the game for me: a casual, non-farming, video gamer.  I would certainly purchase this game again, and would recommend it to friends to get about 30 hours of solid, fun, rewarding game play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2879200">Expand</a></span>

That said, of course it still *is* a farming simulator, so you *will* be doing some things that are a little more tedious than you&apos;d expect from a typical game. For example, there&apos;s no denying that a large part of farm work is driving up and down a field at slow speed, so you will be doing some of that. At the same time you don&apos;t have most of the sources of excitement that other open world games have, you&apos;re doing honest work (except if you&apos;re stealing golf carts, which is possible and apparently nobody cares) so you&apos;re not going to be in any police chases or shootouts. The game does a very good job at simulating a farm. You start out with some money, machinery, a loan, and a field (depending on difficulty) and manage the operation from there on. You tend your fields, buy machines, buy more fields, perhaps some animals, and so on, and the level of detail is mostly pretty good. All this takes place in a completely open world, and while you can&apos;t buy any cars unless you install mods, there&apos;s a very large selection of tractors and other equipment that you can drive around. The nice thing is that equipment generally works like you&apos;d expect it to work: Trailers can be attached to tractors, or in some cases to other trailers, making trains; then you drive them over a grate and press a key to unload your grains, which will happen in a way specific to the type of trailer you&apos;re using. Front loaders can pick up things and carry them around, sowers sow, sprayers spray, additional tanks attached to the front of your tractor provide more fertilizer for the sprayer attached to its rear, balers pick up straw and make bales, which you can then pick up with a front loader or another machine that stacks them. Cows produce manure, which you can use to fertilize your fields if you choose to do so, and so forth.
<br>
<br>The game does try to alleviate some of the tedium by letting you hire help for some of the repetitive driving tasks. For example, plowing, cultivating, sowing, fertilizing, spraying, and harvesting can all be done by a computer controlled clone of you. This is implemented very nicely, you just drive the machine to the starting point and press H and it&apos;ll start doing what you&apos;d expect it to do. For example, a combine harvester will start slowly harvesting your field, driving up and down, and eventually stop when it&apos;s full. Then you can pull up next to it with a trailer and the computer help will extend the combine&apos;s pipe and unload the harvest into your trailer and continue. Similarly if you drive next to it while it&apos;s harvesting, it&apos;ll transfer the harvest to your trailer as you go. This makes it very easy to do some of the typical farming tasks that normally require more than one person. It also adds an aspect of time management to the game when you have multiple computer controlled helpers working your fields and need to jump around between them to support them.
<br>
<br>You also don&apos;t have to wait for your plants to grow. There are three settings to control how fast plants grow, and separately you can also speed up time by 120x. Machines only work at one fixed pace, though.
<br>
<br>The farming aspect of this game includes various types of grains, potatoes, beets, as well as cattle (for dairy), sheep (for wool), and chicken (for eggs). Additionally, you can buy green houses that you can freely place on the map to grow things such as herbs or tomatoes, and you can buy bee houses that&apos;ll produce honey.
<br>
<br>In addition to typical farming tasks, there also are some half arsed missions (basically two types: one requires you to pick up something with a front loader, another requires you to mow strangely rectangular areas where grass suddenly appeared on the golf course). You can also buy solar panels and wind energy converters, which will provide a nice consistent stream of extra income (they&apos;re a little too good).
<br>
<br>I&apos;m rating this game a 9 out of 10 because it&apos;s a good farming simulator with a very nice open world and very detailed equipment. But as I stated above, it&apos;s still a farming simulator, and not an action game, and I would not necessarily expect it to appeal to the same audience as other open world games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2723168">Expand</a></span>

Lack of phsyics (absolutely none, zero, null)
<br>3. Lack of a good manual explaining how to use different buildings (I played other farming games so I know, but new player is completely lost)
<br>4. Emptiness of surroundings. 5. Did I mention terribely ugly graphics and lack of physics? 6. No economy system (You just sell and buy sell and buy - but hey ,where is the competition? Targets You need to meet? nope.) 7. Sound... well, no wonder why every Youtube FS 2013 gameplay has music instead of game sound.  The goods:
<br>1. Machines diversity
<br>2. And that&apos;s all I think.
<br>3. Mods. But 90% of them is ugly or doesn&apos;t work, so actually I should move it to cons. I will recommend it to... noone I think. Just wait for Agrar Simulator 2013 and 7 patches and You will get something similar to real farming. Stay far, far away from THIS.  1/10 for some nice tractors models.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2731386">Expand</a></span>

But it hasen&apos;t been thoroughly checked for bugs. I have the latest patched version installed   There&apos;s problems with leaving a tractor somewhere with a mower attachment, save the game. Load it and you can&apos;t jump to that tractor via the map. You can see the mower attachment but not the tractor so you have to walk to it, to get back in. You can&apos;t hire someone to fertilize. The forklift attachments are kind of wonky, and don&apos;t lie perfectly straight in order to pick up pallets. So it&apos;s really sensitive and makes forklift missions frustrating. The hired workers are really &quot;special&quot; you have to pay attention to them, especially when setting them up to a field to work. Otherwise they&apos;ll just roll off randomly. Their are other tractor switching bugs, that cause hired workers to stop. If you hire workers, put them to work save the game. Load up the game they all stop working. So you have to go back and set them back to work.  When you load up a game you always start right in front of your home farm no matter where you save.  There seems no real incintive to farm anything other than canola, it&apos;s the highest selling crop. Yes other crops may jump in a price a little. But canola is always the top seller even on a bad day. So there&apos;s no reason to farm anything other than canola. Maybe it should of been called Canola Farming Simulator 2013. The map feels more like a rat maze than an actual rural area, surrounded by mountains with roads that made no sesne, no matter where you had to go on the map. You had to take these long, winding routes that all focus on the little city. For the amount of distance you had to drive, they could of at least threw in less obstacles or at least be able to hire people to deliver and sell goods. Which you can&apos;t do.
<br>
<br>And the final bug that caused me to say too bad, and uninstall this game was the collision detection. I had an expensive tipper attached to a small tractor got it stuck on a ramp. Unhitched the tractor to ramm it free, that tractor became lodged upside down underneath the tipper causing the tipper and tractor to become useless and stuck, went and got another tractor went for another long drive *sigh* back to ramm the mess and  got that tractor stuck as well.  Too bad, because I loved the concept. It was just too buggy and obviously not checked properly and fixed to make it fun. 30$ wasted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2957542">Expand</a></span>

The game menus are all stretched at 5760 x 1080 (Eyefinity). I only played through the tutorials and stopped. Unless this game is patched with an updated graphics engine I&apos;ll remove from hard drive and not buy another Giants Software game. I was looking forward to buying five copies so my family could play co-op play. Minecraft looks better than this game so we&apos;ll stick to playing that. I guess if you want a Farming Arcade game this would be okay. A simulation? No, the sounds, the views, the attention to detail are all missing. This is a what I would expect in a 2008 arcade style game, not a 2012/2013 game for a PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2712589">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s over atleast 20 different brand names you can buy from and all that do different things to get the job done.
<br>
<br>I have so far put in 150 hours into this game and i thought it would be tough but it turns out i was wrong. It&apos;s incredibly time consuming and when you go to purchase items that can be placed on the map, it can only be placed one direction. Greenhouses need supplied water AND manure instead of manure alone.
<br>
<br>When i first started getting cow and and a bunch of animals, i thought i was biting off more than i can chew but its becoming even more fun and now i can see almost the whole games features and what its got to offer. I really enjoy this simulator. Best simulator yet! 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3945211">Expand</a></span>

<br>On the minus, the game simply feels like it was released way too early. A very sterile world, with bland graphics. No help available in-game (and very little from title screen). Too many things on the map represented only by icons and no legend to explain what they mean. Trying to establish any sort of advanced gameplay is nearly impossible, thanks to only the most elementary of economic information tracked (Seriously, is it really so hard to imagine a player might want to track information by field?). There are no meaningful objectives or missions, save for exceedingly repetitive and generic &quot;events&quot;. Upgrading equipment (the sole raison d&apos;etre) is an exercise in trial and error, since virtually no useful information or guidelines are offered to help you choose wisely - you&apos;re basically left hoping that bigger and more expensive will turn out to be better.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, just a shell of a game. The possibility of user-generated content is there, but this game seems to be depending on it entirely.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=2799122">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Negatives
<br>
<br>1. I want to point out is that they do not give you a tutorial. I had absolutely no idea how to play it.
<br>2. Lack of physics. Somehow my tractor got stuck in a fence...
<br>3. Music was horrible.
<br>4. Graphics are not the best.
<br>
<br>Positives
<br>
<br>1. Huge selection of vehicles.
<br>2. You get a sense of what farmers go through. Note the world &quot;sense&quot;.
<br>
<br>I honestly would not recommend this game as a 2012/2013 PC game. If this was released in 2009 or around then, I would maybe recommend it. Not a good game. I do not recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3110227">Expand</a></span>

While delivering goods is tedius, I play with a gamepad, and xinput compatibility has been fixed since 2011.  If you were frustrated trying to map LT and RT to drive forward and reverse in 2011, note that the default controls in 2013 include proportional drive, provided your controller is X-Input compatible.  Playing Vanilla, some worthwhile machines have been added (e.g. weideman loader), but this is more of a fix than an improvement, as playing multiplayer with mods is still a giant hasstle.  My biggest gripe is physics, where acceleration is too slow and speeds are to high.  Tractors don&apos;t tip over, and connecting tools is not as realistic as it could be.  While I like the game overall, Giants didn&apos;t sell so many coppies becasue they made a good game, they sold so many copies because they put a case quadtrack on the cover of their box.  Overall, the game isn&apos;t bad, I just wish there had been more effort put into improving the vehicles.  Also Picking up palets is terribly unrealistic, and friction doesn&apos;t scale as you add weight (Driving off of a trailer will propel the trailer backward).  The world is a maze as well.  On the good side, Controls are fixed, the menu music is less bad (though still intrusive if you enjoy in-game sounds) and it&apos;s all in all a more complete than 2011.  Mirrors are grey, and pedestrians do not collide with tractors.  There is much to be desired from this game, but it is surprisingly complex.  Most of my enjoyment of this game is thanks to a dedicated modding community.  Most of the games value comes through mods, and unlike 2011, the game is complete without buying additional dlc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3135168">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s as casual as a game could possibly be.
<br>Actually... it&apos;s more.. much more casual than that. Which is why most people may not even consider it a game.
<br>
<br>But if you like farming &quot;games&quot;... it can be really fun. You can do farming stuff.. like... plowing the field... then sowing... then waiting... and waiting... and waiting... and waiting (if you set the speed to 120x... otherwise it&apos;s 120 times more waiting)... and then harvest and start all over again... you can also have livestock... (Ok... it&apos;s not just that... )
<br>
<br>Cool things:
<br>Lots of content. Lots of machines. And this game can be modded (you can also develop your own... they got a modding tutorial too). And even though the game only comes with 1 map, they&apos;re rather easy to create/edit and there&apos;s a quite active community developing and sharing free mods and maps. When you create a map you can set the possible crop types so... tons of possible crops. Anyways... content customization in this game is pretty cool, though sometimes they go too far (way beyond farming illegal drugs)... you can actually get the &quot;Courseplay addon&quot; that will even play the game for you after you record your macros. That way the game can have fun by itself while you go do other stuff in real life (is that casual enough for you?).
<br>
<br>Multiplayer. Yes. You can &quot;play&quot; with your friends. Although the server goes off if no player is online, they got the dedicated server project that will allow you to set persistent servers (probably gonna charge for server license separately).
<br>
<br>Not cool:
<br>
<br>Livestock is too simple (can be mitigated through modding).
<br>
<br>Limited crop variety. Up to the latest version, there is a hard limitation on the number of different crops you can set your map to have. You can set your maps to have cool and unusual crops, but when you do so, you&apos;ll have to get rid of the tradicional ones.
<br>
<br>Machine-only labor. I&apos;m pretty sure I could work most of the default map fields using only a spoon to do the soil preparation and rip the plants off barehanded in a 8h workday (about 1h for the initial field or 3h if I had to dig barehanded too). I missed the option to buy tools instead of machines to work the smaller fields. It would greatly improve the game by replacing the &quot;waiting&quot; part when you get the multiple fields. At least for people like me who really dislikes the side missions.
<br>
<br>Sometimes you forget what the game is about. Seriously. I&apos;m playing a farming simulator and what I do while I&apos;m playing it, obviously. is.... mowing grass for a nearby golf club and transporting other people&apos;s crates aroung town  The side missions pay better than farming.... unless you turn off the missions. Then you&apos;ll spend so much time driving trucks (check my achievements) to store or sell your crops you&apos;ll think it&apos;s a truck simulator. Except it&apos;s a tractor pulling the cargo.
<br>
<br>Weird balancing (can be fixed through modding). Like all the games I&apos;ve started playing the last few years, I started this one on the hardest difficulty setting allowed. Apparently, it&apos;s tuned as a 3-50 years range expected gameplay (for 1 map). You feel like you&apos;re giving away your crops. The side missions make the feeling much worse (about 5 min to complete a mission and get the same as your 30min gameplay complete field cycle (can be fixed through modding). WARNING: Don&apos;t ever play easy after playing hard. It simply feels surreal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/farming-simulator-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3683854">Expand</a></span>

I have given an 8 due to the fact the tutorial does not go in depth enough for beginners as it shows you how to use the machines but nothing about the environment factors such as fuel, selling or location of services.
<br>
<br>The graphics are not the best (No reflections in side mirrors when in 1st person view) but with the amount of vehicles and features it gives you it can be forgiven. The mission timers are a let down as it does not give you enough time to complete them in some cases but it does let you explore more parts of the large map and use other vehicles apart from tractors and  harvesters.
