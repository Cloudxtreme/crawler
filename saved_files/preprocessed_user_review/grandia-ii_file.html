The combat system is great, but they really should have made the storyline longer, and have more than one ending. </span>

Also it is not limited by usual &apos;character slots&apos; for enemys - be prepared to fight 15 guys at once. The sound, yeah, is off a little - especially during the begining (the opening video music is a hideous selection for the action on the screen) But it does have it&apos;s high points - the &apos;Sleeping&apos; Village&apos;s quasi-sufi music rules all - to bad it&apos;s super short. As far as graphics go - graphics-smashics. Graphics come last when evaluating rpgs. Storyline is most important - then innovation - then gameplay - then music. I don&apos;t know why people prefer these 3D graphics. Chrono Trigger style hand animated are much more intimate and memorable than cold recycled textures. (yuck!) It&apos;s sad to think no one will recognize that and make a game with those kind of graphics - but with massive gameplay length. I think Grandia 2 has well rounded graphics, and fairly warm and inspiring ones - as far as 3D goes- The voice dubs are alright - and suitable to give you and idea of what the character sounds like. But it&apos;s odd when the voice-acting just stops coming. However this is a very good game over all - and definitely one to lure non-rpggamers to the rpg genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grandia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=370278">Expand</a></span>

Very good story, although a few hours too long.  It seemed that the game was close to the end, but then a new twist kept it going.   YFZ said he beat the game in 17 hours, I can&apos;t see how that is possible, unless he did not speak to any NPC characters while in town.  It took me 45 hours to finish the game, and I spoke to every character 6 times (3 times before and after major game events).  Each time, the character said something different or added more details to the story, which I found very cool.  The writers should be commended on being thorough.  The anime graphics fits the game perfectly.  Music and sound were good, except for a few minor complaints.  The music would sometimes end abruptly, instead of gradually fading out.  The characters were interesting, and the story had plenty of twists and turns.  I found myself caring about what happened to the team of characters, and really felt sad when I lost one that I had fought alongside.  The fighting system and available spells were varied enough that I never became bored with battles.  Fights between your characters and the enemies were well balanced.  The battles were never too easy or too hard.  One reviewer mentioned translation errors.  I never witnessed a single error.  It was well written and richly conveyed the story.  The story is original and unpredictable.  Another reviewer commented that the game is unplayable on newer systems.  I have a Pentium 3 Ghz with ATI video card and Soundblaster, and did not experience any video or audio problems.   All in all, well worth the price of admission.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grandia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=57262">Expand</a></span>

The story isn&apos;t massively original, but it does feature some mind-bending twists that are well worth experiencing. The combat system is great, a blend of turn-based and real-time where you queue up actions to perform, and those actions take more or less time to complete depending on the type and level of the action- things get strategic right off the bat, it&apos;s possible to pass the entire first dungeon without ever taking a single point of damage if you input your commands perfectly. Some say this makes the game &quot;easy&quot;, but that&apos;s ridiculous, the game will slaughter you if you don&apos;t get good at strategy- it just rewards strategic players with awesome results. Absolutely every RPG fan should play this game. How does the PC port compare? It&apos;s such a direct port of the Dreamcast version, your old saves will still work if you can port them over. That&apos;s wonderful, as the Dreamcast version is the most bug-free version ever released. The updates include better graphics, and a &quot;Hard&quot; mode that according to the forums just adds 20% HP to all enemies- that doesn&apos;t really fix the complaints as you can still &quot;juggle&quot; bad guys to avoid damage and win battles without being touched, but hey the developers listened and replied, and it doesn&apos;t harm the base game at all. Highly recommended, it&apos;s a great port of an all-time classic game, now forever preserved so you don&apos;t have to have a Dreamcast to play it. Go. Buy. Play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grandia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5436985">Expand</a></span>
