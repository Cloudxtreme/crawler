Starcraft 2 has basically been the only option in what some people call a dying genre.
<br>
<br>Grey Goo is a completely solid RTS that plays a lot differently than Starcraft. There are no unit abilities so micromanagement is limited to positioning and targeting. Basically the game shows you a unit, tells you how it attacks and what it is good for, then you get to use it and move on to the next one. Its simplicity might turn off some people, but for someone like me who loved Tiberian Sun, this was nice to see again.
<br>
<br>The units are fairly tame save for the epic units, each unit ties in very closely to the theme of the faction it is from, which makes a lot of the units from each faction look very similar. But they are different enough that you&apos;ll be able to tell which unit is which when you play.
<br>
<br>The game shines in the campaign cutscenes and story which do an awesome job of investing you in the story and making you interested. The gameplay is well polished and the graphics look great. My only real gripe is that while I was playing I felt like all the maps used the same tileset. Which coincidentally Tiberian Sun suffered from the same thing. Despite entering different biomes on the campaign map, every map felt dark and dusty.
<br>
<br>The only performance issues I came across were the in the menus of the game. The main menu took a while to load and the cinematic leading up to it was really choppy which made me worried, but after I got into a game and I got 60fps gameplay I don&apos;t know what to think about that.
<br>
<br>So it&apos;s a good game. It&apos;s somewhat simplistic, but the concept is great and the story alone is a high selling point for me. It doesn&apos;t do anything crazy but it sticks to what makes an RTS fun. It&apos;s a good polished game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grey-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=4944954">Expand</a></span>

Thing is, it also has some not-so-nice stuff. But, first things first.
<br>
<br>It is absolutely beautiful overall - cutscenes, menus, gameplay, hell even loading screens. Gorgeous design, fresh looking units and abundance of little touches that You don&apos;t notice at first glance. Units design is also top notch, they have plenty of little details and animations to catch Your eye. It&apos;s a joy to look at - but with this come rather big system requirements. Even powerful PCs will struggle in big battles with close-to-maximum unit counts. Choppy framerate in the heat of battle spoils the fun somewhat.
<br>That being said, if You can run it at higher details it&apos;s an absolute feast for the eyes, it really is.
<br>
<br>Sound, unsurprisingly, is pretty much flawless. Music is a matter of taste i guess but i would say it fits the look and feel quite brilliantly and some of the tunes, especially menus, are seriously fantastic. Sounds are similarly exceptional - perhaps some people will miss loud, bassy thumping of cannons and artillery - but again, like music, it fits theme of the game rather well. Add to that superb voice acting and ui sounds and You get the idea. I was trying to think of one bad thing about it and i just can&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Now, for gameplay. This is a big problem because it isn&apos;t bad... at first glance. The factions are REALLY different from one another, they feel unique and each has its own character. But here also problems start. There is not enough unit variety and specialization. Easy way to win is to spam best units and steamroll the enemy. You don&apos;t need any tactics at all. There are other issues - humans are a little bit screwed with their base design (buildings connected to the main hub by rather delicate conduits) - it&apos;s far too easy to rush in and destroy their power conduits leaving the whole base defenseless and without any production capability. It&apos;s fine in singleplayer but in MP it becomes a fairly big issue.
<br>There are also smaller annoyances - like the fact that air units are mostly useless, repairing buildings can be beyond frustrating (having to click every damn damaged building, gets worse if choppy framerate shows its annoying face), production queues are too small so You can&apos;t ever focus entirely on battle.
<br>
<br>Resource collecting is interestingly done and i for one like it, it&apos;s simple and doesn&apos;t add another headache to already click-intensive (or hotkey-intensive) game. Research is very limited but i do like the way each branch (out of 5) can only have 1 out of 3 boosts, it makes You pause and think what You need - even if for a few games before You find the best combination and stick with that.
<br>
<br>Single player campaign is far too short for a strategy game, good RTS player will most likely do the whole thing in around 10 hours or so on hard difficulty, depending on playstyle. Multiplayer is a fun for a little bit but it quickly becomes tedious and a tad boring due to lack of units variety or any tactical options.
<br>
<br>This is why i&apos;m struggling with Grey Goo. I really want to like this game. The looks and sounds are absolutely beautiful, it&apos;s genuinely fresh with its approach to each factions playstyle. However - it lacks depth in gameplay department. It&apos;s just too simple, too shallow. It&apos;s far too easy to spam one powerful unit, back it up with mobile artillery and attack-move the whole map without much effort. It doesn&apos;t challenge You, and for me this is a big problem. It&apos;s a fun game for a week at most, and then you&apos;ll get bored of its over-simplification.
<br>
<br>Overall, i recommend a little bit of caution when considering purchase. If You get it on steam sale or via humble bundle - yes, by all means. There is a fair bit to enjoy for a little while. But full price ? I think not, sadly. It doesn&apos;t have that magic, that elusive &apos;something&apos; that keeps You playing after You&apos;ve finished it once or twice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grey-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=4945148">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- Single player is incredibly well polished, with great cutscenes, although the story itself leaves something to be desired.
<br>
<br>- The QWERTY hotkey-bar setup takes a little while to get used to but is generally much more user friendly than other RTS hotkey configurations like SC and AoE.
<br>
<br>- The foliage cover mechanic is a fun twist to traditional cloaking.
<br>
<br>- So far balancing between the three factions looks solid, but I haven&apos;t played that many multiplayer games yet so we&apos;ll have to wait and see if it still feels right after that.
<br>
<br>- I enjoy having the resource rate meter on the top right, like Supereme Commander and other games in that vein vs. just a straight up resource count.
<br>
<br>- The multiplayer games I&apos;ve played with my friends so far have been action packed from the get-go. Even with 2 factions having walls, turtling doesn&apos;t seem to work as a valid strategy for too long.
<br>
<br>- The unit upgrades in the game are more strategic than, &quot;This just makes my units beefier,&quot; like SC2 where you pretty much have to get some upgrades without thinking too hard about them.
<br>
<br>- The Goo is probably the most unique faction I have EVER played in any RTS game. It will be a lot of fun to master!
<br>
<br>My only major gripe with this game is that the multiplayer scene looks a little scant so far. More people who love RTSs (of which there may not be many) please buy this game so I can play with yo&apos;ll!!! :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grey-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=4924527">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay itself is not too frantic - with fairly slow units - there is time to formulate tactics and exploit the enemies weaknesses rather than to try to find the most efficient order of clicks.
<br>
<br>The research and upgrade system is fairly limited though - as is the resource management - which seems to be a mix between resource concept of Total Annihilation/Supreme Commander and the more classic RTS with finite resources - forcing the player to expand or stagnate/loose in time.
<br>
<br>Sadly though i feel like - while very solid and well done - it does not deliver more than some of the much older RTS games. - both in looks and feel.
<br>
<br>The three factions are different - but mostly in terms of base expansion. The Goo seems to be similar to the factions in Perimeter, the Beta are similar to the LC in Earth 2150 - building hubs and expansions, while the humans are similar to the EC in Earth 2150 - expanding their central hub.
<br>
<br>The units themselves felt very similar with the usual selection of direct damage, artillery, anti-air and air units.
<br>
<br>Especially the units felt very limited - with &quot;only&quot; 11 or 12 units and an epic unit - each unit might have a more defined role than some games with a huge number of units - but i think they went a bit too far there.
<br>
<br>Personally - i prefer Supreme Commander for its scale and tactics on long range engagements and unit selection or C&amp;C Generals for its diverse units and smaller scale tactics.
<br>
<br>With that said - it is sad that those old games kind of outshine Grey Goo - which is a very solid title - but not more to me than average.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grey-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=4922006">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Grey goo is a very good game. Easy to learn hard to master. You don&apos;t need super great micro skills like in starcraft, but you have to learn a lot of strategy element if you want to be a good player in pvp. The campaign got a lot of cinematic, so i love that too, but my fav is multiplayer, and i think thats well balanced atm.</span>

<br>2. Goo race has some exceptional and innovative design (although the other races are very well designed as well).
<br>3.  Very importantly, this game is not an e-sport wannabe; there are no unnecessary chores: you don&apos;t build workers, there are no supply blocks; unit production can be set to automatically produce a certain unit; this makes the game focus more towards strategy, as opposed to unnecessary actions that uselessly complicate your experience.
<br>4. Less frustration: units move more slowly and die slower than in other popular RTS games. There is no imba harassment to ruin the experience or overly weak defenses that promote great viewing experience to the detriment of good actual gaming experience.
<br>5. The music is very engaging and the cut scenes basically rival even the best cinematics out there, as they have been created by the same guys that worked on Lord of the Rings trilogy and District 9.
<br>6. The tone of the game is more sci-fi oriented, more serious, as opposed to cheesy, cheap and commercial (no corny love story **** in this one); it gives me the same feeling I got when watching a great Star Trek episode; it is definitely catered towards a more mature audience; and the characters are very believable and likeable.
<br>7. The way in which you build structures and gain access to units is quite different from other strategy games, which opens up a lot of options.
<br>
<br>If you want to play a good RTS when you get home in the evening, without worrying that you have to spam 200 actions per minute to stand a chance and focus on 10 repetitive activities that pointlessly complicate your gameplay or if you want to enjoy a good solid strategy game with gorgeous graphics and intriguing faction design, then this is the game you&apos;ve been waiting for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grey-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=4957482">Expand</a></span>

<br>Thats why this game gets 7 points - it is only a little bit more of the very standard RTS, really nothing out of the ordinary. It takes a little bit from this RTS, a little bit of that RTS, but nothing new or exciting.

                                        <span>pretty awesome. I really like this game. can&apos;t wait to see where they take it, but I love it as is. It can get really stressful, but in a great way. No real micro managing, which I like. It&apos;s not too difficult to learn, but I&apos;m still learning more as I go. There&apos;s a lot of like, hidden features, which can really turn the tides. Not your average RTS, more like, the new standard. imho.</span>

<br>
<br>Story is good if you&apos;re into the single player, and there&apos;s more than enough variety for multiplayer. Worth the buy.</span>

Super polished cutscenes and a difficult campaign that hearken back to when games were tough. Three well balanced factions and great UI allow the player to always be in the middle of the action.</span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ll give massive credit for the hotkeying system on the fly, which is a nice touch, but the factions are hit and miss and have a very bog-standard story and overall execution. Graphically it&apos;s kept things safe by going for a dark, menacing colour scheme, but as such fails to impose a real identity of it&apos;s own when compared to games from the past such as Starcraft and C&amp;C.
<br>
<br>And it&apos;s the past that this game makes me hark back to again and again, as all it does is make me fondly reminisce about other great titles, rather than get excited about this one in its own right.
<br>
<br>You won&apos;t regret buying Grey Goo. There&apos;s nothing wrong with it at all, and compared to most RTS games released in the past decade this stands on its own two legs as a worthwhile purchase, but... just don&apos;t expect miracles with it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grey-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=4998820">Expand</a></span>

Currently besides Blizzard games, Grey Goo represent the best this genre has to offer. A compelling story line, Interesting and varied characters, and get this...A Language barrier within the game. Ever wonder why all aliens always speak English in games today? Not in Grey Goo. Small features such as the language barrier really make the game stand apart of other titles.
<br>
<br>This game does not require excess competitiveness from the player, nor micro second reaction times. Just a keen interest in Science Fiction, and a yearning for great game.
<br>
<br>All three races distinctly stand apart from each other, from resource management, base construction and even units. While there are some very minor issues with balance, they are sure to be fixed and patched. Grey Goo is a game meant to be enjoyed and savored, not a mad rush to the end to win.
<br>
<br>A little about me in terms of previous games I&apos;ve played to make the above statements validated.

<br>I had to come here because this game is getting weird reviews that don&apos;t completely correspond to reality.
<br>So here&apos;s a reality check.
<br>This game is nowhere near any RTS from Blizzard as some might think by reading some supposedly qualified review.
<br>- The units are not interesting - lack of flavor, character and even individuality.
<br>- The animations are boring - it feels as if you are moving a set of pixels from one place on your monitor to another, shooting blocks that will decrease a bar on your enemie&apos;s set of pixels. I know this is exactly what happens in every game, but here it&apos;s how it feels.
<br>- Controls are clunky - I guess you have to try it to understand what I mean.
<br>- There are huge balance problems.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: I would prefer to repeat Warcraft 3 or the whole 2 campaigns of SC2 than to play this game.
<br>I&apos;m not a Blizzard fan boy. This game is just absolutely inferior. So inferior that even SC1 does some things better than this game, like the unit individuality for example.
<br>I know i&apos;m comparing masterpieces with attempts at something, but I have to be honest.
<br>
<br>Why I give it a 6 and not a 0:
<br>- Good voice acting (albeit repetitive during gameplay, and not on a funny interesting way as in other RTS)
<br>- Decent cutscenes
<br>- Interesting race - goo. Unfortunately they don&apos;t play as fun as they sound.
<br>- New lore - I guess it is refreshing to see something new. And I think that&apos;s why so many nice reviews are coming. People want something new and they reinforce others to create new RTS by giving decent reviews.
<br>- Nice graphics. Yes this game is sharp, but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s beautiful or interesting. It will push your hardware, and that can be satisfying for some. As I said, I would prefer to play an older looking game with more flavor.
<br>
<br>Beware, this game is not worth 50&#x20AC; and it&apos;s not something you can patch. It might have content, but it&apos;s nonetheless lacking the feeling that make great games shine.

<br>Cutscenes rock, super high polish... Controls for units are superb... I friggin love the GOO! I&apos;ve never seen that kind of stuff done in an RTS, or any other game, before!
<br>
<br>One thing that I REALLY appreciate is, there seems to be SO many &quot;Early Access&quot; titles out there it&apos;s sickening. Kudos to these devs for making a COMPLETE GAME! That alone is pretty refreshing.
<br>

<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t played as the third faction yet, but I&apos;ve played several matches as both humans and the goo, and can say that both factions have a very original design, keeping you thinking outside the box.  The humans run on gridlines and instead of making multiple bases, they keep expanding their walls and turret influence until they control the map. Everything connects.  The Goo use mobile bases and everything splits from the host Goo.  The Beta seem pretty standard in terms of a vanilla race.
<br>
<br>The music has that same poppy flare to it that C&amp;C had, and the OST is included, which is awesome. In short, you can really feel a solid mix of both C&amp;C and Starcraft 2 in the game.  The HUD is also very unique in that it teaches you to macro the moment you pick up the game, which is VERY nice for picking up the game quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grey-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=4921148">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Wasted.
<br>Frustrating mission design, poor scripting, telegraphed storyline which always tells you what happens in the next 3 missions in advance because it so obvious. Bugs and issues with region locks and match making. No replays or observer mode either. It really a game in westwood tradition with all the problems their products had and much less of the charm of their CnC series. And when I say frustrating mission design I mean it. Step over the wrong invisible line with a scout unit and experience the wrath of gigantic forces teleported right into attack positions. If you are lucky you will not run into those triggers, but it seems like most players are not lucky and simply have to learn those triggers by try and error. Not really enjoyable to constantly reloading because of those issues. My tip: Save a lot, even when you feel like your dominating.
<br>
<br>Still if you like RTS games you should still get it, but if you are new to the genre grab some of the old classics like Supreme Commander 1 and its stand-alone expansions Forged Alliance or the Starcraft Series. You will enjoy those quite a lot more.
<br>
<br>To be honest the last few missions of grey goo were a torture for me and the most unfun gaming experience I ever had in a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grey-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=4944863">Expand</a></span>

Having said that, it really is a solid game imo, but it&apos;s not yet perfect in any way tbh. What i do hope is that there will be further plans to expand this game into a long going franchise, such as C&amp;C from way back in the days.. With these expansions they might also try to include more worlds, and races, and it wouldn&apos;t hurt if they could make the pace slightly faster ect. I like the game so far, but there are some things that i think they could have done better, yet they most likely will improve the game after the following months.. Also mods are most likely to implement cool new additions, and there&apos;s an editor which we all can use ourselves, if we have the know how ect.. Anyway, to conclude i would rate it 8.5/10 but because i can&apos;t give half a point, i will just make it an even *9/10. Not perfect, but i do believe things will surely be improved later on.. Well done, Petroglyph!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grey-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=5063758">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve been playing RTS games since the original Warcraft, where one my fondest RTS memories was being at my friend&apos;s house for a sleepover where we linked two computers with a serial cable and played multiplayer games. We&apos;d let our peons and peasants hack at trees all night and wake up to spend all our vast resources of gold and lumber for an epic battle.
<br>
<br>So whether you are a long time fan of the genre, or are new to it, add this gem to the collection! There is something about great RTS battles that you take with you for life. So goo get it! Oh, and Grey Goo actually has LAN support so you can go have a sleepover, LAN it up and RTS on!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grey-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=4927194">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve played a significant amount of multiplayer and must say the factions play very, very different.  I suspect the ones that see any similarities only played for a few minutes.
<br>
<br>There is no &quot;golden build&quot; and every game can be different.  Many different viable strategies with super units coming into play sometimes.  Every game is fun and different.
<br>
<br>There are of course a few rough edges (I want observers personally) but I&apos;m confident in the developer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grey-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=4929768">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Visuals:Mixed</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I dont understand why this game gets so much praise from everyone.I think it is because of the fact that  RTS as a genre is pretty much dead.Youll get 1-2 maybe 3 good games a year if you ignore Blizzards SC franchise.For my review i will only talk about the SP part because im not interested in MP and if im interested in a game then it have to be better than &quot;Grey Goo&quot;.
<br>
<br>-Visuals:Mixed bag i think.The CGIs are amazing!!!They are on par with Blizzards CGIs, maybe better.During the mission briefing the aliens look so damn real, great work.The in-game visuals are ok, not great.If you think this is great think about what is possible in the modern time of PC gaming.This looks great to many people because like i said:RTS is pretty much dead and even if there is a good game it will not look like a AAA title.SC for example looks good because of the artstyle, the engine itself is out of date if you consider what is possible.And here is my problem with grey goo:I dont like the art style.I dont like how the units look in game, i dont like how the maps look.Thats personal preference of course.The UI is ok, after some minutes youll find everything quickly.
<br>
<br>-Sound:Music?Is there music?If so i missed it.From that perspective not really great.Think about C+C.You know many themes from the C+C today if you plyayed some games from the franchise.In grey goo i didnt even remeber now.Voiceacting is ok.I watched some videos on YT with the english voiceover, its ok.The german voiceover is not that great(i played with german voiceover).I miss sounds from the enviroment that suckz me into the world of Grey goo.Not really great work, im sorry.
<br>
<br>-Gameplay:As many here stated Grey Goo trys to return to the roots of the RTS genre.Basebuilding is simliar to C+C back then.But they limit it with the way the factions build the buildings.I dont like that.The Beta for example build some kind of hubs and you need to dock smaller buildings on the hubs, much like the Terrans in SC do it with some buildings.There are some balanceissus i think with defenseve buildings.The Units die very quickly and you need to build things constantly.This is like old school RTS, C+C style.The AI trys to rush you.I didnt liked it back in the times and i certanily didnt like it now.Its unreative and boring as hell.I have to fight my way through a boring map with some **** secondary objectives that gives me a very slight advantage, but no real story or drama.THats a problem for me in the game, i dont care about anything.The units die too quckly, there is no XP progression or something that keeps the gameplay fresh and interesting.It comes down to &quot;pump out units, secure you base, move, and do the same again&quot;.This is basicly Command and Conquer with a modern engine.Im sorry, we are in 2015!!!I want more then that!Unit progression maybe or something i can do between missions.Chosse different paths in a missiontree that have consequences.Nothing of that is in the game.There are not many units in the game and nothing fancy too i think.When i say that i think about chronotanks from C+C or units that warp around the map like some SC units.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:Like i said, i dont understand why the game gets so much thumps up.Its ok if you want that old school gameplay, if not dont buy this game.I had no technical issues, which is good, maybe the loadingtimes are too long, thats it.For me that game is a solid 5 because of that which makes it an &quot;okayisch&quot; game.I would recommend this so C+C but not to gamers that like micro management heavy games or games with a lot of depth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grey-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=5040436">Expand</a></span>

The game on higher difficulty is just a mind numbing tug of war with endless streams of units clashing until one of the players comes out on top with the most successful tech switches, due to the fact that you can automate all production. The campaign suffers from the same problem and the story and characters are an absolute snoozefest (cool cutscenes though). It also runs like a dog on my 4790k, 16g ram, 780 Ti. When maxed, it all starts well at 144 FPS, but even with just 2 players, as soon as they hit around the 150 supply mark, the frame rate just plummets to below 40 (even while there&apos;s no active battle going on, the number of units on the map seems to break it anyway) and the choppy scrolling is migraine inducing. It doesn&apos;t even look that good, the colors look washed out and I can&apos;t even tell if the unit models are detailed because they are small and look virtually identical to each other on each faction. I think, hands down, Forged Alliance looks better than this game and it&apos;s a billion computer-years old. Completely inexcusable. Multiplayer is whatever, noone will be playing this in 6 months. 46 euros for this? No,no,no...and no. Wait till it&apos;s 10$ and it might be worth it just so you can listen to Frank Klepacki&apos;s cool pumping soundtrack.
<br>
<br>Edit: It&apos;s worth noting that the final campaign mission is pretty much impossible on anything other than easy difficulty, and even then it&apos;s hard, because your enemies spawn epic units OFF MAP, so any damage you do early on to production facilities or harassment is completely pointless. I actually managed to eliminate the humans (even completed the optional objective to do so), and ten minutes later while I was trying to fight off the Beta, the game notified me that an Alpha epic unit is caressing my face back home, which came from nowhere. Tedious as hell campaign that ends on the cheapest note possible. Well done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grey-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=4926535">Expand</a></span>

No real micro managing, which I like. It&apos;s not too difficult to learn, but I&apos;m still learning more as I go. There&apos;s a lot of like, hidden features, which can really turn the tides. Not your average RTS, more like, the new standard. imho.</span>

If you try to play straight up, build an army and beat the other army while growing your base, you&apos;ll probably lose. I won and lost, but ultimately a silly game poorly designed where gimmick &quot;strategies&quot; rule supreme.

<br>also bland, single player and multiplayer.</span>

<br>Distinct lack of units, only one resource type to gather, and the factions - only one of which is distinct from the other two are bland.

<br>Most of the units are similar I find.  The humans all have super slow units, the good are also super slow and spend most of the game playing hide and go seek while you build your powerful unit that can&apos;t attack in front of itself and is weaker than the other units. The beta seem to be the only race with a proper kit, they have fast units, good rounded hp and can attack and move at the same time.

<br>It just felt unpolished and more aggravating than fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grey-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=5556547">Expand</a></span>

Through the years I have seen how RTS games have evolved from those early titles to the new generation RTS games people are playing these days (e.g. SC2, Sins of a Solar Empire, CIV6, etc.). I have to say that Grey Goo started really good, with a seemingly well-rounded story and 3 (and later on 4) different factions to play.
<br>All boded for a very good game. Instead we have a title that copies a lot (think about base construction or what how many similarities there are between the different factions and the ones from other recent games....mmmh, fishy) from other titles, has an under-developed story-line and offers a very basic multiplayer.
<br>This all makes me think two things:
<br>- Grey Goo could have been a very good title if it was released 5 years ago or so.
<br>- The game could have used some more depth (story, faction diversity, gameplay), but probably developers had to rush it into stores. Whether it is true or not, it certainly feels that way after playing a few ours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grey-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=6785829">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Antes de nada, decir que esta critica solo va dirigida al modo campa&#xF1;a, ya que soy uno de esos raros que compra estos juegos por la historia.
<br>
<br>Esta entrega planta una semilla, que sin ser muy original (me ha recordado much&#xED;simo a SC), deja un solido camino para posibles secuelas. Sin desvelar gran cosa de la historia, he de decir que me esperaba una presentaci&#xF3;n algo m&#xE1;s potente, se llega a conocer muy poco de cada raza. Parece que, m&#xE1;s que contar algo, coge un acontecimiento y corta de una manera muy brusca entre dos puntos sin ning&#xFA;n sentido. Puede ser, por otra parte, que sea porque ha pesar de poder contar algo interesante, me ha parecido que la tratan m&#xE1;s como un tutorial para aprender a manejar cada raza.
<br>
<br>En cuanto a la variedad, aunque hay much&#xED;sima diferencia entre los GOO y las especies &quot;Humanoides&quot; (porque, no nos enga&#xF1;emos, los Beta tienen de alienigena lo que yo de multimillonario), pero entre los Humanos y los Beta, los cambios son tan ligeros que se pueden contar con los dedos de una mano. Eso si, el plato fuerte, los GOO, son deliciosamente curiosos, pero me hubiera gustado algo mas de dificultad a la hora de manejarlos, he incluso, alg&#xFA;n cambio mas bruto a la hora de conseguir recursos con ellos. Ademas, me parecen pocas especies para las posibilidades que tienen, &#xA1;pueden crear infinidad de criaturas de distinta &#xED;ndole, maldita sea!
<br>
<br>T&#xE9;cnicamente es espectacular, sus cinem&#xE1;ticas est&#xE1;n muy logradas, los gr&#xE1;ficos son magn&#xED;ficos, y a pesar de tener muchas unidades en pantalla, no he notado tirones de FPS.
<br>
<br>No es una obra maestra, pero tampoco es un mal juego, y dentro de un genero donde tenemos suerte si sale un juego de este estilo cada a&#xF1;o, y donde el rey lleva tanto tiempo sin ser destronado (por falta de competencia), se agradecen nuevos t&#xED;tulos.
