                                        <span>Great game! Seems like childish quest but has far more deep meaning, charming plot and ambience. Unfortunately it has one minigame that should never existed (I mean the last fight), but still the ending is totally stunning for a quest. In this respect, Deponia and Deponia 2 were not so good, though TNOTR misses some great humor from it.</span>

<br>
<br>This game is a point-and-click puzzle/story game  as are most of their games  where you play as a young boy and a mysterious rabbit whose fates are intertwined.  But first, you play as the boy and frankly he is annoying.
<br>
<br>I died after the second puzzle because I was looking for a fruit and apparently the game incorrectly identifies acorns as a fruit and rose hips as something other than a fruit.  The first puzzle required that you find a stick in a forest.  One stick in a forest.  And that was after passing by three other objects that would have worked just as well.  Then you have to use that stick to remove a bush.  That makes no sense.
<br>
<br>In terms of pros, the game is visually interesting and clearly they spent a lot of time with the art director making it just right.
<br>
<br>In terms of cons, the gameplay is slow and very specific to the point of failure.  I found the premise of the first puzzle to be absurd and the solution to the second puzzle to be incorrect.  The interface is awful.  You quest book gives you information you shouldn&apos;t know and fails to record information you desperately need.  The hotspots are humongous and never go away; you&apos;re going to be listening to the same poorly-done voice acting cue over and over and over again.
<br>
<br>This title lacks the good game design elements you would expect for such an easy genre and fails to do any of it&apos;s homework making it  for me  a pass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-night-of-the-rabbit/user-reviews?user_review_id=3207755">Expand</a></span>

It also does have this little extra which make games something more than just games. It is related to the fact that it is hard to tell whether the game happens realy and in which reality it does really happen, etc. It does have something from Alice in Wonderland or Coraline movie. And I love that &quot;something&quot;. The only downside are some of the puzzles, which don&apos;t seem to make much sense, though there is very little of them. The minigame could be a bit better and most of all, the supposed hint system provides no real hints whatsoever. But these are just details.

Nevertheless, there are always diamonds in the rough that we have to find all by ourselves. &#x201C;The Night of the Rabbit&#x201D; is one of these rare and precious stories.
<br>
<br>Firstly, the part &#x201C;in the rough&#x201D; refers to solving puzzles with such a long chain of logic premises. You must pick many objects and sometimes turn to brute force method. For those who do not appreciate these twisting actions, my advice is to do not hesitate to open the game guide or walk-through when you are stuck.
<br>
<br>Turning to the bright sides of the game, I was so pleased to see a consequent plot with a highly detailed universe of the set of different worlds. The core idea of realms connected by tree roots is absolutely beautiful and romantic! As well as that, the picturesque drawing scenes and characters are stunning. Each of them has his own goal and personality. At certain moments you even feel how tears come to your eyes! And, at the same time the game characters show and teach you to keep your faith even at darkest times.
<br>
<br>Finally, the soundtrack was awesome too! It was nice to listen to different variations of the same magic melody that were played on viola, accordion, flute and other interesting instruments. I really appreciate when people are strive to create something compelling and outstanding. That is why the computer games is considered to be a work of art.
<br>
<br>Personally, I think it is a brilliant adventure game. I was truly astonished by this sincere storytelling and charming characters. Magic drawings and music are unforgettable! Anyone who likes instructive and kind fairy tales and good drawing will really enjoy playing this game.
