I eventually quit, however, because as you get into the very high levels of the game, there are only two ways to play: sub more accounts and play multiple characters simultaneously to build up your team and conquer dungons; or scrape the barrel and hope your friends have characters that are complementary and can help you finish the requisite dungeon. Since many rare drops are directly related to the zone and monster you fight your options for dropping good loot are limited. Having said that, there&apos;s more than one way to get yourself the gear you want. You can try to play the market or level some professions and then charge people for your services. However, all of this is slow, tedious, and plodding labour, ultimately deterring from the fun of the experience. My recommendation: play until you get tired of the grind then find something else :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dofus/user-reviews?user_review_id=2549869">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s a lot to like about this game - the only implementation of strategy RPG mechanics in an online game, challenging PvP due to this, charming graphics, a multitude of careers, mounts and pets and 12 distinct classes. The average rating comes from the unnecessarily cruel amount of grinding you have to do for levelling up, advancing careers and dropping items to craft equipment. That, and the developers seem a little confused and haven&apos;t expanded the game for a year.

                                        <span>Great little game! Quaint, small download, easy to play, great social element, great battle mechanics. Gets tedious eventually but then all games do. Combat, to me, feels light years better than the vast majority of MMOs, as does the natural feel of the social element. Class! :)</span>

<br>
<br>I have to say it&apos;s a really addicting game with very good social features and that&apos;s what differences the game from others. The game itself takes way to long and in order to get more powerful you&apos;ll have to start playing with simultaneous accs, wich is boring, because you loose that social touch the game has.
<br>
<br>If you have enough time to play it (I mean like 5 hours free a day minimun) you should at least give it a try, but if not don&apos;t bother at all, you&apos;ll get bored and end up quiting and playing a more rewarding game, because it will take you a couple of hours to get done only one dungeon, when in any other MMORPG you can do a lot of things in two hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dofus/user-reviews?user_review_id=5500880">Expand</a></span>
