This game nails horror, and by horror I don&apos;t mean jump scares. I mean creepy and unsettling environments and events that are occurring throughout this game.
<br>This game starts out slow for the first 15 to 20 minutes than quickly starts to ramp up. You start in Maine USA as a different character than you played in the first Black Mirror game. While in certain areas this game feels like a step up from the original, it feels like this game is almost setting up the scene for the 3rd in the series in terms of story, characters, and setting. Graphically there is a big different between this game and the original. There is also the option to hold the space bar and see all the hot spots or areas you can click on the screen to interact with. You can toggle this on and off any time during the game in the options menu which can help you out instead of being forced to look up a walk through online which is a nice touch compared to the first game.
<br>Make sure to play the first Black Mirror game or you will be lost when the game starts referring back to the events and characters that take place in the first game. This is a good game but I feel like it doesn&apos;t have quite the same type of dark and gloomy environments that I loved in the first game. The Black Mirror series is worth your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/black-mirror-ii-reigning-evil/user-reviews?user_review_id=3296230">Expand</a></span>

<br>Apart from that, the game is a dull version of things done so many times before, with a weaker than average interface (hot spots you can barely see, unnecessary clicks, a button overlapping the game world...,) bad voice acting, and so on.
<br>
<br>Frankly, if you can bear the protagonist, you might get your dull fix out of it, but I&apos;d rather replay Shadow of the Comet or such from the early 90s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/black-mirror-ii-reigning-evil/user-reviews?user_review_id=6655633">Expand</a></span>
