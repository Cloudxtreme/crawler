However, there are a number of bugs and gameplay issues that can hinder the overall experience, and although I enjoyed the game, I can&apos;t help but to feel some disappointment in the final execution. To put it short, if you want a casual experience just to enjoy the story, this game might not be for you.
<br>
<br>Now to break everything down. Dex takes place in a really cool cyberpunk setting. As a fan of sci-fi and cyberpunk, I think the game captures the cyberpunk feel perfectly. The art is truly superb. The character sprites look great, and the environments are very colourful and beautifully done. Dex proves to us that you don&apos;t need a game to be all grey and brown to show a gritty setting. This is complemented by a lovely musical score. Music playing in every area was fitting to the setting and memorable. Most notable one is the main theme, which has become one of my personal favourite main themes in gaming.
<br>
<br>The story has its good points, but overall it&apos;s a pretty standard cyberpunk story. Hackers, gangsters, evil corporations, secret experiments - all this stuff makes an appearance. To me most issues come in the gameplay.
<br>
<br>The gameplay consists of a mix of stealth, combat, and hacking in cyberspace. Hand-to-hand combat was really well done. The fighting was smooth and each impact was felt. By contrast, gun combat was done rather badly. For some odd reason, it&apos;s not possible to walk with your gun out. If you want to shoot, you have to stand absolutely still. If you make so much as a step, the character automatically holsters the gun. This can become extremely annoying during fight sequences, where each second can mean a difference between shooting the enemy and them taking off half of your healthbar.
<br>
<br>The platforming aspects such as jumping and climbing were fine enough, although at times it was very hard to tell where you could jump onto and where you couldn&apos;t. At times it seemed like you could jump onto something, only to see your character fall through it and to their death. And because you cannot save when you want, this becomes annoying.
<br>
<br>Hacking... ugh. I just didn&apos;t like it at all. It was nothing more than a basic pixel shooter and your sole job is to click, click, and click. What annoyed me more than the hacking mini-game itself is the fact how often the game forced you to play it. Most times there were no alternatives. Play the darn hacking mini-game or make no progress. I signed up for a cyberpunk sidescroller, not a cyberspace pixel shooter.
<br>
<br>The game also had some balance issues. Like for example, there was no permanent cheap/free heal anywhere in the city. So if you were out of money and low on health, there&apos;s probably nothing you can do about it. Likewise, there was never any place where I could grind for money and/or experience.
<br>
<br>The game had plenty of sidequests. Most were pretty interesting and I attempted to solve each one of them. However, quite a few of them I never managed to solve due to things not being clear. Maybe I just needed to do more exploration or simply to get lucky, but I think a bit more direction would&apos;ve been nice. What was nice though is how some main quests and sidequests had nice multi-branched paths to accomplishing your goal and at times you had to make important decisions.
<br>
<br>Finally to round it off, the ending was extremely disappointing and felt rushed. Without giving any spoilers, the game forces you to do your &quot;final fight&quot; in cyberspace. That&apos;s right. Hacking again. And the ending cutscene lasted a total of 10 seconds. I really wish there was more to the ending than what I&apos;ve experienced.
<br>
<br>I know this is a tonne of criticism, but I am glad to have played through this game, and it is a promising game. It&apos;s just, it&apos;s currently riddled with too many small issues, which pile up and hinder the enjoyment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dex/user-reviews?user_review_id=5328913">Expand</a></span>

<br>However, on release day there were a few bugs, but they released a 30MB+ patch within 24 hours to address some.  The main ones I experienced were some minor controller issues (text scrolling sometimes required a mouse in menus) and an end game saving issue.

<br>Aside from those two bugs, I really loved the game.  A lot.  Especially if you&apos;re a Gibson or Stephenson fan, buy this game.  Some of the best $20 I&apos;ve ever spent, and I can&apos;t wait to see what these guys do in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dex/user-reviews?user_review_id=5238950">Expand</a></span>

You take the role of a seemingly average blue-haired, latent street samurai, Dex, living in the urban mess known as Harbor Prime. Like many a cyberpunk protagonist, she suddenly finds herself wanted by armed thugs working for mysterious corpro-government interests. Fleeing for her life into the streets, Dex meets an assortment of colorful characters and must acquire various gear and eventually cyborg implants to stay alive and ahead of the game. Flexible character progression allows for melee, gunfighting, hacking, persuasion and cyborg enhancements like super-jumps and cloaking.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s got passable music, excellent spritework, pretty good voicework, and notably, a free DLC that adds extremely useful alternate outfits, most notably the Armagear Invisisuit, which allows you to stay cloaked indefinately provided you do not reveal yourself by attacking or interacting with objects.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s lots of people to talk to and items to find, and in true RPG fashion, most NPCs have problems that they need some peppy go-getting hero to deal with. Doing most, or all of these, as well as finding Memory Chip items, can see you reaching the level cap before the game&apos;s end, or at least being able to max out two of the six-tier skill trees: Endurance, Melee, Ranged and Hacking. The rest of the skills have only two tiers: Charisma, Augmented Reality and Barter. Endurance in particular is valuable because investing in it not only increases your health but also the maximum number of cybermods you can install, all of which have more dramatic effects then your skills.
<br>
<br>The persuasion mechanic is more opaque then in other games, even Deus Ex; Human Revolution, and there&apos;s really no way to know which dialogue option will result in success. I recommend saving before conversations- and pretty much anything else, as manual saving is an option. Dex is a game with a lot of choices to make, both in character progression and in dialogue, and three possible endings. My advice is to ask people a lot of questions, and explore the environment thorughly, especially once you aquire the high-jump legs. Often times you can discover new things and get more info, and money, out of a lot of the NPCs. And, as always, save, save, save, and if you don&apos;t like how things turn out, reload and try again. In this manner, and with some helpful guides, I was able to obtain all of Dex&apos;s achievements, one of the few games in which I could do so. But that says as much about the game as it does about me- Most of Dex&apos;s achievements are very obtainable if you know what you&apos;re doing. None of them are particularly tedious or grindy. It makes the entire experience feel better put together. Dex is one of the better cyberpunk games out there, maybe one of the better action RPGs, and it is well worth your time to check out the demo and see for yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dex/user-reviews?user_review_id=7315654">Expand</a></span>

<br>The quest were interesting, some of the even suprising. The effect of choices somehow limited, but still you saw some of them. The gameplay entertaining, however fighting part would benefit with a little more variance. The lack of melee weapons was also visible. Character building elements also interesting. And the series of twists at the end - it gave me an impression of reading a well writen cyberpunk novel.
<br>Combine this with watching Blade Runner, Jonny Mnemonic, Minority Report, and reading some of Gibson novels - you have a very atmospheric trip into cyberpunk!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dex/user-reviews?user_review_id=7543103">Expand</a></span>
