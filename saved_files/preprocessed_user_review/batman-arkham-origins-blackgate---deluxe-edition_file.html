<br>+ Blackgate is a welcome addition to the Arkham family. It has a distinctively different game play than its big brothers. Detective work takes over melee fights and this change really suits the handheld gaming environment.
<br>+ It&#x2019;s different, and we must emphasize this. Batman isn&#x2019;t called the world&#x2019;s greatest detective for his gadgets and toys. In this game he relies on his problem solving skills. The game includes some great puzzles that can&#x2019;t be found in other Arkham games.
<br>+ Blackgate isn&#x2019;t a PC game on the first place. It&#x2019;s a handheld game with an existing PC port. Based on this it&#x2019;s looks absolutely great on the PC too. It gets close to early PS3/Xbox360 titles. Batman and the main characters are detailed. There are some blurry textures here and there, but the overall visual experience is very good.
<br>+ With good game design come good boss fights. There is only a handful in the game, but those are very distinguishable. You have to approach every one of them differently. In one you have to rely on you gadgets, but in the next may be locked in a melee fight.
<br>
<br>~ 6 hours. That long will take to beat the campaign of the game. It isn&#x2019;t much, but given the handheld nature of the game we can&#x2019;t hold grudges against it.
<br>~ While most of the bosses of the game are fun in one way or another, the final challenge can be extremely annoying due to the flaws in the combat mechanics. It&#x2019;s very challenging, but not necessarily in a good way. The fight is great but it&#x2019;s spoiled by the mechanics.
<br>~ The game does include some collectibles in forms of upgrades or clues for crimes, but one can&#x2019;t help but wonder, that in a game which focuses on the detective aspect of Batman, they could&#x2019;ve done much more. Maybe characters that could be unlocked by solving crimes or finding clues to extend the length of the game? It&#x2019;s a missed opportunity.
<br>
<br>- Arkham games are immediately recognized by their excellent audios and music tracks. Blackgate is a disappointment in that regard. There aren&#x2019;t any original tracks to speak of and the sounds feel weak and uninspiring.
<br>- It&#x2019;s a real disappointment that in such a high profile game, devs can&#x2019;t get  some basic things get done. Lip movement is missing in the game. This very minor detail is very disheartening about a 2014 game.
<br>- The greatest thing in all Arkham games is the superb fighting mechanics that allow everybody to be The Batman. It&#x2019;s fast, responsive, powerful and most of all satisfying. Not in Blackgate. Simply this pseudo 2D environment and the unresponsive combat don&#x2019;t support this type of gameplay. Those sections when you have to clear a room &#x2013; great sections in the big brothers &#x2013; are awful. The only good thing about the combat is that the devs might have recognized it&#x2019;s flaws and they don&#x2019;t force the gamer into too many fighting scenarios.
<br>- Forget pre-rendered or in-game cutscenes. Boring hand drawn still images represent the game&#x2019;s cutscenes that introduce most of the important story elements.
<br>
<br>Time to beat: 6 hours
<br>Replay Value: 2/5
<br>In one word: Detective
<br>On P&#x2019;n&#x2019;C scale: Fun Time
<br>Must give points: 72

<br>Gameplay some time gets too linear
<br>not free flow combat like previous arkham games
<br>conclusion is:
<br>All the way this game is satisfying treat for Batman fans</span>
