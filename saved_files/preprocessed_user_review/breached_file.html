The gameplay basically boils down to running around huge levels, avoiding glowing magnetic spheres (which are mostly static) with the goal to collect 3 objects and return to extraction point. Some of the objects are pretty hard to find, and you may spend a lot of time looking for them. If you collide with a magnetic sphere, you lose that mission, you can&apos;t reload, and if you fail a few such missions and ultimately don&apos;t collect enough stuff by in-game day 10 (after about 10-15 missions) you lose the game and will have to start over from day one. The whole thing is glued together by some pretty atmospheric narrative which I didn&apos;t understand but got sort of a &quot;feeling&quot; for.
<br>
<br>Good:
<br>- nice music
<br>- nice art, also there are some interesting blurring effects when you turn while moving fast or when you are near a magnetic sphere
<br>
<br>So-So:
<br>- the story is immersive but somewhat lacks explanations which may be good or bad depending on how you like to play. I only kind of understood what needs to be done in the game at in-game day 3 or so
<br>
<br>Bad:
<br>- it takes too much time to move around, and the camera (the point of view) is so close to the ground that you ultimately feel like an ant climbing mountains. With such poor overview of the level, finding anything becomes unnecessary difficult. I found myself sometimes rotating the mouse wheel to zoom out like one would do in World of Warcraft, to get a better view of the surroundings. A control system like in WoW would work much better here, e.g. right-mouse to rotate, left mouse to rotate camera around the running character, and WASD to move/strafe with possibly also QE to rotate.
<br>- no strafe! And it&apos;s also not possible to just look around. Instead you will turn and start moving in that directing due to intertia - that&apos;s pretty annoying.
<br>- the game overall is pretty shallow. Both the missions and the primitive mechanics in the lab which connect them. So, after I lost my first playthrough with 100% fuel and 70% repairs I felt no desire to retry.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: it&apos;s good for a few bucks if you are into artistic experiences or enjoy solving mazes (and I mean simply mazes, not mazes with shooting, stealth, puzzles etc.).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/breached/user-reviews?user_review_id=6564059">Expand</a></span>
