It obviously has parralels to the Commandos series of games and they&apos;ve been a heavy influence, but it&apos;s also more accessible and open than they were. Contrary to a couple of bad reviews there is always more than one path available, and in fact there are challenges set for each mission which will encourage you to try different methods to collect all the badges. Stealth obviously plays a key part, but if you do get spotted you&apos;re able to run away and hide, so it&apos;s quite accessible for those who are new to the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun/user-reviews?user_review_id=6864796">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve read some extemely positive reviews before buying it, but I didn&apos;t think it would have been *so* good.
<br>It&apos;s well written, has great characters (I kinda hope to see the cast in some other game) and great dialogues. The setting is feudal Japan, it&apos;s quite original, fresh and always interesting.
<br>The stealth mechanics are near perfect, and the character abilities are amazing and all of them have a place in the game and are fun to use.
<br>The mission design is great, with every mission adding something new and fresh to keep the interest up. On the challenge level, it&apos;s always pretty hard but never frustrating.
<br>The UI is an absolute gem: simple, stilish, practical. Doesn&apos;t end up in the way of the gameplay. Only issues with it it&apos;s that the &quot;shadow mode&quot; is not a great addition. A tactical pause would have been way better.
<br>Only real flaw is that sometimes, as someone else pointed out, the game is more of a puzzle game than a stealth game: you have to guess the exact way the developers thought to pass some zones, and that can be annoying and may deter from the sense of freedom. Even a split second more (I&apos;m not exagerating) would have made a huge (positive) difference in certain situations.
<br>
<br>To sum it up: Amazing game that deserves all the praise it&apos;s getting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun/user-reviews?user_review_id=7384612">Expand</a></span>

The artwork is fantastic, the characters are very well made and the story interesting.It really makes you feel like a samurai or ninja or whatever.The stages are exceptionally well made and in the hardest setting(that i played it as i like to be challenged by games)it really demands a very thoughtful approach in order to beat it.Also the stages are varied some are at night, other at snow and this completely change the gameplay and the tactics you have to use to proceed.
<br>
<br>The guys who said that there is only one way to finish the stages, they are either trolls, or played the game for 5 minutes.If there is one game that you can approach with a lot of ways this is it.You can kill everyone, you can kill noone, you can go to an objective from various different routes, each character has his own skills, one has traps, another has shuriken for mid distance kills, another has a gun for long range kills, the ways you can beat every stage are endless.Carefully planning your next move and executing it successfully is very very satisfying.The game is quite lengthy also. Highly recommended to anyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun/user-reviews?user_review_id=6993830">Expand</a></span>

<br>It captures the essence of graet gameplay of  Commandos, while being original at the same time. Core gameplay is similar, with few heroes having special abilities, enemies cones of sight  and slow, steady movement and silent killing. But what makes this game great and even better than its predecessor is theme (feudal Japan), characters (diverse and very likable) and mission structure (game is hard in a good way, Commandos had some tiny-easy missions, while this one has 13 big complex over 1 hour long missions which is fantastic).
<br>It also features SHadow mode, which is essentially programming your characters to activate their abilities at the same time, and while it isnt as complex as it could be (lets say game Door kockers) its still very handy in some situations.
<br>And Japanese voice acting is fantastic.
<br>One of best games ive played lately and one of my favourite games ever. Buy it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun/user-reviews?user_review_id=6977772">Expand</a></span>

<br>- The badges for each mission lead you to play a mission in many different ways, you wouldn&apos;t feel bored to repeat the same mission again.
<br>- Each mission and map is very unique, you will find village, temple, military camp, market, castle, none of the maps bear close resembrance to each other, In Commandos and Desperaos, you could still find some maps that are very similar and it is like doing the same thing all over again.
<br>- Musics are good, voice-acting is superb, some of the dialogues are very funny.
<br>- The game is very stable to run, no crash to desktop, no game-breaking glitch that would anger the players.
<br>
<br>Bad:
<br>- Not really a big problem, but I feel that Hayato, the ninja is pretty redundant beside his throw rock skill, I could use Yuki to do everything Hayato could do and she is much more useful with her pipe and trap combo.  When both of them are present in a mission, I would only use Hayato to assist Yuki and Yuki would get everything done. Mugen is a great company to have, he is the only character that can kill Samurai easily, can carry two bodies at once and can run quickly while doing that and kill a patrol squad in seconds. Sniper and the spy are both useful in their own way, but Hayato is pretty forgettable.
<br>- At times, the angle of the camera could completely mess up your plan because an area you thought you could easily click on is actually blocked by some overlay objects and you actually have to rotate the camera before you can click on that area.
<br>- Throwing bodies off the ledge(except when using Mugen) is one of the most painful task to perform, after getting 9/9 badges on all maps, I still could not be certain how to throw the body precisely to the place I want 100% of the time.
<br>- Speedruns are frustrating to complete if you are a save-loader like me :( because time is still added after you load a game. This is actually a also pros because it forces you to develop your patience and improve your skills.
<br>- A building is just another place to hide your characters, there is no interior inside.
<br>
<br>All in all, this is a very polished and well-made game. fans of Commandos or Desperados shouldn&apos;t miss this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun/user-reviews?user_review_id=7224907">Expand</a></span>

<br>Commandos are back and they&apos;re pretty tough in their Japanese Edo-style guise.

<br>Real review:
<br>For an Indie dev what they&apos;ve achieved here is amazing easily matching up to many AAA game in terms of graphics.
<br>I find myself at a loss for words when it comes to describing many aspects of this game. The only thing I could say at it&apos;s fault is despite the open nature of many of the maps the main way the developers go about increasing difficulty is by reducing the amount of ways through an area or by requiring the player to have ever tighter and tighter control over the characters in order to pass through some extremely narrow situations. The latter is expected as is the former but the combination of the two can lead to a frustrating loop of quicksave/quickload as you try to get something &quot;just right&quot;.
<br>
<br>That brings me to the quality of life things this game does to make sure that whenever you do screw up, it really is your fault. There are too many to list here but my personal favorite was the save timer which tells you how long it&apos;s been since you last saved. And it helps, oh boy it helps.
<br>
<br>As for the rest of the game all I can really say is good. Soundtrack good, voice talent good, all around just *good*. Considering how ambitious a project this is for an indie studio it really requires some praise.
<br>
<br>This game is for a hardcore audience. The mechanics the devs made guarantee that ever mission is unique and remarkably self aware. Just be warned that the difficulty while well curved, starts off high and by then end reaches some nigh ridiculous levels. The games replayability remains high but when the aforementioned level design starts to creep in that replayability starts to wane.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun/user-reviews?user_review_id=6910739">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The only reason I&apos;m not giving it 10/10 is because I don&apos;t like the voice acting, it&apos;s not immersive, it&apos;s actually cringeworthy, you&apos;re basically a Japanese assassin but you talk like a cartoon version of a japanese person and they&apos;re constantly telling jokes while murdering people, makes no sense. I&apos;d have much preferred them to be less &quot;funny&quot; and more authentic.
<br>
<br>So perfect game and I take off just one point because disliking the cartoony characters is a personal dislike.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun/user-reviews?user_review_id=6869525">Expand</a></span>

<br>Level design is crucial for this kind of game and here everything is just right. Challenging but never unfair. You always know what you did wrong if a situation is getting out of hand. Level design is diverse with a lot of nice new ideas in each mission. And there are many solutions and ways for each objective, especially in the later missions.
<br>
<br>The characters are interesting. You quickly care for them and their skills are well balanced.
<br>
<br>The badge system is quite unique in it&apos;s depth and offers more than one might think after first noticing it. It is adding lots of replay value after the first play through.
<br>
<br>Mouse/keyboard AND gamepad controls need a bit getting used to but are very well designed and give you the choice to handle your group of ninjas in two very different ways.
<br>
<br>There are 3 difficulty levels that influence health points and the time that you can stay inside an enemy&apos;s field of view until being detected</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun/user-reviews?user_review_id=6861016">Expand</a></span>

Hide the corpses in bushes, climb roofs and create complicated distraction schemes.
<br>
<br>Enemy AI is superb. Which is very important in game like this. I haven&apos;t noticed any bugs. Cutscenes between mission aren&apos;t jawdropping, as they use just the in-game engine without zooming in. But they do the job. Missions themselves are very long, difficult (without being unfair) and challenging. There&apos;s countless solutions to every situation (especially in later levels where all characters are usable), CONTRARY to what some some negative reviews here state. Those players were just too stupid or impatient to find the tactical options and depth of Shadow Tactics. This is NOT an easy game or for the impatient, prepare to get challenged and to die a lot. There is a Demo in Steam, which contains full 1st mission and introduces 3 of the 5 characters (Ninja, Samurai, Marksman). Go check it out! It&apos;s rather easy though, because with 5 characters it&apos;s a lot less obvious what you should/can do in given situation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun/user-reviews?user_review_id=6863520">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Graphics, sound, gameplay, AI, all are superb.  This game can be extremely challenging and extremely forgiving at once with a nearly instant quick save function that it tracks to give you true playtime after each stage, which I can happily say is embarrassing (I want to kill all of the bad guys).  One even created a Time Paradox, which reminded me of the best parts of gaming a generation ago.

<br>Story is nothing to write home about, but it really doesn&apos;t matter.
<br>Also, It&apos;s a pity there are no interiors like in Commandos2.
<br>Finally, Shadow Mode is functional, but I feel it&apos;s a bit simplified and could have been worked better.
<br>To sum it up, a valid game. Feel free to add +1 to my score if you are a Commandos/Desperado aficionado.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun/user-reviews?user_review_id=6862112">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Story is neat, nothing groundbreaking or new, but it sets the settings and tone for the game, and for this, it works quite well. Also, it wont win any &quot;Most Realistic Graphics&quot;-awards.
<br>Why 10/10 then?
<br>Because the gameplay is phenomenal! It may have a bug here or there and sometimes you need to reload a previous save (of which you should have a lot!) because of a bugged NPC, but thats okay - the gameplay makes easily up for it.
<br>For me, this is a Game of the Year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun/user-reviews?user_review_id=6859345">Expand</a></span>

Shadow Tactics Blades of the Shogun is everything a Commandos or Desperadoos fan could have asked for. It successfully captures the essence which made those games great &amp; drastically improves it in every way. The levels are gorgeous to look at, the music &amp; the voice over specially the Japanese one is really captivating &amp; immersive which goes with the edo settings perfectly.
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise it will test your skill &amp; patience. Every level requires you to be really observant of the enemy&apos;s behavior as the A.I is smart &amp; merciless. Coming up with genius of a plan for minutes to deal with a situation but ultimately seeing it unfolding as an utter failure when you execute the plan is one of the most agonizing moments in the game. It will happen, it will happen quite regularly but as soon as your carefully constructed plan meets the shiny colored perfection, that agony will turn into irresistible pleasure.
<br>
<br>Also, the five playable characters, each of them with their own distinctive skillset are full of joys to play with. Their expressive banters during a mission will undoubtedly draw your attention towards them. The characters don&apos;t feel mundane but rather actually feel alive where you start to really care for them.
<br>
<br>In the end, people will always regard Shadow Tactics as the spiritual successor of Commandos/Desperados but in my opinion this game is more than that &amp; it successfully stands on its own. Its interestingly creative world &amp; the charming persona of the protagonists certainly says so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun/user-reviews?user_review_id=6861886">Expand</a></span>

If you are looking for an actual RTS you won&apos;t find it in this game.
<br>You control up to 5 characters, each with different skills to complete your task often needing them to work in tandem (wich there is a gamemechanic in place for) and it&apos;s a blast to pull off a well planned move with multiple characters at once.
<br>The missions are pretty interesting and they fit around the story that enfolds. I personally saw the plottwist in the story comming a mile away but it still didn&apos;t take away anything from the overall experience since the most enjoyment will be from the actual gameplay.
<br>I have spent 31h to complete one playthrough, and there definately is replayability either to get badges (challenges) by doing/not doing certain actions during missions or by simply trying out a another route to your target.
<br>This game is a prime example of a cheap indie games just stomping on most AAA titles in terms of value, fun and gameplay.
<br>I can&apos;t really say anything negative about the title based on what it sells for and what it is intended to be. The few quirks I had with it like missing hotkeys  for selecting all characters at once, some ui annoyances  etc have all been patched in as of writing this review.
<br>So I can&apos;t recommend this enough if you are into tactics games. I&apos;m glad atleast one game in this genre is made and I really hope for more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun/user-reviews?user_review_id=6893762">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s: Here&apos;s an area filled with guards: Good luck trying to unravel it.
<br>
<br>Not for me. I got frustrated on the third map, because there&apos;s this giant corridor FILLED with guards and no apparant ways to get one of my characters through it. After 5 different attempts I gave up and refunded. Also, the map is bugged. Guards kept seeing my &quot;footprints&quot; in the bushes after exiting the wagon, thus putting my into an unwinnable situation.
<br>
<br>Never again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun/user-reviews?user_review_id=6860248">Expand</a></span>

The variability is pathetic - you will use only 2-3 tactics during the whole game. The game design is so annoying after Commandos - moreover you simply don&apos;t have any rescue ways on every maps - they are too small, the abilities are too limited, and AI will spawn the platoon of mobs without any chance for you. Pressing f8 is not the best experience you must have.
<br>&quot;Tactics&quot;? Not funny - all your interactions are limited, even more, than in Xcom series - if you want tactics - play wargames or good strategies, not that linear parody to good game. Too boring, too familiar and too overrated.
<br>The story also is ordinary fills with cliches.
