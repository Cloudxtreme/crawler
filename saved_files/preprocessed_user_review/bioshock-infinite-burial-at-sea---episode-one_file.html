On the positive it pulls strings of narrative from all three games into the dialogue and environment ensuring any fan feels catered to. However the game is somewhat gutted; you can no longer lock pick or hack and a half hearted effort to implement skylines does really work. The game has an interesting story and builds well however the episode is over in 2 hours of game play. I would have given this a 7/10 if the game had a few more hours but felt really cheated at just how short this episode was.

<br>
<br>Sure, it&apos;s pleasant to see Rapture again, especially an alive Rapture. But that&apos;s only for a few minutes, then we&apos;re back to the original Bioshock experience, only with the updated weapons, graphics, and metaphysical shenanigans of Infinite.
<br>
<br>That DLC is shockingly short and is unnecessarily hard due to a perpetual lack of ammo and eve. It was fine in the original Bioshock as most ennemies engaged in melee combat anyway, but here, ennemies have guns and take cover, while you&apos;re stuck with your empty clip waiting for Elizabeth to throw you something so you can keep fighting.
<br>
<br>The attempt to elaborate on the voluntarily confusing ending of Infinite is fine, but it will quickly become old if it&apos;s not done better in the rest of this mini-series.
<br>
<br>In the end, if you&apos;re a fan of the Bioshock series and are ok with a poor return on investment just to get a fix, then you&apos;re up for a mildly satisfactory exprience. Otherwise, Burial at sea can be skipped without to much regret.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3788321">Expand</a></span>

I explored every ounce of each map, got every piece of currency, looted every body, heard every npc&apos;s banter, collected all the audiologs, collected all the upgrade potions, unlocked all (but one) locks, and the game lasted me about an hour and forty five minutes.
<br>
<br>The story was pretty weak. The greatest thing Burial At Sea had going was it&#x2019;s prettiness and awesome prologue rapture scenery.
<br>
<br>The ending undoes everything you&#x2019;ve done in the main story. The explanation some people suggest where &#x201C;this comstock didn&#x2019;t become the prophet so he wasn&#x2019;t stopped by booker&#x2019;s sacrifice&#x201D; is fairly nonsensical.
<br>
<br>You&#x2019;re forgetting that the burial at sea comstock still created Columbia and the only way for him to have done that is to have been made evil/mentally damaged by being baptized. (according to what the main game lead you to believe) No baptizm  no columbia  no interdimensional machine; this is what we know from the main game. Also, if he already had a daughter, he had no clear reason to need to steal another daughter. Of course we could make up reasons, but that isn&#x2019;t our job. It&#x2019;s the writers job to at least allude to motives and character&#x2019;s nature throughout the story not to leave it all up to us to invent on our own. I&#x2019;d just write my own book then. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, I love some creative freedom, mystery, or room for imagination, but this is too much at once without any justification or explanation.
<br>
<br>Overall, if the writer&#x2019;s let us know that one comstock still exists and still made columbia and still made the interdimensional machine, then NOTHING was solved from the first game. The baptism had NOTHING to do with booker becoming comstock and there are INFINITE other comstocks that made columbia which lead to the interdimensional machine which leads to him stealing elizabeth. Suddenly you start to not care about individual comstocks because, lo, they don&apos;t matter. Elizabeth knew this in the main game which is why she had the plan to stop all comstocks instead of killing just one. Suddenly she has forgotten this and has resorted to brutally murdering other comstocks in an inefficient and roundabout manner? You don&#x2019;t even have to think that hard to feel this way; confused and meaningless is exactly how the story immediately presents itself to you.
<br>
<br>Not worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3789421">Expand</a></span>

<br>The reason why there is no life in this review is because this DLC can be considered dead and makes me feel dead just talking about it.

The game is still great quality as the original but I feel like alot of the impact here is lost on someone who has not played the first Bioshock. There&apos;s alot of nostalgic moments in the game but there&apos;s also a feeling here like they worked too hard to try and bring back those fond memories of the first Bioshock and didn&apos;t let the game grow into something on its own. Everything else is the same here as in Infinite, from the gunplay to the vigors, it&apos;s all here. People will complain about the length all they want when this is about how long DLC is nowadays. But I&apos;m very glad this is an episode one because, while it was obviously going to end on a cliffhanger, the motivations for a couple of the characters was nowhere near explained. At any rate, people who liked Infinite will like this DLC pack. It won&apos;t convert anyone who didn&apos;t like Infinite but it does it&apos;s job nonetheless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3778095">Expand</a></span>

The story reveals absolutely nothing in the context of the main game&apos;s story which was a bit of a let down, but i&apos;m hoping that part 2 will tie it together nicely.  Also as others have said it is very, very short.  Took me 1 and a half hours and that was even with searching every corner of the map for items.  I really would&apos;ve preferred DLC in Columbia again.  This DLC is not &quot;bad&quot; by any means it&apos;s just so shockingly average for the game that it is supporting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3769787">Expand</a></span>

<br>For those fans of the franchise who DIDN&apos;T spend several days after finishing Bioshock Infinite grumbling about how stupid the storyline/ending were, add +1 to the rating. For those who did  it&apos;s more of the same here. The only thing that saves this being a complete waste is getting to see Rapture before the New Year&apos;s revolt. It&apos;s beautifully imagined, though you don&apos;t get to see any of your old haunts. It&apos;s also very tightly controlled, and you&apos;ll find Elizabeth hounding you repeatedly to follow the storyline if you try to explore.
<br>
<br>Unless you play it on 1999 difficulty, it won&apos;t take more than a couple of hours in which time you&apos;ll find yourself wondering why the developers decided to make ammunition so hard to come by and impossible to stay stocked (2 clip max) while also giving players tons of money so they could keep stopping to buy more from a vending machine. You&apos;ll also find numerous small rooms where you will be trapped when Elizabeth follows you in and then can&apos;t be moved so you can exit, and  when you do complete the very obvious &quot;finale,&quot; you&apos;ll be treated to an ending pretty much as silly as the core game  maybe worse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3770311">Expand</a></span>

So many people love the story but I find it convoluted, especially if you consider that the backstory is only accessible by listening to audio &quot;voxophone&quot; playback devices, amounting essentially to a voice-over that you must search out and then suspend gameplay (and, of course, disbelief). No hope of understanding the story without doing so and even still that story is very convoluted.
<br>
<br>More of the same here. The world is still very beautiful and that is still the biggest selling point. Fans of BI will not need convincing but if you were on the border about BI you will probably be disappointed with Burial at Sea 1 and could pass or wait until the price falls low enough to justify the disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3788840">Expand</a></span>

They promise Rapture and try to force Columbia into it, using the same items as before just calling SALTS  Eve now. There are no real splicers in the game, the splicers bear few deformities, some not at all, and rather than appearing as people who were once members of the city, they are scavengers. The entire style of Rapture is absolutely ruined and is not the same in the least bit. It defies canon also mostly taking place in a sunken part of the city, but for a piece of the city to be sunk it would be cut off from Arcadia providing all of the oxygen, therefore would not be functioning. Sander Cohen is brought back and his style is ruined and for some odd reason has something to do with Little Sisters when he would never be in charge of such a thing. Suchong makes several audio diaries of which do not talk about plasmids, so that is out of place for his recordings. They over advertise a new Plasmid that is actually just like a level 3 Frost Blast. A new weapon is added, the Radar Range which is ripped from early designs of the Xcom game and is a bit overpowered. The tears and such are back which should have no place in Rapture, Andrew Ryan and Frank Fontaine do not even have any recordings, there is barely anything of the two in the game, and for some odd reason there are sky hooks in Rapture and even a few rails. Rapture is dead, they have just killed the once beautiful city of Andrew Ryan.  If you liked Bioshock Infinite get it, if you actually loved real Bioshock and loved Rapture you will be furious.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3799939">Expand</a></span>

The storyline is interesting, and sets itself up with a cliffhanger for the next episode.  Aaaaand... that&apos;s about it, really.  Depending on how you play, Burial at Sea can be extremely short, maybe 2 hours if you&apos;re more action oriented.  I explored every area (particularly the beginning segment) and got around 3.  That ties in to the next minus, the price.  $15 is way too much to buy this thing piecemeal.  I don&apos;t know whether it&apos;s an encouragement to buy the season pass or not, but if you plan on getting any of the DLC, the season pass is the way to go.  I myself got the season pass when it was 50% off a while ago.  Bottom line, what you&apos;re getting is quite good, but you&apos;re not exactly getting a lot for your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3773636">Expand</a></span>

<br>And unfortunately game is very buggy. I had to reload checkpoints twice as I encountered never-ending spinning doors. And sometimes Elizabeth was disappearing and only unlocking doors and safes was bringing her magically back.
<br>But like in every Bioshock game  this I must say  there&apos;s a killer ending. But if you will like it or not is up to you. It was a bomb, but I&apos;m not sure I like it like I liked Infinite&apos;s one.
<br>But it&apos;s surely one of the highest points of this DLC. 7 from me because in Poland we had Season Pass for free if you bought the game at premiere. But I wouldn&apos;t pay for it 15$ that&apos;s for sure. It&apos;s still too short and buggy considering the time they were producing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3766966">Expand</a></span>

Combat is more focused this time around and seeing Rapture at its peak of prosperity makes this game already worth the price of admission. I only wish it was a bit more different in its mechanics.

<br>
<br>The game itself plays like Bioshock 1 and Infinite combined, with indeed variable combat options, plus the return of the weapon wheel, as well as not having way too much ammo at once. The story is fantastic, expanding upon the story of both Infinite and the first Bioshock, and the environments are incredibly enticing. I loved this DLC and was definitely worth the purchase. The high amount of quality put into this makes it an excellent piece to add to your collection.
<br>
<br>But the length will take you about 3 hours max (this is assuming you do and explore EVERYTHING) despite all that, making it a questionable use of 15 dollars when you look at DLC campaigns for some games, say Borderlands 2 that last for quite a long time for just the main quests.
<br>
<br>In the end, give it a try, but consider getting the season pass so you can save some money when you inevitably buy both episodes, and you can get Clash in the Clouds, which I thought was relatively fun, and the season pass will only net you $20.
<br>
<br>Note about the season pass, however: Get it after beating the main story of Infinite, as they give you 5 upgrades and 4 armor pieces soon into the game that you can&apos;t skip (as far as I know) and I feel that ruins the challenge a bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3805281">Expand</a></span>

The download size was around 5.4 gigs on the pc version, which means its all new assets and tons of detail into the environment.
<br>
<br>It was really awesome going back to rapture and the story of this DLC makes sense as you progress through it and have beaten Infinite previously. Not going to mention any story spoilers, but the audio-logs and ending of this dlc was well worth the price of 10 dollars (assuming you get the season pass).
<br>
<br>Best addition to the gameplay is that you can carry all your weapons again and they introduce one new weapon that uses microwaves to explode enemies. Its really satisfying killing off enemies with this and the random vigor combinations with this weapon to pull off crazy chains of death. Along with that new weapon they added a new Plasmid (Vigor) that freezes enemies and can shatter them if you do enough damage.
<br>
<br>Another cool addition to the gameplay is the addition to allow you to stealth kill enemies. I know infinite had some of it, but since these are closed off corridors and not as open as Columbia it allows for trap setting and stealth melee attacking. You can even run away after killing an enemy and loose the aggro of them and can sneak up again if you follow their pathing. I found myself doing this a lot at the start of the DLC and it definitely added some survivability in 1999 mode when I had very limited ammo.
<br>
<br>To the length of this dlc, it took me around 3-4 hours to beat it on 1999 mode (including restarting at checkpoints), which if you played non-1999 mode it would be around 3 hours or so to complete it. This completely overshadows the common &#x201C;90 minuets&#x201D; of gameplay that critics are trying to pass off. It feels to me that they just spammed through the game without exploring at all and actually enjoying the experience.
<br>
<br>This also doesn&apos;t even include a second playthrough that I will do for an achievement mop up that will make the dlc even more longer (but I know some people don&apos;t enjoy that, so it wasn&apos;t included as the overall time).
<br>
<br>This is the only season pass I have bought for a game and it has been well worth it so far. If you exclude the clash in the clouds (Some people don&#x2019;t enjoy it and it isn&#x2019;t story based), it ends up costing 10 dollars for the first and second episode. I felt like I got more than my 10 dollars worth for this episode and since this is supposed to be the shorter of the two story dlc&apos;s, the season pass is an actual good investment (as opposed to most season passes these days &gt;_&gt;).
<br>
<br>Buy, Pass or Rent:
<br>An absolute buy

<br>Okay if you rush from one objective to the next the game can last even less than an hour but if you give it the time it deserves, the time to admire its fantastic world design, somptuous work on lighting and tones, the time to hunt for its many secrets (the DLC offering more optional content than ever before) then you cannot be disappointed.
<br>
<br>The joy of Bioshock (and System Shock) has always been in the exploration of its world and the appreciation of the exceptional craft displayed in all its constituent parts. In that regard, Burial at Sea delivers a fantastic audiovisual experience with a level of polish rarely seen in the industry, especially for a DLC.
<br>
<br>If you like Bioshock, you absolutely have to play this game. You may find it&apos;s too short but only because it&apos;s so good that you&apos;ll want it to last forever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3769140">Expand</a></span>

<br>Length is also an issue at $15 US but as part of the $20 Season Pass I have no problem justifying the cost.

Most narratives are composed of straight-forward elements. &#x201C;This and this happens and period&#x201D;. In stories like Bioshock Infinite, however, that&#x2019;s not the case. These indirectly tell you &#x201C;No, go look for clues and figure it out! Think outside the box!&#x201D; And when you figure it all out, you&#x2019;re mind blown. Still, you know there are details that escape you, and there&#x2019;s great curiosity triggered because of this, making you go back to find out exactly what happened. When we do this, it means the narrative has done its job. We&apos;ve been engaged to it.
<br>
<br>Having finished Burial at Sea, I&#x2019;m glad to say I felt emotionally engaged to the very end. Rapture&#x2019;s return is quite a solid one and it looks as beautiful as ever. Gameplay mechanics are pretty much the same as it were in Infinite, so if you enjoyed them there you will enjoy them here. This being Rapture, however, brings back that horror theme Bioshock 1 had. Ammunition is way more scarce and Eve is not so abundant. This proves even more challenging if played in 1999 mode, which should be the mode to play this in as it&apos;s the best way to get the most out of this DLC. It&#x2019;s the very last minutes of this journey that, just as it was in Infinite, make the journey even more worthwhile. Just have in mind that by the end that curiosity and amazement Infinite caused upon you, if any, will be triggered once more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3770497">Expand</a></span>

While this mechanic is welcome, I wasn&apos;t even aware of it until I looked up weapon switching online--overall the controls to switch between plasmids and weapons is finicky and poorly explained.
<br>
<br>In terms of aesthetics and story, this offers quite a bit to Bioshock fans. It offers less character development than I was hoping for in terms of Fontaine and Ryan, but the dynamic between Booker and Elizabeth is built upon in some ways. The environments are gorgeous, and the best part of this game for me was exploring Rapture in all its glory. However, these exploratory moments do emphasize the complete lack of interaction between the player and any NPC besides Elizabeth. It&apos;s starting to become really frustrating and even immersion breaking that all of the NPCs stand still repeating one or two lines, and don&apos;t even acknowledge Booker. I hope this is improved on in the future--since combat is not Bioshock&apos;s strongest point, it would make sense to allow for more world building and character development with NPCs other than Elizabeth.
<br>
<br>Overall I would recommend this to those who have played both Levine Bioshock games. If you haven&apos;t played these then you will still probably enjoy it, but the already steep price tag probably won&apos;t be worthwhile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3774072">Expand</a></span>

<br>DLC is quiet harder than the game itself, you are suffering from a lack of ammo and large amount of damage from splicers. And its a good thing!
<br>So I will give this DLC 10/10, because I got everything I was expecting from this DLC. And I`m looking forward to Episode 2!

<br>
<br>I think the shortness of the game is a bit overblown. I suppose it depends what difficulty setting  I played it in 1999 Mode my first run through (so accounting for being rusty) and was quite thorough making sure I got all the gear/plasmids/etc. That being said, I clocked in at just about 5 hours.
<br>
<br>I view the price as $10 since anyone who is a big Bioshock fan is generally planning on getting both story DLC&apos;s. In light of that price, I thought the amount of game was good  a bit light, but when I compare it to many other games that are $60 and have ~$12 of campaign play and are vastly inferior story-wise and gameplay-wise I don&apos;t find this pricing particularly offensive.
<br>
<br>Putting that issue aside, the game feels very much a continuation of Bioshock Infinite  and certainly has more in common with it than Bioshock 1 or 2. This is very much Infinite in Rapture, as opposed to Bioshock 1 with some Infinite mechanics. I personally actually liked Infinite more than the predecessors, thus I&apos;m thrilled with that being the case, but I could see how some people hoping for something else might be disappointed.
<br>
<br>As for story, it&apos;s typical Bioshock quality, thoughtful  and not without a surprise or two despite us as the audience being conditioned to expect these surprises throughout. It serves as a worthy continuation of what took place in the main game, though simply by the nature of the issues risen in the original the plot requires you to take Irrational at their word that the universe makes sense (spend too much time overthinking it and it is sure to show some holes).
<br>
<br>In summation, the game is not perfect, but it&apos;s every bit as good as Infinite if not for the relative brevity. As noted, it&apos;s not as bad as some would have you believe if you&apos;re playing at a high difficulty and being thorough, but you could certainly speed through it in an hour and a half if you so desired. Then again, I&apos;ve seen people play a game like Dark Souls in 5 hours whereas it took me almost 50 on my first play through, so it really is a matter of how you wish to play the game and how thorough you are. For these really well crafted games I take my time and enjoy the sights and sounds and would suggest you do too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3767485">Expand</a></span>

It`s really short, and storytelling doesn`t tell much(there are more Rapture-talking and less Infinite), but it brings the things what was great in both Rapture and Columbia. It feels more like side story, but that`s why ending is so pretty nice. Normaly I could give 8/10 but in hater time, I must give 9  For BS fans, it`s a clear choice.</span>

<br>
<br>The only complaint about this DLC is its length.  Depending on your play style, you can finish it in about an hour or upwards of six hours.
<br>
<br>For my 5.5 hour run on Hard, I rate this at 9.1.  But, if I had run through it in an hour my first time, I would have rated it at 8.3.
<br>
<br>Details on review score---
<br>Entertainment: 10
<br>It was a lot of fun seeing Rapture in its prime.  The combat was more challenging than in BSI&apos;s main campaign.
<br>
<br>Graphics: 9
<br>Great detail.  I&apos;m not sure if this or BSI&apos;s main campaign has the best looking UE3 content, because they&apos;re both very good.
<br>
<br>Sound: 9
<br>Although the ambient sounds were good, the music was what made this stand out.
<br>
<br>Design and Gameplay: 9
<br>Combat was much more challenging than in Infinite&apos;s main campaign.  Although you still have a sky-hook, it&apos;s not as over powered as it was in the campaign, because the enemies seem to be able to hit you while jumping now.  Also, players can carry all of the weapons they pick up now instead of the two-weapon limit in the main campaign via the new Weapon Wheel.
<br>
<br>Game Length: 2-8
<br>As I said above, if you explore and sneak, this content will take you a fairly long time.  If you follow the arrow and charge through quickly, it&apos;ll be over in an hour or two.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3772700">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Part One of Burial At Sea sees players reincarnate Booker Dewitt, the protagonist from the original game, though now there are some notable differences to the events and locales around him.
<br>For starters, players are returned to Rapture, the sprawling city at the bottom of the ocean living under the illusion of individualism constructed by Andrew Ryan, an important figure form the original Bioshock (2007).
<br>
<br>It is New Years Eve of 1959, and Booker is approached by a mysterious, yet familiar girl named Elizabeth. She offers you a job to which Booker feels he has some moral obligation to accept. For the sake of the mystery that Irrational Games has once again masterly crafted, I will not go into any further plot details, just know that if you were a fan of the story of Bioshock: Infinite, you will not be disappointed.
<br>
<br>The tone of Burial at Sea is a happy medium between the original Bioshock and the sense of confinement that you felt while exploring the underwater city  and also Infinite&apos;s strong opening act, and the sense of exploration you got form wandering the streets of Colombia for the first time. Keep in mind, this is before the inevitable collapse of Rapture&apos;s already fragile society which is essentially built on the idea of &quot;every man for himself&quot;, and the populated corridors and malls of Rapture are both vivid and alive.
<br>This however creates a similar problem than the one present in Infinite. The introduction sequences of both games that just see you exploring and perhaps solving a little puzzle here and there, are almost how I wished the entire game would play out, however, combat is still present. The gunplay and use of powers not the games strong suit but it is the playable, as most fight sequences are rewarded with more well written dialogue pieces and story driven elements.
<br>
<br>Though the game is rather short, it&apos;s forgivable due to the incredible quality and attention to detail that the Bioshock series is synonymous with. If you truly want to dive deep into the environment and find all the collectibles, this may take around 3 hours to complete, having said that, this is but one part of a DLC, so length isn&apos;t that relative.
<br>
<br>The first part of Burial at Sea is a fantastic start to the story driven DLC of Bioshock: Infinite, and I await the conclusion with much anticipation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3770423">Expand</a></span>

I played on 1999 difficulty, and the scarcity of supplies caused this episode to play out in a very deliberate, considered way, more of a survival horror than the original Bioshock. It took me nearly 4 hours to complete, but I did scavenge every nook and cranny, collecting all the audio logs and savoring every detail. And there are details aplenty. Rapture redone in the Infinite engine, especially in its pre-fall splendor, is sumptuous, a stylish, smoke-filled environment that&apos;s full of character. The NPCs here are more interesting  instead of everyone having one attitude  &quot;all hail the Prophet!&quot;  the denizens of Ryan&apos;s world, by philosophy, are more diverse, more intellectually keen.
<br>
<br>Aside from scarcity and difficulty, the combat doesn&apos;t turn over any new stones. The new Old Man Winter vigor is a rehash of the freezing plasmid in the original Bioshock, and the weapons play as slight modifications to their Infinite counterparts. While introducing sky rails to Rapture seems a little forced, they do add Infinite&apos;s important dimension and thrilling immediacy to the gameplay.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve heard the twist ending is ineffective because you know a twist is coming  I&apos;d disagree on that front as well. The content of that twist is still very surprising, even if you&apos;ve braced yourself for it. It&apos;s a well thought out narrative with a few gaps that need bridging, but there&apos;s no reason not to believe they&apos;ll be covered in Episode 2, which I eagerly await.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3769743">Expand</a></span>

In my opinion the gameplay of Burial at sea is better then that of the main game. a perfect combination of Bioshock Infinite and Original Bioshock. While it is short it is well worth it for 15$.</span>

I played on 1999 mode and with a lot of exploration it took me nearly 4 hours to complete, so I can&apos;t understand the length complaints.
<br>
<br>Returning to Rapture in its prime is glorious, although the space you can explore is fairly small, it&apos;s packed with details and conversations to overhear, giving life to what we imagined the underwater city to really be like.
<br>
<br>Some familiar faces make a spectacular return, as well as plenty of nods and references to both the original game and Infinite. The story itself is partly a continuation of Infinite and another part &apos;here&apos;s what happened in an alternate universe&apos;, but doesn&apos;t fall into the pointless side story territory as it provides some extra insight to characters that could apply anywhere. The ending, like Infinite, throws a lot at you at once and is pretty mind bending as always.
<br>
<br>The vigors(now plasmids again), weapons, skylines and controls from Infinite are mixed with the scarce resources and the limited/more vocal enemies from the original to provide a refreshing spin on combat, that was actually incredibly challenging on 1999 mode. Stealth is once again possible, and planning your attacks in advance will give you a huge advantage.
<br>
<br>Music and voice acting was brilliant as always.
<br>
<br>My only gripes with it are:
<br>- Too short. Even though I&apos;m amazed at how much Irrational managed to build in such a short time, it left me wishing that this was a full game and not a DLC. I would of loved to explore more of pre-fall Rapture, and the new weapon introduced barely had enough time to be used.
<br>- Integrating things from Columbia into Rapture wasn&apos;t that smooth. They have explanations, but they&apos;re brief and at points, not even needed. They try to bridge connections between the 2 game worlds that aren&apos;t really needed. Also, there were a few crucial models and assets that were re-used, which is strange considering how much of this has been made from scratch.
<br>
<br>Overall, a fantastic experience and a much welcomed addition to the BioShock series that I would recommend to any fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3768649">Expand</a></span>

It took me only 3 hours to beat but considering that it was 3 hours back in rapture and with some of my favorite video game characters, it was an incredibly entertaining 3 hours. It ties in very well with the base game (Bioshock Infinite) so if you liked Infinite as much as i did than this DLC is a must buy!</span>

<br>Yo ya me lo he terminado en PC, casi 4 horas muy intensas (me gusta ir pausado y fijandome en todos los detalles que pueda, consegu&#xED; 16/17 diarios de sonido, para daros una idea).
<br>En estilo visual genial, como ya nos tienen acostumbrados, y la recreaci&#xF3;n de Rapture no puede ser mejor.
<br>La jugabilidad ha mejorado lo justo para que, personalmente, parezca algo fresca respecto a los anteriores (nuevos equipos, 1 arma nueva, y un pl&#xE1;smido nuevo), y la IA de los enemigos tambi&#xE9;n la he notado mucho mejor.
<br>La historia... no quiero spoilearla, pero GUAU, no podr&#xED;a ser de otra manera teniendo a Ken Levine de guionista.
<br>En fin, excelente dlc para una obra maestra de juego.
<br>Y a los que os quej&#xE1;is tanto de la duraci&#xF3;n... Digamos que 3 horas de la primera parte, m&#xE1;s 3 de la segunda, son 6 horas(sin contar el tiempo que juegues al modo horda) 20  (season pass).
<br>6 horas son m&#xE1;s de la mitad, me atrever&#xED;a a decir 3/4 de la duraci&#xF3;n del Bioshock Infinite, el cual ten&#xED;a un precio en su fecha de salida de 60 &#x20AC;.
<br>Yo no s&#xE9; d&#xF3;nde veis el problema, en serio.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3767135">Expand</a></span>

The story is bland and shoved under the rug most of the time. The few bits you do get to explore Rapture are great yet short lived. The combat is much harder to compensate for the lack of story. Medium is pretty challenging and the diversity of combat that the splicers bring is sporadic and chaotic.

It is a total joy to be in rapture again and the storyline plays brilliantly with the quantum possibilities hinted at at the end of infinite.

Of cause there is the economic site of the matter, this DLC cost about Dollar 14,95 which isn&apos;t cheap BUT with no doubt worth it! i recommend buying the season pass for not many Dollars more that the single DLC. The season pass will include all of the already released DLC for Bioshock: Infinite, as well as Burial at sea part 1 AND Burial at sea part 2. SO if you are a fan of the original bioshock (or Bioshock 2) you will with no doubt have a very satisfying, joyful and nostalgic time playing this DLC. a lot of you guys might think 10 is a little too much for this DLC, but on thing is sure, 8,5 (current user score) is not even close to being enough for Burial at sea </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3770000">Expand</a></span>

<br>Anyway, let&apos;s get Back to BaS: the intro is great. Full of references to the first game, really bring you back. Except the &quot;new power&quot; of the Big Daddy seen in the biginnin, the &quot;drill trick&quot;, I don&apos;t see the point of adding that for no reason since it wasn&apos;t never show before.
<br>The story is very nice and easy to follow, sadly some trama plot are pretty trivial and you can totally see them coming. Except the final, that was damn surprising.
<br>The gameplay was reinvented as they promised: you can bring more then 2 weapons, they also added a &quot;new&quot; plasmid from the first game and a new weapon really nice, but that you won&apos;t use that for longer.
<br>The music, as usually, is great. Really fits for every situation.
<br>Sadly is very short, I&apos;ve finished it with 160 minutes, exploring a lot, but rushing a bit in the end. Still, is all worth it.
<br>
<br>In the end, is a dlc that I suggest you to get with the Season Pass, so you will be sure to get the Episode 2 immedialy after the release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3797857">Expand</a></span>

<br>The return to Rapture is everything that can be expected and much more.  While shorter than some full games (clocking at ~3hrs for full achievement completion), the focus is far more on the elements of the story, a deeply twisted tale that turns all you thought you knew from the moment the game started into sudden realization at the cliffhanger ending.  But, as there are two parts to this, the full impact of this ending is meant to be picked up later.
<br>
<br>While ammunition can sometimes be lacking, Elizabeth&apos;s AI seems less helpful (makes sense with the ending, now that I think about it), which can create troubling situations alleviated only in part by the addition of a weapon wheel in place of Infinite&apos;s two-weapon limit.  This was perhaps the only portion of the game that caused frustration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3789359">Expand</a></span>

Are people out there seriously expecting another full game? This should be rated for what it is, an expansion to Bioshock Infinite. The game promised to bring us back to rapture with the Infinite gameplay and ties to both games and that is exactly what it does. It finds a way in the story to connect both worlds and act as a sequel to Infinite and a prelude to Bioshock. Am I the only one who realizes how genius irrational must be to pull that off? They also find a way for us to have the familiar Bioshock enemies (splicers) for us to fight even before the fall of rapture. The fact that you are fighting splicers and not humans who care for their self preservation this time makes the game a bit more challenging too. And plus, it ends with a phenomenal boss fight I should have seen coming a mile away but didn&#x2019;t. It comes with a  great story ending too.
<br>Pretty much, as a fan to both Bioshock infinite and Bioshock, this is everything you could ever want in a short DLC. The developers delivered in every way possible and no true fan can really be upset about anything.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3798831">Expand</a></span>

The good part is that you get to go back to Rapture and see it before it became the hell hole it was in Bioshock 1. There are also new weapons and a new vigor as well. I liked how they interweave the two worlds of Columbia and Rapture so that was nice. Other than that there really isn&apos;t much to say. The $15 asking price is absolutely ridiculous. If you&apos;re a fan of Infinite then you should get this, but wait for a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=4492448">Expand</a></span>

Overall if you are a big fan of bioshock i would say get it but if you are on the fence about it i would say consider not buying it. You really won&apos;t be missing that much story wise. A lot of the DLC involved very little actual story and it had a lot of moments where you had to fetch an item or close certain grates. Overall not bad but certainly not great either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3941865">Expand</a></span>

Taken on their own, Episode 1 is a less enjoyable game and the intellectual part of it is simply... ODD.  Never the less the story is well told as always, unnerving and heady.  Game play is good but not as well done as Infinite or Episode 2 which uses a different formula.  This is a great beginning to a send off of one of my favorite companies.  Thankfully Ken Levine will continue with a smaller studio producing his strong narrative games, it just won&apos;t be the big group that formed Irrational.
<br>
<br>TL;DNR: 8: Great first episode to close out Irrational games work on Bioshock, but Episode 2 is superior.  Regardless, if you enjoyed Bioshock and Infinite (for Bioshock 2 please) then you owe it to yourself to bring the series and the story full circle.  Great graphics, smooth game play, intense combat and a decent story although a bit more out there than usual even for Bioshock.
<br>
<br>Technology/engine: 7: Uses Unreal 3 and is well optimized but nothing really innovative on this end.
<br>
<br>AI: 7: A little brain dead in places and incapable of missing at other times but on a whole its a challenge and keeps you on your toes.
<br>
<br>Graphics: 9: Great sets, good character models with plenty of variation, good particle effects and gun play is as sound as ever.
<br>
<br>Sound: 8: Slight distance to source issues (voices sometimes sound like they are on top of you but are really across the room) but otherwise great ambient  sound that provide immersion.  The audio logs are just great and remain a highlight of the series.
<br>
<br>Soundtrack: 10: Superb period appropriate music that does not overwhelm and only enhances the experience and immersion.
<br>
<br>Voice acting: 10: Really top notch voice acting.  Some of the best in gaming.
<br>
<br>Crafting: N/A
<br>
<br>Customization: Not really able to rate on this as its very minimal.
<br>
<br>Game play systems: 8: Well done but loses some of the fun of the use of sky hooks.  In fact they are used so little it appears that they were included just to keep a thread of connection between the two worlds - Columbia and Rapture.
<br>
<br>Controls: 8: In some ways its of little burdensome but overall works well.  The controls in Episode 2 are streamlined and improved when compared to Episode 1.
<br>
<br>Story: 10: Fantastic writing with great dialogue - everything from the short short films to cut scenes and off the cuff comments.  Ken Levine is a masterful story teller.

<br>A short but enjoyable journey back to Rapture.
<br>As we go back to Rapture with Infinite&apos;s gameplay it was hard to adjust. This is the same problem I had with Bioshock 2&apos;s Minerva&apos;s Den. Infinite stablished itself as first person shooter where you were unstopable and overpowered. Now, (still in the hands of Booker) the game decides to make AI extremely tough. It was really hard to adapt to this new cautious and strategic gameplay. Now story. The story is good but nothing mindblowing like BioShock: Infinite. The music is very good and the sounds of Rapture and from the original BioShock, are great. The game looks great as well, better than Infinite I believe.
<br>In the end Burial at Sea episode 1 is a short but good DLC that (hopefully) is a set up for an incredible episode 2.
<br>Average Score: 7.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=4094707">Expand</a></span>

The  story and scenery were the only really big changes in addition of Bioshock, other then that the controls are still just as smooth and fun as Infinite. The scenery is amazing, I love seeing Rapture in its glory days, where Andrew Ryan beats Fontain. The story is the only place that really causes problems for me. While it is still the good classic writing that we&apos;ve come to expect from Irrational Games, its way to short. There is more that could have been added to this dlc to make it more worth the money.  For this reason alone the game three points. But its still a very good game and makes me excited for part 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3930935">Expand</a></span>

You get to see people living their lives normally and see what the city was like when it was alive. Sadly, this was the high amount. On the plus side, the actual gameplay element of the game felt much like Bioshock, but maybe a little too much, following the slightly tiresome &quot;here&apos;s an obstacle now find the plasmid to get past it&quot; structure. And then we see what starts as a highly promising expansion hit its worst flaw, its really disappointing length. Barely two and a half hours long, Burial at Sea feels like nothing more than an extended demo  and hardly justifying the &#xA3;12 price tag (if you get it BUY THE SEASON PASS). Not to mention a few glaring omissions of classic Bioshock 1 elements, like character customization (Burial at Sea doesn&apos;t even have Infinite&apos;s Infusions system) and encounters with Big Daddies; we only meet one of those in the final boss fight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=3822671">Expand</a></span>

There were no Penumeo lines (I didn&apos;t write it correctly) in the first Bioshock. There was almost no change in the gameplay. It is a waste of a sequel, it could be better. The storyline is perfect.</span>

<br>It does come with its downsides, the pacing feels kind of weird because of the combat overkill in the second half of the game. The biggest disappointment besides its short length is the second area. Booker and Elizabeth are sent to a sunken down part of rapture where splicers run rampant.
<br>It looks like a environment from the first game and i would have rather spent more time in Rapture in its glory. Overall i think this is a good piece of dlc and a must have for every Bioshock fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bioshock-infinite-burial-at-sea---episode-one/user-reviews?user_review_id=4159580">Expand</a></span>

This game is a DLC, for the first game that I ever reviewed: BioShock Infinite.  For those of you who don&apos;t know what this means, this basically means you cannot play this game without getting BioShock Infinite first.  As for BioShock Infinite itself, I thought it was a fantastic game, and more than worth purchasing for any gamer (see my review of the game for more details).  As for this game/DLC, does it measure up to the fantastic feats of the main game, or are the clouds of Columbia better than the oceans of Rapture after all?  Let&apos;s find out.  The gameplay of this DLC is very much the same as BioShock Infinite.  You play as a man named Booker DeWitt, and must fight alongside Elizabeth in a fantastic first-person shooter experience.  As I said, as a shooter, this DLC is fantastic.  It retains all of the same gameplay that made the original game so enjoyable.  The controls are about the same as any other PC based shooter, and it adds a few extras.  There are numerous weapons to choose from, and you also get super powers called vigors, that add a unique touch to the game&apos;s gameplay.  Once again though, this is the exact same gameplay as BioShock Infinite.  This is both a good thing and a bad thing.  If you enjoyed BioShock Infinite, which you most likely did, there is definitely fun to be had with this DLC.  If you didn&apos;t however, this DLC is most likely not for you, as it does nothing to change the gameplay at all.  Sure there is a new freeze vigor to play with, but that&apos;s the only real thing they added.  The other problem I had with this DLC is that it is way too short.  I managed to beat it in just a little over an hour.  Despite the short length however, when you get down to it, the DLC is just more of the same game, and that is exactly what I am a fan of.  This DLC is really fun for people who enjoyed the main game, but if you didn&apos;t like BioShock Infinite because of its gameplay, you won&apos;t find many redeeming qualities here.  As for the graphics, they are also more of the same.  While the graphics don&apos;t enhance the main game in any way, they are still every bit as pretty to look at as the main game.  Plus the game&apos;s return to BioShock&apos;s original setting of Rapture allows for many more unique visuals than the main game.  Once again however, if you enjoyed BioShock Infinite&apos;s graphics, then this DLC is definitely for you.  If you did not, then you will probably have to look someplace else.  This DLC also boasts the graphics of its main game, but if you didn&apos;t happen to like those graphics, then this is most likely not for you.  As for the story, let me just start by saying that it&apos;s complicated, and you should definitely play the main game first before moving on to play this one.  The reason why is: this DLC takes place right where the original game leaves off.  In other words, playing this DLC first would both spoil everything that happened at the end of the original game, and be too confusing to even try to follow, which is most likely why it was DLC.  The story of this DLC is that Booker DeWitt and Elizabeth have to rescue a girl named Sally from the city of Rapture.  The story is pretty good overall, except for one thing: this DLC is just over an hour long!  It feels like it is developing into something just as it ends so abruptly.  That&apos;s not to say the story is bad, it&apos;s just that it is too short to really develop into anything.  Despite having a really abrupt ending, this DLC still has a great story.  Overall, this DLC is worth buying if you really enjoyed BioShock Infinite.  I recommend this game to anyone who has played the original game and loved it.  If you didn&apos;t like this game however, this DLC is just more of the same game, and definitely not worth purchasing.

<br>The only issue with the game is its quite short. When I realised I had got to the ending, I panicked and hungered for more as if the game itself had become my addiction .
