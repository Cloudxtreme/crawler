And Diablo is all about the loot, it&apos;s the reason why we run higher difficulties.</span>

<br>Less users per game, less items, less heroes, less customization, less secret levels, less hero levels, less workable builds, less item affixes, less item types, no runewords, no jewels, no stats on heroes, no charms, no custom room names, etc. The list is extensive and I recommend dropping by the official forms: http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/3354739/ and asking there if you should buy the game or not, BEFORE YOU BUY IT.

I was a big fan of Diablo I and Diablo II. I remember staying up all night playing and playing to the point where my friends I passed out. Diablo I actually was a birthday gift from my friend and was simply unforgettable. Now fast forward to Diablo III. Here are the reasons why Diablo III should literally be pulled off shelves and reworked:<br><br>1. Online Only Mode - To play this game by yourself you must constantly be online. All the time. No matter what. So this means you must rely on Blizzard&apos;s servers which are having a hard time with the volume.This also means when they decide to no longer support those servers your game will most likely be dead unless some private server linking occurs and then you&apos;re dependent on them.<br><br>2. Short - It took hours upon hours of dedicated work to beat the previous Diablos. This one takes no skill what so ever. The game is extremely linear to point of being &apos;race tracked&apos; through the plot, start to finish.<br><br>3. Lack of Complexity - There isn&apos;t much in the way customization in the game. That is to say selecting specific skill groups or where to place points to strengthen the character as you see fit. When you level up you are alerted to what is new and you can select it if you wish. Skills points are automatically placed. Just imagine Need for Speed without the ability to customize the paint on the car... Or your only choices in Call of Duty was M16 or... M16 with an ACOG. I&apos;m exaggerating a bit, but only a bit.<br><br>4. Atmosphere - The atmosphere of the first Diablos were incredibly dark and bleak. This one isn&apos;t exactly rainbows and unicorns, but it&apos;s definitely missing the styling queues from before. Example [spoiler kind of] when there is a reprisal of the Butcher, I expected to see piked bodies and blood splashed about. I saw some blood stains, some empty torture devices, a skeleton here and there, but not the disturbing imagery from before. The kind of imagery that made you apprehensive to put your character forward. Remember this game had gore comparable to Hostel at certain points...<br><br>5. Story - It&apos;s just terrible. It&apos;s just so predictable and so bland. Like the corny, &quot;This mystery man is actually... MR. WITHERS!&quot; type of plot.<br><br>Now to talk about the good things.<br><br>The things I did appreciate was the male/female versions of the classifications, the new classes offered, but to the detriment of not seeing some older classes. I miss the Necromancer. *Sniff, sniff* I thought the cinematics were great and the voice acting was well done. The music was ambient and was placed nicely. There was some annoying repetition with player/companion npc banter, but nothing too bad. I especially liked the new companion interactions with new areas and new people (additional companions you find along the way). It&apos;s like the Wizard of Oz! Ha!<br><br>Over all this game is terrible. I wouldn&apos;t buy another Blizzard game unless there was an ironclad user review that it wasn&apos;t absolute drivel. It seems like the total development time was dedicated to creating this auction house, the cinematics and the online only (DRM) with the game itself being slap dashed together. I think what bothers me the most now is the generally favorable reviews from professional critics. How did this game rate so high? Did they play something we didn&apos;t?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2440537">Expand</a></span>

(ie; level60 2-handed weapons dropping in Inferno Act4 with 100-200dps (while your gonna get murdered with 1000 dps weapons there.) But wait for PVP you say!? Why? So I can enter a game with some moron that dropped $250 on weapons and items in the Real Money Auction system? No thanks.
<br>
<br>Summary: This game is 95~99% gear, and 1~5% skill. Anyone still wanna play it?
<br>
<br>Good riddens,
<br>Someone elses future customer
<br>
<br>P.S. The lack of response to combat the RMT spammers from sending friend invites, chat spam, and now whispers has made this alrady horrible game much much worse. Great job Blizzard. Wont EVER buy one of your half completed products ever again, and its because of your amazingly bad CUSTOMER SERVICE that will cement this decision as I submit my refund ticket.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2440187">Expand</a></span>

However, the reason I give it such a poor score is because I was expecting to get so much more out of it than I did instead of outright quitting after a month of playing it. Simply put, the game is a colossal disappointment. There is *no* way that it took Blizzard so many years to develop this game&apos;s engine, graphics, mechanics, etc. It&apos;s painfully obvious that the game, from the ground up, was built around the Real Money Auction House business model, and that&apos;s what most of its development time was sunk into. The game is probably fun until you hit level 60 and Inferno Difficulty, when you slowly begin to realize that the game was pretty much solely designed as a cash-grab on Blizzard&apos;s part. Feedback for the game has been overwhelmingly negative, but in response to this massive blowback, Blizzard has only made changes to the game that I believe only served to make the game even worse and even more of a disappointment. Just ask someone you know who quit, and if they didn&apos;t quit before Patch 1.0.3, that patch was almost certainly what pushed them to finally quit (that was the final nail in the coffin for me). It almost looks as if Blizzard is making changes based on what is most likely to force people to use the RMAH. Meanwhile, the Blizzard employees in charge of interacting with the community via the forums remain woefully silent about everyone&apos;s main gripes with the game, addressing only things that people largely don&apos;t care about, and sometimes being downright condescending to their player base. They really come off as implying &quot;we&apos;ll tell you what&apos;s fun, and we are making changes to the game based on what we think is fun.&quot; It&apos;s as if Blizzard is refusing to face up to the fact that most of its fans hate the game and think it&apos;s a major disappointment. Many people feel as if they were bait-and-switched, and that they were cheated and lied to, and when one does some detective work pertaining to news about the game&apos;s development from years past, it becomes obvious just how many things were shown and then cut out of the game entirely before launch. This has been a major wake-up call for droves of Blizzard&apos;s once-loyal fans who auto-purchased all of Blizzard&apos;s games. They are starting to realize that this is not the Blizzard we used to know. Unfortunately, all we&apos;re dealing with now is another big, faceless game corporation that only cares about its bottom line instead of what its customers want. With Diablo 3 being lambasted from all directions as a major failure and disappointment, and the upcoming WoW expansion being largely regarded as a joke and/or &quot;the death of WoW,&quot; it certainly looks like Blizzard is in a downslide, with 2 of its 3 franchises essentially in the toilet. Blizzard better hope it has something damn good up its sleeve with Project Titan. Even though I got so much playtime out of this game before I got fed up and quit, I still feel cheated out of my $60 because I, and everyone, was expecting this game to have so much more longevity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2522670">Expand</a></span>

You pick a character, fight hordes of monsters, and loot their stuff.  But what you might not know is that Diablo 3 is filled with poor design choices that seriously detract from the game play.<br><br>The biggest issue for me is the pacing.  Blizzard assumes you are going to play the game through three or more times with the same character.  But the bulk of most gamers experience is the first play through, perhaps with multiple characters.  And Diablo&apos;s experience there is decidedly lackluster.<br><br>When my wizard finished the game at level 30, only 30% of her skill runes were unlocked  That meant that although I had played through all the content I was still very restricted in what I could do with my character.  To unlock all my skills, I&apos;d have to play the exact same content with the same character two more times, which honestly I&apos;ll probably never do.<br><br>The order that the skill runes unlocked was also an issue.  All of the core skill runes that my wizard used unlocked by the end of act 1, so I spent acts 2 through 4 with little to look forward to when I leveled.  My level was just a number, there was no meaningful change.  Yes my hit points went up and damage improved, but the monsters scaled up too, so essentially nothing happened.<br><br>Blizzard seemed to attempt to correct for the fact that you&apos;d only have a fraction of your skills on the first play through by making the monsters numerous but easy.  You will rarely be in any real danger.  You just spam your primary attack, and they all die.  Boss monsters can be more challenging, but are hit and miss as well - some easy, some of medium difficulty.<br><br>As a side effect of the spam your primary attack &quot;strategy&quot; is that the core mechanics of each class become irrelevant.  In theory, the core mechanic of my wizard was her arcane power, which was in limited supply and regenerated slowly.  However, the primary attacks of the wizard don&apos;t use arcane power and were more than sufficient for most everything you came up against, so arcane power didn&apos;t actually matter much.  I believe that the class mechanics (rage, chi, etc.) have the same issue.<br><br>Put all that together and you can see why the experience on the first play through is not very good.  Your character changes little after act 1.  90% of your time is spent spamming your primary attack.  At the end of the game, you&apos;ve only unlocked a fraction of your character; to unlock the rest you have to face the above again.  And again.<br><br>Besides the pacing, there are also numerous design issues that detract from the game.<br><br>The skill UI is horrible.  Simply horrible.  It&apos;s confusing and overly complicated, while at the same time somehow managing to be tremendously restrictive in what you can do.  The best thing I can say about the skill interface is that you won&apos;t have to use it that often past act 1.<br><br>Numerous Diablo 1 &amp; 2 features were stripped out to &quot;streamline&quot; the game, but left confusing remnants.  For example, identification scrolls are gone, as they were just cluttering up inventories.  OK, I&apos;m fine with that.  But oddly, you still find items you have to ID, which you do by right clicking on them and waiting half a second.  What&apos;s the point of that?  Is Blizzard paid by the click or something?  Similarly, the complex gem, jewel, and rune system has been removed, as it was complicated and required too much inventory management.  But they left a modified gem system in which you can level up a gem cutter to be able to combine gems into other gems that you also won&apos;t use, because they are pretty much worthless.<br><br>Another poor game design component is how Blizzard treats characters and levels.  As a player, a character is someone that I want to customize.  Maybe I want my wizard to be a fire wizard, or a lightning wizard, or an illusionist.  Levels are what I use to do so.  But to Blizzard, the character class is the character... all wizards are the same.  Same appearance, same voice, same skills, same back story, etc.  And levels aren&apos;t a way to customize your character, they are a way to restrict content so that you have to put more hours into the game.  Very unappealing approach.<br><br>Finally, the decision to force you to be connected to the internet... it definitely detracts from your experience.  You WILL have to deal with server downtime and lag.  And you WILL receive tells from people out of the blue when you just want to veg.  It&apos;s annoyingly unnecessary.<br><br>All in all, I rate Diablo 3 a 4.  It&apos;s OK at best.  I&apos;d pay $20 for it, but it&apos;s definitely not worth $60.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2440920">Expand</a></span>

All I see that was accomplished was tarnishing the good name the was Diablo.

Unfortunately, as is the standard with Blizzard games, you need to put this amount of time into the game in order to see anything relevant to the actual game. At about Act 4 Hell I discovered that the balance of the game is worked around the Real Money Auction House (RMAH). The reason this is an issue is because pieces of gear are sold for around 100k minimum yet it takes around 2 hours to farm that amount prior to level 60. At 60, the rates increase a bit, but not enough to carry you to gear that will allow progression through Inferno; this gear is sold upwards of 300k gold each piece. All of this would be moot, except that as many others have also noted, the itemization is abysmal. I understand that not every piece is going to be usable, but over the course of 60 levels I managed to find only 2 or 3 pieces of relevant &quot;rare&quot; gear. This means that you end up playing a Chinese Gold Farming Simulator or opting into the Pay 2 Win (p2w) model. The story is definitely not worth playing for. However, the one saving grace for the game is Covetous Shen. Absolute gold. At least I was lucky enough to never have any connection issues like other players. Happy I got my refund though, as they (developers) severely broke the game. Expect D2 and be incredibly disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2494245">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I like the artwork and the story isnt half bad. I didn&#xB4;t care all that much about the story because western RPG always suck compared to eastern (japanese) RPG:s. To complain about the story is thus a waste of time.
<br>
<br>But I have witnessed the ultimate sellout of fans by a company with this game. Vivendi/Activision/Blizzard have lost all track of what made Blizzard such a successful company in the first place. Their hardcore fans, the gamers. With the release of this game, they spat on the face of every gamer out there. They made us buy a game that first of was incomplete, secondly it was unbeatable by default.
<br>
<br>Who in their right minds releases a single player game in which a single player cannot finish the game?
<br>
<br>Apparently Blizzard does.
<br>
<br>This game is impossible to beat on inferno level (which is the endgame) without having to use the auction house. Keep in mind, this is a single player game. Why do I even have to use the Auction House?
<br>
<br>For one reason, RMAH (Real Money Auction House).
<br>
<br>It&#xB4;s a great idea for the company, make players buy and sell gear whilst Blizzard makes cash without actually having to work. But for the players this means that the best gear will always sell for cash and that the ingame gold AH (Auction House) gets depleted of the best items.
<br>
<br>RMAH is however acceptable even though it&#xB4;s tacky as hell. If they wanna be greedy, sure go right ahead.
<br>
<br>But in this case Blizzard has made the game so hard on inferno level that the usage of the AH was impossible to avoid. If AH is unavoidable then RMAH automatically becomes the next step.
<br>
<br>But, don&#xB4;t you get drops in the game?
<br>
<br>Well of course you do, nothing usable but of course you do.
<br>
<br>The loot system is innovative, the first game I have ever encountered where the highest item level (ilvl) on drops doesn&#xB4;t mean that youre getting the best gear. I have gotten alot of the ilvl 63 which is the highest possible and yet I have nothing to show for it. My best gear is actually an ilvl 61 (it&#xB4;s the best drop I have gotten and it beats my ilvl 63 bought gear), this after 250 hours of gameplay. &quot;Then why do you even have item levels Blizz?&quot;, should be the first question they should answer.
<br>
<br>Diablo 3 is the biggest pyramid scheme since the pyramids themselves:p and for this Blizzard should take a timeout in the corner and reflect on their shameful behaviour. Standing next to them should be the corrupt media that has given this game a good reviews. Shame on you, the free press, bought and paid for by lazy and greedy developers. I&#xB4;m still giving this game 3/10 because of the artwork and the 250 hours of gameplay it gave me. But this was the last time Vivendi/Activision/Blizzard get&#xB4;s a dime from me and I used to be a big fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2537943">Expand</a></span>

I was really looking forward to this game since I stopped playing Diablo 2 in 2004.  I was in the beta and the first 15 levels up to skeleton king showed lots of promise.  The graphics while not cutting edge are crisp, the environmental effects are done well, and the spell animations are great.  Unfortunately what the beta did not test (and I really wish it did!) was the end game.  There are tons of issues why Diablo 3 fails at this, but here most of them in list form:  1) Blizzard&apos;s decision to allow ultimate flexibility with skills/specs, but at the same time limiting spec changing is just poor design.  There is nothing fun about feeling like you can spec in numerous ways to overcome unique challenges, and then have to maintain some stale spec for the majority of your level 60 experience.  Don&apos;t get me started if you accidentally mouse click near your skills as you can drag the skills off and reset your buff that gives you extra chance at finding gear the more elites you kill (stacks up to 5).  As a demon hunter there are very few viable builds that will allow reliable killing of elite packs -- which is really where the end game is.  2) This brings me to my next point, killing elite packs that sometimes have insane affixes is not fun.  Invulnerable minions and some other combinations are near impossible.  Sometimes these mobs are positioned in areas where you can&apos;t actually progress unless you lure them away into a corner after repeated deaths.  Sometimes the best solution is restarting the game which in my mind shows that this is also pretty bad design.  3) Blizzard gives us mixed messages on item stats.  At one point they want you to be able to kill things quickly (hence the enrage timers), but on the other hand you sometimes need ridiculous amounts of defense stats to withstand normal wear and tear of battle.  Gear that has the ideal mix of defense/offense is like winning the lottery. 4) Essentially the worst part of Diablo 3 is the fact that despite how long you may farm inferno and I have for weeks, you really never get anything decent.  The amount of crap loot I&apos;ve got for doing the same thing over and over again in Act 3/4 on inferno is mesmerizing.  Accumulating gold requires playing hell or Act I inferno (where the chance to get good items is 2% or less, so its just gold farming).  Since when is gold farming good game design?  5) Lastly the fact the real money auction house is even available despite the fact that over 2-3 weeks of farming nearly nightly for 2-4 hours I did not receive one upgrade from my demon hunter (with my friend playing as well) makes me think Blizzard wants this game to make money for them rather than have any good design or enjoyment.  Lastly, haphazard patches with very little communication of what&apos;s changing or stealth nerfs makes me think this game really isn&apos;t salvageable.  Extremely disappointing game with what could have been huge potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2489407">Expand</a></span>

There is literally no other dynamic. When you build a game from a purely business stand point, you&apos;re not building a great game - and a great game this is not.<br><br>In conclusion, gamers, do you really want to spend your time on yet another slave-like gear grind? If so, eat your heart out. You&apos;ll find no better place to do it!

Played it for 3 hours after I finally got back on to their bad servers.... thank God they didn&apos;t actually put SP in. The gameplay overall is just bad and so far the story is worse than the others. Overall so far it is just trash with the Diablo name on it.</span>

The story is mediocre, the controls are sluggish,  the balance is bad, there is no path finding at all for your character so you get stuck walking around corners.  The only plus side really is it is a game you can play with your friends, well after they patch the multyplayer issues.  Oh and you will never find loot good enough to progress through the difficulties without using the auction house.  There are man many games worth paying over this one.  This is the first time a Blizzard product has flat out disappointed me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2462783">Expand</a></span>

<br>The company seemed much more concerned with the auction system than with the game.</span>

Blizzard really needs to get its butt in gear if it plans to keep its fans because SC2 was a huge disappointment and now they have failed to deliver with Diablo 3. Blizzard, your fans need more than just a stale storyline and upgraded graphics. Try creating more interactive environments, different routes and decisions for quests, open environments, special multiplayer concepts (not just co-op). You (Blizzard) are destroying great series&apos; of games and you not learning or listing to your fans; they want more than just new graphics and a one-way story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2439771">Expand</a></span>

Do these people actually get paid? I&apos;ve read so many of these 100% reviews that it literally churns the stomach. How can anyone think this game is good? It&apos;s 13 hours of solid gameplay, then the rest is repetitive grind. The voice acting is TERRIBLE. Terrible, god damn it. The game&apos;s customization steered away from talent trees to this dumbed down &quot;pick 6 skills and mash&quot; system. Look up diablo 2 on gamefaqs and at their indepth/character guides and recognize how watered down this game is, compared to it&apos;s predecessor. The graphics are straight from the 2004 era, which, I can understand, considering blizzard strong arms you into playing online, but they could have at least used cell-shaded graphics. As it stands I won&apos;t buy the sequel, or any blizzard game at this point. It&apos;s down right appalling that people still buy the mountains of **** blizzard craps out and call it gold. This game is not gold, it&apos;s a long, tedious grind, that won&apos;t even last you 3 days. Worst of all, it&apos;s a loot game but it&apos;s so painfully randomized that you could spend your whole day grinding, even using exploits to make it go by faster, and never find a single piece of useful gear. You are better off going to the royal crypts loaded up with +Gold find, and buying **** off the AH. I have a firm belief that every game should last it&apos;s cost in hours. Diablo should have brought to me 60 hours of enjoyable time spent for the 60 bucks I had to pay. Instead I played it for 13 hours, enjoyed the cinematics, then the other 26 hours I begrudgingly put into it, I was banging my head against the desk, and the only thing that made it even remotely tolerable or why I kept going to begin with was because I had 6 people to play it with. I got skyrim 2 weeks ago and I&apos;d say I&apos;m about 20% through the **** game and still loving it. Sufficed to say, I haven&apos;t even touched diablo since and don&apos;t have the slightest desire to pick it up again, even if I played a new class. Blizzard really doesn&apos;t respect it&apos;s fanbase at all, if they think they can get away with marketing this and expecting us to eat it up. Game get&apos;s a 2/10, for not meeting my hour to cost quota, wasting 20+ hours of my life, and in all honesty, being drastically underwhelming for a game I have been waiting 10-11 years for. What. a. letdown.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2394728">Expand</a></span>

Recommendations - don&apos;t buy it in Australia at the Aussie price - at peak hours you may not be able to play the game you paid for or it will lag sooo much you will smash your computer in frustration. Wait for Torchlight 2 at half the price and double the fun. If the game was playable wih decent server support then score would be 6/10 but after buying a game I would like to play it and I can&apos;t. Might be ok if another company did this too me but Blizzard should give us better with their multiplayer history and amounts of money from making the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2435982">Expand</a></span>

First off the only online DRM makes it cumbersome to play, and weekly maintenance? I feel like I am playing an MMO.  The graphics are a step up from D2, but are reminiscent of 2004-2006, and do not evoke any nostalgia from the earlier titles in the series - hell, there is no light radius!  That was a great feature in the original games.  The story is quite bland, and even the characters that follow you throughout the game do not grow on you; however, I do enjoy the retorts of the companions and their interactions with the player.  Those characters are much more fleshed out that even... wow, I actually forgot the name of the girl who is the centerpoint of the story!  Aha! Leah, wow.  I was going to just sit and think for a bit and keep typing her name, but the fact that I am an avid roleplayer (both paper and pencil and classic RPGs) and I could not remember a leading NPCs name says something to the quality of the storyline.
<br>
<br>The constant patching and downtime is expected in the early weeks of a new game, but this was not meant to be an MMO, but rather, staying true to its predecessors, a single player game with LAN or battle.net connectivity.  So if I do not play online I cannot use the Auction House?  I don&apos;t care.  I would gladly make a character on battle.net and play online with support and have my offline skirmisher for when I had 30 mins or so to kill.  D2 even had the open battle.net option where I could bring my offline character online and search for other players.  On gameplay, I can understand removing the town portal and auto-identifying items to make the game more fast paced, and the new skill system has its merits, but I feel that one thing is to streamline the playthrough, and another thing entirely is to simplify it down to the point that it loses all appeal other than left click kill, left click loot, left click move.  Inventory management, skill or talent choices, visual character customization!!!!, to name a few examples are part of action-RPGs.  The devil is in the details, and I would say that this proverb is even more true in a game titled Diablo.  There is something severely missing in Diablo 3, I have come to the realization that I have been able to play for this long because I have been grouping with the same two friends to progress together, but honestly I have rarely played solo much - the first act I did alone and enjoyed it greatly I will admit.  I believe that this act is the most faithful to the franchise - if they added darker lighting effects and a fog of war or light radius if would truly be creepy and Diablo-esque.  However, the random idiot yellow robed cultists and the purple flying faerie that COMPLETELY deter my immersion into the game, please make them black robed even if it&apos;s generic and have the purple faerie witch be less flamboyant - and without WINGS!!! arg!!!
<br>
<br>To summarize, this game seems to have lost its direction and is not worthy to be named a continuation of the Diablo legacy.  I hope that Blizzard sees this and reviews its decisions with this game for future endeavors.  I have no hopes for any significant changes in a game that is free-to-play, sadly -- Blizzard already got my $60 and well I guess that price for a few weeks of gaming isn&apos;t so bad -- there is no monthly subscription (thank God) which is the biggest incentive in online games to make changes.  Play the demo (they should have a 3-day pass offer still) before you decide to invest in this game.  Hopefully you will get to Act 2 and see how far it diverges from the spirit of the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2485066">Expand</a></span>

Low poly models, bad lightning, shader issues, lack of camera movement / zoom. We can list them but we can say: many similar games share these traits. Lag spikes, disconnects, error 37... Ok, some online games stay this unstable for weeks long, Diablo III isn&apos;t all alone. Online only single player encourages account hacking but doesn&apos;t prevent item duplication? That is bad. And even worse with server side achievement and AH bugs. We can speak about stability issues, hacking incidents, AH bugs, item duplication and other things. We can point to the fact, there is no PVP because the game is half finished. We can see frequent hotfixes because of huge balance problems that shows how some abilities weren&apos;t tested at all. We see numerous smaller or bigger issues. We can see how Blizzard lied in russian key related scandals. But sadly when many people tell you, &quot;it was easy to this point, but now I can&apos;t make a progress at all&quot; and good drops just don&apos;t want to drop even after days... Then you have to say the game can offer you two things: Boredom because you see no challenge, or boredom because the game is too hard. Where is the fun part? Ok, &quot;flow&quot; (if you learned about psychology) and mindless farming can be &quot;motivating&quot; and &quot;fun&quot; for some. But the same people would have fun as factory workers as well.<br><br>Why the game can&apos;t even have short part where the difficulty is just right and you can enjoy it? Why everyone sees easy progress then hit a wall and see &quot;no progress&quot;? Because the balancing mechanism that help to set proper difficulty are just wrong, and small tweaks and adjustment can&apos;t fix it. The core game mechanism is flawed and it needs a total redesign. This with the well known issues is enough to rate this game as a 0/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2412156">Expand</a></span>

If you enjoyed D1 and D2 avoid this game, you will be greatly disappointed.  After the lengthy development time you would think that D3 would be great, it&apos;s almost mediocre at best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2437026">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you  played D1 or D2 or both and are expecting the same experience....dont bother.
<br>After reading the reviews (witch I have to agree 100% with) I find myself surprised that no one has mentioned the HORRIBLE loot system this game has... I mean.. DEAR GOD! One of the things that made D2 &quot;fun&quot; to play was the loot, but in this game is just crap.. Maybe Im too used to WoW&apos;s format..blues are better than white...yellow (in this case is better than blue) and orange (witch are legendary items are far better than any other color) well.. this is not the case.. you can find a legendary or a yellow and 20 min later find a blue item witch is a lot better than both, at the same lvl requirement .... what?
<br>Another observation....I found me a really nice &quot;Wizard&quot; hat.... and by wizard I mean &quot;only a wizard can equip&quot; .. with dexterity and strenght for stats... again.. .what? The random factor on item&apos;s stats is absurd!
<br>Last but not least.. loot rewards.. you can get a yellow out of a damned barrel! or random champion packs, but when you kill a boss.. when you kill DIABLO..THE LAST BOSS IN THE GAME.. he drops 1 or 2 blues..it feels so .. unrewarding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2439409">Expand</a></span>

Moreover they could have put in place more server in more region, so that they can maintain the server during midnight, when most people of the region are sleeping. Instead, they only put up 3 server and this make it very likely that there will be high server load all round the clock. Obviously they just want to milk the cash cow.<br><br>2) reducing the loot drop and quality to a ridiculously low level just to cater to the supposedly increase availability of gears from the Auction house. Basically they say that they take into account the availability of Auction house when deciding on the loot table. And going by the current drop rate, they expect ALL players to use the Auction house in order to supplement the loot drop if they want to progress at a reasonable pace without excessively tedious and long grinding process. Now this might appeal to some players and other who have complaint about the gold seller and other loot buyer in D2. But for people like me who just want to play the game and play multi session with friends on occasion, it breaks the immersion of the game and it seems that now I cannot ignore the Auction House now (whereas in D2 I don&apos;t care since what other people do does not affect me) and I will not be able to progress in the game without excessive frustration if I don;t partake in the Auction House. This is probably in the grand plan too, so that when Real Money Auction House comes online, more would be tempted to put up the better gears there and buyers will be forced to use RMAH if they want the legendary/rare gears.<br><br>3) Skill tree - or lack there of. Now this is more of a personal choice. Some embraces it, but to me, it actually make me feel less diversity in my character. Technically there are thousands and thousands of combination I can play with, but the thing is, if I create 2 witch doctor, they would have access to the EXACT same skill set. And this means that once the game mature, there would be even more cookie cutter build than what blizzard is admitting now. 4) Hacking and their customer service. Hacking ... I can accept that it may happens and loop holes may happen. But Blizzard seems to be in denial and their fan boys are up in arms over claims of people been hack, even blaming the victim! This is perverse logic and it really turns me off that Blizzard actually condone such behaviour on their forum. On the other hand, they have been removing the post of the players who are overly critical and impolite about their opinion (which doesn&apos;t surprise me since it has been happening since a few years ago, when blizzard start to get a big ego). And they seems to disregard the well documented case of a few players who have ONLY their current player&apos;s loot compromise. They keep saying that the players are at fault and most likely reason is keylogger/phishing and what not. But if that is the case - a) why did some players only had one character&apos;s loot compromised and not the others? if the hacker really get their hand on the user name and password, then he would have sold ALL the gears from ALL the characters.<br>b) Why is it that only their blizzard account is compromised and not their more valuable bank account? And don&apos;t make me laugh by saying that the hackers are sitting on the account. Once they get their hands on the credential, they would quickly cash out, since the over time, it is more likely for the user to detect the compromise.<br><br>4) Which brings me to the next point - inadequate security. Until recently the password is not case sensitive and does not log you out after repeated tries. It seems that blizzard is simply skirting their responsibility and telling everyone to get an authenticator to increase their security? for a game?! And if so, why is it not included in the game itself if it is so important?<br><br>5) patch by stealth - and I really disliked the tendency of Blizzard to patch by stealth and not publicly admitting that they have loopholes.<br><br>And to those Fanboys, you have been saying give the game some time, and it is now coming to almost 3 weeks and their server has NOT been improving and lag is still present even when you can play.   now accounts actually start to get hack. So I truly will return the game and not buy another Blizzard product again. Those who bought it online and those whose country support lemon law, I would encourage you to do the same.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2451205">Expand</a></span>

There seems to be 30 more levels and an auction house but I&apos;m not sure what the point of those are since I have completed the game. Although what I experianced of D3 was fun and entertaining it was surprisingly short and lacking in end game content. I was expecting more from Blizzard, I don&apos;t imagine it would have been to hard to create 10-15 end game maps where players could spend sometime fighting a few new bosses to finish the level cap. The games seems like it was rushed to market. Game play is simple and old school... all you are getting are the cut scenes that continue the Diablo story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2529049">Expand</a></span>

And this is coming from someone who spent over 100 hours on it and beat the game on Inferno with my Wizard so I&apos;ve given the game more than its fair chance. The first couple of times of beating the game are very fun, especially with friends, I will hand it to Blizzard. The art is nice, the music is not bad, and the environments are somewhat interesting. Then you reach the brick wall that is known as Inferno (the hardest difficulty) and you realize what Blizzard has been planning all along.
<br>
<br>The mobs in Inferno suddenly become godlike and all your gear becomes instantly obsolete. Elites and even regular mobs will kick your ass unless you upgrade your very quickly. To make matters worse the game PUNISHES YOU for playing co-op on Inferno, the already disgustingly difficult mobs become near godly and unless you and your friends are supremely geared it&apos;s going to be an excruciating exercise in futility. Problem is that 95% of the loot you get in Inferno is literally garbage, so bad that even the NPC vendors will be reluctant to accept them. Magic find increases the chances of getting yellow items, but chances are they are still crap. There are far too many possible attributes during item rolls, so as a result you will almost always get items which make no sense whatsoever (example: Wizard hat with Strength, or Barbarian sword with Intelligence, etc.) and weapons in Act 4 of Inferno with 200 DPS. It&apos;s infuriating. It is so bad that when I killed Diablo on Inferno he dropped only blues, and not just any blues but TERRIBLE blues, stuff so bad you wouldn&apos;t even use it on Hell difficulty.
<br>
<br>So you&apos;re thinking to yourself, WHY WHY WHY would they do this?! Why make the mobs so difficult and the gear so bad?!?!
<br>
<br>WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE REACH THE GOAL OF BLIZZARD&apos;S GAME DESIGN IN DIABLO 3: THE REAL MONEY AUCTION HOUSE!!!
<br>
<br>As stated Inferno is so ridiculously difficult and the loot generally so bad that the ONLY WAY to progress is to use the Auction House. I only managed to beat the game by bidding low gold on items and shopping intelligently, but it took wayyyy longer than it should have. Not only this, I was BASICALLY FORCED TO USE THE AUCTION HOUSE TO BEAT THE GAME. Trust me this isn&apos;t just unique to me because I suck, 90% of my friends gave up at Inferno Act 1, those that stayed have had no choice but to use the Auction House as well. The game isn&apos;t skill dependent, it is only gear based.
<br>
<br>PROBLEM IS that the gold prices of items have flown through the roof due to inflation, botters, and exploiters. So expect to see any half decent weapon for at least 10 million gold, which is no small amount of money. So a lot of people have resorted to using the Real Money Auction House and it&apos;s absolute chaos. I&apos;ve seen people spending over $500 (yes real cash) on a SINGLE ITEM, a virtual item folks that will probably be obsolete in the next patch or expansion. I personally don&apos;t believe in spending real money on video game items (especially absurd amounts like stated above) but to each his own. -----
<br>
<br>So I really can&apos;t help but feel like the entire game was designed to revolve around the Real Money Auction House. The difficulty is absurd at inferno, many of the bosses are basically gear-checks (can only be beaten with certain amounts of DPS) and the loot is so bad that you have no choice but to use the Auction House.
<br>
<br>This game is a money grab, it&apos;s pay to win, and I&apos;m not sticking around for when they implement Player vs. Player where it&apos;s going to be the battle of the credit cards.
<br>
<br>I will admit that I got more than my money&apos;s worth and it was fun at times, but this franchise has been ruined and this is by FAR the worst Blizzard game I have ever played. I will not remember this fondly like I do Diablo 2 or the Starcraft Series.
<br>
<br>SHAME ON YOU BLIZZARD, THIS GAME IS A SCAM

It was the story, the atmosphere surrounding it, the sense of realism as well along with the balanced fantasy aspects that made the two first installments of the series fit so well with me. The visual style of the game has lost much of it&apos;s dark feeling of the first games. Instead, it is now veiled with a cartoonish style, rendered in a manner that further alienates it from the original style from 1 and 2. The graphics just are not Diablo for me. Skill structure is a huge let down and as crazy it may sound, I think Blizzard rushed to release this, and considering it has been twelve years in the making, that is quite an achievement.

The story is terrible and predictable with cheesy dialogue. The graphics are almost 10 years old. No singleplayer. Pay to win. Always online.  There is zero social aspect to the game. Diablo 2 had the main chat lobby where you could see other players and their gear, as well as interact with them in a multi channel chat interface. Diablo 3 has one pathetic &quot;general chat&quot; which is plagued by an ungodly amount of gold farmers spamming relentlessly. One will find themselves forced to leave the channel instantly. The item database is garbage. Blue &quot;magic&quot; items are generally the best in the game and &quot;legendaries&quot; are a complete joke. One will often find class specific items full of worthless attributes (e.g. intelligence on a &quot;mighty&quot; 2handed barbarian only club). Terrible. I think the auction house is the worst feature this lackluster game has to offer. It literally gives no incentive to playing the game at all. Lets say you get to a boss in act 3 and it&apos;s too difficult to beat with your current gear (i.e. gear check fights which are also lame). Instead of going back through the act and farming lower level content to gear up, the auction house is right there to solve your problems in a few clicks. Seriously, whats the point to trying to farm decent gear when you can just buy it for a few thousand gold and then steamroll the boss you were stuck on. I could go on but I find myself filling up with rage. I can&apos;t believe I waited years for this garbage to come out. The game is in beta mode at best. What has happened to the gaming industry? Remember when games had to stand on their own two feet and were sold as is? Those were the best. Now were stuck with mainstream casual friendly mega corporations with the &quot;we&apos;ll patch it later&quot; mentality. So sad.

The lack of variability in attributes and skills makes each class homogeneous with its equivalent level (I remember beating people in PvP when they were 20+ levels higher - that was the fun!).  You no longer drop you body when you die, so there is no real reason to worry about it.  You don&apos;t really get to the &quot;good stuff&quot; until level 60+. The game is also too short, the areas are not particularly big and always the same.  The side quests are boring and often make little or no sense.  Levelling up makes enemies that were impossible suddenly extremely easy.  To add insult to injury, the storyline is awful.  The game no longer feels scary like D2, but cartoon-esque.  The auction house also ruins the game by offering items better than you ever find.
<br>
<br>This is such a shame for a game that could have been so great.  Really really disappointed with it.  The Diablo franchise is dead (thankfully the D2 servers are still up!).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2538828">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s just that since I purchased it a few nights ago I&apos;ve only been able to get on the network for a grand total of two hours to play a single player game BY MYSELF. Either it won&apos;t let me on, or will tease me for a few minutes before it boots me. I&apos;m glad to see everyones anger at this crap and I hope these crap ratings deter others from purchasing it. If I could return this product I would march down to gamestop and demand my money back. I realize piracy is a complicated issue to control. But I&apos;m getting sick of this whole &apos;not really owning the things I paid for&apos; thing.  I hope the people responsible for screwing this up are having a really bad day. It makes me angry that so many people still crap that companies are having to resort to bs like this. But this isn&apos;t the way to do it. I would gladly undergo a slightly more intensive registration process if it meant I could actually play the game I bought without the lag and getting booted. Or not being able to play it at all. I feel like blizzard sold me a product I can&apos;t even play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2439780">Expand</a></span>

Buy it then, right now you&apos;re pretty much joining a $60 Long term beta. Complete with outages and game breaking patches. This is my first and probably last review, but with always online requirements breaking a game so consistently, we all need to tell companies that this will not pass and that cheaters, software pirates are their issue, and their issue alone. Oh and on the no LAN support issue, I played this game at a LAN it was a boot fest, I guess the LAN is dead.

Melee is completely at a dis-advantage in this game and besides that. It is extremely dumb ed down with no skill points or talent points it is nothing but a linear ARPG with limited action after you beat the game once. How much fun is farming the same 4 acts to get to level 60 then at level 60 you get to farm act 1 inferno that has a 2% chance to drop gear that is even level 60 most of it  that drops prevents you from progressing sense it is the same exact thing you can get from act 3 hell.
<br>
<br>This game was an extreme disappointment and should be sued for false advertising. i wonder when the beta version will stop being sold and we can purchase the real release in 2013</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2481626">Expand</a></span>

ADSL in most parts of the UK isnt &quot;always on&quot; to start with... bad former NTL areas now under the virgin brand are a classic example. I know people that can barely skype for 10 minutes at a time let alone play anything for a long period of time. Add that to the fact Blizzard seem incapable of keeping the servers up and you have a show stopping experience before you even get to the game. In a sense, in this case this is fortunate, because it hides this (MMO) Massive Mediocrity taken Online. It was how long in the making?

<br>
<br>Diablo 3 is a game where none of the original authors were involved in creating the sequel. In this case, it amounts to an analogy of R. A. Salvatore writing &quot;Lord of the Rings 2&quot;, or the author of Twilight authoring &quot;Crime and Punishment 2&quot;. The changes are just too contradictory to what Diablo 1 and 2 represented. Why did Blizzard North get sacked? Because they had artistic integrity? Just look at the original plans for D3, from the early 2000&apos;s, they say a lot about how the game was really meant to be. It is really disappointing that the original project got scrapped. Besides, the vast majority even on Blizzard&apos;s site have stated they definitely prefer the originally planned art, even in this day when graphics and all is supposed to be better, and many of whom state this really appreciate graphics in general.
<br>
<br>A game is primarily defined by what emotion or feeling it gives to the player. This is done via artistic and conceptual vision. Diablo 3 does not feel ANYTHING like D2. Smoothness and high-performing requirements can be good things, but very often are just otherwise.

<br>People game for the EXPERIENCE, not the way you swing your hammer, how neat the inventory looks or how fast a button-click responds. The experience is both intellectual and artistic. But Diablo 3&apos;s ambient qualities just plummeted to regular cartoons, and mindless DPS-viewing.
<br>It IS cartoony as by the saturated candy-whooping animations and designs, silly (wow, a boss named &quot;Skeleton king&quot;... wow, how cheesy), simplistic (they&apos;ve scrapped the whole stat and skill system, and in fact, all LOGIC behind choosing skills instead you&apos;ll just choose and construct a &quot;role&quot; or animations). It IS simply dumbed-down both artisticly and stat-wise.
<br>
<br>Ok, whoever enjoys MMO&apos;s (and Blizzard&apos;s oh-so-inspirational WoW in particular), you can be delighted by this game. But it is nowhere near art as opposed to originals.
<br>
<br>Not to mention that the originals were SINGLE-PLAYER GAMES, that actually ALLOWED playing the game. Whereas this iteration throws other players in your game, without you having any intention of playing with them (not to mention the damned DRM). And on top of all, this MULTIPLAYER game does not allow for competitive multiplayer nor LAN.
<br>
<br>This Diablo 3 can go to Pandaria, as much as I am concerned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2413370">Expand</a></span>

<br>However in reviewing Diablo 3 I must take into account the flaws in Blizzards ability to deliver said gaming experience.
<br>
<br>Blizzards requirement to have us always be online is detrimental to the gaming experience as a whole offered up by Diablo 3. Previous Diablo games could be enjoyed solo or with others online and I think that it&apos;s reasonable to assume that the third game in the franchise would hold up to that basic tenet of the series.
<br>
<br>That is simply not the case.
<br>Multiplayer is fine, I expect outages, I expect connection issues from time to time. This is not an MMO however and the game is designed to be able to be played solo as well, but it is here that the connection issues are not welcome. Lag in any other single player game would be considered a bug so it is is not justifiable in any way here.
<br>
<br>Blizzards decision to protect the RMAH at the expense of our gaming experience is reprehensible.
<br>
<br>Diablo 3 might be the best game that no one should play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2439377">Expand</a></span>

D3 is much more simpler than D2 which made the game less enjoyable, I bet a huge part of D3 players agreed with me.

But I&apos;m sure enough if the game were sold at USD 10 instead of 60 , it would be more worth it.</span>

The difficulty scaling felt just right and some of the drops I could use.  However,  I am now in act 2 of inferno and I am bored stiff.  There is no real strategy in this game, the boss fights are not very imaginative and the elite packs are dull.  With most elite packs in inferno, you will end up resorting to hit and run tactics for about 10 minutes until you burn down all their HP.   For all this effort you will pick up rubbish equipment that is always for another class.  I wish the loot tables meant equipment dropped I could actually use.  I don&apos;t mind using the AH, wont ever be using the RMAH but just now and then it would be nice if I could run a dungeon and find something worth equipping.  A side from the boring progression in Inferno and lack of decent loot, I wish there was more randomization to the game dungeons as it is soo boring doing the same quests/dungeons over and over and over!!!!!!!! Blizzard are right to admit that D3 has no end game... it&apos;s flawed! If I had my time again I wouldn&apos;t spent my money on this game.   Hoping Torchlight 2 bring more enjoyment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2524179">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay oversimplified to a point where players don&apos;t need a brain to play - this means there&apos;s no interaction at all. Lobby system from D2 is taken out and replaced by an auction house as well as a &quot;public game&quot; button which only ever puts you with 1 other person. I actually like the idea of auction house. However, implementing a real money version of it just doesn&apos;t cut it. Aside from the social perspective, the gameplay itself is just bland. There is no character customization at all - no attribute points, no skill tress, etc. The only differences between characters are only the selection of the skills and the gear itself. I understand that some may argue there is customization in terms of picking which skills you use, but keep in mind that SELECTION differs from CUSTOMIZATION. The lack of customization prevents players from being attached to their characters, and this causes players get bored easily. The other part of &quot;customization&quot; in D3 is related to gear. However, the gear-farming system is just too broken. Blue (magic) equipment can even be better than Legendary (Unique) items because of the random stats that Legendary items give. What&apos;s the point of gear farming then if I could just buy items off the auction house? Oh right, I forgot that Blizard makes a % profit per auction house trade. Quests are too simple and straight forward; they&apos;re either &quot;go through the dungeon&quot; or &quot;kill this monster&quot;. There is no sidequest; you have to follow the storeline almost 90% of the time. One other thing that pisses me off is that you&apos;re not really encouraged to freely warp to maps other than your primary quest location because it does not give you any incentive - drop rates are crappy and you only get a decent amount of EXP if you finish the quests. The connection required requirement is also a concern, but it doesn&apos;t really affect me because I&apos;m more into the multiplayer aspect of the game. Graphics are nice. Sound and BGM are okay. Overall, if you&apos;re used to be an avid player of Diablo 2, do not purchase this game because it will disappoint you. This is an extremely overhyped game. If only Blizzard were to focus on funding on the development of the game instead advertisements...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2412149">Expand</a></span>

Try everything you hate about MMOs and none of the stuff you like. In a single player game. And god help you if you log into public games. Hacking is unbelievably common. people logging in and stealing your stuff. Fortunately Blizzard will happily sell you an authenticator for six bucks. Do not buy this game. Or, if you must, first search for &quot;5 Creepy Ways video games are trying to get you hooked&quot;, an article from cracked. Read that and understand that this is all diablo is about. Addictive treadmilling. You have no significant customization options, no significant means to influence your characters build (No Knife and dagger Demon Hunters... not if you don&apos;t want to die every encounter). At best you get dualwield, sword and board, or two hander... and even the differences between these two are negligible. What I&apos;m trying to say here is that the play is extremely shallow. It lacks any kind of depth and if you&apos;ve followed the diablo mythology for any length of time you&apos;ll pretty much know exactly how it&apos;ll end about ten, maybe fifteen minutes in. This is not an exaggeration. I figured it out roughly that quickly. However, if you&apos;re dumber than a box of hammers you&apos;ll get to learn the exact same thing I figured out about 20 hours later when you&apos;ve completed the game. All that&apos;s left is higher difficulty. Mind you, higher difficulty doesn&apos;t really unlock any significant new options (you have character progression til sixty but you&apos;ll beat the game on normal around 30)... The critics were either bought and paid for or too terrified of knocking blizzards new MMO. I cannot stress this enough. This game is an enormous con job the likes to which, in roughly 20 years+ of gaming) I&apos;ve never seen before.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2440942">Expand</a></span>

The only improvement in my eyes is that you now pick up gold by walking over it instead of having to click on every single pile. The addition of forcing you to have a constant connection to the servers is annoying and should never have been implemented. I was never one to play D2 online and I only ever played with friends when we were on a LAN so forcing me to connect to Blizzard servers is extremely annoying. They have issues, have maintenance, or any other issues and all of a sudden I can&apos;t play a game I paid for. I honestly think that D2 is a better game solely because I can play it without an internet connection.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2483159">Expand</a></span>

All I wanted was an action role playing game that I could enjoy for a few gaming sessions.<br>And what happened? First, I was in a QUEUE. Yes, the servers where full and I couldn&apos;t play the game. Not even in single player.<br>After HOURS of waiting, I finally got to play the game. The first thing I noticed was some kind of strange blur filter, which made the graphics blurry all the time. I looked for a fix online, because you couldn&apos;t turn it of in the options. The only thing I found was a graphic mod, but Blizzard said you would get banned if they catch you using it.<br>So, I had the choice of playing the game with a bad looking filter or risk getting banned. I chose the first option and tried to not look at the screen for more than an hour. But while playing, I noticed that you couldn&apos;t skill or built your character like in Diablo 1+2 or similar action role playing games. You get every skill during level ups and perks like in call of duty. That&apos;s nice and all, but I got really bored of playing the game after a few hours.<br>I picked it up again today and found no motivation playing this at all anymore. I forced myself to finish it on normal difficulty, took me about 5-6 hours while exploring everything. The first act is kinda boring, act 2 get a lot better, act 3 and act 4 are a joke in terms of length. The levels are very linear, and you just run along corridors, without much to explore.<br>I was really hyped for the game and this is one of the biggest disappointments in video game history for me. I still can&apos;t believe they legalized item/gold-selling with the real money auction house, giving Chinese farmers a legitimate platform for virtual item selling. On top of that, players stop trading with valuable items and just try to sell them for real money.<br><br>I&apos;m feeling ripped of by Blizzard with this game and I can&apos;t even get my money back for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2387850">Expand</a></span>

The graphics may be severely dated, the gameplay might be lackluster and tedious at times, and there is extremely limited variety among random item modifiers -- but the game is still fun -- although perhaps not $60-fun. I recommend it to people who are head over heels in love with the Diablo series but nobody else.<br><br>The game has plenty of great details, such as the fantastic-looking environments and animations despite the outdated graphics engine. The gameplay is fun, but it gets tedious very quickly -- Normal / Nightmare difficulties are way too easy, and Hell / Inferno are nothing more than inflated difficulty (insanely high HP/Damage) that require you to grind for better gear. The only new enemies you fight are ones that have gimmick abilities you must dodge (like of like a mario party minigame) and aren&apos;t actually any more difficult AI-wise. Really, they could have done a lot more in the 6+ years of development.<br><br>My issues with the game seem to be endless at times. The always-online DRM, the constant server problems and lag, frame-drops (my computer can handle most games at maxed GFX, but I still get frame-drops in Diablo 3), no PvP on launch, and I digress. One of my biggest complaints is that the auction house is a miserable excuse for a way to exchange items between players; with clunky searching options, maximum of 10 auctions at a time, and you cannot take items down once you&apos;ve put them up -- so they are stuck there for 2 days unless they sell. So all in all, not the worst purchase I&apos;ve ever made, but it&apos;s definitely one of the biggest let-downs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2410343">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Always online DRM is lag filled and further ruins the experience.   I&apos;ve literally lost track of the number of times I have died directly due to server lag.   In a game like Diablo, thats ALL action, where every tenth of  second matters...having a constant 150-200 ms connection ruins the game.

But as a sequel to D2, it is a major disappointment. After spending 4+ years of promising the community that this was the best Diablo ever, Blizzard finally released this dumbed down, incomplete, buggy, boring, un-fun abomination. I really don&apos;t need to repeat what&apos;s wrong with this game: just go to the BattleNet forums. There are many, many well reasoned posts like this [http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/6246475567] outlining the flaws in this game, and some pretty decent fixes proposed by the community. Sadly, Blizzard isn&apos;t listening. Equally, the so-called &quot;critics&quot; have failed the community. Only Armchair Empire [http://www.ae-infinite.com/2012/06/review-diablo-iii-pc.html] got it right.

<br>The game is lackluster, its missing its polish that is normally apparent in Blizzard games.  Holes in the story line, broken promises (PvP), silly voice acting, obvious testing issues, and a general lack of customer feedback has destroyed this games chances of becoming great.  Most of us bought Diablo 3, because it was Diablo.  The teasers, the beta, the screenshots, the game box, and hell the website all lead us to believe we were getting something that we just plain did not receive.  For those of you who got refunds or are selling items on the RMAH to get your money back, more power to you.
<br>
<br>Some say gamers today are &quot;entitled&quot;, and that the developers / creators spent hundreds of days making this game for us.  We are entitled, we have opinions, we have voices, we have choices. All people are born with this ability and use it everyday.  We all spend our hard earned money on consumer products; food, entertainment, transportation, etc.  When we don&apos;t get what we were promised or expecting, we demand a refund, or we don&apos;t return. Just because its a &quot;game&quot; doesn&apos;t excuse Blizzard from falsely advertising a product and releasing a retail game that is obviously a product that is reminiscent of an open beta.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2486575">Expand</a></span>

While a great attempt at recreating what made it&apos;s predecessors so successful, this game is bogged down ultimately by one thing, the Auction House.
<br>
<br>What made Diablo fun, was the excitement of finding new and unique gear, and the auction house has taken that hunt away from players.  The best gear is flooded into the market and players are transported far beyond what they normally would find.  Then, instead of a major upgrade every few hours of play, all the player has to look forward to is a minor one, every few days.
<br>
<br>The real money auction house has done even worse.  It has made balance more important to the developers than the feeling of power that made Diablo so much fun to play.  If you find a great way to slaughter the denizens of evil within the world of Diablo, you can count on the developers &quot;fixing&quot; it, to protect the balance of the auction house.
<br>
<br>Perhaps it can be salvaged into something close to it&apos;s predecessors, but not likely while the auction house remains.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s hope that it becomes clear to the developers.  Lets hope they are humble enough to listen and hear.  The game has potential, but it hasn&apos;t reached it yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2606968">Expand</a></span>

Its not about difficulty lvl - fresh after getting to 60 i geared up from ah with like 1 mil gold and act 1 was easy mode. First time i did it died maybe few times entire act, had to skip one elite pack that had too nasty skills for my class. Constant connection? Meh, dced few times in total so its not a biggie . But cant imagine playing in hardcore. One dc/lag and you&apos;re done... Increased repair bills ? As i said i don&apos;t die that much. What i REALLY HATE is how I&apos;m forced to use ah all the time. During leveling if you don&apos;t use ah then you will find yourself running in gear thats for 20-30 lvls lower. Good luck with that. As lvl 60 i have ONE item that dropped from monster i killed. Other then that every single piece of equipment came from ah. Is that how games suppose to be played? I don&apos;t think so. I don&apos;t mind farming, played Korean mmo for almost 3 years ... but i need to know that there&apos;s some reward waiting for me in the end. What diablo offers? Ability to sell my gear at rmah once I&apos;m done with it? I don&apos;t need to make money out of games, it suppose to be fun not work. If i spent 10 hours in game killing monsters and in the end i don&apos;t have even one item i can equip then whats the point. Why as lvl 60 in highest difficulty 80% of my drops are for low lvls? Another 19 has some messed up stats. Maybe 1% is worth selling in ah... Diablo feels to me more like on line market simulator than action RPG. Sure you can play the market, get rich, buy best stuff available in game but ... I rather play something else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2408279">Expand</a></span>

<br>The youtube videos from 2008 have more content that the current game for some reason. It was a great game for a while, but as something I expected to play all summer and having the Diablo namesake, it failed miserably.

<br>Finally they did what players wanted. They made the game about loot. It still gets tedious very quickly solo player, but the new Adventure mode is great to play with friends</span>

(keep in mind, online &quot;professional&quot; sites get money from the Companies they review.  Big titles always are rated well, even when we know they suck.  A positive rating is easy to buy.)<br><br>The Money Shop is why you MUST play On-line for a SOLO game.  You must always connect to the internet to play.  No matter what.  To cater to people that like to Pay to Win.  Pay to Win.  Blizz supports it and built the entire game around it.  You don&apos;t do it, you will be left behind.  Have fun with that if you can.<br><br>WoW&apos;s success and Starcraft and Diablo mean Blizz can do many things wrong for a few years and people will still eat it up.  Just like Final Fantasy can do almost anything and get a hit, Blizz can produce mediocre content and get people to buy.<br><br>If you read the perfect score reviews, notice they say D3 is not as good as D2.  They rate D3 a &quot;10&quot; but then call a game OVER 12 YEARS OLD AS BETTER!  Really?  But D3 is still a 10?  Graphics are cartoony.  You are Bugs Bunny battling the armies of Elmer Fudd.  Welcome to Looney Tunes.  Gone are the serious tones of Diablo.  The graphics are also low quality.  Animations are jumpy (not smooth) making it look like a beta still.  Your character has no customization.  Is this a 2012 game or 1999?  People are blaming &quot;kids&quot; for the poor reviews.  Kids didn&apos;t play D2.  D3 is the first experience they&apos;d have, so if they were kids, it would be positive remarks.  People next blame fans of D2 for the hate of D3.  D2 is old, and no one wants to play that anymore.  They want better.  Instead, they get a game aimed at children.  If people are hating D3 for not being superior to D2, something is very wrong with the game.<br><br>The game is short.  Very short.  Beyond short.  And easy.  I could go on and on about why it is just sup-par Pay to Win crap.  But I&apos;ll leave it at this: Wait until the game has been out for 2-3 years and is patched up, then buy it for $10-15.  It is NOT worth the over-priced buggy junk that it is now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2411605">Expand</a></span>

A LOT of problems. Broken servers, broken AH, weird performance issues. I play on a heavily overclocked 2500k with Crossfire 6950 GPUs. Day one, horrible stuttering when entering games. I even had stuttering on pre-rendered cinematics, and that bug still exists today. There is a bizarre bug with v-sync that if I ever drop below 60 FPS even for half a second, my FPS either gets cut in half to 30 for several seconds, or keeps going at 60 FPS as if v-sync was suddenly turned of. This turns the game into a juddery piece of s*** when it occurrs and totally ruins the experience. That bug STILL EXISTS TODAY and has been well-documented. How do things like this happen with a game that had the budget they did? I really don&apos;t get it.
<br>
<br>The game itself is okay. In general the classes are fun to play. The &apos;story&apos; is a complete travesty. I don&apos;t know who wrote this thing, but the story and delivery are on par with something like...&quot;The Room&quot;. How many times does Kulle have to telegraph that he&apos;s going to betray you by laughing maniacally every time he finishes talking? What really killed the game was itemization. You basically have to win the lottery to find an item that is any good or even worth selling. Inferno was so challenging at launch that most people never made it past act 1. People depended on broken specs and exploits to get through. Botters and exploiters have absolutely ruined the gold economy. Items that would be a solid upgrade for me now cost 50 million gold or higher. There is something truly effed when I can&apos;t buy an item that would really be a good upgrade when I&apos;m sitting on 35 million gold. And guess what. You can&apos;t gain a lot of gold unless you sell a really kickass item. But wait, remember that the loot rolls are so random that I play a few hours every day with a good amount of MF and find an item that sells for around 10 million gold...oh, about once a month.
<br>
<br>Lately, Blizzard has shown some interest in making things better. The 1.05 patch and 1.04 really seem to put forth some effort to improve the experience. However, for many players it&apos;s just too little, too late. Seriously, it&apos;s months later, and the changes in these last 2 patches should have been what the game launched with. Still no PvP or even word when it should be expected.
<br>
<br>I actually still have fun with the game, so that&apos;s something. They seem to be committed to fixing the problems and what players don&apos;t like. But until that really happens, I can only give this game an average rating. Maybe with the expansion (and we all know one is coming) they will get it right from the start. After the utter s***fest that is Mists of Pandaland, I&apos;m not holding my breath.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2653070">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been a big fan of Blizzard since Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, and some of their SNES games.  All the way up to World of Warcraft, and, to a lesser extent, Starcraft II.<br><br>I&apos;m not a fan of Diablo 3.  And I&apos;m not a fan of the direction that Activision has taken Blizzard in.<br><br>Diablo 3 is a game that favors quantity over quality.  It provides just enough (repeating) content to keep you going, but below the surface, none of that content is particularly interesting or enjoyable.  In that sense, Diablo 3 truly shares more in common with the later years of WoW than it does with previous Diablo games.<br><br>Some insight as to why I say this: the item system has been completely revamped.  Rather than interesting on-hit spell effects like you might see in the previous Diablo games, Diablo 3 focuses on watching numbers grow larger.  Items that add two stats (+DEX + VIT) are supposed to impress you more than items that add one stat (+DEX).  And, of course, three-stat items you&apos;re supposed to believe are the holy grail.  Legendary items, which are some of the hardest to find, are most times inferior to magical items, which are found every thirty seconds or so.<br><br>Most of the game&apos;s social features have been removed.  Searching for a multiplayer game is completely random, so you have no idea what your co-op buddies have in mind for their goals in playing.  Whether they&apos;re going on boss runs or clearing whole areas, or what.<br><br>And Diablo 3 includes the worst possible type of DRM.  Always-online.  Meaning that your play is entirely determinate on whether or not Blizzard can manage to keep their servers up.  Spoiler alert: most of the time they can&apos;t.<br><br>The bottom line is that Blizzard no longer knows how to make a proper Diablo game without the assistance of the former Blizzard North staff.  They&apos;ve paved the way for other aRPGs from other developers to take the throne.  My new personal favorite, and shining example of aRPG done right, is the game Krater.  I suggest you check it out on Steam.  Other good upcoming games in the same genre are Torchlight 2 and Path of Exile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2457728">Expand</a></span>

Diablo 3 is a perfect example of exactly what a sequel shouldn&apos;t be - Toned down gameplay, &quot;b-b-but the graphics are better!!!&quot;<br><br>What redeeming qualities could this game possibly have that warrant a score higher than a 0? Could it be the heavily restrictive DRM? Could it be the pay to win BS? I feel like this &quot;game&quot; was bought more by people who are interested in the political / business sides of gaming, and the DRM that would finally be the end of piracy (which obviously isn&apos;t even true). It&apos;s like they bought it out of some kind of distorted, false interpretation of &quot;morality&quot;, rather than to play a game.<br><br>Diablo 3 is also a perfect example of why many people feel classic gaming is superior. The idea used to be &quot;This company is providing a game that I am interested in. Therefore, I will buy it so that hopefully they will make more in the future. I like to have fun!&quot; But now the idea of &quot;gaming&quot; is &quot;Wow, this company sure did rape us all in the ass really hard! Now I&apos;m going to go on the internet and accuse anyone who didn&apos;t buy it of being self-entitled!&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/diablo-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2428843">Expand</a></span>
