The gameplay in Loadout has a very Quake/Unreal Tournament feel to it in that you are almost constantly moving and accuracy is something of an after thought. You play from a third person viewpoint so you can see around corners and such a lot easier. Not that it makes much difference since you will pretty much be sprinting your butt off for most of the match.
<br>
<br>The game is free to play with an in game market that is purely for cosmetic items. Definitely not a pay to win type of game. All items that affect the actual game can be bought with resources that you earn from gameplay. Guns can be customized in crazy ways. Want a shotgun that heals you friends? Done. How about a gun that shoots spiked metal guns at are electrified? Done. While you start out with fairly basic items, they can quickly be customized to fit your play preferred playstyle.
<br>
<br>There are several different game types. Each which add a fun twist on familiar concepts (for example, the flag in CTF is a giant hammer that can kill enemies). Right now, the only downer is the lack of maps. Right now you a bit limited since certain other modes are unavailable right now.
<br>
<br>The reason this game didn&apos;t score higher is that, while it has its fun moments, it also gets boring kind of quickly. The run and gun type of gameplay will give you a rush at first but after you figure out most of the game mechanics and see the loadouts that other players have you start to get a feel for what are the best mixes and matches in terms of weaponry.
<br>
<br>The game is also in desperate need of a tutorial that teaches players the objectives of the different game types. Too many maps has my team lost because most of them don&apos;t understand the overall objective of the game and instead just go for kills. Also, the feel to the community is turning a bit toxic since lots of the &quot;good&quot; players would rather berate teammates with insults and underhanded comments.
<br>
<br>All in all, the game is at the least worth a try since its free but don&apos;t set your expectations too high. You find a game with a lot of action, gore, and nudity (albeit censored but rather poorly at that) but very little else. Its a bit of a hit and miss game. I&apos;ll probably play periodically from now on but probably not dedicate too much time to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3955642">Expand</a></span>

The dodging and ads aiming make it seem like a very fast gears of war game which I really dig. Decent graphics and animations. Viable gun choices are kinda weak and possibly the worst part of the gameplay. They tried to make it so there are tons of options but really there are only a few decent gun configurations which results in having less viable guns than UT. I love me a good arena shooter and I will certainly keep playing this for maybe a month but they are going to need a lot more content and gun choices to keep me interested. People that say this are pay to win are most likely just bad at the game. I&apos;ve played about 30 matches and so far I&apos;ve seen no evidence of pay to win.  I do quite well with the stock assault rifle and a modified 3 round rocket launcher which can be purchased after 2-3 matches.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3984411">Expand</a></span>

It does have micro-transactions but they are for outfits and boosters. The gun customization is great but it is not fully taken advantage of. I highly recommend to try it.</span>

<br>
<br>The huge draw of Loadout is the ability to make your own weapons, which is simple to do using the in game currency used for simply playing the game, and the process can be sped up by the use of real money. The issue is that there is very little point in making anything but something with shotgun spread or an assault rifle. Like most games nowadays, the fast paced confusion of Loadout means that you either want to take out an opponent in one shot at close quarters, or spray and pray to land as many hits as possible. Because of this, it boils down to everyone essentially using the same four guns in order to win. The same is true for the grenades, which are not customized outside of their initial ability.
<br>
<br>For example, the fire grenade does the damage of a regular grenade, but also sets the target on fire, which may or may not go out as the target rolls. This is never adequately explained, and many times I found myself rolling around like an idiot as I slowly burned to death, and seemingly couldn&apos;t stop it.
<br>
<br>Another issue is that the level design is all over the place. Many levels force plays to huddle into small areas the size of a pack of gum, obviously trying to make the grenades in the game useful. Unfortunately, this leads to frustrating deaths as someone&apos;s grenade destroys your entire team, and there is very little you can actually do to stop them. Other levels are so large that they take MINUTES to traverse, and they are capture the flag maps, leading to stalemates as the games just drag on and on.
<br>
<br>There are three playable characters, which are entirely cosmetic. This is fine. However, in order to customize them, huge amounts of real-word money must be used. This leads to characters either all looking the exact same (and using the same taunt, which plays extremely irritating music), or someone with a 30 dollar character looking so ugly that your eyes burn.
<br>
<br>On the plus side, this game is funny most of the time. Most of the jokes gave me a snicker the first time, and watching my character bounce around with a colossal hole in his chest, with his heart and organs jiggling around inside of his torso gave me a dark chuckle. Unfortunately, watching a fat woman twerk is only funny the first time, and very quickly grates on your nerves from the constant chaos and unavoidable deaths.
<br>
<br>The graphics, as a whole, are fun and appealing, even if they seem like something concocted from a Team Fortress 2 fever dream. The music is appealing, the game is pretty, and it is even fun for short sprints. However, the horrendous balance, appalling level design which seems to be trying to invoke the chaotic energy of 90s FPSs (including all of the worst parts), and repetitive fart-humor began to ware on my nerves very quickly. If these things get patched out, the game might hover around a 7 or so. Until then, I have to give Loadout a 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=4093472">Expand</a></span>

The server issues are fixed now and the game is loads of fun. It&apos;s not pay to win in any way. Its very skill based. And its freaking funny and loads of fun. And guess what? ITS FREE! I can say with certainty that it is among the best F2P games out there.</span>

Second, character customization.  In this day and age, this becomes a must for games of this ilk.  Theirs is definitely full of funny sight gags and ridiculous costumes, again, it being such a new game, it needs time to really be opened up, but it is on the right track.  The costumes cost a pretty hefty chunk based on how much those points cost to buy, but they&apos;re still figuring out their system.  Otherwise, this is a great game.  Fun, easy time sink.  If you like shooters, this is definitely worth the play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3954777">Expand</a></span>

Especially If you&apos;re the type that can&apos;t take getting stomped for a long-ass time in a game until you figure stuff out. By the time it has all it&apos;s features everyone is going to be leagues ahead of where they are now, and it&apos;s already pretty rough for noobs in this game. You will die a lot when you first start playing. I died a lot for the first month I played until I figured out how to move better and make a good gun. I have a feeling a few of these really low reviews got stomped early on and raged. Just a hunch. This game is recommended by the youtubers: RoosterTeeth and TotalBiscuit. TB even remarked that the Weapon Customization system is quite possibly the best he&apos;s ever seen in a game of this type.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3959165">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t believe the BS when people call it a &quot;Team Fortress 2 clone&quot;, it plays almost nothing like TF2 for better or worse.
<br>
<br>Loadout really plays a lot more like a mix between Gears of War&apos;s multiplayer death match and Borderland with it&apos;s whacky and incredible gun customization. Loadout boldly takes the approach of allowing you to make your own weapon. You&apos;d think that&apos;s make things incredibly unbalanced, but honestly I haven&apos;t really found an &apos;unfair&apos; moment yet. The shooting is fast, frantic, and very enjoyable.
<br>
<br>The game is also the best kind of Free-to-play, as well. There&apos;s no pay to win here, but there are loads of free customization options to unlock if you choose to support the developer...and in my opinion, they do deserve it.
<br>
<br>Scoring this title less than a 7 or so is like punching a gift horse in the face, and I don&apos;t know what entitled moron would complain about getting a game like this for free.
<br>
<br>Give Loadout a try, you might love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3967063">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is next gen, not your typical shooter like cod, it has platforming different types of weapons different powerups truly captures what FPS is supposed to be at its core. I grew up playing quake, ut2k4 halo 2 battlefield and I can say this is what will make the genre come back again, this game right here. There is also different types of game modes suited for different gun types so everyone has a chance to shine, lots of customization, equipments, its a whole another wacky world of gaming this game offers so much for free I feel bad for not paying. It also has a semi moba mode where you can upgrade player damage,defense or healing, and you coordinate objectives with your teammates. The cosmetics are hilarious, there is a penis, there is twerking, mocking golf clap, fedoras, suits, teabag taunts and the smooth criminal. Truly a superb customization for the characters. The only thing I do not like about the game is the fact that the studio is so small and limited amount of resources, this game has so much potential and I wish more people were interested to see it blossom into one of the greatest games ever made. There are a couple of bugs encountered here and there but if you like shooting games, hell if you even like mobas you can come try it out because if you don&apos;t you are missing out on one of the most fun games ever made. - sinnen</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3949123">Expand</a></span>

Now for the positives. Want gore you got it, want nudity you got it, want customization you got it , kill a rival and want to tea bag his body you got it, want to do the carlton dance you got it , loadout offers so much fun the only way for me to explain it is you have to try out the game yourself. Think of loadout as a mixture of tf2 graphics and silliness with borderlands 2 troll references and gun customization. The develops are in constant talk with the community hell check for yourself on the steam community hub, if a major bug or issue pops out 8/10 it will have a developer response.

The game focuses a lot on making your own gun and having your own play style. this sounds like it&apos;s going to be a massively unbalanced game with some people destroying the other team, but somehow they made it so that you can do good in the game no matter what loadout you have.
<br>The game have very vertical maps that fit well with the floaty jumping and rolling. All the maps have different routes you can go to get to your objective and sometimes you will have to improvise to get out of a sticky situation.
<br>Since this is a F2P game you can expect some micro transactions but they will not help you much in making progress in the game. the guns you start out with are one of the most powerful guns in the game, you can spent real money on customizing your character but it won&apos;t give you any advantage.
<br>
<br>i really recommend that you at least try out this game. it&apos;s a fun game to play with your friends.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3955606">Expand</a></span>

<br>The gameplay is a throwback to &quot;classic&quot; shooters with a lot of jumping around, shooting often ridiculous guns at each other and completing team objectives which require you to move around the map a lot.
<br>
<br>Between the matches you are expected to customize your weapons to suit your tastes. The customization can get pretty fairly with each gun comprised of several parts each providing modifiers which add up to the final gun. This includes changing ammo types for new effects and how the shooting itself behaves (such as semi-auto, burst fire, auto, spooling, etc..), the sights and other aspects. There is also a big list of usable items you can get, starting with grenades and expanding to things like turrets, mines, medkits and so on.
<br>
<br>The only problem I have with the weapon customization is most of the parts are locked away in a tech tree, I wish they were just all open to use from the start so you can build the gun you want to try right away rather than waiting, it would suit this classic shooter type of game a lot more. It does not take too long to get to the parts you want though so it&apos;s not a huge issue.
<br>
<br>The game modes are fun and pretty varied with some variations of modes you will have seen in other shooters but usually with their own little spin. The flag in capture the flag is a limited use superweapon which destroys everyone around you if you time it right, the loot in their loothorde mode is dangerously explosive (and thowable) and the deathmatch requires that you collect a drop off your kills or the kill doesn&apos;t count (and this can be denied). It&apos;s a good mix and they just added a new mode which combines a lot of those modes together in a supermode.
<br>
<br>Your character can be customized to a high degree, with so many parts, many of which are funny references or shout-outs to other games, movies, or whatever. It&apos;s highly entertaining BUT the cosmetic pieces cost a slightly insane amount of money. The prices really need to be brought down or maybe there could be some sales with big discounts. I can&apos;t see myself spending anything on cosmetics which cost so much.
<br>
<br>On the bright side, you can&apos;t directly buy any of the gun bits and combat items with real money so it&apos;s just the cosmetic stuff people pay for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3947640">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Good map design.
<br>
<br>Fun modes with clever tweaks to the classics like TDM &amp; CTF, all team based 4v4.
<br>
<br>Varied weapon building mode that allows you to create essentially any gun type (however, some combos require component leveling to work properly; ex. charged 1-shot sniper rifle deals barely less than lethal damage to begin with).
<br>
<br>Completely free to play -- pay for features include standard XP &amp; currency boosters as well as a robust 14-slot cosmetic system (cosmetic items can be earned in first win of the day as well outside of the pay system).
<br>
<br>The initial launch was hindered by server issues as there were up to 30k concurrent players. Server issues are not completely gone, but they have been significantly reduced.
<br>
<br>There is currently only an automatic matchmaker and no server selection tool at the moment.
<br>
<br>There is a leveling component to both the user and each individual weapon component (unique to each base weapon type; that is to say a rifle slug ammo levels up separately from a beam slug ammo). Component leveling is a two-edged sword, as being matched vs players with high level weapons do provide a moderate disadvantage, while the leveling provides a persistent RPG-like goal system. Leveled weapon differences vary and generally are not extremely lopsided -- a whole tier above does about 5-10% more damage, but that difference can change some few weapons from being ineffective to quite effective.
<br>
<br>The movement system has some interesting quirks, such as rolling then jumping allows for a high jumps. Rolling while on fire will reduce and possibly remove burning.
<br>
<br>The devs are constantly updating the game and servers as well as being quite transparent with their operation by keeping in regular contact with the players.
<br>
<br>---
<br>Final review notes: I have had a lot of fun with the game and haven&apos;t spent any money on it yet. There are some weapons that are just simply easier to use and can be irritating when overused. Not all weapon builds are viable initially and require some component leveling to have work properly. There are 1-shot kill weapons in the game, however they&apos;re generally the most risky to use. Good players can quickly seem overpowered in Loadout, but they&apos;re not because of their weapon level, but because they know how the game works, know how to move, and are a good shot. :D (playing vs someone who can consistently get headshots is annoying, as in any game). Despite the leveling system, Loadout is still a skill based game.
<br>
<br>---
<br>Speculation: Apparently more weapon components, maps, and characters will be added in the future, so hopefully those will keep population more-or-less constant, as the biggest issue, I find, with any shooter is a divergence in population, especially between map related DLCs or expansions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3952788">Expand</a></span>

<br>Most of the professional reviews have disappointed me greatly, equating this game as just a copy of team fortress 2. Two have mentioned connection problems. All I can say is that I have been playing since the game hit steam and have had no problems with matchmaking aside from getting thrown into a game in progress that&apos;s already been lost, which is pretty standard for this genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3954101">Expand</a></span>

Loadout, on the other hand, manages to create a fun game while still being free to play. That being said, while loadout is not pay to win, the game does push you to pay for things. You can only unlock a maximum of three loadouts and six gunslots without paying, and doing so takes an incredibly long time, but if you are willing to pay you can buy weaponslots, loadouts and  boosters in order to upgrade your weapons faster. The actual gameplay is quite fun, but there is no tutorial and also no singleplayer type of gameplay, so if you are new to third person shooters like loadout or do not know the controls, expect to have a harder time in learning, although I did not have too much trouble learning. There is also a limited number of maps and they do not feel unique. Loadout is definitly worth getting for its price, just don&apos;t expect it to be a jaw-dropping,  worth playing thousands of hours type of game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3962933">Expand</a></span>

Easily one of the best F2P game out there and I recommend it to everyone. Sorry mac users, but you&apos;ll have to wait for an update or something. Also, you can customize your character a la Team Fortress 2. You have a variety of choices to make you gun. There are different game modes and I hope more will eventually be released. The reason why I give a 9 out of 10 is that there aren&apos;t a lot of game mode as of today. Still very good, graphically non-thirsty, fluid gameplay. If you have space to download this game, download it, it&apos;s worth the space.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3958985">Expand</a></span>

Making use of a smooth, fluid, and fast movement system Loadout plays nothing like the average CoD clone. Gameplay focuses on movement mechanics combined with a wide variety of weapon mechanics. Hitscan domination is not the name of this game!
<br>
<br>The game prides itself on its weapon system allowing for immense customization of your killing utensils. This isn&apos;t cosmetic customization either (though that IS coming), but rather mechanical and statistic differentiation. Want a 6 barreled homing rocket launcher delivering flak tesla payloads? Well look no more. The options are near endless and the weapons all behave differently with varying pros and cons. No more false variety that games like CoD deliver en masse. This is real customization.
<br>
<br>The art style is over the top, crude, cartoony, and immature done surprisingly stylishly. Animations are slick and enjoyable all around. The game is colorful yet graphic. There is a lot of humor of the crass and immature variety sprinkled in by the developers, but it creates an enjoyable atmosphere.
<br>
<br>The game is still young in its development as the dev team has promised continuing support as long as it remains economically viable. New weapon systems, improved matchmaking, additional customization options, ladders, clan support, and much more is all coming. Still, the game is already worth checking out.
<br>
<br>An arena shooter better has not been made than loadout has not been made for ~ 10 years. The modern touches are welcomed, and once all the bells and whistles are added this will truly be the king of arena shooters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3972453">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The gameplay is chaotic, with a great selection of weapons and customisations, while still all falling under the great core principles of game weaponry: splash damage launcher, hitscan laser, hitscan projectiles, projectile projectiles (&quot;pulses&quot;).
<br>
<br>Minus one point for relatively poor matchmaking (no way to browse games and often slow).
<br>Minus one point for being a F2P, even though it&apos;s largely cosmetic, you can still buy Blutes and get advanced equipment faster than others (although this is a convinience, not an outright advantage).
<br>
<br>Really enjoying the game so far, give it a go now. The clever combat and movement system allows for some ridiculously fun maneuvers which add a heavy tactical flair. I&apos;ve played rounds which have been utter explosive chaos, and others where each team lay in quiet wait, progressing in packs and taking cover to spring ambushes and quick kills.
<br>
<br>Great fun, and it&apos;s free. Grab it now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3945702">Expand</a></span>

This game has a high skill ceiling, and it&apos;s apparent who in these reviews is at the bottom of the food chain. This game is a totally solid shooter, is a play-to-win free game (not pay-to-win,) and emulates games like Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament with its blazing fast pace and precision gun play.  The icing on the cake? Players use guns they assemble themselves. It&apos;s totally awesome, and worth playing. I got on here expecting a 8-9 user score for this game. I am totally blown away that it is a 4.4 at the time of this review.

<br>It&apos;s like TF2, Gunz, Quake, and UT3 had a bastard son. If you&apos;re a fan of frenetic shooters, definitely take a look at Loadout. The only things that can be purchased for real money are cosmetic/convenience items, so it&apos;s nowhere near pay-to-win.

<br>Loadout is a fast paced 3rd person shooter that has one of the most diverse weapon crafting systems I&apos;ve ever seen in a game. It&apos;s incredibly in-depth and you&apos;ll be spending a good amount of time crafting new weapons and seeing if you can improve them in any way possible.
<br>The level design in this game is superb. There are heaps of jumps, pathways and buildings to traverse across and almost everything in every level can be used to your advantage. Need to drop a nade on a capture point? Throw it at the pipe above the point so it bounces down and demolishes your enemies. Although there are only 5 maps atm, they&apos;re extremely well put together and you&apos;ll never get sick of them.
<br>
<br>Now, for the bad bits.
<br>Fights can seem one sided a LOT of the time. That guy you tried to kill couldn&apos;t possibly die because he has a shield and a launcher that kills you in two hits. It makes creative weapons seem unnecessary since all the simple guns do a really good job at killing the enemy team.
<br>Even though the weapon crafting is diverse, a lot of the gun pieces are redundant and add little to no difference in how your gun works. Sometimes, there&apos;s no point in using a specific piece because there is another that does a way better job.
<br>There are some really big balancing issues that can make every game you&apos;re in feel boring or frustrating. Beams that kill you in 3 hits; launchers that kill you in 2. You&apos;ll be seeing that a LOT. However, not every player uses them and games can be a lot of fun. It&apos;s just that they could be a lot more fun if the weapons were better balanced.
<br>
<br>tl;dr: You should definitely check out Loadout if you&apos;re into faced paced shooters, despite its few flaws</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3944684">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I have experienced these problems myself, however I&apos;ve looked past this and have also experienced the most fun I&apos;ve had in a free to play game in a long time. Games are fast paced with plenty of ways to kill and be killed. Weapon creation and modification allows players to personalize their loadout as they wish and think of the most creative or possibly offensive weapon names before entering the battlefield. Use of skill trees allows players to unlock weapon upgrades with experience earned during matches however this is not a grind. After playing a few games I found myself able to purchase the upgrades I wanted.
<br>
<br>his game IS NOT a pay to win, with all weapon modifications unlocked through experience rather than real world money. The game makes it&apos;s money however through character customization, and it is this that makes the game so hilarious to play. Ever wanted to run through a battlefield with your penis out? Well in Loadout you can do that buy purchasing this &quot;item of clothing&quot; from the in game store.  There are currently three characters to choose from, all of who can be customized with a large selection of items. Anything from Facial hear and masks to knee pads all with various options in each category. If you have the money to spend you can make a character that really suits you.
<br>
<br>The animations in this game are also great with plenty of cartoon style gore which can be turned off in the settings but why would you do that? ... Characters shot with rockets can run around with holes in their stomachs, burned players appear burned to a crisp, and body parts seem to be attached just by a thread all while the player is still alive and this makes dying slightly more enjoyable. Especially when you see your character raise a middle finger just before death. It is clear to see the developers have made humor a key feature in this game, especially with the vast amount of taunts available to purchase from the store. Forget tea bagging manually, just hit the taunt button and see your character humiliate your opponent without having to do a thing. There are plenty of these animations to choose from and multiple taunts can be set to one character so you can change things up when you please.
<br>
<br>This game offers various game modes such as a &quot;Capture the Flag&quot; like mode called Jackhammer where two teams fight to capture the hammer, which can also be used as a weapon while being escorted back to base. There is also general capture the point mode called Blitz where each team must fight over the designated control points in order to take control. As well as this there is a mode similar to kill confirmed in the Call of Duty series called Death Snatch. One of the more different game modes however is called Extraction and sets two teams against each other where their job is to collect Blutonium ore and deposit it to their team grinders. There is one set collector who is changed upon death, while the rest of the team attack or defend in order to win. These modes are a lot of fun however there could be more.
<br>
<br>This is not a professional review so don&apos;t expect me to get all of the points in however this is a genuinely brilliant and fun game, especially being free to play. And what makes it better is that you don&apos;t need to spend ANYTHING to have fun. As of now i haven&apos;t spent a penny and I love it. I would recommend this game to anyone and advise people not to listen to low scores based on bugs because these will be sorted.
<br>
<br>More game modes, more characters and more weapon classes would make this game better which is why i&apos;m giving it 8/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3945767">Expand</a></span>

Loadout is a very good free to play game in every sense. Everything that can effect gameplay like guns, their upgrades, and abilities like turrets and sheilds, can all be unlocked in a reasonable amount of time for free. Only cosmetic items such as hats, clothes, and taunts are purchasable.  This keeps it from being pay to win, as things that are required for you to buy are purely optional. I do think that purchasable items in the store however are a little overpriced (It runs about 8-10 dollars for one item), but there are two reasons I can kind of forgive this. First, it is only a little more expensive than price I already pay for other games like League of Legends and TF2. Second, there are bundles that cost more (20-50 dollars) but give you your moneys worth by giving you the equivalent dollar amount in its in game currency, xp boosts and exclusive full sets of items. Gameplay is fast and fun, and well balanced (The fact that everything is OP means nothing is). The only problem I have with this game is the fact that there isn&apos;t very much variety. There are only 4 gun types and three characters. Once leveling is done there isn&apos;t much else to do, and with only three characters everyone tends to look exactly the same unless you want to spend some serious cash on your avatar. So to wrap things up, this game is well worth your time. Even if you don&apos;t want to put money into it you can still enjoy it. The devs are still working on this title to improve it and add to it. So I hope that I can get on Metacritic again in the future and raise its score if they add a ton of new content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3956214">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Loadout is fast paced, gory and hilarious. Couple that with mind boggling weapon customization and you end up with a huge change of pace from other popular shooters. Also players can only buy cosmetic items with real money. In order to upgrade their weapons and do more damage, they actually have to PLAY to win. Its free to play so really there is no reason not to check it out.</span>

<br>HOWEVER, I feel that the game was rushed to release and that&apos;s where the negative reviews start pouring in. It lacks many features which just slaps a frown on my face. I wont even get mad over the server issues, the devs just weren&apos;t able to stand up to all the hype and the servers became over loaded.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3949098">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now, the main part of this game is the weapon customization. It is flawless. You want a Rocket launcher that burns players and has laser targeting? You can have that! You want a shotgun that zaps players? You can have that! The possibilities are like no other game.
<br>
<br>The Maps could use some more work, because most times playing a certain game mode where you need to capture a random flag, one team&apos;s spawn may be much closer than the other teams.
<br>
<br>The Character Customization is where the in-game currency comes in hand. The choices you have at the start are little to nothing, like having 1 hair style or no hair, ect. I love customizing characters in games to make him look as funny as i can. I can&apos;t really do that with the character customization. The currency pricing isn&apos;t that bad, though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3955975">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Ignore the reactionary 0 reviews from users that had matchmaking issues during those first few days after launch.
<br>
<br>Ignore those complaining about bland character models and everyone looking the same.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not the devs&apos; fault that most people are cheap and want as much as they can get without giving any remuneration in return for the devs&apos; creating a fluid, stylish, and highly polished f2p game.
<br>
<br>These people are apparently not clear on the f2p concept, or the idea that studios make games with the intention of getting some ROI for their efforts and should be rewarded accordingly if you actually enjoy the game.
<br>
<br>I have had no matchmaking issues, and I&apos;ve never had a disconnected game. I&apos;ve already dropped $20 for an outfit and week&apos;s exp boost, but I can easily see myself spending another $40 for a pair of outfits for the other characters and some boosts.
<br>
<br>Do yourself a favor: download it and try it for yourself.
<br>
<br>If you miss the frenetic days of old school shooters combined with a TF2 meets Borderlands meets Unreal meets Earthworm Jim atmosphere, then I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll be disappointed.
<br>
<br>if you don&apos;t end up liking it, then you can simply delete it without having spent a cent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3959567">Expand</a></span>

So far I&apos;ve played a fair number of hours and it&apos;s managed to keep my attention, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be playing it long term in the future.
<br>The game itself plays quite fluidly, albeit with furious mouse clicking and explosives spam, but the limited number of maps and game modes let it down a bit. Gun balance is also really up in the air because the customisation opens the field to overpowered combinations which actually end up reducing the number of viable weapons you can actually use.
<br>The game is fairly entertaining, but don&apos;t expect too much if you&apos;re playing on your own, because most of the fun comes from teaming up with friends. Also, the game is not very &apos;Free-2-Play&apos; , while you can download it without paying, the game is very limited unless you shell out some money to unlock more Loadout and weapon crafting slots.
<br>Overall, an entertaining game which is worth playing for a laugh, but don&apos;t expect to get too many hours out of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3969564">Expand</a></span>

<br>the buddy list is not working.

Default/starter weapons do virtually no damage, upgrades require multiple games to purchase, and do very little to improve weapons. I believe this is due to the ability to buy additional credits.

The graphics are fair enough (though unimpressive, this is permissible if it&apos;s not offensively bad or out of touch with the rest of the game). The game gives off a somewhat &quot;mobile game-y&quot; vibe around the menus, which in themselves are quite buggy and often unresponsive. The three avatars available without paying (real money in this case) are ugly as sin, and a lot of people use them. In other words, you&apos;ll spend a lot of time playing with 5-7 of your clones. The characters themselves have no personality.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s core concept revolves around creating weapons. Or rather, assembling them from a set of parts and 5 basic weapon types. It&apos;s certainly an interesting idea, but I feared for the balance. That fear turned out to be entirely justified. Entire weapon types perform so badly that they&apos;re virtually useless, and other configurations don&apos;t leave much standing. The way this works is based more on trial-and-error than on any kind of discernible logic. Since parts are expensive, you&apos;ll be at the mercy of more experienced players (whose weapons also outperform your own by a wide margin) for a long time.
<br>
<br>The core gameplay, unfortunately, is rather lacking. Map design is chaotic, illogical, and lacks direction. Due to the difficulty in weapon balance (compounded by skewed teams and often, map design), matches often end up a frustrating ordeal whether you win or lose. Due to the immense number of potential weapons, the game fails to give off the feeling that skill and strategy is rewarded to a greater extent than luck. Character movement around the map also seems rather buggy, and there are few indications of whether an area is passable or not. Gamemodes are largely standard (CTF, resource gathering(!), team deathmatch), but are sometimes confusing due to conflicting information.
<br>
<br>The controls are somewhat jumpy, but largely fairly hard to screw up.
<br>
<br>The music is... basically non-existent, which is actually fine.
<br>
<br>The game, while not actually &quot;pay-to-win&quot; (you can&apos;t purchase weapon parts at all), seems very intent on forcing purchases on you. Anything cosmetic will require you to pay real money, as will extra &quot;loadout slots&quot; (the only way to switch weapons during a game) - the 2 &quot;free&quot; ones are level-locked. These actually do make a difference, unlike the tacky avatars for sale.
<br>
<br>During the first few days after launch, the matchmaking server and &quot;Friends&quot; service have been offline a lot. This could probably have been avoided if the beta wasn&apos;t paid and if they&apos;d made more of an effort to actually stress-test their servers and infrastructure before unleashing thousands of players on them. Time will show whether they get it under control.
<br>
<br>The game is based on an interesting concept, but suffers from (quite predictable) balance issues and generally poor execution. Bugs like scoring for the opposite team should generally not be an issue when the game is out of Beta, the servers should be tested before launch, the user interface should definitely not frequently stop responding, and it wouldn&apos;t hurt if the entire game seemed slightly less eager to scramble for your credit card.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3946959">Expand</a></span>

<br>Imo the controls feel a bit inaccurate. And i felt like other players weapons did a lot more dmg then mine did (+ the capture the random point game mode seems to be won mostly by luck just hope the point your standing on will be the next to be captured). The Graphics are good and the game has a fun feel to it.

The free to play model sucks, everything is way over priced, and it&apos;s pay to win with XP and Blute boosters giving paying players a huge advantage with gun upgrades and gaining levels.
<br>
<br>On top of all that, the game is online only, no offline mode with bots or practice mode or anything. Just log in to some random match and shoot like a maniac and then turn the game off. I guess I&apos;m tough to impress these days, but there&apos;s not much I haven&apos;t seen here before and nothing to impress me or make me go &quot;WOW!&quot; I feel bad for the people who crowdfunded this game through Kickstarter because they essentially paid money for a free game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3956225">Expand</a></span>

Loadout is a gleefully violent and hilarious multiplayer third-person shooter with fast-paced twitch combat. Its slick vertical and horizontal movement system makes fights based on speedy reaction time and precise aim, heightening its skill ceiling. The weaponcrafting system is unique and fun, and allows you to create a huge assortment of weapons to toy around with. Many negative scores have been doled out unfairly due to the server issues present at launch, but those issues are now non-existent. Loadout is already quite good now, but there is room for improvement and the community-active devs are going to be adding new maps, modes, weapon parts, and payloads in the future. Please ignore its (unfairly) mediocre metascore and give this f2p gem a try, I doubt you will be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=4039797">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is really good... like team fortress classic type good... id say TF2 but I was kinda disappointed with TF2 because it lacked nades and some of it was strange when I first played it from what I expected.
<br>
<br>LOADout however is great....
<br>
<br>there are CASUAL SERVERS for noobs and there are hardcore servers for people with better stats and guns..
<br>
<br>anyone crying about this game is a whiney kitten
<br>
<br>this will be my go to FPS-arena shooter.... hands down no BS
<br>
<br>and with all the BS aside I do believe I chuckle everytime my dead body gives the finger because well... I was thinking it anyway...
<br>
<br>Get LOAD out its a measly 2 GB game.... its FREE and you  its not Pay to win as far as I can tell...
<br>
<br>also if you can buy some stuff make this game stick GJ loadout people</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3978778">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Sound - Nice BGM, decent weapon SFX. Personal playlists are recommended still.
<br>
<br>Community - SUCKS. Annoying 14-year-olds and some hackers. Kind people are extremely rare.
<br>
<br>Overall - Pros: Addictive enough. Weaponcrafting can be very enjoyable. You can have a lot of fun without hackers, and if you are not a sensitive person.
<br>Cons: Bad community. Horrible matchmaking which is expected to be fixed.
<br>
<br>Verdict: Give it a try, you will *probably* like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3997945">Expand</a></span>

<br>There are microtransactions if you feel like you need to get more add ons for your gun but the game is NOT pay to win because the first basic gun is one of the most powerful therefore making this game not pay to win.

<br>
<br>wardrobe combinations, taunts, extra loadout slots and weapon slots cost coins which you can get with Real money (SpaceBux Yellow) they can cost quite a lot (19$ you can get a good wardrobe set for one character), extra loadout slots and weapon slots being the most 19-40$ may not need them in the long run, but weapon upgrades are bought with in game currency (Blutes Blue) are acquired as you play.
<br>Edit: there is daily packages that can give you wardrobe parts thats pretty cool :)
<br>
<br>lack of characters and levels seem a bit lacking but things will move along as more patching goes on
<br>
<br>2/24/2014 : players are ruining it already using only OP snipers and the much hated disguise perk which is why killzone 2-3 sucked soo much, unless people or devs stop this lame cod sniper crap there won&apos;t be much enjoyment left.
<br>
<br>and dont Even get me started on cosmetic pricing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=4078508">Expand</a></span>

Unless he also has double jump, and happens to jump all around you, or over you. How many 360s can you do while aiming with the rifle? And guess what, while jumping the rl is reloading  so he can just rinse and repeat. Imagine three of those guys on the other team. No thanks. Also some maps have &quot;holes&quot; you can fall in (and die) and while it might be funny the first 100 times you fall in them it eventually gets kind of boring. I get it , it&apos;s funny cause it looks like you can just jump over it, but then you can&apos;t. Still, this kind of things are best left out of functional games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/loadout/user-reviews?user_review_id=4178456">Expand</a></span>

<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, for a f2p game its pretty alright, but id recommend Black Light Retribution over it any day.</span>
