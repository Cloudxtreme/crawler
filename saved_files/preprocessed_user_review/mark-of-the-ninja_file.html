But I still do not have any idea why people lavish the game with such high praise. While the game has an amazing art style, the game has flaws. The game-play is basically a stealth game in 2D. While I like the fact that you can hide bodies, set traps, upgrade your arsenal, and even terrorize your enemies, the level design ranges from good to poor, usually on the bad end of the spectrum. The game constantly you through trial-and-error sections, with the end result of me learning nothing at all and feeling extremely frustrated. Also, the control can be a bit wonky, as sometimes, I&apos;ll end up grabbing a body when I meant to pick a lock. And the game loses its appeal once you go through 60% of the game, as you will be frustrated with the fact its basically the same thing over and over but with added traps that are extremely cheap. Also, when you complete the game, you will feel robbed of your efforts. When Mark Of The Ninja does things right, you really will feel like a ninja. However, the sections are few and far between. If you enjoyed Mark Of The Ninja, that&apos;s great, you made a good purchase. But for me, Mark Of The Ninja is a clear example of not living up to its potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2763496">Expand</a></span>

If you liked the platform games of the 80s and early 90s on the old Atari systems etc, you will probably like it. If your a COD kid you will probably hate it because it doesn&apos;t have amazing graphics and a new release every 3 months.</span>

I was a big fan of the Thief series some years back. After so many great reviews, I finally downloaded this and I must say am really nicely impressed. All the stealth tools are there...and its a platform game! The checkpoint system is good. I think the devs at Klei have come up with a really good solid game in a time when they are few and far between. Is it perfect? No. Is it enjoyable? Yes it really is! Once I was through my &quot;platform&quot; block, this little gem came shining through. The price is awesome and this one really rocks!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2866571">Expand</a></span>

The game sports a 2D platform type of gameplay with a focus on stealth and tactical maneuvering rather than a full action combat. The game has fluid animation, beautifully created atmosphere, challenging (yet not frustrating) puzzles and encouragement of user creativity during missions, but of course like with all things, it has it&apos;s flaws. It&apos;s 2D perspective sometimes make item interactivity a bit annoying (trying to interact with object A ends you up interacting with object B). Still, this is just a minor inconvenience and the overwhelming amounts of innovation in gameplay could more than make up for it. This is a game well suited for anyone who likes gaming for their gameplay and mechanics over superior graphics. Mark of the Ninja is a simple and easy to learn game yet stands above some of the more popular games this past few years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2801675">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I found the game addictive with great replay value. More than once I caught myself thinking &quot;Damn, if I&apos;d done that differently, I wouldn&apos;t have wasted that item&quot;. It forces you to think tactically which is almost unheard of with other stealth games.
<br>
<br>About my only complaint is that while the controls are largely intuitive and simple, you have a tendency to grab onto things even when you didn&apos;t mean to (eg when trying to climb down off a box in a narrow shaft you often end up clinging either to the wall or the side of the box).
<br>
<br>The ending was suitably ambiguous that it really made me stop and think before proceeding.
<br>
<br>All in all, thoroughly enjoyable (so much so, I bought it for friends in the Steam sale) and I can&apos;t wait to replay it with everything I&apos;ve learnt form the first play through.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=3300826">Expand</a></span>

The upgrades are useful and interesting to unlock as you go and contribute to your style pacifist with distractions or assassinate with weapons &amp; traps.  I played Shank 2 (made by Klei as well) all of about 30 mins before giving up on it, so I was skeptical, but this game was so much better.  I have to admit that I like stealth games, so I&apos;m biased.  Run and gunners may not like it as much.  The visuals in the game and cut scenes were a perfect style for the game.  This isn&apos;t a triple A title, but it is what I expect from an Indie.  Excellent value at a reasonable price.  Well done Klei.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=3784269">Expand</a></span>

<br>A must have.</span>

It captures the spirit of true ninjutsu: complete nothingness and silence, alongside the occasional assassination. The path you take as a ninja is completely up to you, ranging from a murderous nightmare towards every guard to an undetectable ghost. The game is more than happy to give you various options in approaching every situation. I was also pleased by how varied the levels are; one time you will be infiltrating a fortress, the next time you&apos;ll be escaping poison-filled catacombs, and another time you will be setting a building on fire. I also found the game to be quite challenging and as of writing this review have yet to earn all the achievements...and complete a harder New Game+.
<br>The art direction is fantastic, harkening me back to the style of Batman: The Animated Series, Star Wars: Clone Wars, and Samurai Jack. Plus, the visual cues regarding sound and light is nothing short of genius.
<br>The story is surprisingly intriguing and the end led to much reflection of my playthrough as a ninja. The characters are good with well-executed voice-acting. Overall, very well-written.
<br>With all this being said, this is a ninja game. What more could you want?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=4662845">Expand</a></span>

<br>The first playthrough was fun, story kept me interested until the end (which was kind of mind blowing). However, the real fun stared after unlocking additional costumes and features, which enabled me to play the game again in a completely different way. You can play as a merciless assassin, a true unseen ninja or a trickster that likes to mess with enemy&apos;s mind.
<br>The controls need a while to get used to. It might happen to you that you will fall off a ledge, even though you only wanted to take a peek. Once you get used to the controls, you will be able to maneuver quickly and do fancy ninja techniques without any problems.
<br>The overall gameplay experience is absolutely amazing also thanks to the clean graphics. You always know what is happening around you and what you can do about it.
<br>The game is available on Steam, so you can wait for a discount to grab it, but it&apos;s definitely worth it, if you&apos;re into stealthy action games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2870677">Expand</a></span>

It is interesting and fun play. Overall the game does do what a game should set out to do...mainly entertain. It has a nice story line that can get most anyone involved with the mission. The missions get longer and harder as one progress making one have to constantly view the surroundings in order to avoid almost instant death. The most interesting part is that you cannot go guns blazing ever because as it turns out your fists and kunai don&apos;t kill people, only your sword does. While the concept is there, Mark does fail in a few categories, namely the visibility and movement. I would prefer that the entire outer point of the screen not be all foggy, but this is quickly fixed by a check box in the settings. My real problem with the game is frankly the lack of color unless the room is lighted in which case your probably dead by getting shot and the movement because I doubt a ninja hasn&apos;t been trained to run silently, so for most of the game one is moving at a slow pace. Repetition is very obvious as the game progress so don&apos;t think that you can beat the game in one sitting, you&apos;ll probably get bored before you finish. Don&apos;t be chased away however because of these relatively small problems. The leaderboards for every level give a huge incentive to replay some of your best moments and the killing scenes are frankly done just right, but not too many variety to kill someone unless you start getting the power ups which start a bit too late for my taste. Great game to play, frankly one that should be taken time with not just sped through. Would recommend to those who have their tablets in which case its perfect and some core gamers looking for an indie game that steps outside lines and still delivers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2859315">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Amazing game. Game of the Year for me. It totally reminded me of my old times platying Metal Gear Solid, trying to stay away from the guards and killing them when they weren&apos;t looking. If you enjoy stealth games, you&apos;ll have a lot of fun with this. It doesn&apos;t become repetitive at all and the art is beautiful to look at. And what&apos;s even better, it&apos;s only 15$!</span>

There are so many average and below/above average games nowadays that some people have become jaded.  I was one one of those jaded folks until I came across &quot;Mark of the Ninja&quot;.  It takes a lot - and I mean a lot - of time, patience, talent and testing to create such a magnificent accomplishment in gaming (and just about anything really) with all the competition and hype that comes with newer titles.  MotN is an epic game with amazing gameplay, spectacular art and design and mechanics that work all the way through to its end.  Platformers are becoming more popular again as well as stealth games and this game does both impeccably.  There are NO issues here - none.  Not one fault.  OK, maybe the fact that the guards aren&apos;t bright at times and are easy to take advantage of - until you play the highest difficulty (after the game is completed) then you wish it wasn&apos;t this hard.  The artwork is similar to old school Disney and Genndy Tartoksky&apos;s &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; with tons of blood and violence.  The backgrounds move and fluctuate and are brilliantly rendered.  It&apos;s almost like a piece of art hanging at the MoMA.  The movements, attacks and tactics are versatile and unique and the player can choose between which best suits them or even which not to use at all with the option to choose some or none.  The upgrade system is simple and fluid with no complications or annoyances.  Enemies are sharp,adaptive and deadly.  Level designs are articulate and challenging with hidden items through.  The foley work is excellent as well as the music. The writing is sharp and the plot is engaging.  Even the hailkus in the game are brilliantly written.  How many games can you say that about?!  It&apos;s worth more than it&apos;s going for and has great replay value.  It gets my vote for best game of 2012.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2889849">Expand</a></span>

Most of the peoples answer is splinter cell series or hitman series. Most of the stealth game was 3D. But Mark of The Ninja kind of rewrite the history. This is the first pc game which bring stealthy game play in 2D platform. Basically it is a fusion of action, stealth and platform game. Game story is perfect and the game physics and game dynamics is really cool.

Not a raw gem, but a sculpted one, polished with care and attention to detail. An incredibly enjoyable experience, definitely worth the 15$ price of admission. You feel in control of your character at all times and the wonderful aesthetics cement that feeling. Feedback is instantaneous and clear: there&apos;s no confusion as to what&apos;s happening on screen. You can play this game slow-paced, taking your sweet time avoiding every guard, or you can try and play at a somewhat more frantic and chaotic pace, using your quick reflexes to jump over guards while avoiding their cone of sight and flashlights, distracting them when need be and killing them when necessary. The controls lend themselves excellently to both play styles! The world needs more games as brilliantly executed as this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2698968">Expand</a></span>

It does not matter how you like to play. If you like to be sneaky, fast, cruel, or unmerciful, then this 2D side-scroller is for you. You play as a ninja who accepts the First Mark, a tattoo with strange powers, to avenge your clan who was recently attacked by a security and arms enterprise. However, accepting the mark also means sacrificing yourself, as the ink in the tattoo has been said to drive people into stark madness and blind defiance. In my opinion, this was the best 1200 Microsoft Points (Xbox 360) I&apos;ve spent, and I am more than willing to pay another 15-20$ just to play it on the computer. A great game with flawless animation and an overall amazing gaming experience. 10/10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2697760">Expand</a></span>

When it was announced for the PC via Steam I was thrilled. I feel that Mark of the Ninja is well worth the price. Quite an enjoyable stealth game and it looks great. I&apos;m not usually one for the cartoony art style but it works well in and is gorgeous, reminds me a bit of Samurai jack at times. The animations are not overdone and fluid. The stealth mechanics are great and provide a good variety of sneaking, hiding, stealth kills, sabotage and evasive platforming. The gameplay emphasizes the shadowy, stealthy nature of the ninja to an excellent degree. The AI feels sharp enough, enemies react accordingly to the level of stealth you employ (or lack thereof). I just wish Steam had advertised this game AT ALL leading up it&apos;s release; Mark of the Ninja is worthy of a lot of recognition and recommendation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2701221">Expand</a></span>

The mechanics of this 2D game are surprisingly and amazingly deep. Enemies will respond to sounds, investigate where they think they saw you, and even be terrorized by your actions. There are a whole assortment of gadgets that you can use in many ways to turn the tables on your foes. You can perform all sorts of tricks, such as climbing up almost every wall, scurry around in the air ducts, throw a dead body to terrorize some hapless guard. There are even multiple solutions to your problems: do you shank that guard at the first opportunity? Or do you use your gadgets to distract him while you slip past? Or do you even get them to kill each other by accident? The choice is yours. Even months later, I still cannot find anything wrong with this game. It&apos;s length is bolstered by the presence of New Game+, its animation is beautiful and well crafted, its sound and music creates perfect ambiance, and even its story, despite being small and short, has a surprising amount of twist and turns to it. Buy this game. This is stealth done PERFECTLY.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2926263">Expand</a></span>

For $15 off Steam its more than worth the price. If you liked Shank 1 or Shank 2, its the same type of graphics and same gameplay on a keyboard and mouse like shank 2, its made by the same company, and its still a side scrolling game like the Shanks except this one involves stealth gameplay and stealth kills. One of the best parts about this game is the game length, its quite long for a 15 dollar indie game and once you think ok this is probably the last level since the story is winding down and the end boss is in this level and the girl even tells you its last mission, well no it keeps going. The story in the game is interesting i suppose nothing special but good enough to keep your attention, its the gameplay thats amazing. The numerous ways u can kill enemys or not kill them is genious. The music is fitting for a stealth ninja game, voice acting is top notch, game length is long enough for me, steam achievements are reasonable, some arent easy but its not kill 100,000 enemys requireing you to play the game 20 times over to achieve it which is really nice, definately possible to get all achievements 2nd time through. GREAT game i really really hope they make a Mark of the Ninja 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2702727">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Great game. I didn&apos;t think i could still really enjoy a 2d puzzle-ish game. But yeah, i can. The story is pretty simple, but the gameplay compensates, very diverse and interesting from start to finish. Worth every penny.</span>

The game reminds you with its art style of some old times when we played games on commodore or some earlier pc platforms. But this game is really fun, I played it trough in 1-2 days. Only its a bit to short.</span>

Being reckless will get you killed as it should in any stealth game, but even an action approach, if done correctly, can take down a room full of guards. This opens up various options for combat, or even pure, violence-free stealth.</span>

Wasn&apos;t convinced it would be my kind of game but the reviews looked good and I&apos;m a sucker for a bargain. Now that I&apos;ve had chance to play it I&apos;ve got to say it is probably the best &apos;why not?&apos; purchases I&apos;ve made. For a 2D stealth game the graphics work really well and it has tremendous replay value. Each level has 9 things to achieve including completing specific objectives, collecting items and posting high scores. You can run through each level killing everything in your path like a maniac or creep through each level using stealth and distraction. As you progress through the game you get to upgrade your skills, distraction items and attack items as well as your ninja abilities. These different abilities along with the 9 &apos;achievements&apos; per level and the option to play through it all again with an increased level of difficulty  have resulted in over 40 hours of game play for me so far. I&apos;ve managed to complete the game on the normal setting gaining all steam achievements at that level and am working towards playing through the game on the harder setting of &quot;new game plus&quot; to gain the last steam achievement I need. If you can get it in a sale then buy copies for your friends. Enjoy and give joy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2940689">Expand</a></span>

Klei knocks another one out of the park, with a truly magnificent title that challenges the player with puzzling stealthy and/or combative platforming. This is definitely one of the strong points of the title. You can choose whether to go through the game slicing and dicing all your enemies head-to head, sneakily scurry past everyone, without raising an alarm or killing a guard, or even a mixture of the two, silently killing the guards off, one-by-one. Mark of the Ninja just doesn&apos;t have some of the best stealth gameplay I&apos;ve seen, either. Klei brings it&apos;s now signature artstyle to the table, the likes of which have been seen in their previous Shank titles. Notably less gruesomely gorey, the game presents remarkably clean lines with interesting design. The sound is spot on, and is represented by visual cues, so you know if that guard is going to hear you sprinting through the vents or not. The music is pleasant but satisfyingly unobtrusive, and the controls are tight and perfected. I played through the game using keyboard an mouse, but then went through part of the New Game+ mode using the XBXO 360 pad. I personally preferred keyboard and mouse for this stellar title. The game is not difficult, and is not terribly long, either. Dying only a few times during the length of the first playthrough, it lasted me roughly 6-7 hours, without raising alarms and being the super-stealthy ninja that I am. The different gameplay styles offer replayability, and the addicting gameplay will keep you coming back for more.
<br>
<br>All things considered, Mark of the Ninja is definitely in my Top 10 Games of 2012.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2980481">Expand</a></span>

The levels are interesting, with always multiple ways to beat them.  The stealth mechanics are really something special, with light, sounds, and LOS/cover really playing well together.  Leaning up against a door to &apos;hear&apos; what&apos;s on the other side, or creeping along the underside of a sewer &apos;seeing&apos; the footsteps of the guards above is really something special.  Stringing up bodies to scare the guards is just hilarious.  There&apos;s alot of little details that make this game so much fun.  The story is deeper than you expect at first, and plays out subtly but very well by the end.  Lots of secret levels/items/upgrades hidden around.  A solid game across the board and well worth the $10-$20 price tag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2870721">Expand</a></span>

My favourite thing would have to be the way in which the game gets harder as you go along, and after you finish it there is new game+ which really amps up the difficulty. Not often that you get to feel overpowered and challenged at the same time. There is also a lot of freedom in how you choose to go about doing the levels, be it super sneaky of super stabby. As a side note its total BS that the game is boring at the 50% mark. Most of the more challenging obstacles and traps are only towards the end of the game and there is a new game plus really adds to the re-playability imo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2808648">Expand</a></span>

There is a steep learning curve on the controls, but by the time you learn all the character abilities, it feels a bit more natural. The perfect amount of gameplay. Maybe not such an original story, but told well. The animation is well executed and a welcome departure from 3D.  Not impossibly challenging, good casual gaming.</span>

Actually feels great to sneak by opponents, or equally great to rid them of their patrol path. The game feels simple to start, but gets nice and challenging later on. The upgrading system eventually gives you the abilities you wished for at the start. Highly recommended.</span>

I rarely go back to complete achievements after I finish a game; but this one (taking all of fifteen hours) was quite enjoyable even during  a second -more difficult- play through. It could be quite challenging at times, but never beat-your-face-on-your-keyboard-screaming-difficult. It&apos;s cheap, it&apos;s fun, and relatively rewarding, buy it.</span>

But I still do not have any idea why people lavish the game with such high praise. While the game has an amazing art style, the game has flaws. The game-play is basically a stealth game in 2D. While I like the fact that you can hide bodies, set traps, upgrade your arsenal, and even terrorize your enemies, the level design ranges from good to poor, usually on the bad end of the spectrum. The game constantly you through trial-and-error sections, with the end result of me learning nothing at all and feeling extremely frustrated. Also, the control can be a bit wonky, as sometimes, I&apos;ll end up grabbing a body when I meant to pick a lock. And the game loses its appeal once you go through 60% of the game, as you will be frustrated with the fact its basically the same thing over and over but with added traps that are extremely cheap. Also, when you complete the game, you will feel robbed of your efforts. When Mark Of The Ninja does things right, you really will feel like a ninja. However, the sections are few and far between. If you enjoyed Mark Of The Ninja, that&apos;s great, you made a good purchase. But for me, Mark Of The Ninja is a clear example of not living up to its potential.

<br>
<br>To get it out there, this game is amazing and the best modern stealth game hands down. Games like Dishonored and Assassins Creed have huge budgets and 3D worlds yet this games simple 2D mechanics are awesome.
<br>
<br>While you may think 2D means simple there are many ways to play the game. You unlock different moves, outfits (with abilities that change your playstyle), attack items, and distraction items. Gameplay is tremendous and long lasting. Each level has 3 hidden scrolls (one is in a puzzle), 3 scores to achieve (highscore unlocks all 3 obviously) and 3 unique goals (i.e. kill these guards steathly). This makes you replay the levels which you are glad to do in order to figure it out. The game also gets progressively harder as lasers and guards w/night vision goggles are introduced.
<br>
<br>The story is also good and interesting which is a plus, its not just a random killing game.
<br>
<br>One of the most fun things about the game is killing is actually encouraged. Dishonored made me mad by advertising all sorts of cools ways to kill people then punish you for killing them. Mark of the Ninja gives you different ways to kill people to earn achievments and see fun deaths ranging from dropping chandeliers on guards, hiding in the floor and killing upward, dangling from a lamp and hanging a guard, or my favorite, throwing flesh eating insects on a guard.
<br>
<br>Bottom line if you want a fun action game with violent deaths this game is for you and WELL worth the $15.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2750323">Expand</a></span>

At least if you try to get all the &quot;seals&quot; (certain accomplishments for each level). Or you just don&apos;t want to be detected, period. Numerous unlockables and new game plus with actually very fun changes means quite a bit of replayability as well. I especially love one play style that one can unlock that makes literally running through stealthily while not harming anyone possible. Controls are fantastic and whenever the game punishes you, you know that you deserved it. The only unfortunate thing I can find about &quot;Mark of the Ninja&quot; is that it is only available through Steam. But I bet that won&apos;t bother anybody here...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=3030747">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unfortunately,</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">As a stealth game, Mark of the Ninja excels.

There&apos;s still plenty of sneaking past guards and hiding behind pots, but there&apos;s also plenty of silent and deadly action. It does a great job of making you feel like a ninja.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, everything else about this game is awful. The controls are far too limited, with buttons serving far too many functions causing you to constantly do the wrong thing at a crucial moment. Puzzles are exercises in tedium, rather than creativity, as you painstakingly work your way through rooms performing tasks to complete a mechanism that you figured out within 15 seconds. Then if you mishandle the controls, you end up having to repeat the entire process. Killing guards is extremely repetitive, and for some reason forces you to perform a quick-time event (press a random button in a short time limit) to succeed. Every time. There&apos;s a variety of tools that you can use, but none of them adds much beyond a flamboyant way to achieve what you could do just as easily without the tools. The trap sections are horribly designed, and combined with the limited field of view in 2D, simply force you to use trial and error. Prepare to reload your game a lot as you work your way through trap levels, figuring out what will and won&apos;t kill you by getting killed by it (or not).
<br>
<br>By far the worst aspect of this game, however, is its checkpoint save system. After having to restart a mission four times, from scratch, due to being auto-saved in an impossible position, I eventually gave up on even finishing the game. You have no control over when the game saves, and once it does you&apos;re unable to revert to a previous save. In my case, I&apos;d timed things perfectly to slip past one guard, kill another, and escape. Unfortunately halfway through doing this, I hit a checkpoint save. From that point on, every time I reloaded, both guards saw me and shot me to pieces before I could so much as jump to safety. The only solution? Play through the first 40 minutes of the level again. For the fifth time. No thanks.

<br>The parts of this game that work, work fantastically. Unfortunately it needed a far better PC port, and less gimmicks (like QTEs and repetitive puzzles). Skip it unless you love being forced to replay the same content through no fault of your own.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2879745">Expand</a></span>

Yes, it&apos;s 2D, but it&apos;s not linear as you can often choose which angle to attack from and can bypass obstacles and enemies entirely.  One of the best games of 2012.</span>

The idea, preview movies, and reviews shouted a masterpiece... but it&apos;s mundane and boring stealth game. If the levels were designed in a way to really utilize the need for being stealthy, then perhaps it might work; but, the levels design lacked interested scenarios begging for stealthy tactics. The way the character felt when maneuvering didn&apos;t feel satisfying like Shank did. The bad guys were very easy to kill... out of boredom you might try to rush a kill to get some fun. The build-up of hiding and getting spotted is lacking (maybe because it&apos;s a 2D game).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=3910984">Expand</a></span>

To begin with, the game is plagued with the same issues that Hitman: Absolution had where it is essentially a stealthing-game for the impatient, the 2d limitations only proves to further hamster the potential this game could have had and while I can appreciate the stylish artstyle and cartoony cutscenes with a decent story just as much like the next guy, game-play wise it is an collection of frustrations. To truly assassinate an enemy, you need to be undetected closely behind them (which can be a long and bothersome process involving a lot of trial-and-error) and then click M1, followed by a certain swipe movement with your mouse which either very often gets miss-read by the game, screwing the kill up completely or you knock something over on your desk. Getting to the point of being behind the NPC&apos;s is also tedious as you need to find the intended scripts that the developers put in place and if you choose to skip all that (not possible at many occasions) and simply engage them with your fists, the enemies will spam &quot;Combat-rolls&quot; which essentially make them invulnerable (Kunais, your throwable items literally bounce off them) leaving single 1v1 fights a matter of &quot;Waiting for the invulnerability to go away&quot; while with enemy teammates turns to a &quot;Pause the game every half second to spam stun projectiles or you&apos;ll die&quot; competition. Yes, the feature of freezing time and instantly throwing projectiles at enemies to stun them is an honest game feature which should let the next fact come less of a surprise: You engage any enemies that have spotted you with your fists instead of using weapons. I am dead serious. To fully kill an enemy requires a mandatory melee-range grab when they are incapacitated (for a few seconds after you&apos;ve punched them about 20 times in the face)to  fully kill them which is just laughable. I also had several occasions where I would be almost done cutting a guy&apos;s throat and he&apos;d suddenly still somehow put out an alarm, making every enemy on a 5 kilometer radius rush to my location. And even with all these &quot;bullsh!t&quot; moments, I found the game to be ridiculously easy due to the no-limit freeze-time function, allowing you to take your time at any moment and mark enemies to be instantly thrown with Kunais, infinitely stunning every single enemy you see. I cannot honestly see the logic behind actually implanting something like this. It does not benefit the combat in a positive way and it is just an eyesore of a function for the stealth as well since it removes any actual difficulty. But I guess these kinds of poorly-thought through design choices are mandatory and very obvious trait of being ported from the  360. To sum it all up, did I like Mark of the Ninja? No. Why? Because this can be played in a browser and stealth-games are not meant to be played through 2D. Oh and, all the retards spamming thumbs down on negative reviews in regards to this game should give you even more reason to stay away from this smelling turd of a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2857128">Expand</a></span>

While this game is fantastic in concept (think about a 2D version of Metal Gear Solid), and the stealth aspect well-executed, the game is utterly ruined by its terrible combat controls.
<br>
<br>There are two main objectives in this game: sneaking and killing. In a game where half the point is to kill people, there is no point in having melee combat if it doesn&apos;t help achieve this goal. Worse still, you cannot switch between melee and weapons combat. Hell, when it gives you the option to kill, it makes you swipe your mouse in an arbitrary direction in order to maintain stealth while you do so. WHY? WHAT&apos;S THE POINT? Why did not not occur to the devs that ninjas are able to kill with their bare hands?
<br>
<br>I would have given this game a 1, but it&apos;s so bad I&apos;m never playing it again, and I&apos;ve only played it for thirty minutes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=3893755">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are poorly upscaled, soundtrack is your stereotypical &quot;oriental&quot; themed &quot;*gong* WOOOOOOOOOOOOO&quot; stuff, and the sound effects are pulled from a stock library. Many bugs ruin the experience ranging from small things like guards being blind to you standing right in front of them to gamebreaking bugs such as getting stuck on a wall or in a vent. An unlock system lets you kill from different angles and gives you some new tools but it doesn&apos;t really change the core gameplay of &quot;kill silently and without being seen&quot;. I love slowly stalking through stealth games but this one is ruined by too many checkpoints, an overabundance of bugs, balancing issues (one outfit and one weapon are clearly the best at what they do), and everything else mentioned above. Running at around 10-12 hours, this is a flash game better left to XBLA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mark-of-the-ninja/user-reviews?user_review_id=2951044">Expand</a></span>

MGS had a depth of story and style as well as tight controls and action that could be played as a NON-stealth game. This game does not have that. It forcefully holds gamers hands and makes them plod through set pieces without much thought for imagery or imagination. Multiple branching pathways or engrossing storyline will not be found here.</span>

<br>I really enjoyed this game. It&apos;s a side-scrolling stealth game with an art style that really makes me think of Samurai Jack. The gameplay is really gun and fairly challenging at times.
<br>
<br>The controls are really good, and hardly ever caused an issue besides once or twice where I stuck to the wrong wall, but that was likely my fault. The controls are so good enough that you never feel cheated when you die, it&apos;s always your fault.
<br>
<br>The story doesn&apos;t seem like much until you get close to the end, where there&apos;s a twist and then everything starts to make sense. The ending itself left me felt a little unfulfilled, but I think it&apos;s made to make you fill in the blanks yourself. It really gets you thinking about your choice, why you did what you did, but doesn&apos;t tell you what happens next, so how good the conclusion to this game really is what you make of it.
<br>
<br>I only got 7 hours out of this game, so I felt like it could have been longer, although I did skip a lot of the side missions, and I do feel like much of the challenge comes from the challenges you set yourself (Don&apos;t raise any alarms, never get seen, don&apos;t kill anyone, etc). but besides that I can&apos;t really think of anything that was wrong with this game.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not sure what else I can say about this game, but if you enjoy stealth games, this one is great fun, and worth the money. If the store page looks good, get it, otherwise try it when it&apos;s a bit cheaper.
