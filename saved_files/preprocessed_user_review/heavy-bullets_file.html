Turrets are the worst sometimes, but having 6 of them at spawn is insane, yet it happened to me 2 times in  a row!

<br>Overall, heavy bullets is  NOT for everyone (please refer to the 1 anonymous user that gave it a negative rating), but it&apos;s also very fun, fast, and HARD. 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/heavy-bullets/user-reviews?user_review_id=5213707">Expand</a></span>
