The game has alot of features but is very complicated. The UI isnt bad its just there are so many menus you can get lost sometimes. Overall its the best 4x title i have ever played and its stunning graphics and mechanics is just awesome. The reason i take a point off is the fact there are a bit of things here and there that are EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. Such as the fact you HAVE to assemble a fleet to protect ever single system you own. This is so frustrating its unreal. Plus combat gets annoying because you cant freely move the camera, you have to double click on your units and then the camera follows. So really the game just needs a few tweaks and it would be perfect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2451221">Expand</a></span>

Kerberos&apos; efforts are beyond dedicated, and if you don&apos;t believe me you can go on their site and browse the thousands of fixes and additions that have been made to the game. Or don&apos;t believe that, and buy it. I just bought the game again, and at turn 30 am still going strong. I have to admit the UI is still a little clunky and it might be hard for beginners, but the game and all of its featurey goodness is there now. It has finally begun to capture the magic of the original, and hopefully soon with the stream of updates that has yet to cease, it will surpass its predecessor. I think the worst game of 2011 may soon be one of the best of 2012!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1828012">Expand</a></span>

The original released version was a Beta, wrong file uploaded to Steam, I understand mistakes happen, so another version was uploaded the following day. Well nothing really changed and the publisher admitted on their forums that they knew the product was bad they were going to release and patch it. Menus are grayed out so they cannot be selected, such as options, no scenarios maps but a tab, the encyclopedia which they tell you to use for information appears to be mostly empty. The manual was a draft copy that the published put on the forums, how do you not have a manual completed for release? The graphics are beautiful but without just clicking around its next to impossible to figure out how anything works. No tutorial, no intro missions, no manual, no encyclopedia. Horrible game, horrible release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1834961">Expand</a></span>

Stationdesign for Naval Bases
(Weaponhardpoints)
Space Station Upgrades
(Some are got to high requirements and cannot be fitted with req. module ammount, some are deactivated on purpose, like the level 5 Science Station that was deactivated in Patch 4th Nov. 2011 for Bugfixing.)
Defense sattelites
Morrigi Void Mastery Drive
(you can research it, but not fit it in designer)
Tarkan Warpdrive
(Same as the Morrigi. You can research it, but not use it...)
Drones, Assaultshuttles, Nodefighters, Battlecruiser and Battleships
(All part of the Battlerider Technology tree)
Starbase Hangar for Battleriders
Cloaking Field
Shield Technology of all kind
Siege Driver
Armorplate fitting in the Shipdesigner
Traderoutes
(at least you cannot assign any Tradeships to any kind of Traderoutes)
Moral boosting systems
COL-Launcher
Asteroid Monitor construction
Special project research
Salvage and Reverse engeneering from salvage
Gem and Forgeworlds
(cause crash at the moment if you wanna choose a typ)
Fusion/Antimatter/Leach/Cloak Mines
Diplomacy
(not all features activated yet, but at least you can declare war at the moment ^^)
Delete of old shipdesigns
(they are deleted in the designer, but stay in the list of the available productiondesigns for ships at the shipyard)
Liir Leviathan &quot;The Black&quot;
(its constructed out of modules with weaponhardpoints, it seems not to work propably at the moment)
Random encounter slider
(you can change it, but it seems to have no effect at the moment when you start a new game)
Grand Menace slider
(same as above, it seems the Systemkiller as a Grand Menace just appear or dont, random at the moment)
MIRV Missile system
(Missile shoots and explodes without creating new Missiles)
Ship Module &quot;Auxiliry Fission/Fusion&quot;
(It increases crew need by 2, but dont give you any bonuses, no speed, no energy, no support bonus at all)
theres more, way more but it doesnt fit</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1859587">Expand</a></span>

A pointless decision in a stream of bad choices that will cost the game and the publishers and the programmers all their public value and this game won&apos;t sell well and if it does then there is something wrong! They don&apos;t deserve a penny for their efforts so far this is just plainly an insult in the face of the gamers. I mean imagine a game like ES V L Skyrim doing this kinda thing. People would be angry and they should this is an embarrassment to the gaming community and a lesson to be remembered ! Do not rush a game out!

The initial release last Friday was the wrong version or so we were told. It had a buggy features like the options menu. The patch on Saturday merely fixed a few issues and disabled the options menu. Yes you heard me right, this title does not have an options menu upon release. Unlike the previous reviewer I have had several crashes, or should I say until I got sick of them. These crashes are mostly caused by missing parts of the game. What is also lacking is a decent tutorial and to top that a lot of tooltips are missing as well. This game should be considered to an early beta build at best.<br>Whilst Kerberos and Paradox promise to improve this game and support it for years to come. Would you trust a company that released such an abomination on the market. I agree with many that there is a game underneath all the rubble. I however am not waiting for the rubble to be cleared and have requested a full refund.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1827899">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s ugly, right from the title screen. The ship models are distorted and messy - they look unfinished and cartooney against the sharp, industrial look of Eve Online or Sins. The UI is also hard on the eyes, although the actual starmap looks pretty good. The gameplay is also dull. Exploring and colonizing systems is done via &apos;missions&apos;, which are essentially the same as other 4X games except that they take 4x the number of mouseclicks to initiate. To colonize a planet, you don&apos;t just build a colony ship.. you have to build a command ship, then a colony ship, then a supply ship, then attach an admiral to create a fleet, THEN select your destination. I&apos;ve heard this game called &apos;deep&apos; but &apos;convoluted&apos; comes to mind. The first time you enter into combat, you&apos;re greeted with more of the terrible graphics, and absolutely no inkling as to what tactics might benefit you. Unlike the Total War series, where it&apos;s clear that higher terrain is good for archers, while hiding in the woods is a good defense from missiles, etc., instead you are floating around in space with the only discernable strategies being.. move there, or shoot that. The UI is counterintuitive at every turn. You could pick up MOO2 and learn it without looking at a single manual or forum. This game is a dog&apos;s breakfast and you will be forced to look at the manual (which is awful) the beginner&apos;s guide (which is also awful, but longer) then the wiki (which is entirely incomplete). Here&apos;s an excerpt from the beginner&apos;s guide: &quot;Once the core modules of a ship have been decided upon, you can begin to arm the space-craft with weapons across the breadth of it&apos;s surface. The amount of weapon points available will vary depending on the hull type, size and command, mission and propulsion modules selected&quot;. This is the entire section on ship weapon design. Great, so I can put weapons on the ship. Brilliant. What&apos;s the point of having mounts in particular locations? Is there a directional advantage? Would there be a benefit to placing certain weapons in certain slots? This game is complex in the same way walking around someone else&apos;s house in the dark is complex. Here&apos;s another example - trade is fundamental to a successful empire, and these require freighters. There is no section on freighters in the manual and no in-game explanation. What are the devs smoking? All of this aside, once I got into the game and had a dozen colonies with a humming economy, several naval bases and attack fleets, I found I was having the same amount of fun that I was at the start, i.e. none. I think the recent high scores for the game are because people are impressed it&apos;s actually out of alpha 1 year after its launch. It&apos;s just a shame that the game looks 15 years out of date and is boring as bat sh!t. UPDATE 8 December 2012. After playing this for a whole day, this game is even worse than I thought, so changing the 5 rating to a 1. So many of the mechanics make absolutely no sense. For example, I had 3 fleets defending an outpost planet that was close to enemy territory. Sure enough, the enemy attacks.. but I can only enter combat with 1 fleet while the other 2 wait. Why? There&apos;s no logical reason for this.. if you have fleets stationed at a system, they should all be able to fight. Another example - each fleet has a home system. If a fleet leaves the system for a mission, once the mission is completed, it has to return to its home system to refuel and resupply. Why? Why not just fly to the nearest system to refuel? Basically, the developers have invented these mechanics to create their gameplay - and they are all nonsensical. They all serve to make the game more complicated, less elegant, and less logical. Combine that with the steep learning curve and lack of information, and it&apos;s just a mess. If you decide to embrace all of their illogical mechanics, you might have a great time after about 20 hours of learning the fundamentals, but I&apos;d rather spend time on a well-made game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2813605">Expand</a></span>

Wanted a game that was like a more advanced model of Masters of Orions and pretty much I have it now with Sword of the Stars 2, the game has evolved so well in the past year since its early conception. Much of the game is geared towards a strategy / simulation genre in a turn-based 4X Strategy universe. Very complex, very hard to get into when you first start playing, but very well designed. Complete ship designing from the command - role - engine systems, and design of the weapons and what goes into it. Gives a whole new spin on Development and Deployment game mechanics where no one can predict what you will roll out next. The multiplayer is outstanding, long... but outstanding, its never the same game twice when playing with another person and gets persistantly better everytime you play it. Again its long, even with small 1 on 1 maps.
<br>Only downside is its still relateively incomplete, but for what its content is at the moment, its worth a 10... now I just need a 10 + 1  for that little extra credit for when its complete.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2728144">Expand</a></span>

I saw a lot of potential in the game even back at the start and will give Kerberos serious credit for not giving up and putting in the time to make this game shine.  A quick look at the reviews by date of submission will tell you all you need to know about how far this game has come and what state it is in now.
<br>The game has 6 distinct races that vary widely enough in there mechanics that it feels like you are playing a brand new game with each one, a randomized tech tree that guarantees a think on your feet approach to playing (no perfect path to victory every time here),  In depth ship design with a nice array of weapon types to choose from and absolutely stunning RTS Space combat.  The game really does remind me of Shogun 2 in space.
<br>Having said that The UI can be clunky at times and directing your ships in RT combat can require some intense micro because of it.  The game is very complex and there is a very steep learning curve but fortunately the Kerberos forum community is very active and helpful and most questions are answered within minutes of posting.  The AI is decent for newcomers to the genre but most people will quickly figure out its weaknesses and shouldn&apos;t have too much trouble taking it down.  For veterans of the genre there is a fairly active multiplayer community on steam that will step up the challenge if that&apos;s what you are looking for.  The developers have been listening very closely to the community and have stated they plan on continuing to update both the UI and AI shortcomings. If they put in even a small fraction of the effort they have applied over the last year I have no doubts this game will make the step from great to outstanding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2732755">Expand</a></span>

I do seriously enjoy this game and while is USED to have its fair share of glitches and whatnot,  Kerberos has turned this ship around. It speaks a lot when a company stands by their product for over a year - constantly making upgrades and patches to make it what it should have been. Yes, it is arguable why it was released in such a poor state in the first place but that is in the past. Hats off to all the developers for the extreme amount of hard work it took to overcome the pile this used to be.This game is fantastic if you are looking for a very complex and deep 4x strategy game - I mean each race has their own means of traveling between stars! I love the fact that the tech tree is randomly generated - meaning one game you might be able to get the super-ginormous-fusion cannon and the next game, you can only get basic lasers. It adds a unique factor to the game and forces you to modify your strategy. As an added bonus - Kerberos has just announced a FREE expansion which includes another race as well as some other bonuses! So why just the 8? Truthfully, last time I played with a bud (before the &quot;All clear&quot;), there were some minor glitches and fixes still needing to be done. I have yet to confirm if these have been fixed but have no doubt they will be in due time. Off to play!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2769631">Expand</a></span>

They are clearly passionate about their game.

Now, after tons of patches and free expansion with new playable race, Sots 2 is definitely better at every aspect - but it still falls way short of meeting expectations. It&apos;s very complex game, with great variety of options and possible strategies - however, it is also one of the least approachable games I have ever seen. Unclear interface, cryptic tooltips and utter lack of any tutorial in game are obstacles for any new players. If you manage to overcome them, you will find good sides of this game - and they are plenty. However, they all fade when you realize that AI is COMPLETELY broken, and does not present any threat whatsoever. Seriously - computer controlled empires not only cannot beat player, they also fail to defend against random encounters game throws at them and often collapse due to missmanegement of economy and mounting debt. I am willing to bet that anyone giving this game super-high score has not played it long enough to actually measure AI capabilities. Maybe after another year it will get acceptable - for now, if you value single player at least, I recommend to stay away from this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2915589">Expand</a></span>

One of the worst launches in game history has turned into a fully functional 4x space sim, ignore the vast amount of launch reviews here if you&apos;re a fan of the genre games like sins of a solar empire or even the civilization series you&apos;ll enjoy this.</span>

Sure there a some bugs here and there,and a few &quot;missing&quot; features. But compared to how it was at the start, its nothing that disturbs the game play at all. I love playing this game now.</span>

Its blindingly addictive, 6 hrs can pass and you didn&apos;t even realize. With its latest enhanced edition kerberos gives the new expansion, End of Flesh with the new version of the game. this adds yet another race. now 7 races totally different experience with each race, super in depth gameplay and an awesome random tech tree/Forest that changes the game every time you play. This is a game you could play again and again and it would change so much you would learn something new each and every time.  The GFX are great and kerberos continues to stand by its product and set an example everyone in the industry should learn ////cough/// blizzard. ITs nice to see a game with what i would have agreed with 44 metascore coming to fruit, and in desperate need of a change. A far far better game than endless space.  Dont let old reviews scare you away this is a brand new game worth every bit of time and money you spend on it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2802319">Expand</a></span>

Ship design excels with an expansive research tree and excellent macro management design for your empire. Whilst the occasional crash is still an issue, the autosave more than compensates for this. The time has come that the negative reviews can now be largely ignored and the game easily picked up at a bargain price.

<br>While the game still has a small number of bugs and missing features, it is the greatest sci-fi 4x game I have encountered so far. It does well in comparison with Sins of a Solar Empire, Endless Space, Masters of Orion etc, but is a totally different game. One comparison would be a Total War game in space, but that doesn&apos;t do SotS II justice at all. Sword of the Stars II has great lore, beautiful and fun tactical battles, and great strategic gameplay, and the different aspects of the game ties together really well, creating a sum larger than its parts.
<br>The game does have a great deal of complexity though, and the game differs from it&apos;s peers in several aspects, which might scare away newcomers to the game and to the genre.
<br>Players that are able and willing to do just a little reading in the beginners guide, the manual, the wiki or the forums won&apos;t have any trouble.
<br>Give the game a few hours, and you&apos;ll never regret your decision!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2783287">Expand</a></span>

It isn&apos;t the same as SotS Prime, but it has grown into something more, something different. There are aspects that might not immediately be interesting to everyone, but the gameplay overall should be highly desirable to all 4X players. I got burned like so many others when the game came out, but I decided to not take the refund option. At this time I&apos;m no longer sorry and no longer angry, I&apos;m quite glad.<br>If we are to be mad about the launch, we must also give credit where it is due. More than 50 patches has been uploaded. That is dedication most big companies would never even think of.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2460077">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s difficult to even use the word &quot;game&quot; to describe it; one day publishing and development houses will realize that pushing a product that requires months, or even years, to market is simply not a valid business practice.  The product is lacking in tool tips, contains many bugs that result in a crash to windows, lacks memory optimization which results in horribly slow load times when changing UI options, the list goes on and on.  From most studios this would barely qualify as an engine test.<br><br>To add icing to the cake the developers made the choice to lie on release day and say they had simply uploaded their beta engine and that the real game would be forthcoming within 24 hours.  Sadly this was simply a sales tactic.  Like I said, skip this title and go spend your $40 at a casino, at least you might have accidental fun there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1834542">Expand</a></span>

But the developers have been beating it into shape via relentless patching and support and it&apos;s now fairly close to its intended glory.<br>It&apos;s not yet in a 1.0 state, but it&apos;s definitely getting there. And since the game can be found for a very cheap price, I&apos;d definitely recommend it.</span>

It has many issues and is very unstable, not to mention that it has incomplete features.  The current release is pretty much unacceptable for a &quot;released&quot; game.<br><br>The fault for this lies with the developer, not the publisher.  The developer is the one who comes up with the ideas and has to realise them and they have to do it within an agreed upon period, so given the game is so broken and incomplete the blame has to be squarely on the Kerberos.  It&apos;s clear they aimed far too high for either their skill or manpower (or a combo) to meet within the development period.  However, most disappointing was that they kept fans in the dark about the state of the game, which is made worse by the fact several of those who worked on the game were highly active with the community.  You can also put some blame on the publisher for not saying anything either and while it is easy to say they should have given Kerberos more time, they can only be expected to sink so much money without a return into a project.  All in all the release by both parties should have been better handled.<br><br>The game is been patched with the aim of making it work, but it will take some time.  Best plan would be to wait 6 - 12 months and have another look at the game unless as I said, you wanted to take part in a beta test.  So far for me this game has not been worth its price.  You can see the potential in the game, but I didn&apos;t buy the game to look at it and imagine the cool things it could do so I can&apos;t give it anything outside of the red zone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1947530">Expand</a></span>

But it still feels very unfinished. there are still bugs that should be there, many things are totally unexplained and you need to read them up in forums or somewhere in the internet. It feels strange to play it. I still get headache because I just dont understand most of the game. I mostly fight agains the game and User interface itself then agains the Other races or players in the game. I&apos;m a great fan of sots 1 from the first day, and I would highly recommend Sots 1 for anyone who like these games. But in my opinion, sots 2 is just a shadow of sots 1 with better graphic. This game is good for hardcore fans or people who just want to support Kerberos. But its not a game for people who just heard about Sword of the Stars or want a finished game to enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2802321">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Important note about the game version: I&apos;ve read about the rocky start of the game, basically being a beta version on launch day. I downloaded it off Steam in July 2012, and the current version seems to be pretty polished. It is still lacking helpful tooltips and ingame documentation, but the game didn&apos;t crash on me or had missing features that I noticed.
<br>
<br>My review:
<br>
<br>When I read about Sword of the Stars II (SotSII), I was really excited: combining two of my favorite genres, 4X and RTS, sounded perfect. A similar hybrid, Sins of a Solar Empire, I&apos;ve already played and kind of liked it, but the complexity of a full 4X strategy game is missing in Sins.
<br>
<br>To make it short, SotSII is a pretty big disappointment. First, it&apos;s rather ugly. Not in the sense that the graphics aren&apos;t great, I wouldn&apos;t care. But the interface is clumsy, sluggish and the color schemes look like **** I could forgive that easily though if the gameplay would be a revelation -- but I just don&apos;t feel that.
<br>
<br>Compared to Master of Orion II, the gold standard for space 4X games, I would say SotSII is slightly more complex, which could be good. But  unfortunately, it is &quot;more complex&quot; in a stupid way (which is bad). Many of the variables you can tweak feel disconnected, only having small effects, and you sometimes wonder why you even have to bother with setting them. If you enjoy tweaking numbers only for the sake of tweaking them, you might like the game more than I did, but I feel complexity in itself is not a goal, but *motivated* complexity (like, say, in X3 Terran Conflict) is what you&apos;d want.
<br>
<br>Combat feels like it could be the most interesting part, with a rather complex weapon and armor system, but the interface is a pain, and it just doesn&apos;t feel very satisfying to play those battles. Maybe because I didn&apos;t play long enough, and I did&apos;t see the causal connections and effects of my weapon layouts clearly enough yet, but there&apos;s something arbitrary about which weapons beat which armor. Same as above, it&apos;s complex, but not in a way that makes me feel I&apos;m being smart when I succeed in doing something, but more like it&apos;s tedious to understand the differences.
<br>
<br>tl;dr SotSII is a rather complex strategy game, a hybrid between 4X and RTS. Interface and design aren&apos;t very pretty, and, more importantly, while the game is complex, it feels complex in an arbitrary, unmotivated way, that wasn&apos;t fun for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2534555">Expand</a></span>

I couldn&#xC2;&#xB4;t believe that a company would really release a game in such an unfinished state. The I found out what happened. Acc. to the forums and posts from Paradox and Kerberos officials they knowingly released a version that was in a state that was more a beta-version as a finished product. They apologized for that and promised to fis it. But I can&#xC2;&#xB4;t understand and assist a company with my money for such a fraud. My advice would be:<br>Please, check the forums to get a complete view of this mess.<br>And - DON&#xC2;&#xB4;T BUY THIS GAME NOW - LET THEM FIX IT FIRST.<br>LET THEM NOT BE SUCCESSFULL WITH SUCH A BAD WAY TO TREAT THEIR LOYAL CUSTOMERS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1829681">Expand</a></span>

As one of the people who bought the game ahead of its release it was like seeing a game getting from Alpha to Beta and now nearing Gold-Status. It is now stable, running quite fast and bugs are diminishing by the hour. Some still remain, but I am in good hope that they will be dealt with. Mainly they are visual glitches, like problems with refraction or some moons appear completely black on the map or non-critical things like Sol-System (in the &quot;canon&quot;-map) having an additional planet between Earth and Mars. Crashes appear to be a thing of the past and if they appear, then mostly in multiplayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2495701">Expand</a></span>

It is a shame that the formerly justified low ratings are putting people off.  Feasibility study before research, and prototypes before mass production, limited upgrades to existing ships or total redesign and replacement to use completely different technologies, and just when you start wishing there were Q ships available to deal with pirates they pop up as available to research. The huge differences in strategy between the core racial technologies mirror the original. Logistics via tankers and star-bases gives an extra dimension. Would be nice if planetary characteristics were less abstracted, and could be linked to technologies &amp; races.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2598675">Expand</a></span>

It was rough, the turn times were long, the delay between menus were absurd...  but I still saw some great stuff in the game.  Fast forward to October 2012, and the All Clear.  Now, the roughness has a good bit of polish, turn times are much improved, and the menu delays cut down massively.  They&apos;re still present somewhat, but what were once 10-12 second delays are now 1-4 second delays.  Still breaks the flow a bit, but not so much that it makes you want to rage quit. The game is exceptional.  It&apos;s Total War in Space. If your thing is diplomacy or commerce, you&apos;ll probably find SotS2 too combat oriented (It&apos;s &apos;sword&apos; of the stars, after all, not &apos;merchant&apos; of the stars).  If you like good strategic and tactical warfare, however, this game should be right up your alley.  It&apos;s not very friendly to get into, just because of the massive depth, but none of that depth could be called fluff.  Each bit is important, and the more you understand the games systems, the more you can improve your game.  Kerberos has created something special here, which is the only reason I&apos;m writing a review.  It&apos;s a great game if you can get past the massive depth, and lack of in-game tutorial (there is a manual, and you should probably read it if you want to play).  As epically bad as the launch of this game was, the game itself has turned into something epically good, and any fan of good space 4x would be doing themselves a disservice by not giving the all clear version a play.  There are still a few technical problems that I&apos;d say would give this game a 8/10.  If those were cleared up, I&apos;d easily say it&apos;s a 9/10, just from the excellent design.  I give it a 10/10 to raise it&apos;s score, because it&apos;s ridiculously low for a game so good.  With an xpack or two and the aforementioned technical problems fixed, I think this would be worth a 10/10.  I haven&apos;t had a game that feels so damn good once you get into it since MoO2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2723848">Expand</a></span>

Before you hit a game killing crash, repeating itself each time you try to load the game, you will probably witness: one of the most clunky, user-unfriendly interfaces ever seen in a game, placeholder technologies with no real effect, some weapons not dealing any damage, or dealing a different damage from what stated, or being incredibly inaccurate as to be almost useless. Your ingame tutorial: a few screenshots of the interface with brief explanations of a few functions. Ridiculous AI. But wait! The realtime battles look great! Design your ships and go PEW PEW while battling for the galaxy! Too bad your fleet will often spawn so far from the enemy that you may spend all the time available for the battle trying to get in fighting range. You make choose to add more time to the battles: now you just have to spend five minutes being frustrated before getting started. You may also organize your fleet in a formation! Too bad as soon as the battle starts all the ships are just standing in line, regardless of what you chose. Now, the list of missing features and bugs in the existing ones is longer, but this is way more than I need to give this heap of failure a zero. The devs are working on it, while the game is still sold with no mention of its current state, as if this was a complete, working game. This is why I&apos;m reviewing it as such. If someone chose to show some respect for the players by simply selling it as a paying beta to support the project, it would just be a game with a decent chance of becoming actually good, before or later. My advice: wait a few months, and if you like what you see get it for cheap at the next steam sales. Dont buy it now: it may get good, but some annoying stuff like the clunky interface seems to be here to stay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2052508">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been following this game since it&apos;s launch, and clocked over 700 hours of play time over various versions of the game.  It&apos;s the only offering to the 4X genre that really contains depth.  Games these days have continued to shirk away from adding depth and complexity to their games for fear of alienating the casual demographic.  Well... this game follows in the footsteps of Sword of the Stars 1 and it&apos;s expansions and continues to evolve both the strategic depth as well as the tactical combat detail.  The weapons are unique and varied.  The races continue to be diverse and interesting, and have actual gameplay differences between them.  Every game is unique and different and will often challenge the player to use new strategies due to the random nature of the research system.
<br>
<br>The game has come a long way and continues to get better.  Right now it&apos;s a fun and engaging experience and will only get better as they add more to the game with expansions down the road.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2434289">Expand</a></span>

Spend your money elsewhere!  IN DEPTH:  I bought the Complete Collection of Sword of the Stars 1, and while I found it to be a very challenging game with a steeper learnign curve than I was accustomed to, it was also an _enjoyable_ game.

And eventually, enough lessons let me start holding my own ... well, against the AI set in easy mode, anyway.  I do not claim to be a great general, ha!  Based on that, I then bought SotS2.  And right now?  I don&apos;t just want my money back, I want the TIME I spent trying to figure the game out, given back to me.  Yes, it really is that bad.  The game seems stable enough right now, but the interface makes it still unplayable.  At least, to someone like me, who is not omniscient.  I can&apos;t figure out how to start up Trade within my empire - despite researching the technology, and building a dozen or more freighters.  I have yet to find a way to scrap old, obsolete ships - except throw them at the enemy, to be uselessly blown up in combat.  I also very much dislike the fleet management setup; if I build a fleet to explore the galaxy, for GODS SAKE, I don&apos;t want it coming all the way back home after every system it surveys!  I haven&apos;t yet found a way to relocate a fleet from one system to another, either.  Which, in turn, leads to another problem: you can&apos;t build a fleet piecemeal at multiple stars.  You have to build the WHOLE fleet at ONE system ... because there&apos;s no way to permanently reassign a ship built in system A, to a fleet based out of system B.  Not that I&apos;ve been able to find, anyway!  All in all, I&apos;m not really fighting the AI very much in this game; I&apos;m fighting the arcane, counter-intuitive UI.  And I&apos;m not learning anything with each loss this time around, either - because I just can&apos;t tell what I&apos;ve done wrong, or what I&apos;ve neglected to do.  The blasted game doesn&apos;t TELL ME enough about what&apos;s going on, for that!  SotS1 was a great game, and I&apos;ll keep playing it for a long time to come.  SotS2 is a stinker, and it&apos;s coming off my hard-drive just as soon as I&apos;m done writing this review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2108009">Expand</a></span>

The time has been greatly reduced for turns. Even at turn 80 they only take 5 - 10 seconds and lag between screens has been cut down. However, the UI is still missing many things that would considered standard in other games of the same type, and the only way to learn the game is to search through the SOTS2 wiki, the kerberos forums, and just playing it. However, I am enjoying it quite a bit and so I would rate it a seven now, but only for those people who really like this type of game. May 23rd 2012 - 5 out of 10<br><br><br>I got this game because I am big fan of Paradox and was hoping for a good 4X game. For those of you still looking at this game and wondering &quot;Is it ready?&quot; I would have to answer that it is not. I have no problems with it crashing to desktop but there are still three major issues that I&apos;ve noticed after playing it for seven hours. Delay between turns is still pretty terrible. I have 8 GB of RAM, an excellent video card and CPU but after turn 50 (which is very early in the game) the time between turns became significant. Second, the UI is pretty terrible, revealing almost nothing about the game. Parts of the screen are cut off, information is easy to find, you can&apos;t even look at a planet and tell what buildings or space stations it has. I am mainly comparing this to Europa Universalis III a great game by Paradox which displays all the information seamlessly. Finally, in addition to the bad UI it is very difficult to understand how to do even the most basic actions, or to understand what various techs, governmental skills, and ships do. They do have both a beginners guide and a manual for the game, which I have read before and after playing, yet they are sparse and do not contain anything but the most basic generalities. Underneath all these problems I think there is an interesting game, but its not there yet and I hope it becomes what they say it will. On the other hand, some of the UI seems so terrible that it should really be redone entirely and I don&apos;t have much hope of that. As the game improves (hopefully) I plan to adjust the score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2422167">Expand</a></span>

To this day there are still a few issues, however anyone who played Sword of the Stars 1 from the beginning can tell you that even the first game was not perfect when it came out however it is one of the best 4x games that is out right now.  With Sword of the Stars 2 it is moving in the same direction as the first one.  There are very few major bugs in the game as of now.  You can actually play the game, and while it is different in so many ways than Sots 1, I personally feel that the game is better than the first.  Now if they can get rid of all the remaining bugs that crash the game and get is completed.  I will say that if you do purchase the game now you are helping fund the completion of the game and personally I see nothing wrong with that.  Yes it would have been nice to know this from the beginning, but really get over it people when the game is finished it will be amazing based on what has been fixed so far.  I am glad that I bought this game when I did and I have no issues with the waiting(I did the same with Minecraft and that turned out wonderful too).  However for those who are not wanting the game till its finished Kerberos has said that they would let the world know when the game is finished.  I can tell you that if you pay attention you can pick the game up really cheap and then save some money now.  I ended up only paying 7 dollars for Sots 2 and I got way more than 7 dollars of entertainment from the game and know that I will continue to do so.  The game is improving at every patch.  The bad For me there are really only 2 things that are worth putting in this spot from my last play through.
<br>
<br>1) There is a Pure virtual function call that happens in combat some times that crashes the game.
<br>
<br>2) The Zuul (Suul&apos;ka Horde) do seem to be unfinished with there tooltips.  Also had a wierd bug where the game said that a node that wasn&apos;t actually there had collapsed and then it gave me a free ship that had a very long trip at sublight back to the closest station.
<br>
<br>The Good
<br>1) The new mission system which while different from sots 1 in my opinion is way better and more realistic
<br>
<br>2) In sots 1 I never messed with my budget after the initial placement of 50 percent savings and 50 percent research and that worked great for me.  In Sots 2 There are many reasons to actually mess with your budget and there are actual options for things to adjust instead of one slider.
<br>
<br>3)The hiver are awesome and even more so than in sots 1
<br>
<br>4) I love the new feasibility study option over the not having the tech show up at all.  And even if right now you get a low result you can study other things related to the subject and come back and try again and get a better score.
<br>
<br>5) The graphics are much improved.
<br>
<br>6) The retrofit system to let you upgrade your weapons on your current ships.
<br>
<br>7) In sots 1 when you used a colonization ship you lost it and had to build a new one.  In Sots 2 you no longer lose the colonization ship.  This is also more realistic.
<br>
<br>8) You can control the Lords of Winter in the game which is awesome as there way bigger than any thing else on the board(You are limited to a max of 7 I believe)
<br>
<br>I could go on and on about improvements over sots 1.  The thing really is that change is good and waiting for this game to be complete will be worth it.  Yes there are issues still, but where sots 1 felt like a 4x lite game sots 2 takes the series into hardcore 4x.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2557110">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As for the bad reviews, they are no longer valid.
<br>For those who are complaining about a lack of manual, you are just lazy as hell, because if you&apos;ve actually spent any time looking for the manual of the game you&apos;d have noticed that it was released digitally AT RELEASE. Not to mention sots2 wiki has answers for EVERYTHING, so stop being lazy and use google it&apos;s your friend.
<br>
<br>The starmap part of the game has become much better and more polished than it was, and the added view options make the game much easier to manage.
<br>
<br>The battles are great and immersive, you can aim at sections/subsections of a ship by clicking on parts of the ship, like weapons, forth mid and aft sections engines and such, not to mention you can turn and roll your ships into different positions and with this you can minimise damage to your ships and if you are at a disadvantage this can turn the tide giving the combat immersion.
<br>
<br>The research is also good, the feasibility is there for a reason: the reason being if you dont have the pre-requisites there might still be a chance of researching the tech albeit low. Also the devs staid that they&apos;ll probably add revisit feasibility option.
<br>
<br>Retrofitting: you can retrofit old and outdated ships with new and shiny tech, so you dont have to destroy your ships all the time to upgrade.
<br>
<br>Yes there are still bugs although in the past days of playing the game i have seen none, yes the turn end times can be long when playing against 5 ais, and the ui is still crappy, but you should still try this game now, it&apos;s playable, its fun, and in this state it can beat other 4x games.
<br>
<br>Also there&apos;s the dedication of the dev team, after release for months they released weekly 4-5 patches and even now they release monthly 2-4 patches i mean come on what other game gets support like this?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2712008">Expand</a></span>

<br>I didn&apos;t buy this game when it first came out, so I cannot comment on the launch situation which seems overwhelmingly negative.    Stability:
<br>The game is in good shape.  Minus a few minor annoyances (some of which have been fixed in the latest &quot;enhanced edition&quot; and expansion), the game is very stable and plays well.    UI:
<br>The UI leaves a bit to be desired.  Mostly, there&apos;s a lot of guesswork and not a lot of helpful tooltips.  Even reading over the wiki, the forums, and the manuals there are still things I do not quite comprehend.  The tech tree does not do a very good job of saying what is a prerequisite of what unless it&apos;s a direct upgrade. (IE - To build a leviathan ship, you need to have several techs that are in various tech lines.  Nowhere clearly lists the exact path of all the techs you need to reach leviathans.)  Some of this on the forums was explained as a deliberate obfuscation, but that does not help people like me who like their information very accessible.    I cannot for the life of me understand why there is no bulk management screen for anything.  Sure, there&apos;s a fleet management - but you can&apos;t modify admirals or issue commands to the fleets from it.  You literally can&apos;t do anything with the fleets from the fleet summary screen other than look at your fleets.  Being able to issue orders to your fleets from here would be a 100% decrease in annoying micromanagement.    The planet manager is slightly more useful in that you can adjust your construction --&gt; trade balance, overharvest, biosphere, and infrastructure/terraforming sliders - but lacks a huge feature in that you cannot issue construction orders to build ships.  You also cannot issue colonize orders to planets that are uninhabited from this management screen.    The station manager does what it says, allows you to manage your stations, modules, and even issue station upgrade orders - but does not let you build new stations from the screen.    For all of these things that are &quot;missing&quot; above, you have to either scroll to the fleet and issue an order to do it, or scroll to the destination (spot you are attacking, colonizing, building a station, etc.) and issue a fleet to come do it.  It&apos;s clunky and tedious when you have a bunch of fleets or things you want to do.    Accessibility/Gameplay:
<br>It has a bit of a learning curve, especially coming from SOTS 1.  There are several things done differently, but in my opinion the game adds more depth while retaining the charm of the original.    Read the manual and study the forums and wiki, there are several game concepts I wasn&apos;t even aware of (like provinces giving additional trade cash bonuses, biosphere affecting psionic points, and keeping the treasury 500,000+ giving a morale bonus) until I dug around on the forums and got a better understanding of what exactly the purpose was.    The shining star of this game is the unique qualities given to each race.  It&apos;s not just a simple &quot;This race gets +10 to weapon damage&quot;, but there is a fundamental and drastically different travel system for each race which completely changes the gameplay strategy of each race.  The randomized tech tree is great in that you can&apos;t always bulldoze to your tech of choice, there&apos;s a chance it won&apos;t be available and you will have to adapt on the go.  It keeps things interesting and the gameplay dynamic.    Graphics:
<br>
<br>The quality is good overall, with the exception of some of the text and weapons graphics.  Zooming in, some of the text becomes pixellated/blurry like it&apos;s not designed to scale (vectorized vs. rasterized) - I am specifically referring to the star system names.  The same situation exists with some of the laser beam style graphics in real time combat (you see it on the opening background video with the &quot;lightning&quot; type weapon and green lasers).  Fully zoomed in, it seems like there is a fair amount of sharp edges and a lack of smoothing.  That being said, the ship textures are amazing and the fact that you can target specific points on a ship and whittle away at weak points is excellent game design.    Overall:
<br>
<br>The game is a very fun game, though trying at times with what seems like tedious fleet management.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2808377">Expand</a></span>

<br>I feel for Kerberos that this game may never stand amongst the great 4X&apos;s. If it had been released in it&apos;s EOF(Enhanced) state then it would have rocked.
<br>But it&apos;s cheaper now, and if you need a 4X fix, i don&apos;t hesitate to recommend it now.</span>

Advertising the game when there are so many people warning about it and its developer company would need a miracle or a professional spin-doctor to make it actually work out in favour and turn it into profitable franchise. As an indy company  they should never have got to that point.<br><br>About the game itself there is not much to say about yet as I have yet to finish a game. I always hit a game-stopping crash even after nearly 1.5 months after release. It is shaping up, things are improving, and alot of things finally getting functional. It is almost as watching game development live. As if you are part of their QA team. There is no doubt about it they are really trying to fix it up. But they are already over their promised deadline. If things are going as they are now then I&apos;d say they will be done around end of February 2012. Which should have been the official release date.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2081878">Expand</a></span>

I was incredibly wrong to have such optimism and not take the offered refund.  The game is barely playable because of the amount of &quot;crash to desktop&quot; and End Turn cycles taking an obscene amount of time to run.  It appears on a 3 player map after turn 100, end turn cycles can take 5 to 10 minutes to run.  Some screen transitions, going from starmap to to research for example, can take around 30 seconds to load. CPU idles around 30% load and GPU seems to idle around 11%.  Key features are still missing.  The game is like ordering a new car and the dealership promises delivery.    Instead they drop off a kit and a team of mechanics take up camp on your driveway.  The mechanics have put the car together but it is still missing the accelerator, turn signals, brakes and for some reason has a 8track tape player.  So you can only look at your car, and maybe drive it a little bit but you aren&apos;t going far with it.<br><br>Some day it may run, but so far it is not looking.  I suggest not buying this one.  Kerberose Productions should be made example of what not to do to your fanbase and paying customers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2247893">Expand</a></span>

However even after just a week of patching the game is very stable for most people.  I am writing this review based off of my 493 turn game using the Zuul on the map Disc.<br><br>For the most part the game functions well.  There are some bugs and problem areas but in general, after Friday&apos;s patch, things have gotten smoother.  A lot of the stuff that was in SOTS1 is still present and, in most cases, updated or built upon.  First let&apos;s go over the changes to the game play.  SOTSII is more about macro management then micro.  Planets have now been places into a new entity on the star map called systems. Basically like a real star system the planets orbit around a sun.  You can no longer have an infinite number of ships in a fleet and fleets require a command information center ship along with an admiral.  You also do not directly interface with fleets anymore, instead you give them orders through a context menu.  Admirals can also ignore your orders if certain conditions are met, for example they will not usually attack a planet if you are not at war with that empire.  Fighters and Destroyers are no longer used.  Instead you start out with Cruisers and can progress up to Leviathans.  Levs are the new biggest thing on the block and dwarf cruisers and size up dreadnaughts by a fare margin.  They are also expensive as all hell.  When designing ships you can no longer put whatever you want onto a ship; Kerberos added several metrics to ships that regulate what can and cannot be put onto a ship.  For example you cannot fit lancers to all of the heavy cannons on a dreadnaught now because there will not be enough power available.  Laser weapons take up energy while everything else takes up supply space.  Both take up points from the crew member metric.  Research has also change a bit from prime.  Now you cannot immediately research all technologies, instead you now have some techs that are locked and must be studied for feasibility.  If your scientists find that a technology has a low feasibility rating you are less like to be able to learn that tech and it will go over budget indefinitely when researching.  As other have stated, the game is not quite finished yet, but it should be close to complete and reasonably bug free by December.  You can still play through it right now but between updates and bugs you may find that you are forced to restart your games a lot.  However if you can put aside your gamer ego and peer into what is actually there at the moment you might be presently surprised that this could become possibly the best 4X game released recently.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1857763">Expand</a></span>

But that is not enough to make it a good game. The UI is still horrble, its very hard to find out what is really going on in your empire, what possible threats are incomming (be that some space menaces attacking your planet or simple over-spending of your budget). On strategic level, game is very complicated, but that does not transfer to wide variety of strategic options, on the contrary, you get drawn into finding out some small details (like why the hell can&apos;t I send my ships to system X). Space combat is quite boring, plays by itself and if you have bigger fleet, you win, if smaller, you loose and nothing you can click can change it (well, maybe you can retreat if you are lucky to find out how, i wasnt). Research system is ok, although I personally do not like the randomized tree and time-wasting feasibility studies, but thats personal preference. To summarize: the devs fixed the crash bugs during last 8 months. Now they should spend at least the same time to make this game fun - but I&apos;m not sure they are willing to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2508135">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen a game implement so many different sci-fi ideas so well - some of the hundreds of examples include: AI uprisings, galaxy-infesting insect swarms, tractor-beam drones which attempt to smash your ships onto the surface of a planet, asteroid storms, ancient automated defence platforms, a society of telepathic nomadic cyborg space-squids, megacomets which carve a path through the stars and I even once had a &apos;galactic peace enforcer&apos; from another galaxy who sat in the middle of the map and broadcast orders for every species in the galaxy to stop all wars, otherwise it would use almost unlimited tech to wipe out the aggressors.
<br>All happening visually and spontaneously in an unscripted - randomly generated way, on a 3D plane, and in bloody excellent DX10 graphics.
<br>
<br>Of course it also has a mind-bogglingly complex strategic interface, weeks-long playtimes and a cliff of a learning curve, but most good games do.
<br>
<br>The game has come a long way since its abysmal release over a year ago, the game is now fully playable and fairly stable overall. I play it regularly and quite enjoy it. That said, there are some lingering interface issues and one or two features which don&apos;t feel properly polished yet - and I get a crash to desktop once every few hours of gameplay.
<br>
<br>The developers have a long history of supporting their games for YEARS after release, and so far they&apos;ve deployed thousands of free bugfixes and content updates, plus released a free expansion pack in the last few days.
<br>
<br>I have absolutely no doubt that the game will be patched to perfection and mountains content added as the years go by, just as the first game was supported.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: This is a well-implemented deep sci-fi universe with impressively creative mechanics, sophisticated and satisfying space combat and some of the most dedicated developers (Supported their last game with 3 expansion packs and constant content patches over 5 years) and deserving publishers out there (Paradox fund new and interesting kinds of games, unlike the commercial giants who tend to be afraid of creativity).
<br>
<br>I strongly recommend you buy it and support these guys to make a great game even better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2809323">Expand</a></span>

There are many features and lots to do, however it is complicated in areas, which will make the casual crows hate it, but when has the casual crowd ever played space 4X games...
<br>Pro&apos;s: Faction differences - particularly in it&apos;s travel methods
<br>Mission System - initially seems worse when you get started but when you have a large empire you notice how intuitive it actually is
<br>Combat - looks great and is very tactical
<br>Graphics - Game looks amazing
<br>
<br>Con&apos;s:
<br>Load times - game has long load times, at times
<br>CTD - game occasionally crashes, however you can see all the patches for this and it auto saves regularly</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=2811165">Expand</a></span>

I understand the people who were upset at the time of release and they were issued refunds. Was the game ready for release? No, but I would rather it be released unfinished and get patched into the great game that it is becoming then have it to have died like so many of other due to lack of funds to continue development. Should the company have let people pre-order it and then have access to the beta like other games have done? Maybe that would have been better. But everyone who says the gameplay sucks hasn&apos;t spent enough time playing to know what they are talking about. I realize that might be from all the crashes that the game experienced at release. Was it really buggy? Yes. Was it complete? No. Does the game suck? Absolutely not. If you don&apos;t want to play it because it&apos;s unfinished wait until the company makes the announcement that it is in a releasable state, which they acknowledge it wasn&apos;t on Oct 28th. But one of the devs stated it was either release at that time or not release at all. I chose to support a team that obviously has passion for the game they have created rather than so many companies that stop supporting a game as soon as it is release. The game it is very complicated and visually stunning. The initial instability is gone. It is too bad how short-sited people are these days. Just thought I&apos;d chime in my two cents. Love the game and I have spent too much time playing it already.   :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1998213">Expand</a></span>

I would recommend not buying it in its present state unless you would like to support the developers. If you just want to play the game, wait a couple weeks. THE GAME DOES NOT DESERVE THE TERRIBLE REVIEWS YOU SEE HERE. IT IS A GOOD GAME OFF TO A BAD START.<br><br>THAT SAID, here is my review.<br><br>This game represents the very niche 4X space genre. Like many space-themed games, it is very complex, with deep customization options, huge randomly populated tech trees, dozens of star systems per map with the possibility of multiple habitable planets in each system, diplomacy, random grand menace encounters, etc.<br><br>Essentially, it plays like a much more complex version of the Total War series. You build and explore from the main turn-based strategic star map, and have actual battles in a real-time combat mode.<br><br>Graphically, the game is beautiful, with some exceptions. Ships are rendered in unprecedented detail, and the modular construction of ships mean that each design can look very different from one in the same class. Explosions and weaponry is dazzling and intricate, with ship damage being represented down to individual turrets.<br><br>The UI is one of the major downsides of the game. While it may be improved upon in the future, right now it is very intimidating and unintuitive. Something as simple as sending a ship to another system took me about 15 minutes to figure out.<br><br>AI is also a bit strange. Diplomacy can be a chore, as other factions tend to act randomly/irrationally. Again, this may be improved in the coming weeks.<br><br>Again, this game has many excellent features and will be worth buying in the coming weeks. Wait a bit, them give it a go! This may be one of the last decent space games we see in a long time, so fans of the genre should consider buying now to support the developers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1832681">Expand</a></span>

It was an innovative and fun game that the developer (Kerberos) strongly supported over the years with patches and expansions.  The game was long on content and provided interesting strategic challenges, while still being a blast.  The space battles in particular were a both fun and beautiful.<br><br>Due to the above I eagerly awaited the October 28th release of Sword of the Stars 2 (SotS2).  SotS2 promised to follow the standard sequel formula with updated graphics and some overall design improvements.  In some ways it has met that promise.  The graphics are breathtaking, and there are many improvements to the overall design.<br><br>Unfortunately, I am badly disappointed with the game.  The game is not particularly buggy, and does not crash overly much for a new release, but it appears to be simply unfinished.  Many core features are simply unimplemented even after a couple hurried patches.  Large stretches of the game look as though they are just rough drafts.  With so much of the game unfinished one wonders how any balancing work or AI development could have been seriously undertaken.<br><br>The most frustrating thing of all is that it is clear there is a tremendous game here...or at least the potential for one.  Yet, until A LOT more work is put in, the game is borderline unplayable. This makes the game very hard to rate.   It is like a brilliant student with good test scores who just didn&apos;t write a term paper.  Sure you could fail them, but that doesn&apos;t seem fair.  On the other hand just grading them on potential isn&apos;t fair to the rest of the students who actually did the work.  I really wish I could just hand out an &quot;incomplete&quot;, but metacritic does not work that way.  With another few months of work this could easily have been one of the best games of the year (95).<br>But as it is now I would not recommend anyone buy it, even hardcore fans of the genre (25).<br><br>I guess I will average those and give it a 6.<br><br>If the developer survives long enough to complete the game there should be many long hours of fun to be had sometime in the distant future.  Whether that is weeks, months, or years from now only time will tell.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars-ii-lords-of-winter/user-reviews?user_review_id=1827586">Expand</a></span>

<br>IT WORKS! IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!
<br>Its pretty fun too :) Weapons and defences seem rather balanced, The AI seems to know what it&apos;s doing (to an extent) the menu and UI makes sense and I have not had a single glitch or crash in the last 10 hours playing.</span>

Frustrating movement system and combat system. Normally when something like this happens one is rewarded with stunning graphics, but not so here. The graphics are merely alright and not worth the abysmal gameplay. If you liked the originals you probably won&apos;t like this.</span>

Maybe not as much of a classic as the original SotS was, but with a bit more TLC and polish from Paradox, this game could easily become supremely awesome. A shame that Paradox has dropped the ball on this.</span>
