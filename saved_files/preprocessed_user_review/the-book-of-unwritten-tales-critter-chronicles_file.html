About half of the game was completed by my nine-year-old with a little help. I think this is a great game to play with your kids, they love the sophomoric humor. Some of the jokes are laugh-out-loud funny. Overall I thought this game was a little more polished and clever than the first one. I definitely recommend playing BoUT first before playing this game, since the story makes more sense this way. Overall the game was very entertaining for the story and the comedy, the puzzles keep you busy but are not all that challenging.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-book-of-unwritten-tales-critter-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=3746746">Expand</a></span>

Characters now move and run across the screen more often, but still one has to wait out animations and most cutscenes without the ability to skip them, which is kind of a downside if one wants to hunt for the hard-difficulty achievements right after finishing the game.</span>

<br>
<br>I did enjoy my time with this game for the most part. The presentation is nice and i enjoyed the voice acting in the game. The lack of support for 16:9 ratio kind of sucks but it is hardly a deal breaker. There could also have been a bit more environments in the game but overall i enjoyed the presentation of the game and i found it to pretty charming.
<br>
<br>The story and character was also pretty charming and they kept me interested throughout the game. I wouldn&apos;t call anything especially good but they were enjoyable enough even though there could have been some more characters in the game.
<br>
<br>Overall i found everything except the puzzles to be enjoyable though nothing amazing. There are however a lot of really nonsensical puzzles in this game and i can&apos;t imagine that people could figure them out without simply trying every possible combination. It might just be me who is dumb and i am sure that there are people who really enjoy the challenge but they were just to many nonsensical and far fetched puzzles in the game for my taste. And it did somewhat screw up my enjoyment of the game.
<br>
<br>If you are fine with that then this game is a charming and competent adventure game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-book-of-unwritten-tales-critter-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=5372976">Expand</a></span>

<br>The previous part had the same problem but there was at least a workaround available.
<br>
<br>Imho overall worse than the first part.
<br>
<br>Most of the riddles are absolutely absurd and not in a funny way. They can sometimes just be solved by randomly + multiply clicking items / persons. Almost none of them can be solved by logic or intuitively.
<br>
<br>It nevertheless overall is a somehow entertaining game and at least some jokes are actually funny. Graphics and sound are okay (for a point&amp;click adventure) despite the mentioned problems.
<br>The story of the game is okay but nothing special.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-book-of-unwritten-tales-critter-chronicles/user-reviews?user_review_id=4564219">Expand</a></span>
