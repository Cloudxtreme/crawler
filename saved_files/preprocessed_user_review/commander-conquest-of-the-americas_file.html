It is a very high-level, macro view overall. Fleet battles can be fought on an individual or more RTS level and can be quite enjoyable. Movement through the quite tedious and slow periods is easily mitigated with the battle speed control, adjustable from 1x to 10x.
<br>
<br>Trade is a bit flawed as was mentioned in some previous reviews. It is greatly simplified with trade possible between your own colonies (although not profitable) and your home port. It seems that the AI nations can offer up one-time trade shipments to you, but not vice versa. The diplomatic screens are pretty limited. Also a gripe, when diplomatic offerings are sent to you, there is no counter-offer capability, you either accept or decline, and when trade shipments are offered to you, there isn&apos;t any good way to tell whether you&apos;re getting a good or bad deal.
<br>
<br>The graphics are nice and the ambient sounds are good as well, without much variation though.
<br>
<br>Overall, while trading is how you make your money in the game (taxation gets you nowhere except having pissed off colonists), trade is not very involved or deep. Basically anything you buy from your colonies makes you money selling back to home port. The quest objectives are a nice way of keeping things a bit more interesting. The Pirate pack is a cool idea and really adds to the most interesting element of the game, being the ship battles. Capturing pirate ships and then getting their ships and treasure maps is pretty cool. Being able to automate trade routes is a huge gain for the game, otherwise it would be completely mundane to play. The interface has some quirkiness to it and it seems that some controls could be better implemented, particularly in the management windows. Many times, too many clicks are necessary to do something.
<br>
<br>Add a bit more capability and detail to the trading and diplomacy and streamline the interface some and this would be a great game. Considering this, the game is still fun to play, just not *great* to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/commander-conquest-of-the-americas/user-reviews?user_review_id=3640300">Expand</a></span>

Trade mechanics are solid and the naval battles are ok but after a while it gets quite repetitive and feels like you have nothing to do.

<br>A real lack of a basic guide will mean you will miss things which are required in some cases.</span>
