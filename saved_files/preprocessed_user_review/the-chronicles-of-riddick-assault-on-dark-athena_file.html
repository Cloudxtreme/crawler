Shortly into the game I began to actually appreciate it and felt the urge to finish it all the way through. The game only has about 6 hours of game play but it gets straight to the point. It&apos;s a nice variety of shooting, hand to hand combat, and strategy (mainly if finding ways to climb/crawl/jump and overall maneuver into new rooms or areas). I enjoyed putting a few hours into this &apos;different&apos; FPS and I give it a decent 7/10 but nothing more. It&apos;s worth beating the adventure once and getting to use the weapons towards the end of the game (SCAR gun and the mechs are sick).

Very evocative of the movies, extremely enjoyable to play, very little to complain about. Fighting is visceral and enjoyable, environments are engrossing and if you buy it in a bundle with the original game it&apos;s an exceptional value. Throws a few curve balls to shake you out of complacency, and there is as much fun to be had stealthing around as running and gunning. What I enjoyed the most is the game starts with you being incarcerated in a super-max prison that no-one should be able to escape -- and after you do just that the lengths your captors go to contain you just get wilder and wilder from there. There are a couple of moments in this game I will NEVER forget -- and that&apos;s saying something. Great bargain, great game, great fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-chronicles-of-riddick-assault-on-dark-athena/user-reviews?user_review_id=2331475">Expand</a></span>

There are quite a few bugs that they need to work out, but that doesnt take away from this great game. + and Butcher Bay is included! maybe not such a plus for those who already had butcher bay...

The plot was complex to the point that I needed a walkthrough to get through Escape from Butcher Bay.  The best thing about both games was that cut scenes were kept to a minimum so that the game moved fast.</span>

There are some really cool gameplay sections in the game and the mix of brawling, shooting and sneaking does its part to keep the game feeling fresh. The game do however have its fair share of problems. Even though the shooting and brawling in the game works well enough cant they compete with other games in similar genres. The brawling feels stiffer and and more button-mashingy than i remembered it to be from Butcher bay, and the shooting simply doesnt feel up to date with the current standard. Add some framerate problems, needless backtracking,  dumb quickslots options ,annoying checkpoints and you will get a game that is a bit rough around the edges to say the least.  The game is still alright though and if you like the genre you could do worse. Especially considering that you get the original for &quot;free&quot; with the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-chronicles-of-riddick-assault-on-dark-athena/user-reviews?user_review_id=2635723">Expand</a></span>

You have to phone a support hotline to get more and you have to state a legitimate reason before you get one - try this in the middle of the night. This game is a rental at full-price, it has no resell value. Do yourself a favor and wait until this game is available in the bargain bin for 10 bucks without drm in a year or so.

<br>-It seems to lack ideas, this sequel if you can call it that.
<br>It feels like the chronicles of riddick movie in that it feels like a ham fisted attempt at squeezing all the mystique out of everything while giving us only the bare bones of story, characters. We aren&apos;t even given any side missions to do like we could in escape from butcher bay.
<br>-a fair bit shorter than the previous game, and for such a short game you do a fair bit of backtracking.
<br>-level design is no where near upto par of the previous games, dark athena isn&apos;t the big sprawling ship you think. Its basically a series of corridoors with some storage areas and robot storage. One short section in the &quot;labs&quot;.
<br>-gameplay isn&apos;t up to par, you are always forced into stealth, brawling or shooting. You&apos;re never given a choice, its always one course of action that a section is designed for.
<br>-Ironlord is the cheapest enemy in the series, he counterattacks you every time (and it takes out one hp each hit) so you can never hit him first. This is why the counter attack system is always so stupid to be included in multiplayer or against unfairly cheap AI. You can never attack first or you automatically get hit.
<br>-You can&apos;t resign weapon keys. The sprint key doesn&apos;t work in single player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-chronicles-of-riddick-assault-on-dark-athena/user-reviews?user_review_id=3147006">Expand</a></span>

<br>However, I got Escape from Butcher Bay in the first place because it is included in this game for free, so all in all, it&apos;s a great deal and a really good bundle. The gameplay reminded me of Deus Ex, so if you liked that series, this one may interest you as well, even though it&apos;s nowhere near as complex as far as game mechanics are concerned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-chronicles-of-riddick-assault-on-dark-athena/user-reviews?user_review_id=5193448">Expand</a></span>
