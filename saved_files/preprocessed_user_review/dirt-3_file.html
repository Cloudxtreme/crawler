What turned me off from Dirt 2 was the testosterone-fuled X-games garbage which had swallowed the game and rally-racing was given a backseat. I heard Dirt 3 was more rally oriented and had less X-game involvement. For the most part, these predictions were correct. There is more rally stages now and the X-games stuff has been toned down. Unfortunately, these pros come with some cons. For starters, the majority of the rally stages barely last longer than a minute and a half and the tracks themselves are very wide and the only challenge comes from annoyingly placed obstacles such as logs or tractors. Secondly, the X-games malarkey has been replaced by by Ken Block&apos;s Gymkhana stunt-driving rubbish. To be perfectly honest, this is actually worse than the X-games. Not only does it have nothing to do with rally or off-road racing, it&apos;s absolutely tedious and frustrating. I also wish they would bring back the car-tuning options of Dirt 1 as the options in Dirt 3 have little affect on how the car handles and drives. For a joke, I set all the tuning options to the silliest settings I could think of and the car was still perfectly drivable. Overall, the impression I get from this game is that they made it more rally oriented while cutting back on rally content, which makes it fall on its face a little bit. Most of the rally stages are just variations of the same stage and the tracks can get very easy in places. They also need to start focusing on real racing instead of smearing Ken Block and testosterone everywhere. Rally is a European dominated race, it&apos;s sad seeing it so Americanized.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1652385">Expand</a></span>

DiRT 2 on Ultra is equivalent to this on High without Ambient Occlusion. The Medium preset in DiRT 3 is what the Xbox 360 version looks like. My PC crashed within 2 minutes of track time on Ultra, which doesn&apos;t happen after 2 hours on BF3 on High! Anyway, the only graphical difference between the 360 version and PC is the more consistent environmental textures. Cars look no different really, apart from more reflections. The green tint can be annoying as well. However, that&apos;s the only downside to this game. Achievements are good, career is of perfect length and variety and multiplayer is even more rewarding than DiRT 2, and more balanced and polished. This really is an ultimate package. I&apos;m glad that there is now full controller support for PC. You can navigate menus easily and most controllers will work with the game. This is a racing game for everyone. There is rally, rallycross, gymkhana, hillclimb, one-on-one crossovers and landrush. You really can&apos;t go wrong. There are now assists so you can cater the experience to suit you. Vehicle set-ups are simplified like in DiRT 2 but now the game will automatically choose the optimal even if you don&apos;t change anything. Only gear ratios are constant, but they&apos;re more personal preference. Anyway, apart from the inefficient and taxing EGO 2.0 game engine, which quite evidently isn&apos;t very good given how demanding games like this, F1 2011 and F1 2012 are for very little eye candy gain, it&apos;s still just as good on PC as it is on 360. The lack of improved graphics is dissapointing, but that shouldn&apos;t be enough to stop you buying this amazing game. You can read my 360 review of why this is the case if you want to know more. In short, it&apos;s the variety of game modes, variety of cars, complete and near-perfect multiplayer and a well-paced DiRT tour along with polished time trial leaderboards. What more could you want?!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2708413">Expand</a></span>

With a special controller or on a console, I can see this being a great game to invest in.  But I grade it based off of what I played with, and I don&apos;t want to have to purchase special controllers just to play the game with more efficiency.  I&apos;ll buy it for Xbox if I want to play with a controller.  Fortunately, I got this game with my AMD graphics card for free, otherwise I would have been a bit more dissapointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2157372">Expand</a></span>

<br>overall a great rally game if you like racing games buy it!!!!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3348164">Expand</a></span>

This probably isn&apos;t the game for you.
<br>
<br>I wouldn&apos;t mind that rally itself makes  20% of the game content, because the driving model in this game is actually pretty well executed. There are, however, other annoying things that I do mind in a game I paid for. A game that, on the outside, makes it look like you&apos;re getting a complete package. Don&apos;t fool yourself, you&apos;re not.
<br>
<br>The game shoves it to your face pretty much everywhere you go, that you can buy additional content. The purchasable content doesn&apos;t actually extend the game as you may be used in other titles. It completes it. This game makes you feel like you&apos;re playing a demo version of an actual game, not a full AAA title. In pretty much every race series, there&apos;s a race to be bought. In every car class, there are cars to be bought&#x2014;great many of them, unfortunately.
<br>
<br>Add to it the content reuse that you&apos;re gonna see in pretty much every game. Oh, you&apos;re driving in Finland again? Nothing bad with that, or is there? There is. You&apos;re gonna go through the same turns that you&apos;ve seen in previous races, they&apos;re just put together in a different order than before.
<br>
<br>Fancy some freestyle driving with Ken Block at your back? Don&apos;t worry, he&apos;s not gonna give you any proper advice on how to drive. His role there is just to add a little diversity to the annoying voices you&apos;re going to be hearing every time you want to race, every time you finish a race and every time you&apos;re trying to click your way through the annoyingly put together menu. Transitions in the menu take so long that you&apos;re gonna spend 20 seconds clicking through, loading excluded, before you even get to get a go at a 90 second race.
<br>
<br>The game has a hotkey for uploading your races to YouTube. No idea who came up with that feature, but you&apos;re gonna be reminded of it every second race: &apos;That was great, Amigo! You should put it on YouTube&apos;. Time developing this &apos;feature&apos; would have been much better spent building real rally courses.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3410074">Expand</a></span>

Yes I am referring to the Gymkhana or however you spell it stunt driving crap! Where it not for this crap I would have rated Dirt 3 above Dirt 2 But it has totally ruined my enjoyment of the game because it has stopped my progress dead in Dirt Tour. I have a sim driving **** with a Logitech g25 wheel and have the hand break mapped to the clutch peddle and Dirt3 setting on hardest and I can tell you even with these highly sensitive analog controls this gymkhana nonsense is impossible to control! I don&apos;t mind coming 4th of 5th in a rally at top difficulty setting but this Gymkhana stuff is crap. Codemasters please remove it form the game. Here&apos;s how you make dirt 4. 1. Improve graphics for realism.
<br>2. Improve physics like rFactor. Stick to Rally Cross world championship! There! you have a winner. The only thing that is improving about Codemasters driving games is the graphics. Everything else is going backwards. If you haven&apos;t already bought this game take the advise of a long time sim racing enthusiast and get rFactor 2 instead. Alternatively if you are a console user drop dead!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1736160">Expand</a></span>

I really struggled with rating this game. If I had never played another codemasters racer it would have easily rated a 7 or 8. Unfortunately, I&apos;ve seen what a spectacular job they did with Dirt2 and this game just doesn&apos;t measure up. It&apos;s not so much a single massive problem as it is lots of little things that add up to spoil what would otherwise be a great game. For starters, The interface has been completely overhauled. Rather than placing the various menus in a track side &apos;Trailer&apos;, Dirt3 uses a plain old text menu laced with strange triangle motiffs.More staright-forward certainly, nut it completely kills the sense of immersion the previous UI generated.
<br>Which brings me to perhaps my next major gripe, removal of the in race voices for the AIs. It sounds like such a minor thing, but having the AI drivers actually talking back and forth and reacting to what was happening in the race gave Dirt2 a completely different feel in single player. It felt more like racing with a bunch of friends rather than just grinding against some oblivious robot. It even had an affect on how I drove. In Dirt3 I can run another driver off a cliff with absolutely no consequences. In Dirt2, cut off an opponent or pull some other dangerous maneuver and the other drivers would tell you about it  in no uncertain terms. Nothing like having Tanner Foust or Ken Block call you an a--hole (sort of) to make you think twice about being hyper-aggressive.
<br>
<br>Another major issue for me is the heavy emphasis on Rally. Don&apos;t get me wrong I love rally, be it a traditional point-to-point or scraping paint in Rally-X. There is however such a thing as to much of a good thing. Dirt2 did a great job of balancing out the formality of rally with plenty of truck/buggy based events that allowed you to let loose a little bit without having to worry about hitting a perfect apex to shave 0.002 seconds off your time. The trucks are still there, but they&apos;ve been relegated to a single event type (landrush) with just a single available vehicle ( the &apos;landrush event truck&apos;). You can choose your livery (sort off) by choosing a team but other than that no real choice. It&apos;s as if they grudgingly let you race them, but there&apos;s a nagging feeling that the game is telling you &quot;Trucks? yeah we have those but wouldn&apos;t you much rather be over here perfecting your rally skills? See, look shiny classic rally cars from the 70&apos;s. That&apos;s right, forget about those dirty, smelly buggies and come over this way....&quot;.
<br>
<br>The final gripe I have is the way you progress through the single player career. You still get experience,  but rather than the leveling system that gradually opens up more and more opportunities as you progress, this is pretty much a straight point-A to point-B. Also rather than earning cash as a reward for completeing a race has been removed. Instead, you simply get handed cars and liveries at certain set points. There&apos;s no real feeling of having accomplished anything; the car isn&apos;t really yours, some random corporate just lets you use it and expects to get it back in one piece when you&apos;re done. Even worse though is the way rep (the equivanent to exp in this game) is tied to the car you drive. You get more rep from completing the &apos;bonus&apos; missions in a car that just unlocked than in your vehicle you&apos;ve been racing from the beginning. Sometimes it can be a gap of several hundred points. In essence they are constantly trying to force you to drive a different vehicle rather that spending the time to master a single car you really like.
<br>
<br>To sum up. If you are a rally nut and the mountian dew fueled, Americanized X-sport theme of Dirt 2 set your teeth on edge, then Dirt 3 is probably a must buy. If you are like me however, and enjoyed Dirt2s blend crazy antics and challenging events then Dirt3 is going to feel somewhat unfullfilling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1644818">Expand</a></span>

The poorly kept RV that traveled around the world with you in Dirt 2 was such a charming idea for what was essentially the menu screen, which was always set in the middle of a huge crowd with music blaring  and the scenery of the location you decided to race in looming in the background. Dirt 3 ditched that for a much more simple menu that, while streamlined and stylish, is just kinda boring, unless rotating golden pyramids are your thing. The gameplay is fantastic of course, the cars handle wonderfully and the sense of speed is spot on. However, I didn&apos;t get the same sense of excitement, the rush I got when I played D2. Watching a replay of  my speedy little Ford Cosworth zipping through the Finnish wilderness in its beautifully rendered glory was cool and all but the techno-pop track that played in the background simply didn&apos;t fit. At all. It didn&apos;t hold a candle to watching the replay of my Mitsubishi Evo X tearing ass through canyons in Utah while My Delirium blasted from my speakers in D2. The music list in general adds to D3&apos;s somewhat sterile presentation. I&apos;ve heard mostly techno oriented tracks so far and it&apos;s just so quiet, so subdued and when you mix that with the games (overly) simplified, calm presentation, it kinda comes off as just another race sim. Compare this to D2 which was constantly noisy and flamboyant with its presentation, which was good because it&apos;s rally racing. It&apos;s supposed to be noisy and dirty and fast paced, not quiet and clean with a bunch of friggin triangles. Graphically the game is better than its predecessor but not by leaps and bounds. This isn&apos;t a bad thing though, far from it in fact. The Dirt series is known for being beautiful and Dirt 3 doesn&apos;t disappoint. There&apos;s too much to mention in a little review like this, you really just have to play it, but the one thing I want to stress is the performance. I run these games on a 2007 iMac.... ya. Despite the fact that it&apos;s very underpowered by todays gaming standards, I run Dirt 3 perfectly fine on high settings. The Ego engine is just so well made, you get marvelous detail and performance even on lower end tech. One area they skimped on a bit was the driver detail. They sit as rigid as crash test dummies, hardly ever moving and the overall detail put into the models is lacking compared to D2. In D2 replays the game never shied away from showing your driver struggling with the vehicle, all the animations reasonably smooth and realistic. Hell even your co-driver would turn their head to look at you once or twice, a small insignificant detail but that&apos;s what made me surprised and happy to see it. There was a person next to you not a dummy. The only other downside other than the presentation is one.... single... race type.... Gymkhana. Some people may like it and that&apos;s fine. I don&apos;t hate it, it&apos;s fun to watch, but God almighty it can be a pain in the ass. Despite the games wonderful controls Gymkhana is just flat out hard and, at times, confusing. I zoom out into the arena and my first thought is &quot;What the f*ck do I do?&quot; I decide &quot;Ok, I&apos;ll spin around this pole and maybe smash those blocks. Perhaps then I&apos;ll drift under that thing and make a futile effort to connect it to the donut I&apos;ll do over there.&quot; Unless you&apos;re pretty good and I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if there were those who are, it just ends up being kind of a mess and a bit frustrating. I&apos;ve never once felt like I was doing one of those events for any reason other than getting it out of the way. It doesn&apos;t help that I&apos;m a bit of a purist I guess, I absolutely love the rally events and trailblazing and thank God Codemasters really emphasized them this time around. There&apos;s also your little &quot;HR Rep&quot; I guess you would call him, he is annoying as all hell. He&apos;s always calling you ridiculously cheesy nicknames like &quot;amigo&quot; and &quot;muchacho&quot;, it&apos;s flat out painful to hear him talk. I even found myself unconsciously hitting the mute button on my keyboard when he started to speak, it&apos;s that bad. Speaking of voice work. What happened to driver chatter? Where are the big name racers? Why aren&apos;t Katie Justice or Ken Block congratulating me on a good race? Where is Foust to be a douche when I come in second and he&apos;s first? It kills the immersion! Overall, I strongly recommend this game to racing fans. It&apos;s a strong racer. Just be prepared to be put off by the achingly sterile presentation if you were a big fan of  Dirt 2 like I am, it damn near ruined the game for me. That sense of occasion, of pure excitement, is simply lost. I know I keep referring to it but it really does make a huge impact on the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1653542">Expand</a></span>

And more funny stuff is, that the maps is all the same. I am disappointed. I want true rally with lots of maps and rally. If you have more then 50% rally in the game, and more maps, that it is a true rally.</span>

<br>
<br>don&apos;t get me wrong, its still a good game... but VERY shallow.  too ken block, DC product placement... less colin mcrae, and much less rally.  still its better than GT5&apos;s rally in many ways which felt more like an afterthought for marketing purposes.
<br>
<br>anyways, im halfway done the dirt tour (on advanced, which is ridiculously easy btw) and don&apos;t think i&apos;ll bother going back to finish it.  i expected more out of the genius that is/was codemasters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1674547">Expand</a></span>

I thought this game was about rallying? instead I find some crappy american sport.<br>I never played dirt 2 because I knew it was everything I didn&apos;t want in a racing game, but I did play dirt 1 and it is the best motor sport game I have ever played, that&apos;s why I bought dirt 3 because they said that they bought rallying back, but all I can see is something in between.<br>Ever since Collin Mcrae passed away Codemasters rallying games have gone downhill.<br>So if your looking for a good rallying game/sim Collin Mcrae Dirt is the way to go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1990454">Expand</a></span>

And that it was. For better or for worse, though, we&apos;ll find out now.<br><br>On a visual basis, even on my junker of a PC, this game is extraordinary. Droplets of rain cover my car as the pre-race cam gives me a splendid view of snow covered hills and trees. Powersliding leaves a trail of dust in my wake that resembled the one I kicked up at a dirt track near Worcester, and smashing through foam blocks in gymkhana sends a spray of green shards, shreds and pieces cascading across the car. Truly, there is truth in saying that the Dirt series has some of the best visuals in the racing genre today.<br><br>The sounds are also something to drool at. Ken Block&apos;s gymkhana-tuned Ford Fiesta is something that nearly rivals that of my dream vessel, the M3, even more so seeing as South Africa once held a twin-engine Golf that sounded strikingly similar. The trucks and buggies are on an almost identical note to those that rip up the local dirt track, and the iconic CMR poster car, the Subaru, is probably the best - and most real-sounding - rendition I have heard so far. Gameplay-wise it also has its golden moments. Even now, I am fighting myself not to go spend another three hours fooling about in the Gymkhana &quot;Tracks&quot; or piloting the RS2000 across kilometers of ready-to-be-shredded dirt and snow. There&apos;s also something very satisfying about scoring a Platinum medal on your third try of a Gymkhana race - something easily done, in this game.<br><br>But sadly, it&apos;s not all sunshine and roses. The aforementioned Gymkhana, while fun, defies every point of the CMR series, every point of a rally game, really. I see Gymkhana races, I see Gymkhana Showdowns, I see drifting (Drifting??!), all in all I see a lot of Japan and America in a game that focuses on a sport largely Europe-based. Novice drivers are in for a rough ride - of all the Dirt games, this one takes to dirt and snow the most realistically. That means loads of sliding, handfuls of grip, and (for a novice) lots and lots of crashing and restarting. For those playing without assists, this counts doubly - for some reason a car&apos;s tires get coated in butter if the player has little experience of rally in general.<br><br>The tracks are also very poorly set up. Most are about as wide as my mother-in-law, and others are just ridiculously set up - there are even stray logs and tractors laying about in some; undoubtedly the only challenge this game poses to you.<br><br>That is my main irritation with this game. Even with the unfriendliness of the driving toward new players, this game is almost shamefully forgiving - even going as far as to allow me a 7 second margin ahead of the 2nd place driver... On the highest difficulty. Even the gymkhana becomes tediously repetitive later - once you&apos;ve thrown about 2 hours into it you&apos;re dead set for a straight Gold (or even Platinum) run right till the end. Even beasts like the RS2000 become as tame as an A-Class Mercedes after a few half-hours of play.<br><br>All in all, DiRT 3 boasts a rather enjoyable experience. It won&apos;t leave you with the same satisfaction and hunger and excitement you&apos;d find with Forza, and it certainly hasn&apos;t done anything to surpass Codemasters&apos; other race (Race Driver: Grid), but overall it is a solid experience offering a good few hours&apos; worth in enjoyment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2060177">Expand</a></span>

Yet another crappy port from console to PC. The manifests itself primarily in very average graphics. Dirt 1 was fantastic. The graphics were great, and therefore this should have had excellent graphics. Instead, they&apos;re quite weak by comparison. I&apos;m sure the kiddies will think it looks great on a PS3, but for real PC based graphics, it&apos;s average. Much like Crysis 2 was.<br><br>The next thing that sucks is the terrible &quot;ello guv&apos;nor&quot; British voices that waste my time and interrupt the game. They&apos;re boring and useless. They ramble on and bloody on and I can&apos;t skip them. I don&apos;t want to hear from some faceless boring voice actor trying to create excitement about rallying and telling me how &quot;sick&quot; it is. All I want to do is race the cars. It&apos;s a huge black mark against the game, in my opinion, and the one thing that routinely pisses me off when playing it.<br><br>The racing itself is okay. Nothing particularly special. They&apos;ve claimed it&apos;s got more rallying than other games in the series, but I wouldn&apos;t know after playing it. Actual rallying is in short supply here. There&apos;s not much of it, and the stages are incredibly short as well.<br><br>The next thing that sucks are the Smelter levels. Well, they&apos;re okay, but *every* final is at the Smelter. It gets very dull. The track changes about, but it&apos;s the same location. Very poor.<br><br>However, there is a reasonable variety in the races on offer. There&apos;s dune buggys, trucks, hill climbs, gymkhana and so on. If only they hadn&apos;t made a crap looking console game and ported it to the PC.<br><br>Overall, it&apos;s a very shallow game. Not much rallying, average graphics, short races, annoying voice talking at you and wasting your time. You can further tell how crap it is because they&apos;ve spent an inordinate amount of time making little documentaries about how good it is. It&apos;s not worth $50. A $30 game at best, Poor form Codemasters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1673472">Expand</a></span>

This one let&apos;s me know again why I play games.  Yes, it is a bit sad they abandoned the festival style menus and neutralized the atmosphere from Dirt 2 , but it&apos;s not all bad because the menus are now much quicker to navigate through. All the trolls are crying about it... and the graphics... and the controls but honestly, it&apos;s still the same engine as in grit and dirt 2! it handles exactly as you&apos;re used to from codemasters race games, which is formidable. if you can&apos;t handle it, try another car or turn on some of the various help functions. And it looks brilliant: the raceway with tessellation textures, the spectacular lighting, the water looks better and the new weather effects fit in perfectly. This is the Crysis of Race Games: untouchable. On the downside are the usual too easy and monotonous career mode and the high rate of course recycling (night/day, weather, backwards).<br>But all in all: the best race game since Dirt 2. If you&apos;re a NfS Driver or GT5 and annoyed, stick to the engine you know and don&apos;t come here flaming. It&apos;s in the end always a matter of taste and preference.

The cars have weight shift unlike dirt 2 where you just drift to the side.  The cars will react to different surface and weather types(in snow you have to step on it on turns or you&apos;ll just get stuck in the snow mid-turn).  The motion-blur is a nice add-in when driving fast, games just look goofy without it now, in my opinion. The new modes are a hoot.  Gymkhana takes a ton of practice and getting used to, WITHOUT the assists, obviously.  Transporter, also capture the flag, is a blast in the whole DC compound.  Cat n Mouse is where up to 8 people, and depending on teams(lets say 4v4), you&apos;ll have 2 mini coopers, and 6 Audi quatro&apos;s or high bhp cars to try and spin out the enemies&apos;, or protect your mini cooper all the way to the finish line of a long trailblazer course.  I won&apos;t get into the other modes now because they are self explanatory, but this game is a definite buy for PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1640577">Expand</a></span>

If you think driving various vehicles that feel as if they have bald tires, no grip, no traction, and driving on ice is fun then this game is definitely for you. There is no road feel or grip to the road at all. Well, maybe a smidgen. There were a couple of tracks that I started to get the hang of, a little, and then tried the off road trucks in Aspen, well, that was a total joke, zero traction or control. Then I tried the trucks again but in &quot;Smelter&quot; (I think its called) thinking to get off the ice and snow and onto dirt and the exact same loss of control was still evident. I&apos;ve raced motorcycles off road for many years and this game makes me think that it&apos;s designers have no clue as to what traction is. They designed the game so that you must get used to the squirlly feel and somehow master that in order to simply drive the vehicle where you want. Get used to a long learning curve...me, I say forget it, the game sucks and isn&apos;t worth my valuable time to figure out the stupid ass driving dynamics. Last Dirt or Codemasters game I&apos;ll ever buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3461606">Expand</a></span>

PROS - The physics feel great, although it&apos;s probably a bit easier then DiRT 2. But I really think that it feels very realistic and I personally like it better then DiRT 2. - Singleplayer is awesome and you have a lot of nice cars and different game types - Multiplayer is also awesome as far as I can tell for now. They even have some kind of ranking system, but I didn&apos;t play that much online so far. - Menu is easier and more practical then in DiRT2 - IT HAS SPLIT SCREEN! YAY! - Graphic looks pretty good, but I&apos;m not a specialist there - I like the sound too, but it has maybe not that many songs CONS - takes a bit long to load a map - windows live (it&apos;s not that bad, but well....it&apos;s windows live)  - no map editor so far? Cmon I need to tell something negative too I would give it a 9 because a 10 is impossible. But since some smartasses are giving disproportionate low ratings because they are buthurt, I give it a 10 :p</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1640835">Expand</a></span>

Dirt3 isn&apos;t dramatically better on either point but it is a step forward for both. If you enjoyed Dirt2 you should get your money&apos;s worth from Dirt3--though there do appear to be a few who manage to disagree.<br><br>Graphics--the Good: It&apos;s the Dirt2 engine with environmental effects on top. There&apos;s a bit of polish all around--the cars look appreciably nicer, and the water is better--but nothing dramatic. Kudos to Codemasters on optimizations though--while everything looks nicer, I get the same frame rate I did in Dirt2.<br>--The Bad: The overall color palette and set pieces are more subdued--compared to Shibuya or London in Dirt2, Finland&apos;s forests look bland and repetitive. Given that there are fewer locations there&apos;s less variety in the atmosphere that the added environmental effects don&apos;t entirely make up for--they lost a bit of the spice from the previous game.<br><br>Content--the Good: All the racing types from Dirt2 are here, though Rally and Gymkhana have a bit more prominence than the other modes. Between driving in rain/snow having more cars to choose there&apos;s a goodly bit more variety in driving conditions.<br>--the Bad: sure there&apos;s more spice in the driving options, but less areas to drive in.I don&apos;t mean the tracks--there&apos;s definitely more road to drive on--but they&apos;ve been crammed into fewer locations. The menu navigation isn&apos;t nearly as neat as the trailer from Dirt2 but that&apos;s not a dealbreaker. Gameplay--the Good: with the difficulty set to advanced, the handling is almost identical to Dirt2. The myriad of driver assists they added made this game way more accessible--for kicks I had my grandpa play it on casual, and to my surprise he enjoyed it. The new weather conditions are a blast to drive in. Gymkhana plays out like Tony Hawk with cars and is a fun addition to the franchise. The flashback system no longer has a delay when activated which makes it much more fluid to use.<br>--the Bad: I&apos;m struggling to think of things they&apos;ve made worse. Load times are as frequent and as long as in Dirt2--anyone making claims to the contrary has their rose-colored glasses on. Difficulty occasionally too random--I&apos;ve seen the fastest CPU time fluctuate as much as 7s between playthroughs of the same track. If you&apos;re getting this expecting a simulation you might be disappointed, but as a fan of the Dirt series they&apos;ve raised the bar in nearly every category.<br><br>Dirt3 isn&apos;t a big upgrade, but they took kept the fun from the previous game and added some new modes, content, and weather twists. It doesn&apos;t have the wow factor for a perfect 10, but it&apos;s certainly got enough improvements to be worth my money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1642156">Expand</a></span>

Dirt 3&apos;s visuals are a step above its predecessor and its physics are also a great improvement. I played this game with a Logitech Drive Force GT with 540 degrees of rotation. Though the game just game out, it runs great and is very stable. There are still plenty of annoying bugs which Codemasters will probably address (though they usually stop fixing things after a while like F1 2010&apos;s 7 month old pit issues). I do not like the new menu styling. The old walking around menus like that of Dirt 2 and F1 2010 were far more immersive. There is also less interaction between you and your AI couterparts apart from your boring teammates. It was fun talking to real American rally drivers in Dirt 2, but in Dirt 3, you really only talk to Ken Block (haters gonna hate).<br><br>Criticisms aside, Dirt 3 is a step in the right direction. The tracks are not real ones, but Codemasters did a great job with the custom tracks they did make. Although, the tracks are quite wide which may be great for less skilled players, but hardcore WRC sim fans want slimmer and longer tracks (longer tracks run around 3:00). The physics are much better than Dirt 2. You can actually spin out and lock your brakes. However, it seems like the cars brake and grip the road too much compared to their realistic counterparts.<br><br>Verdict: You liked Dirt 2, get Dirt 3. If you like rally, get Dirt 3. Do not expect it to be a sim, but it does have great physics and a lot of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1645797">Expand</a></span>

I agree with most of the other reviewers that it&apos;s a little easy; turning everything but ABS off and setting opponent skill to 5/6 still enables me to win most races without much of a fight, but it&apos;s still a fun game. The physics make handling a little twitchier than DiRT 2, but for an &apos;arcade&apos; game they&apos;re very well rounded, unlike those in the aforementioned Shift 2 which are appalling (if you want &apos;simulation&apos;, go play Gran Turismo 5, not Shift 2). The one thing i don&apos;t understand is why they&apos;ve narrowed down the locales so much. I really miss the old, true rally games that had events in around ten different countries. The main thing that impresses me about this game is how well optimised it is; i get a steady 40~50fps at 1080p, max settings, max AA + supersampling on my Q6600 and GTX260 which are getting a little long in the tooth by all accounts. Whilst it&apos;s not running in DX11 mode, it gives you an idea of how well new cards will breeze through this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1640840">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are incredible, even though I play the game on a 800x600 resolution. Gameplay, top class, very highly engaging, although I do find car control tricky at best at some moments. Despite this, i find so much fun in hurtling down narrow passes and drifting round tight bends. An excellent game and well worth the time and money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1651615">Expand</a></span>

Major glitches that frequently cause the program to stop responding, and even more frequently stops interfacing correctly with my Logitech G27.  Furthermore, it doesn&apos;t save my control configuration, so every time I launch the program I have to select the G27 as my controller.  It seems that the stability of every codemasters release is worse than the last, while the graphics are slightly better.  I said I would stop purchasing codemasters games after losing 20+ hours of my time after a Dirt 2 save file corruption, and then another 20+ hours after an F1 2010 save corruption.  I&apos;ve had it up to here, and will no longer be supporting this crap-fest company that doesn&apos;t know how to do their job.  Just another milked franchise by a sold-out development team.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1681782">Expand</a></span>

Dirt 3 gave me a lot in the matter of car racing. 1) Rallies which are awesome and there is much more emphasis on them in this part. Off course, some of them are short, but that just encourages me to make videos from them and brag. Graphics - outstanding! This is the best looking PC racing game in the matter of environment effects and lightning. Some people say that graphics are not that good - well, I play this game at 1920x1080, DX 11, 8xCSAA, everything set to ultra or high (if it can&apos;t be set to ultra) -&gt; game looks purely great. Handling: set your wheel how it should be set! Not  only in game, but in profiler too. I did that and now it is much more realistic than Dirt 1/Dirt 2, You just have to know what You&apos;re doing with your hardware. Forget about pads and keyboards if You expect realism - don&apos;t be a hypocrite!  Sounds of the engines could be a bit better,  but for me that&apos;s the only flaw of the game. The variety of cars, tracks and locations is just about right for having months of fun. You can&apos;t tweak your car too much (there are only five settings) but they have huge impact on how the car is driven (that&apos;s the second thing people who demand realism should set right, you won&apos;t get a proper handling out of the box and that&apos;s actually good, cause it forces you to tweak). All in all this game is really amazing, I had no problems installing it, I don&apos;t see any bugs, I have 45 (constant and stable!) FPS when playing on settings which I already mentioned and value which is comfortable to play here is around 33-35 FPS. All of this make this game best optimized game ever plus a great and beautiful racer for all WRC fans, but also for people who love too see crazy drifting and barrell jumps. Everyone can find something for themselves here - I did too. You just have to keep looking and know how to set certain things. 9,5 out of 10 with hopes for 10/10 after some sound mod is made :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1645980">Expand</a></span>

First of</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I love cars and racing games. The Colin McRae series of games were a long standing franchise that went from strength to strength. Codemasters did not kill off the rally game entirely when Colin McRae passed away, and now the game is focused towards the Gymkhana legend Ken Block.<br><br>Now in its 3Rd instalment, I&apos;m happy to report that Dirt3 is now my favourite rally game of all time.<br><br>First of all, let me tell you about the graphics. I&apos;ve played the PC version of the game, and I have to stay that its absolutely stunning. Whilst it isn&apos;t exactly a step up from Dirt 2 in this department, its not exactly ugly either. The game has beautiful lighting, the cars are well modelled and very good textures throughout. Just to show the attention to detail, on the Battersea DC Compound, even the buildings surround it are accurate to its real life counterpart. Only on rare circumstance did I notice a couple of poor textures here and there but unless you are standing still next to it, you won&apos;t notice.<br><br>Sound is very good too. Engine sounds are varied and there is a wide variety of music on the soundtrack. The guy and girl that help you throughout the tour can get a bit annoying at times but the positives outweigh the negatives.<br><br>Game play wise there isn&apos;t much to complain about. There&apos;s a wider choice of events than ever and a wide variety of vehicles to drive. Everything from a 60&apos;s Mini Cooper to an insane Pikes Peak car and pretty much everything in between. The handling is decidedly arcade for what the developers claim to be finely tuned by Mr Ken from the Block himself, but heck at least the cars don&apos;t handle terribly. If you are after a simulation rally game, this isn&apos;t for you and you should stick to Richard Burns Rally for that.<br><br>I am happy to report that I&apos;ve played this game several times, sometimes up to 3 hours at a time and it hasn&apos;t crashed once. This is in Direct X11 mode, not using the Rapture3D audio and using the Steam version of the game. It also runs consistently above 60 frames per second and this is with all settings on their highest. So far theres little reason to buy the DLC unless you love your cars. Often the cars available for DLC aren&apos;t the best ones to race with.<br><br>I haven&apos;t played any on-line features yet so I cannot tell you from my own experience what its like. However this game offers the usual race modes as well as game modes associated with First Person Shooters such as Capture the Flag and Infection.<br><br>Hope you&apos;ve enjoyed this review and I give this a 9 out of 10.<br><br>Postives:    Less use of the &apos;X&apos; Games    Career mode is at least half rally based    Good graphics, Good sound<br><br>Negatives:    Handling is not for people who like simulators    Graphics are pretty but not a step up from Dirt 2    The guy and girl that talk in career can get quite annoying<br><br>Test system:<br>Intel Core i5 2500k 4.0ghz, 8GB DDR3 1600 MHz, Nvidia Geforce GTX 470, Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1680824">Expand</a></span>

But there&apos;s nothing as annoying as Ken Block&apos;s voice.<br><br>The game modes look fine to me, a nice great number of cars and tracks. Rally, rallycross, trailblazer and raid, they all play nice and easy.  Gymkhana feels too arcade-ish, though.<br><br>Luckily, the hipster soundtrack from DiRT 2 was replaced by a more mild electronic track list mixed with a nice compromise of the former sort of music.

Overall I&apos;m glad they somewhat got away from the Ken Block style gimmick make up in Dirt 2. This feels more like a grown up racing game again, not like some 12 year old&apos;s kiddy game. The graphics are simply stunning, making Dirt 3 what might be the best looking racing game of all time. The controls are fine on keyboards and gamepads and allow for a wide range of difficulties by disabling driving aids. The car line up is just brilliant and I don&apos;t know what else I&apos;d add. The tracks are super pretty and super fun to drive. The thrown in Gymkhana games are a real hassle though and just feel completely out of place. The career in general is okay, might become a bit boring at some point though (but what racing game career doesn&apos;t?). Multiplayer wasn&apos;t played yet, the infection and capture the flag modes sound like proper fun though. All in all a really solid game and experience, and probably the best of racing games this year. Great variety of cars, tracks and modes. Handling feels good. The Dirt series still needs to find its identity (again) though. This mix of old school Group B rallying and gimmicky new age Ken Block style drifting stuff don&apos;t go well together, and this is kind of a bummer regarding the atmosphere. One point off for that, and one point off for those animated menus (why not simply some good old static ones instead of drifting cars and rotating pyramids?) and unskippable instructional videos.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1682518">Expand</a></span>

Again, there are too few cars compared to old Colin Mcrae Rally games - few classics and that`s that. Graphics are very good (DIRT2 has it better, seriously), sound is okay (nothing special) , the driving gives some serious satisfaction. The Gymkhana events are surely the core of this game as they are great fun. The others - trailblazer and rally events are far worse than in DIRT2. Shorter, modest tracks with little variety. The Dirt Tour mode is also fun but not as much as online driving which is very addicting.   Something I always praise about the Codies is that their games are 99% bugfree and can run with good graphics on a friggin old hardware. This game should be recognised not as what the devs presented it to be (real rally game) but as a fun title to play when you don`t really have much time for gaming in general.<br>Solid and worth the price, but a backstep to the Dirt2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1693715">Expand</a></span>

Rallycross is pretty much fine, but again codemasters lack of tracks for most of the event types (and using way too many trimmed and mirrored routes) is dissapointing. To throw fuel on the fire, it&apos;s quite cheeky to release half a game then have to double the price of the purchase to get all the DLCs to make for a fully game, so depite loving this game there no way I&apos;d give it top scores unless you find it acceptable to fork out &#xC2;&#xA3;20 on DLCs less than a month or so after release</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1710420">Expand</a></span>

I love all the locations and the numerous cars available, although I wish there was more of both. Overall, the game has stunning, optimized PC performance, meaning that it runs smooth as butter, and it looks great. There are A LOT of races in the Dirt Tour series, and some of the events get tiring, as you strive to repeat them over and over again, to get the highest finish or to complete the bonus objectives, for more driver rep points. I play it on a keyboard though, and although it&apos;s very drivable, a wheel would offer a great advantage in precision and game immersion. The events are fun, and I like all the extra goals and quirks that the developers added, as well as what they left out, from Dirt 2. Everything is more streamlined and more pretty, while still keeping the great rally car racing genre intact. I&apos;d say this arcade-like racing game trumps all others in shear fun and playability. If you&apos;re looking for a driving sim, look elsewhere, get Di3ty !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1716304">Expand</a></span>

But Regardless, I&apos;ve really enjoyed the experiences I&apos;ve had with this game, the new game modes added are a lot of fun, particularly the head to head races, and even the standard rally phases are a blast. The visuals of this game are also fantastic when ran at maximum which gives a super sharp picture. However the only problem with the PC version is the awkwardness of the keyboard controlls, but luckily I have a game pad which does the trick. Another downside to this game is the mass amounts of paid DLC required to unlock cars and rally stages which I feel should have been included into the game in the first place.<br><br>Overall, A good game with nice visuals.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2450404">Expand</a></span>

The car models look great, and my favorite: The landscape is gorgeous. The damage engine works fine, it just doesn&apos;t go &quot;Deep&quot; with damage. The physics are pretty close to realistic. It&apos;s pretty fun. The tracks feel a little dull, too much dark color and there isn&apos;t many variety of colors. The sound is very good, the engines sound realistic, you hear the crowd, you hear the tires, you basicly hear everything that is going on. The Dirt Tour was great, but although a tiny bit short but wasn&apos;t bad. If you finish the Dirt Tour, you can all ways play the multiplayer which will take a long time to reach max level. Another bad thing is the tracks are very short. 1-3 minutes for every track, there is only one that is 4 minutes. Some textures, especially the engine and inside car parts are a bit blurry. The rest of the textures are very clear and look nice. Another thing about the damage engine, you can pop your tires, and the engine can take damage and start smoking, which slows down your acceleration and top speed. There are over 50 cars and each car has a few designs. Although landrush is only 2 vehicles, buggy and truck. There is a variety of things to do in Dirt 3, Rallycross, Rally, Trailblazer, landrush, etc. You can drive classic cars all the way to new cars and trucks and raid vehicles. One of my favorites things about this game is watching the car build up mud, dirt, and snow. The interior of the cars is beautiful. The rain (Especially the interior) is very pretty and looks realistic. There is also a variety of weather options. In night your car has lights and it looks really cool. Overall I give the game a 8/10. A few cons and a lot of pros. Not perfect, but decent. If you like racing, and offroad, give it a try. If you have a friend, splitscreen will be very fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2544395">Expand</a></span>

<br>My vote is the average between the game itself (a solid 9), the graphics engine (a perfect 10) and the &quot;let&apos;s try to be appealing to the 13 years old boys&quot; containers and menus (barely a 4).</span>

It&apos;s a bit over-advertised (Monster energy and stuff). I think it should be more rally than rallycross and landrush things. I think it&apos;s the best racing simulation so far. Who said that this is a Colin McRae game? It isn&apos;t in the name. Waiting for DiRT 4!</span>

<br>The problems start with a menu system that I can only describe as baffling, like they gave it to the intern and he got his degree at a trust fund art college.  It&apos;s a series of unfolding triangles that give you zero sense of your overall progress. Are you improving?  Moving up the rankings?  Who knows.  Cause if it&apos;s one thing we race game fans like it&apos;s to have absolutely zero sense of our progress.
<br>
<br>Next you get to see their DLC advertised obnoxiously throughout the game.  It&apos;s a constant reminder that while you paid full price for the game, they lazily threw in a few extra cars and other dumb stuff that took them 15 minutes to program while they licked In-n-Out grease off their chubby fingers.
<br>
<br>But the biggest sin of Dirt 3 is the driving just isn&apos;t much fun or satisfying.  Dirt 2 and Grid really nailed the driving, and at the end of the day that&apos;s all that matters.  Dirt 3 is either condescendingly easy with all the driver assists turned on, or a sloppy ice rink mess when they&apos;re not.  There are literally times on certain tracks when the car becomes uncontrollable for no reason, usually in the form of your breaks having no effect (but in other parts of the track it&apos;s like the calipers are stuck closed).  So you end up strategically &quot;sneaking up&quot; on these sections of track, breaking way ahead of when you should need to, just so the game won&apos;t send you flying through the air like a rag doll.
<br>
<br>The drifting, in particular, is terrible.  No combos or flags like in Grid.  If you like to do handbrake turns, look elsewhere.  They put you sideways every time and control is basically non-existent until you finally come to a stop.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: Frustrating, unsatisfying game play is enough not to recommend Dirt 3.  But add on the terrible interface and DLC and you might have enough reason to think twice about Dirt 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4060824">Expand</a></span>

Other than that the graphics on maxed out settings look GREAT, the single player campaign (Tour) could be better if Ken Block&apos;s stunts&amp;gimmicks would take a hike once in a while and the multiplayer modes are quite challenging and fun, especially if you have some friends to join in the race. Too bad though some maps could use some patching and the game is generally not yet 100% bug free. Audio and soundtrack is not bad, unfortunately the soundtrack is forced off during gameplay, so no music while you&apos;re racing!...why so serious Codemasters? Why not let me decide? I paid the damn thing didn&apos;t I? :/  To be short the looks are gorgeous but the substance is IMHO shamefully lacking...and if this comes from a newbie (in this genre) like myself, than some of you rally fans out there might just get seriously offended trying to play Dirt 3. #valid8#</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2790312">Expand</a></span>

But it&apos;s a small step back for how fun this game is. Yes, there isn&apos;t a lot of traction and more often than not you&apos;ll slide off the track and crash into a tree.

Overall, nice graphics, cool cars, and addicting challenges all over. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3600879">Expand</a></span>

This game also does multiplayer very well! Split screen so fun, and doing a joyride with a friend is unimaginably fun! The only flaw I found that this game is that once the dirt tour is over, there&apos;s really not that much fun in playing anymore.</span>

In particular it is characterized by bad design, annoying voice acting, repetitive sounds from the engine. At least the 3D engine is slick, and the graphics are nice (not good but nice). Gameplay could be on the nice side but it&apos;s ruined by the bad design and too simple physics.</span>

Considering it came out 5 years ago, it really holds up, the graphics are clean, the controlls are nice and snappy. Never did work with my wheel all that well, but, my wheel is a piece of crap so, not gonna judge it on that account, great game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=6133606">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m not sure about you, but when I buy a game it&apos;s to play it, not to look at it. But hey, maybe that&apos;s just me, I mean, there are a surprisingly high number of users around here who enjoy &apos;walking simulators&apos;. Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that.
<br>
<br>Other than the painfully long wait times though, this game isn&apos;t that bad. The graphics are nice, the controls are nice, and the soundtrack is also nice. Too bad it&apos;s not nice enough to justify all the waiting. The waiting is not nice at all. And what&apos;s with the short races? If you&apos;re going to make me do all of that waiting, then at least reward me with a race that lasts longer than two minutes. But nope, let&apos;s go back to that awesome menu there and check out some car stats or something. Not nice. Pretty darn not nice, actually.
<br>
<br>I know a lot of people enjoy this game, and that&apos;s cool I guess, but honestly it&apos;s a pretty big steamer. I&apos;d steer clear from this one and maybe get something that is a little less terrible. Possibly a racing game with a little more racing and a little less waiting. As I stated earlier the waiting is the part I really did not enjoy about this game. Also you cannot save your game. But honestly, who really cares.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4920752">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I LOVE the car selection. I am a huge fan of vintage rally cars, and there are a lot of great ones here from Lancia, Opel, Ford, Audi, and more.

I like the tracks. They look nice and the designs have enough variety to keep me interested.

I like the variety of race types.

Visually, it is still really nice even now 5 years later.

<br>I think it&apos;s cool that the narrators use my actual name. Neat little touch.
<br>
<br>The biggest problem I have with Dirt 3 though, is Gymkhana. I **** DESPISE the Gymkhana levels. I hate them. They do not work well in this game, but being the completionist I am I can&apos;t resist the urge of playing them over and over and over trying to get all the medals. These things are SO frustrating.
<br>
<br>Other than that, it&apos;s a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=6432539">Expand</a></span>
