Sadly our game industry has fell to where everyone gets instant gratification. Jump in and disregard the learning curve, and trust me it took 5 hours to get this game down and im still getting the hang of it. Once you get past the clunky sword system its actually alot of fun. In my opinion the sword system forces the user to think and position oneself alot more than games such as chivalry and there is a good amount of strategy when engaging in a sword fight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-vikings/user-reviews?user_review_id=4182495">Expand</a></span>

It had a suboptimal start with some bugs and netcode-issues, but in it&apos;s current state it&apos;s an amazing game. I&apos;m a dedicated gamer with over 300 games on my account, I&apos;m gaming excessively for 25 years now and I would go as far to say that this is the best multiplayer-game I ever played. The graphics are the most beautiful I&apos;ve ever seen in a game, a true piece of art. Actually the game in motion looks much better than the screenshots. The maps are extremly well designed and detailed, setting a new standard. You can literally see the great amounts of love that the devs put into them. Also sounds and music add nicely to the atmosphere and complete the great presentation. The gameplay itself is simple in it&apos;s elements but is in result very deep and skill-based. Easy to understand, but hard to master, like it ideally should be. The combat is fast, tactical, uncomplicated and satisfying. All upgrades you can unlock are purely for prestige and visuals, which is great since it doesn&apos;t create disadvantages for new players while it&apos;s still rewarding. Only drawback of this game is the small community, which makes it difficult to find other players early in the morning and in the middle of the night, but it doesn&apos;t bother at the rest of the day. Another little issue might be the beserker-class, which rewards spamming a bit too much. The game would be better without them but I don&apos;t see it as a serious issue since berserkers have very limited potential. In conclusion I got to say it makes me really sad to see that such a beautiful game doesn&apos;t get the attention it deserves, while millions of people pay 60 bucks for CoD every year. Makes me honestly question the future of gaming, it&apos;s industry and it&apos;s consumers. I guess the low success is a combination of bad marketing and the fact that most players today get frustrated by a game which requires a few hours to develop decent skills in, compared to CoD where you just need to know how to pull a trigger. And surely this game had a tough start, but every major multiplayer-game has these days. In this case community and publisher/devs were sadly very impatient, which is disappointing. But even more I&apos;m disappointed by the market (respectively consumers), since it apparently doesn&apos;t reward an elaborated, ambitious, well-designed game which hasn&apos;t an advertising-budget of billions and in which you will get killed many times in the beginning since it&apos;s really skill-based and requires some learning.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-vikings/user-reviews?user_review_id=4709679">Expand</a></span>

<br>Many of the reviews here talk about ridiculous ping issues and server crash issues. Indeed, that was the case earlier in Early Access, but more recent updates make server crashes a thing of the past. As for ping, that is solely due to the server location and your distance from it, it is nothing to do with the game engine (eg: if you are in the US and play on a EU server you will inevitably have high ping).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-vikings/user-reviews?user_review_id=4095698">Expand</a></span>

It is a great continuation of the &quot;War of&quot; series.  Well designed combat system that is vastly improved over War of the Roses.  Developers are great at working with the players to ensure a quality game.  In the Alpha release the game feels whole.  There are a few issues with netcode but the developers have made this a top priority to be completed for the Beta.  Considering the game is still in early access and the developers have addressed any issues the full release of the game looks to be the best in its genre.  The combat system is a bit hard to learn at first and has a fairly steep learning curve, in order to address this issue the game has created special moves for melee weapons that make it easier for the newer players in the game.  The beta is due to release soon with tons more extra content. If one is familiar with War of the Roses new features include (but are not limited to): Stamina, throwing weapons, doge abilities, sprinting, special moves, battle chatter, and 3 character class types (each with different armour).  Highly recommend the purchase of this game, the only real problem is trying to stop playing the game is so good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-vikings/user-reviews?user_review_id=3834121">Expand</a></span>

I have now played the beta for 3+ months and all the issues mentioned in the negative reviews have been fixed and the game is so much fun. Think CoD with a ton of customization gone viking raiding era. Fast paced, highly skill based, hard learning curve first hour but once you get the hang of it after that, you&apos;re an addict. So stay away if you don&apos;t wanna get addicted :)
<br>
<br>Corrections to previous reviewers, there is NO pay to win in this game as someone states, all customization is purely cosmetic and all weapons have the same &quot;stats&apos;. Also having played war of the roses and war of the vikings both with 200+hours each, war of the vikings is very fast paced in comparison and not slower.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-vikings/user-reviews?user_review_id=4010339">Expand</a></span>

The problem is aiming feels really slow and attacking has a bit of a strange feel to it which makes it really hard to aim or block  and you can almost never run away from an enemy because they will just trip you, and when you are on the ground, they will decapitate you. Yes, this game is in beta but I am sure they will not change the core elements of movement and combat. Though if you really enjoyed War of the Roses and if you are looking for a new game to play with similar mechanics, I would suggest to get this game or at least try it (If it ever comes on free weekend for steam again).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-vikings/user-reviews?user_review_id=3849706">Expand</a></span>

After spending a good amount of time with the alpha and some of the beta, I can tell you that this game is absolutely abysmal. This game relies on good mechanics and gameplay to make it what it is and yet almost every aspect is broken, makes no sense or just generally doesn&apos;t work or is very bad. It&apos;s hard to put into words how bad this game is and why because there are just so many reasons. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

Netcode still sucks ass, the game is laggy and freezes randomly from time to time. Do yourself a favour and watch Total Biscuits video on this game.</span>

Very slow to attack, dodge, etc. Awkward controls with having to press left mouse button and a direction for the mouse at the same time, which sends your view all over the place. Looks nice though. If only it had enough players in Australia to make it worthwhile. Maybe come back in a year after official release.</span>

<br>AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS.
<br>$20 is a complete rip off for this game. It is the exact same cloned game of their previous but with vikings in the title and slightly different combat animations.
<br>
<br>LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER GAME (war of the roses)
<br>It was all fine and dandy at the start (if you neglect all the many glitches bugs and issues with servers) but soon after, there were ridiculously pricey weapon packs and the game turned into &quot;spend money to be the best&quot;. War of the roses died when this company neglected it and started with their new project (war of the vikings). You can download a free copy of war of the roses and see for yourself!
<br>
<br>This game will follow the same fate as war of the roses. The company who developed this game is &quot;fatshark&quot;.......rofl how ironic?!
<br>
<br>Save your money and look elsewhere!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-vikings/user-reviews?user_review_id=3855689">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The key to this game is to parry effectively, to be able to mislead the opponent  when attacking and to move wisely.
<br>This game is all about &quot;reading&quot; the opponent. Each player has favorite movements, most of the times he will attack and defend following a pattern (or a combination of favorite patterns) , that&apos;s a weakness that can be exploited, all you have to do is to remember and anticipate those patterns, so you can counter them. Your shield is only good at blocking projectiles, in combat you&apos;ll need to use your weapon in order to parry. Shields are nearly useless in hand to hand combat, don&apos;t rely on them because they don&apos;t block sword and axe blows most of the times.
<br>
<br>To become a good WOTV player, you&apos;ll need to translate your ideas into movements flawlessly and instantly. You&apos;ll notice that movements in this game are triggered differently from most other games, since you have to click first and then move your mouse towards the desired direction. This can easily become a problem. It&apos;s very easy to move your mouse a little bit to the left or to the right when trying to move it up, or when trying to move it towards any other direction...this usually means death in War of the Vikings, so it&apos;s very important to be precise with your mouse movements.
<br>
<br>You&apos;ll also need to make sure that your internet connection is working at maximum performance (fast connections are recommended). Your distance from the servers is also important, the farther you are from the server, the worse. I recommend to use FRAPS in order to monitor in-game fps,  if your fps drop under certain conditions (too many players around), lower your video settings and resolution and turn off vertical sync (in my case, vertical sync caused important fps drops under certain conditions, so I turned it off...fps have never dropped since).
<br>
<br>Now let&apos;s talk about what&apos;s good in War of the Vikings.
<br>
<br>Do you like the idea of enemy squad members running away from you after you&apos;ve cut down all their mates? Do you like the idea of chopping heads off using massive two handed axes and other weapons?  Do you like the idea of coordinating with your team mates in order to kill enemy squads or to take control points? Do you like the idea of being able to customize your characters, their weapons, outfits, perks and shield paints? Do you like skill-based games where performance is everything?
<br>
<br>If you like those things, you&apos;ll probably like War of the Vikings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-of-the-vikings/user-reviews?user_review_id=4190297">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>+ : fast paced combat, more balanced than WOTR, Arena and Pitched Battle modes are awesome, graphics/sounds are great, a unique multiplayer combat experience. Lots of choices of class and interesting gameplays since v 1.2!
<br>
<br>- : some stabilities/optimisations issues, can be hard for newcommers, hitboxes sometimes feel weird.</span>
