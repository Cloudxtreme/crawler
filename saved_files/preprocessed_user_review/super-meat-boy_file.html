As you can immediately notice, the user scores are quite polarized, and I believe this is true to the nature of the game. If you find joy in surmounting difficult (But FAIR) platforming challenges, this game is the PERFECT game for you. Let me also state that the 10 I assigned this game was not some knee-jerk reaction to a merely clever indie game. This game is fantastic by ANY standard, it is perfectly executed. There is nothing in the game where I have ever said, man, I wish X existed. In a time where games like Fallout New Vegas and Civ 5 release with the swath of glitches and bugs in the game, it is refreshing to have a game ship out that is immensely bug free, it is absolutely precise. You may even grow to treat this precision as a foe, as there is a razor thin edge between success and death in each level, there is no &quot;give&quot;, if you touch a deadly obstacle with any part of your hit-box, you can count on dying. However, this consistency gives rise to the games greatest achievement, the overall fairness of the game. I am astounded that I read other user reviews that actually complained about the controls, they are absolutely astounding. To be fair, I do use a Xbox360 controller, I could see that without one it may take longer to &quot;pick up&quot; but the controls are nevertheless, precise. The character becomes an extension of your will, you&apos;ll find sometimes that when an unexpected hazard appears, you react quickly and ably within fractions of a second, as if you were acting out of instinct. I am also disturbed to read some people claiming that this game&apos;s difficulty is just a mechanism to lengthen the game. I find it hard to believe we even played the same game. The levels are difficult to be sure, but they are absolutely fair, if you die, it is your fault, there are no invisible traps, your character will not move if you don&apos;t tell him to. And even if you die, the levels each can be completed in under a minute, so if you do die (and you will die, often) almost no progress is lost. You will not be spending 5 minutes just to get a chance to practice the spot you died at last time. The other reason I find this explanation difficult to believe is that there are over 300 levels. The game is already massive, it wouldn&apos;t need to be lengthened by unnecessary difficulty.<br><br>In short: A difficult platformer, but an absolute masterpiece if you are willing to take up the challenge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1448841">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The real genius of the game is the steep learning curve but incredibly precise controls. Although many of the levels are, quite frankly, absurdly difficult, with practice it will become clear how to progress through the level. Muscle memory is king in this game. Meat Boy becomes your avatar in nearly every sense of the word; if you play long enough, it will get to the point where you know exactly how to maneuver Meat Boy through the mazes of buzzsaws, salt, needles, lasers, and any number of other environmental and sentient hazards.
<br>
<br>A word to the wise: if you are looking for a game that can be beaten easily and quickly, this game is not for you. If you are looking for one of the greatest platforming games ever, look no further.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3391077">Expand</a></span>

HUNDREDS of stages, challenges, and unlockable goodies.  Also, this game is hardcore.  This is a real treat when the general game holds your hand with garbage like a quest compass and regenerating HP... in Super Meat Boy, if you screw up, you die.  Usually instantly.  And it only gets harder.  The learning curve is also fantastically satisfying.  You will consistently get better from play.  When you are playing the first boss it WILL seem difficult.  After playing the next few levels if you go back you&apos;ll wonder what was so hard.  You will stand back and say, &quot;oh my god, I&apos;m DOING this.&quot;  The mechanics are very smooth, jumping, wall jumping, dashing, these are fun and for the most part the game seems very fair.  When you die you&apos;ll know YOU messed up and it wasn&apos;t just something stupid due to chance.  Point being, if you like video games, get this game.  Also, use a controller.  This game is a seven with a keyboard, a ten with a controller.

Despite the extreme difficulty though,  I loved every minute I spent playing this game. The levels are ingeniously detailed and varied, with many obstacles in your way such as spinning saws and bottomless pits. The levels are also very short, so when (not if) you die, you will not have to constantly repeat huge segments. The game&apos;s music is also incredible and really just makes you want to keep playing even if you&apos;ve died 50 times already on the level you&apos;re trying. This is a really great game that I can&apos;t recommend enough.

However, if you love the feeling of finally NAILING IT, the overwhelming sense of accomplishment that is the reason we play these games, then there is nothing better than Super Meat Boy.  You&apos;ll hate it most of the time, but when you love it you will LOVE IT!
<br>
<br>The art is very well done.  The characters are likable, the environments very interesting and the cut scenes are pretty funny.  The music is excellent, if I was the type to listen to game music around this would be on my phone.  What takes center stage is the control.  Meat Boy is an extension of yourself and will do exactly what you tell him to.  I can&apos;t rave about this enough.  When you&apos;re flying through the air you can feel it.  When you&apos;re sticking to a wall you can feel it.  It&apos;s a superb achievement by the developer(s).  There are also tons of levels, great variety in level design and mechanics, plenty of unlockables (including the unbelievably hard to get protagonist from I Want To Be The Guy, took me hours to get him), plenty of secrets... right now Steam says I have played 56 hours, pretty remarkable for a platformer.
<br>
<br>I thought about rating this a 9 for one simple reason - an extremely frustrating bug that would make certain game objects (like walls of buzz saws) move too fast to get some secrets.  I think it was a problem with the objects moving based on a fixed frame rate for the xbox that didn&apos;t translate correctly to PC.  I was able to work around it somehow - it was a while ago and I don&apos;t remember what I did - but it was EXTREMELY frustrating.  I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if this problem was patched by now though.
<br>
<br>Read my first paragraph again.  If it rings true for you then you already know you need this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=4429575">Expand</a></span>

I bought it for $3.75 on the Steam sale (what the hell right?) and have had so much fun with this game.  There are a few very unique innovations that make this game stick out.  First, the difficulty is there, it takes time to figure out some levels, and when you do, there&apos;s a sense of adrenaline and excitement...like, &quot;oh no, I&apos;m almost to the end of the level (AMAZINGLY!).  Once completed, the replay is spectacular, showing all the iterations of your attempts simultaneously.   The SFX and Music put many blockbuster games to shame.  I&apos;d buy the sound track if I could...and all the little meat splotch sounds are just hilariously satisfying.  I&apos;[d recommended this game to anyone.  For it&apos;s type of game (Indie, platform-spam-death thing) it deserves the highest marks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1458516">Expand</a></span>

Because the PC port feels horribly unpolished.
<br>
<br>An XBox 360 controller is (understandably) the recommended method of controlling Meat Buy.  But does a it work out the box?  No.  The buttons mapping is completely mangled with no way of reconfiguring in-game.  So fixing up the input config file I eventually got the stage controls to work but the menus are still buggered.
<br>
<br>Whatever, I can deal with that; except that there are parts of the menu that are unreachable with a mangle button setup.  Oops.  Fortunately having done a bit of game-dev  specifically controller input  I got the feeling that it was a Human Interface Device gone wrong.  Fine, found it and removed it from the Device manager and everything worked.
<br>
<br>I should be happy.  No, I&apos;ve spent my time fixing issues the developers should have dealt with.  Added to the controller woes: SMB does not start on some machines (screen remains black) and the graphics are messed up on others (mostly black textures) making it unplayable.
<br>
<br>A good concept? Yes.  A good implementation? No.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3016320">Expand</a></span>

Despite the classic, old-school look of the game, it&apos;s still very engaging and definitely an encore of videogaming&apos;s previous retro years. Yes, it&apos;s side-scroll, but don&apos;t think it&apos;s another Metal Slug or Sonic. It&apos;s tough. You&apos;ll be navigating you small meaty hero through complicated mazes, avoiding needles, buzz saws, flowing lava and even salt. But don&apos;t worry, the game has a smooth learning curve. Starting from the easiest to the most brain-heating levels, you&apos;ll find that the difficulty curve will increase gradually as you&apos;ll learn to time you jump or when to sprint. And if you think meat boy can never get through a particular maze, don&apos;t worry as there are other characters with special abilities to avoid traps (though it will be less challenging and hence, less satisfying). Still, if you find yourself deeply annoyed and frustrated by the hardness of the mazes, even after repeating the whole level for a hundred times, just stop playing and resume a few hours later, after you cool down. That way you can always figure out how to get through the puzzle. Having played in the PC, i see no trouble playing this. Just the basic arrow keys for movement, space for jump and shift for sprint. It&apos;s that simple! Though the downside of the game is when you want to reach the collectables: bandages. That&apos;s when your real platformer skills will be put to the test. Overall, a must have game for all casual gamer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1602291">Expand</a></span>

<br>It follows the path:The girl is kidnapped,you find her,the doctor sends a monster at you and run in a different location,it repeats over and over and the you beat the doctor and go away with the girl.
<br>The unlock able characters give the game diversity and makes it easier but still hard.
<br>The music in this game is gorgeous,the music you will like and will pump you with adrenaline.
<br>So this game is very good and it&apos;s not old school,because it&apos;s a funny and spontaneous game with a lot of references.
<br>So one of the best platforming games that ever existed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3669645">Expand</a></span>

Needless to say, I was disappointed after playing it after 90 minutes, but even that said and done, this is a very well-made game.
<br>
<br>Production values are excellent. The art style and sound design come together quite nicely. Music is, as expected from a gameplay-oriented platformer, acceptable. This game packs a whallop of a punch dollar-wise: What was it, 250+ levels? 20 or so characters? Specifics, I don&apos;t remember them. All I can attest to is that there was a LOT of content for 15$.
<br>
<br>Level design is as excellent as advertised. I found myself constantly marveling at strategic locations of sawblades, and after adjusting to dodge that particular sawblade, be killed by an equally deviously placed obstacle. The character-specific levels are also well-made to teach you the attributes of your new character.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, I found the controls wonky. Space to Jump and Shift to run? It only works in FPS. In a game that emphasizes twitch-response actions and complete control over your character, it&apos;s disappointing to have such an unusual control scheme. It&apos;s even WORSE that you can&apos;t customize it: I can&apos;t create my preferred setup. That, plus unchangeable wall-jump mechanics, made this game much less fun to enjoy.
<br>
<br>It also kept reminding me to buy an Xbox controller. If I wanted to use an Xbox controller, I&apos;d get it on Xbox Live, thank you. Maybe I wouldn&apos;t NEED to buy one if you let me change controls, eh?
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a solid game. If you can put up with the Shift-to-run-space-to-jump movement scheme, this is a definite must-buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1485124">Expand</a></span>

The game starts off in a pristine  forest filled with squirrels and other creatures. As the player progresses through the levels it is apparent that the game is a metaphor for our destruction of the world. Slowly the scenery begins to change into a dismal industrious world filled with pollution and destruction. As you progress further the increased difficulty is synonymous with difficulty needed to clean up our environment (the more we pollute the harder it will be to return to normal in the future). All in all it was a very educational experience which I recommend for all ages.

I didn&apos;t have a particular interest in it originally, but I do enjoy platformers, so I thought it would be worth a try. As my score makes readily apparent, I&apos;m infinitely glad that I decided to give it a go. I didn&apos;t really know what to expect from the game at first, but it far surpassed all my expectations!
<br>
<br>As many are quick to point out, the game gets pretty intensely difficult a couple of chapters in, but from my experience, it&apos;s never aggravating. I&apos;ve cried out at some deaths, but more at myself for failing than anything; I&apos;ve never found myself legitimately frustrated at the game itself. Even using the keyboard (although I&apos;d love to try playing with a gamepad), I found the controls to be incredibly precise and fine-tuned. I always feel in control, and it&apos;s extremely satisfying to make an intense dash through a hazardous level for a Grade A+ completion -- and then watching my many deaths before that victory in the replay! The level design itself is beyond stellar, and I never feel disappointed with a particular course. (There are definitely some that stand above the others, of course, usually due to their memorable layout, or a particularly hard-to-get bandage.) There are lots of extra characters, although I pretty much stick to Meat Boy, save for a few rare situations -- usually for bandages that I couldn&apos;t survive collecting otherwise. They&apos;re nevertheless enjoyable to unlock, and indeed, a very specific one gave me the most difficult challenge I&apos;ve faced in the game!
<br>
<br>The game has a very basic story, which contains some crude humor that might not amuse everyone, but I found it endearing for some reason. There&apos;s definitely no reason to rate it any lower for the simplicity of the plot, however; it does its job, and it will most likely give a few laughs if you enjoy any sort of slapstick shenanigans. The game&apos;s music is something I particularly favor -- it&apos;s very catchy, energizing, and always fitting. It never distracted me from the gameplay, and really pumped me up and kept me going even after some devastating losses on the most challenging levels.
<br>
<br>Overall, if you enjoy platforming, and are ready for a challenge, this game is for you. It won&apos;t disappoint.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=2550984">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are somewhat far beyond 1995 but the characters, gameplay, achievs and also the story are freaking fantastic.

Can&apos;t say it often enough.
<br>
<br>I used x360 controller from the beginning. As the effing thing went dead I had to play with keyboard for some days. Absolutely not playable. So be sure to have som Gamepad.
<br>
<br>I hope there will be other good plattformers coming in the future times. Until that I will continue trying to beat some of the finger-crippling hardmode levels that Super Meat Boy offers.
<br>
<br>Now get going and kick some Fetus-asses or play some more days in Sims3 or some sort of pony riding game :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=3996237">Expand</a></span>

I have, and growing up in the early 90&apos;s with popular consoles like the &apos;Super Nintendo&apos; and the &apos;Sega Genesis&apos; have given many platformers extremely nostalgic feelings for me. Then I got older and video games changed just as much as I did and when I came back to them many years later I found that they had turned into something that I didn&apos;t understand, appreciate, or recognize. Every game seemed to blend in with the ones around it, and I wasn&apos;t all that happy with the majority of games that I was playing. This is the game that changed that.
<br>
<br>&apos;Super Meat Boy&apos; is easily one of the best games that I have ever played and rivals some of the greatest platformers of all time like &apos;Mario Bros&apos;, &apos;Castlevania&apos;, &apos;Mega Man&apos;, and so on and so forth. This game put 2D platforming, along with indie gaming back on the map for many people because everything about it is simply amazing. From the soundtrack, to the controls, to the level design, to the insanity of it all; &apos;Super Meat Boy&apos; will keep you addicted until the very end. And just when you think you&apos;ve mastered it all, you discover there are even harder versions of each and every level that you&apos;ve already played. If you are at all into side-scrollers this is a must buy. Hell, this is a must buy even if you aren&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=5059846">Expand</a></span>

I haven&apos;t played such a thrilling and satisfying platformer since Super Mario Bros. 3, and I&apos;m beginning to think it may be my new all-time favorite game in the genre. Just be warned that this game is VERY difficult amongst platformers and it can be frustrating to people who are bad at video games. 90% of the negative reviews are &quot;this game is too hard it kicked my ass.&quot;<br><br>The controls are perfect; to put it simply: they put you exactly where you want to be. I went back to Super Mario and for the first time in my life I have to say the controls feel dated by comparison -- and I&apos;m a huge fan of classic Mario platformers. To add to the fantastic gameplay is the outstanding music, beautifully gritty environments, and a really solid &quot;arcade feel&quot; to the theme.<br><br>The only real downside to this game lies within it&apos;s virtually non-existent story, but then again if you&apos;re playing a platformer for the story, you&apos;re doing it wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1604446">Expand</a></span>

Definitely one of my all time favorite games! I recommend playing it with the xbox 360 controller for windows, keyboard controls are simply not precise enough for such a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=2301597">Expand</a></span>

As soon as you&apos;re trusted with the handling the game is as fun as hell. I couldn&apos;t stop playing it until I had this game on 100%. The playtime is more than enough even for the full price. After finishing all levels you can either create your own or play custom level from others. Can&apos;t give the full 10 points due to the achievements are pretty hard to get. Even after having this game on 100% I still don&apos;t have more then half of the achievements. All in all this game is perfect for people who either need a game that they can play in small gaming sessions or for people who simply like that kind of games</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=2529111">Expand</a></span>

As it gradually became more difficult, I challenged myself to do the best I could to become a platforming master. I loved the idea of being able to jump at precisely the right times and do godly runs through courses filled with obstacles waiting to splatter poor meat boy. But as the time I spent on the game increased, and my frustration mounted, I started to wonder whether it was worth it. Am I really enjoying myself by trying to create the perfect muscle memory to make it through a stage, only to be challenged by a more difficult stage that will require hundreds of deaths to pass through?
<br>
<br>It might have to do with the type of controller. I use a keyboard, and the game does tell you in the introduction screen that you should switch to using a gamepad as it is much easier and was designed for the game.
<br>
<br>But even if I did go out of my way to buy a gamepad specifically for this game (which should only detract from the score), I suspect that it wouldn&apos;t really quell my concerns in general. Platformers can be fun. But this platformer, as someone else put it, is for masochistic personalities.
<br>
<br>There are some courses where you literally require pixel perfect jumps, and with the inability to save during each course, that means you have to keep up that level of perfection throughout the course in several areas, making things tremendously difficult. Why subject myself to this? Is it really worth the hours, days of stress accumulated in trying to play like a computer? It depends on the player. If you&apos;re good at these sorts of games, perhaps you&apos;ll relish the challenge. For the vast majority of us, I suspect the answer is no.
<br>
<br>The story is fairly simple; while it will keep you interested just to see whether you can save your fair maiden, the sheer difficulty of the game will likely prevent one from every reaching the end, let alone the completion of the bonus levels.
<br>
<br>In the end I awarded this game a 6 just because it does provide some short-term entertainment for a few &quot;worlds&quot; (series of courses with themes). But in retrospect, I don&apos;t think its all that worth it unless you&apos;re really good at these sorts of games. Because most people will just end up being discouraged and stressed out, and I&apos;m pretty sure games were designed to be enjoyable.
<br>
<br>Also I bought this during a special sale on steam, when it was available for 2 dollars. So I may be biased in giving this game a higher score than it deserves, but all in all I think 6 is a decent score for this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1550194">Expand</a></span>

It is purely made for players who want to relive &quot;the good old days&quot; or for those who never truly lived them. The game goes extremely masochistic after few levels and at times I felt I was going to lose my mind just when I saw the next level. In a good way though. The music is very catching when you&apos;re escaping a boss from almost certain death. And those battles are probably the highlight of the game. The controls are great with both keyboard and Xbox 360 controller so you can easily swap between controller and keyboard. There are so few buttons to use so it stay simple. The story isn&apos;t complex either and the game don&apos;t need it. Meat Boy is lovable character and will be remembered in the future. The simplicity of the game is its key to success. This game is just classic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1468626">Expand</a></span>

<br>2.  Since when did a challenge become masochistic?  Yes it&apos;s hard, but it gets progressively harder.  If the latter levels weren&apos;t hard, then it wouldn&apos;t be much of a platformer now would it?
<br>
<br>I have completed the game to 100% and have to say that no other game in the past six or so years has given me such satisfaction upon completion.  The last levels are absolutely insane, and require literally perfect execution.  But if you die, it&apos;s your fault, never once could I blame the game.  If you want a walk in the park cinematic experience, this game isn&apos;t for you.  If you want a game that will have you jump up out of your chair and give a loud &quot;FUCCCCKKKK YESSSS!!!!!!&quot; that your neighbors three houses down can here, then this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=2806121">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;d say its a niche-market type of game, most definitely not meant for everyone, but immense adrenaline-fueled fun for those who&apos;re into that type of speed/twitch puzzle solving. I&apos;m using a brand new Gamepad for it and have noticed a few control responsiveness issues, but nothing major. Seems as though many, if not most, of the people giving the game very poor ratings are playing it with a keyboard, which is pretty bad idea in the first place. Upon first purchasing it, I tried it with the keyboard and knew instantly that I would never fully appreciate this game without a gamepad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1604032">Expand</a></span>

This is the perfect game in every aspect of the sense. The music, controls, timing, levels, bosses, and bonus content are sure to blow away any graphically enhanced POS that you could get for the same price. This game is the perfect example of what video gaming should be, and what advances to the industry it can bring, beautifully integrated into a retro style game. The challenges the player will face is a difficulty that brings back feelings not felt in decades, creating a unique and extremely difficult playing style that demands perfection (its mega man on crack with too many saws). My favorite quote &quot;A giant F*** You to the casual gamer&quot; Super Meat Boy will easily crack any gamer with weak will power, or skill. If your looking for a game to play occasionally your just bending over to team meat by buying this, but anyone who has skill, experience, and love for unique games, this is just perfect. Honestly if you don&apos;t like this game your not good at video games, and its obvious that one made to be hard and frustrating will send virgin gamers screaming, but experts clawing for more, even with keyboard controls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1582118">Expand</a></span>

Deaths come quick, and often, but just like VVVVVV, you&apos;re back into the action in seconds with minimal frustration. The PC version is the definitive copy of this game. Constant updates from the team, including a level editor, renders the 360 version kinda pointless. If that&apos;s your only option though, go for it!</span>

Before i even go into the fact that there are Thousands of levels available for play from users ( like you ) or the hundreds of masterfully crafted levels, the game-play is that of absolute triumph. The storyline alone was amazing from its simplicity and the tug you could feel while playing. I have played over hundreds of hours into SMB and even if it was starting to get boring the music would snap you right back into it. If there was to be a SMB sequel it would be terrifying... because there was absolutely NOTHING that made you feel still hanging by the end of the game. between the storyline with clever and hilarious cut-scenes, a level of difficulty only based on your skill, and a musical score that is beyond parallel there is nothing to even rival the mighty meat boy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1800028">Expand</a></span>

It starts off easy, but the later levels are insanely difficult, requiring you to complete multiple pixel perfect jumps etc. back to back to back.  The beauty is that there isn&apos;t a punishment on death, there&apos;s no waiting, you just get straight back into another attempt.  I&apos;ve sunk &gt;80hrs into this game and would heartily recommend it.</span>

You can&apos;t go wrong with this game, unless you really hate any sort of challenge and prefer those interactive story games this game is a must.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=2867018">Expand</a></span>

For all the hype I&apos;d heard about its controls, I found them to be nearly unusable (and by the way; insulting PC gamers who don&apos;t own a XBox 360 controller? real grown up, Team Meat), if there&apos;s the slightest clue that you might be near a wall, the game will interpret every action you take as something to do with wall jumping. The levels are also badly designed: the platforms are always the exact distance apart to make the timings of the dash and jump buttons incredibly fiddly, destroying any flow the level had, and the graphical design on the level  is just plain idiotic, as pretty much everything is the same colour on each stage, so the &quot;hectic pace&quot; is slowed down by you squinting at the screen to see if you&apos;re next to a crumbling block or a sawblade launcher</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=2861886">Expand</a></span>

It is based on quite a few facts: + The game is overall FUN to play; not feeling like grinding in WoW or over exaggerated Action in CoD. + Although the difficulty gets insanely high, these are the things that make it fun to play:  * The controls are absolutely tight, meaning the levels don&apos;t feel like a stab in the dark or brute-forcing as the player is absolutely in control instead of autoaim or wonky motion controls or quick-time-events.  * The learning curve is very well done, constantly making 1 level harder than the previous.  * The challenges are widely varied, there is none of the typical &quot;spawning twice as much enemies in the room&quot;  * The extreme difficulty does not feel like a punishment, more constant test of skill and in every normal level there is a infinite instant respawn anyway.  * To get to the end it is not neccesary to compete every level consecutively, and 3/20 levels do not have to be completed in order to challange each chapter boss.  * The extra characters bring a freshness and can potentially help you on the level you are stuck on. +  It is multiplatform, available on every current platform except PS3 and mac at the time of writing. + It brings new elements to the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; platforming genre. + The art style design and setting/story is very innovative and often sarcastically hilarious. + The music is very fitting and well made. + It has HEAPS of different levels and with 30+ hours of game time i have yet to beat them all. + The price is at $15 US very very good, and it was $3.75 US when i bought it. + If you buy it you are supporting the indie game market which is a very good thing in my opinion.<br><br>To conclude: It is a must-buy for anyone who can handle a fresh, challenging game.<br><br>Note: I&apos;m basing my review on the PC version of Super Meat Boy. I have played mostly PC/PS3 games from varied genres.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1470747">Expand</a></span>

Team Meat (devs of the game) show us that they have a good sense of humor (some cut scenes are just hilarious), but most importantly they show us how 2D platformers should be made. They should made DIFFICULT! And I really mean difficult. Some levels take up to a couple hundred tries to complete. Some people whine about difficulty level being too high, but I say if you don&apos;t like difficulties don&apos;t buy this game. SMB is just an ultimate challenge that you can take only if you are patient and skilled enough. Overall it&apos;s a great game that REALLY challenges you. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1564705">Expand</a></span>

I seriously had to practice level that can be completed in around 7 seconds for 20 - 30 minutes simply to beat it, even longer if i wanted to attain a high score (which i would recommend against trying to achieve as hackers and cheaters have ruined the leader boards for us all with times impossible to achieve such as 0).  Super meat boy isn&apos;t just about jumping through saw blades of death to rescue his beloved partner, it&apos;s also somewhat of a self teaching lesson about what the average human will put himself through just to reach the end of the game, much like our brutalized hero, spending hours upon hours just repititously playing a level over and over again, death after death until we beat it.  Luckily there is another little shining star in this, as you can unlock characters by getting band-aids, getting enough high ratings on levels, or beating warp portals, and surprisingly these characters each have their own unique abilities to help the player get through these obstacle courses of impossibility.
<br>
<br>It is a great challenge that is at the same time enjoyable for the most part.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1588538">Expand</a></span>

PC games are designed for PC and therefore should always play better with a keyboard+mouse with a gamepad being a player preference on some titles.<br>The game is literally IMPOSSIBLE with a keyboard so it loses points for forcing you to own a gamepad and even then it didn&apos;t recognise my PS3 controller and struggled to register my 360 controller.<br><br>The game takes place in several stages such as a Forest and a Hospital. Sadly you see little of these good tilesets as most of the game takes place in subterranean passageways.<br><br>However now we come to the games big problem, the difficulty. This is a game that tries to hard to be hard. The game certainly is not hard but merely frustrating. You shouldn&apos;t have to repeat a stage over and over to complete it using trial and error rather than observation and technique. A good platformer is hard due to it being complex and clever, SMB is hard due to frustrating controls and enemy placements.<br><br>I liked the soundtrack but sadly it does little to save the game, I really wanted to like SMB but due to the controls and the frustrating nature of the game it comes off as a rather bland and outdated platformer.<br><br>If a Platformer fan is considering getting SMB I would recommend instead the free N-Game or the two excellent Oddworld platformers which are available through Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1570403">Expand</a></span>

Not only with its challenge level and precise control does it define what difficulty should really rely on in a game (player skill, not lives-based punishment), but Super Meat Boy also manages to revitalize old school platforming notions of perseverance, muscle memory, concentration, and practice to almost zen-like levels (if you&apos;re willing to commit). Respawn times are also virtually nonexistent, giving you little chance to grieve over your last death. By helping put a spotlight on many other interesting games via unlockable characters, SMB has increased its replay value ten-fold and helped put a much-needed spotlight on the indie games movement. The indie development model is also celebrated here, with increased emphasis on discounts and endless content (level editor, user-created level portals). There are bosses to beat and an ending to achieve in Super Meat Boy, but it is hardly the destination of the game, something that is evidenced by the journey of 300+ timed and leaderboard-enhanced levels of pure platforming bliss that Team Meat clearly put two years of blood, sweat, and tears into. Oh yeah, and the music kicks ass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1659601">Expand</a></span>

Team Meat really did great work in revitalizing a concept (2D platformers) that was for the most part forgotten in the new modern FPS gaming world. Super Meat Boy is a wonderful game with a great atmosphere and great-looking graphics. From Forests and Hospitals to Hell and The Rapture, you can really tell what the world you are in is. The difficulty curve is VERY high, but this means every time you beat that level that you were stuck on for a day straight you feel like the king of the goddamn world. The soundtrack is simply wonderful, from the steady beats of the Forest to the synthetic notes of the Salt Factory to the symphonic melody of the End all the music fits where it was put by Team Meat. And with sixteen different characters from other indie games to unlock, from Commander Video from  the Bit.Trip series to Steve from the smash hit Minecraft, there are plenty of alternate options if you can&apos;t beat that level you&apos;re stuck on or just plain want to mess around. The controls are great, with you having lots of control over your character.<br><br>However, the insane difficulty might be too much for the more casual gamer, and sometimes you feel too in control of your character, but both are forgiveable as the game has it&apos;s difficulty planned out enough so that you will never find yourself stuck in a world far beyond your skillset.<br><br>Super Meat Boy is definitely one of, if not THE best platformer out there. In fact, I rate it higher than classics that everyone knows and loves such as Super Mario Brothers. All of them. I would definitely recommend checking out Meat Boy even if you are bad at platforming, I started out as a horrible gamer and came out a lot better for it. And with the Level Editor coming out very soon, Meat Boy&apos;s game is only going to get meatier.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1483281">Expand</a></span>

I have some old USB controller laying around and I might give that a try. Really this is the only thing I found that was holding the game back from it becoming one of my top time wasters.</span>

Ugly, ridiculously hard and unfun, shoehorned boss battles, stupid &quot;meme&quot; garbage and poor PC support. The only positive thing I can think to say about it is it has a lot of levels but I don&apos;t want to play them.

Mario sucked ... sure, it was great at the time, because *there was nothing else.* While I&apos;m at it, guess what else? Goldeneye sucks too. It&apos;s not &quot;the greatest FPS of all time.&quot; Try playing it on an HDTV? It looks like garbage and it controls even worse. It was just the best of what was available. People&apos;s over-bloated infatuation with nostalgia is beyond puzzling. People always want to think &quot;the good old days&quot; were better. Really? In the &quot;good old days&quot; people used to die from diarrhea. The &quot;good old days&quot; blew. This blows.

Which is, I don&apos;t know, I&apos;ve seen people struggle on just 1 world stage for 40 minutes. I don&apos;t know, I don&apos;t find it that difficult as it is annoying. This is on the PC mind you. People say the control on PC is bad, I can&apos;t say much about it. Some parts of it are just incredibly annoying, mainly cause the controls are glitched up sometimes. Do you wish to jump off this wall? No you don&apos;t! So I slide off and die. This isn&apos;t just a once a life time occurrence, it happens quite often. I&apos;ve jumped off that wall a lot of times, and sometimes it won&apos;t let you, sometimes it will, not sure why, but it is really annoying, and it has nothing to do with &apos;precise&apos; control, its just annoying.<br><br>The controls, it won&apos;t let you change the controls, so you&apos;re stuck with space and shift, which are quite awkward for some reason. Well, I have a habit of playing with the buttons &apos;Shift&apos; &apos;Z&apos; &apos;X&apos; and &apos;C&apos;.<br><br>Graphics... well, they&apos;re retarded, but its an indie game and it fits the goal of the game so its fine.<br>Sound, I personally don&apos;t like computer generated sounds, and there are quite a bit of em, but some of them aren&apos;t, but it fits the general bill of what the game is.<br>Overall I just find the game decent, albeit annoying because of the random &apos;I won&apos;t listen to the player&apos; moments. Difficulty, its supposed to get harder, but I don&apos;t see it getting harder as it is just make platforms smaller and more obstacles. It does get to become more of the same.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1560651">Expand</a></span>

If so, you are in luck, as that is all Super Meat Boy is about. It is not about clever mechanics, interesting game world/story, or well designed platforming and good controls. It is the exact opposite of that. The developers decided to display a large disclaimer every single time you start the game, trying to get players to specifically use an Xbox 360 controller. Furthermore, this same disclaimer often states that playing with a keyboard should not be done. This is completely unacceptable. I bought this game for PC, and I expect to be able to play it as such. Every level is a repetition of the last, with only the boss levels actually feeling different. The general level design and artwork are mediocre and bland, creating very little excitement and entertainment. There is a vast amount of campaign levels, and the option to download levels from the in-game bulletin board, but there is little reason to go through them. The repetitiveness of it all, in conjunction with how terrible the game mechanics and controls are make Super Meat Boy not very fun at all. It simply keeps on recycling the small amount of game play it has over and over. There is no variation, very little amusement, and not much to look at or listen to. The level design and difficulty are so badly unreasonable, that the patience required to play this game is unnatural. This is not a platform game. It is an attempt at forced trick jumping with lackluster controls. It appears that Edmund McMillen went back to his awful roots with Gish, and created something almost as appalling and flawed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=2157863">Expand</a></span>

You will play some levels more than ten times, but you will love every time. This game has precise controls even if you are using a keyboard (however the game will constantly tell you that controller is better). There are at least three-hundred levels that will entice you to keep on going. The boss battles are fun, but the crown jewel is definitely in the difficulty of the game. This is the kind of game that makes you pull your teeth out of anger. You will die in this game at least one-hundred times, but this game is definitely worth the purchase. it has a funny story, precise controls with a lot of content for only ten dollars, and even show a variety of guest from other indie games (such as the crab thing from half-life) that has special powers that definitely come in handy. Overall this game is an assured buy; you will never regret spending the ten dollars necessary to obtain this amazing game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/super-meat-boy/user-reviews?user_review_id=1782405">Expand</a></span>
