<br>
<br>The visual style and action mechanics are as great as any other game they made. The soundtrack is fine. I really enjoyed having more than one player-controlled character, because I liked seeing the same scene from different angles. I don&apos;t know if it was done before or no (the only other Telltale Game I played was The Wolf Among Us); so I can&apos;t say for sure if it&apos;s innovative, but it sure was cool.
<br>
<br>Looking forward to the rest of the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=4787118">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed it so much I immediately replayed it choosing different options to see where the different path choices led. Helps if you know your way around Borderlands lore but there&apos;s a lot to enjoy here if you don&apos;t. Looking forward to the next instalment.</span>

<br>However it doesn&apos;t stop you from playing the game, I haven&apos;t played any other Borderland games and I&apos;m fine! They give us some information about the world during the game play.
<br>
<br>I also love the way you&apos;re playing two characters, and revisit the same places but from the view of the other character. And their stories can vary enormously, since at least Rhys might be.... exaggerating a bit.
<br>Over all I highly recommend this game if you like other Telltale Games, and if you like them AND Borderlands this is a must buy.
<br>
<br>Other than that there are a few graphical glitches, like in all Telltale games, the length of the episode are also better than normally, two hours long, let&apos;s hope the rest of the episodes are as long. Now go get this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=4768500">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t have high expectations for this game as i knew it wouldn&apos;t be emotional as walking dead or wolf among us. However telltale proved me wrong, they made a masterpiece out of this. Surprisingly long episode really in which i enjoyed much. The game&apos;s humor is really clever and it replaces walking dead&apos;s emotional feels well. I&apos;m a bit disappointed with the ending since they didn&apos;t hype it as all wolf among us or walking dead episodes, but oh well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=4770882">Expand</a></span>

<br>Umm it&apos;s made my Telltale. You know, the developers of multi choice games that seem to perfect everything from TV shows to Other video games, so you would expect this to be good, right? If you answered no your right! Just kidding every game telltale makes seem to be good. Gets a bit repetitive though.</span>

With funny, creative, and interesting storytelling. I was not expecting much from this game, as i am not too much a fan of the original Borderlands series. This game doesn&apos;t really have an emotional theme to it, (at least not the first episode) but my god is it hilarious. I found myself laughing the whole way through, and to be quite honest, with all the emotional and depressing games as of late, this was really a breath of fresh air, and has even garnered some more interest into the Borderlands universe from me. The thing holding this game back some issues with the PC. Not massive issues but they can be annoying, slight mouse delay, tiny cursor that can be hard to see at time, all small issues that aren&apos;t a big deal. I would love Telltale to make their options menus more vast though, as basically all of their installments are extremely basic in the options menu, just Full Screen, Resolution, Anti-aliasing, and Texture Quality, and especially Texture Quality which only has &quot;High&quot; or &quot;Low&quot;. The controls are worse, i know Telltales games are very narrative focused rather than gameplay focused but rebind-able keys would still be much appreciated and very easy for them to do. Overall fantastic game though that is really deserving of your wallet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=4793426">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>ok so if you don&apos;t know this game is made by telltale same people who brought us the walking dead game (season one and two) the wolf among us and now this. so the game is setup all about the story so instead of the classic non-stop action millions of guns and looting every thing that&apos;s all gone but whats left is story humor and some borderlands charm, the story so far is great really its very good and very funny at times. it feels like telltale has finally done it i felt that the walking dead just felt a little slow paced and a bit boring at times (never played the wolf among us looked boring to me) but this game is so far great
<br>
<br>one issue is that during the times when ever rhys had to fight the bandits with the stun baton i found a bit of frame rate issues and once it would not allow me to attack one of the bandits because your circle (aim like thing) was stuck in the corner even though i was moving my mouse</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=4776773">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Story itself takes place after borderlands 2, told from the perspective of two main characters which adds even more depth to it than we are used to. Being familiar with the borderlands series only enhances the experience, and not necessary, so it&apos;s a must play for anyone remotely interested in the genre, but who doesn&apos;t like a good story, the game is very accessible so there is no excuse not to check it out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=4768994">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The biggest flaw? I woldn&apos;t exactly call TftB a game. Tales from Monkey Island was a game. Both seasons of Sam&amp;Max were games. This is more of an interactive experience with a series of casual QTEs, that let&apos;s you make some choices which turn out to have very limited consequences. If you get past that, you should have a really terrific time though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=4777366">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m really liking the plot right now and I played it non-stop to its end. Connections to the previous games just give you more reason to play it. If you enjoyed the other Borderlands games - even if you don&apos;t like these point and click ones, there is still more that enough reason for you to play it. The action sequences a well done and the gameplay is probably the best I&apos;ve seen from Telltale yet. The sheer amount of enjoyability made time pass way sooner that I would have expected. The environment is well detailed and has a wide variety of colour. There not a single boring moment. Now for the score I&apos;m giving it, many people may disagree, but I just think that  this a very welcome entry to the Borderlands universe and would make it a lot more interesting. There not a single boring moment and the departure from the slow but dramatic tone of previous Telltale games is a great choice, bringing more life into the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=4768775">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;m not a serious gamer of late though I used to regularly play big title games... games where you actually *did* something in the game, and had to try *hard* to win. Evidently there is a niche of gamers out there that would rather spend a couple of hours basically watching a movie and occasionally hitting the Q button, or idly pushing A or D when prompted by the game. Seriously? How lazy are gamers these days? I&apos;d rather take my $20 bucks elsewhere.
<br>
<br>I have to give credit to this game as a movie: the voice acting is pretty good and there is some nice humor mixed in, plus some impressive sets. Yes I call them sets because mostly you just look at them.
<br>
<br>Interaction boils down to &quot;choices&quot; you make in the game. Perhaps the consequences of those choices will actually amount to something three or four episodes down the track, but in this episode choice repercussions seemed trivial and didn&apos;t add much flavor to what little actual game play is there.
<br>
<br>So this brings me back to my puzzled start - how the heck is this more fun than a good scripted film? You punch a few keys on queue and make some choices and watch things unfold ... snooze ...count me out of this genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=4861722">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;re basically just watching a Borderlands cartoon, and you have to pay attention to click at the right points in the story for the cartoon to continue. The episodic nature also ruins the game. The first part was released last November, and here it is February already with no Part 2 released yet? At this point it will be 2016 before the game is completely done.</span>

<br>Another  Amazing Game By Telltale Games
<br>I Was a bit nervous going into this game
<br>i mean borderlands story can be very confusing to a lot of people
<br>i must say that they did an amazing game as always with the telling of a story
<br>i wont go to in depth with this review i don&apos;t want to spoil the games story
<br>but if you are a fan of borderlands &amp; if you are a fan of telltale games then pick up this game
<br>its epic from the start to the end of episode 1
<br>it keeps you glued to your computer screen / tv &amp; it keeps you playing
<br>the style of borderlands they captured it prefect here.
<br>&amp; the voice acting also top notch
<br>the chatterers / voice actors put on a very believable performance
<br>the games world / story is so well crafted that it fells like a real breathing world
<br>at first you wont really care about the chatterers but give it 20-30 minutes in &amp; you will want them to live &amp; you will fall into love with them
<br>I Give this game an 10 out of 10
<br>Its an amazing game &amp; should not be passed up by anybody that is looking for a good story
<br>and episode 1 took me about 3+ hours to beat so it has a good amount of gameplay time for episode 1
<br>i cant wait for episode 2 to be released
<br>Pick this game up.
<br>Again i gave it an 10 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=4790380">Expand</a></span>

I was a bit afraid how they would convert the loot and gore fest of the original games into a point&amp;click adventure, but I&apos;m satisfied with the results: where you would shoot the bandits in BL, now you get past them utilizing cutting-edge ... conversations. It features QTEs and there is short a timeout on conversation options; it keeps the exciting up, but I found myself choosing an option due to the time pressure and not having enough time to think through the possible consequences. On e one hand, this is mildly frustrating, on the other hand, gives an incentive to play the game again and again. Voice acting is good, but doesn&apos;t feel as good as in BL2. Iconic sound effects are in the game, but they sound odd and unpositioned in the 3D scene. Graphics looks good and is performing well, but the settings lack fullscreen toggle (although alt+enter works), v-sync and certain resolutions make part of the menu fall off the screen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=4769083">Expand</a></span>

So far it&apos;s not better than The Walking Dead but better than The Wolf Among Us and Game of Thrones. The quirky jokes, story telling and gameplay makes this game fun. I just wish these episodes were longer, they feel too short.</span>

But after playing this game i have to say Telltale games have done it again, they crafted a fantastic, smart, and very funny game taking place in the borderlands universe. i never thought borderlands was one for storytelling but this game nails it. the first episode was lengthy, fun, and set up the events of the oncoming episodes. great characters and action set pieces are awesome and fun to play since im one who enjoys QTE elements. i wont spoil the story but its mainly about a deal gone wrong and how everything unfolds is worth experiencing. plus not to mention all the different outcomes. this is a ttg all the way and choices are back and plentiful. how the story pans out is incredeibly up to the player. overall i really enjoyed this game and will definitely play the others.

The dialogue is hilarious and well written but doesn&apos;t have the same emotional punch that walking dead or wolf among us had, but the tone of the game is completely different from those two games, this is suppose to be a funny adventure, and it works perfectly. I don&apos;t like it as much as the wolf among us or walking dead but it is something different from those two series in a good way and I cant wait for the next episode</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=4774381">Expand</a></span>

<br>Telltale Games makes with the good quality continue where they left off in The Walking Dead.
<br>This time it is action-packed and the player controls from the outset two people. I really do not care for Borderlands but what Telltale Games has touched just fine.
<br>I had 3-4 stuttering in the game. Maybe you would have to fix that.</span>

Well i write here because people may do same mistake and lose they money for nothing. To me and all my friends Borderlands is only for coop nothing else.

<br>I&apos;m looking forward to the next episode. I hope TellTale keep up the good work and don&apos;t slack like they did with TWDG (Season 1 of TWDG was great but season two...meh, mediocre?). I&apos;m especially looking forward to a second season of TWAU and now the next episode of TFTB too. I&apos;m not too excited for a season 3 of TWDG but I hope TellTale surprises me by doing better, I will definitely be doing my part of research before spending money on TWDG season 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=4931539">Expand</a></span>

This might lead to some confusion as Borderlands was a first person shooter with some role play elements while Tales of the Borderlands is best described as an interactive story. Tales has therefore nothing in common with the Borderlands games but the setting and some cameos by characters.
<br>I wonder at what audience this game is actually targeted as it seems to me that the group of people who liked the Borderlands games are of a somewhat different disposition than those who like interactive stories, but maybe I am just mistaken.
<br>Tales is also not a game for those who like complex puzzles. Although Tales has some puzzles, these are far in between and not very complex and offer therefore no challenge.
<br>The game also sports dialog trees, but again this is of a rather superficial nature as the different choices do not play out in significant different ways. This might disappoint some people no doubt, especially when you are used to be able to make a significant impact on the story line.
<br>
<br>Tales is the story of Rhys and Fiona. Rhys is an employee of the malignant corporation Hyperion who tries to get back at his boss Vasquez by buying the Vault key Vasquez is trying to get his hands on before he is able to do so. Fiona is a con artist who tries to sell a fake Vault key to Hyperion as part of a con job that she and her sister Sasha try to pull of, helped by their replacement daddy and mentor Felix and the unknowing August, a small time gangster who is in love with Sasha.
<br>The whole deal gets messy fast when the vault key is found out to be a fake and at that same precise moment a gangster boss, Bossonova, chased by a vault hunter named Zer0, enters the scene and steals the ten million Rhys has &apos;borrowed&apos; from Hyperion to buy the key. And now the ten million becomes the MacGuffin  of the story that is filled with chases, lunatics, funny dialog, double crossing, odd characters, back stabbing, silliness and hilarious over the top scenes. But also with love, loyalty and friendship.
<br>Tales can best seen as a story with some interactive elements and should not be mistaken for a game. While you will be able to have some interaction with the story line, this will mostly be superficial.
<br>For me this might diminish the game somewhat, but because of the sheer fun it gives this can be forgiven.
<br>
<br>There are some dark linings though.
<br>At the moment the story is full of unfinished business and more loose ends are in the make in episode three as far as I can tell. The danger is that there are just too many of them to wrap it up neatly later on. The concept kill your darlings applies here as well. But there are still a few more episodes in the make, so let&apos;s give Tales the benefit of the doubt. An eight at least.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=5316001">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The bad: writing is mediocre at best, and downright poor at times. And because writing is the beef, the potatoes and the dessert in this genre, that is a huge shortfall.
<br>
<br>The story is a 100% linear jog down a pipe with zero chance to make an actual difference at any point with own choices. The player is limited to a very small number of actions at all times, and apart from missing a quick-time event that leads to an instant death, never feels like actually being part of the story but simply a by-watcher. The decision to tell the story as a series of flashbacks makes this problem even worse, as it further enhances the feeling of pre-defined fate.
<br>
<br>At several key phases of the story, drama is created or the plot is advanced with either a deus ex machina solution, or with one of the characters performing an act that is either out of character and/or has no sensible motivation behind it. Apart from one nice twist, the story unfolds like an exercise in lazy writing. Even the humour is cheap and unimaginative.
<br>
<br>The male main character is an unlikable loser, and the writers&apos; idea of humour is having him make a fool of himself at every opportunity. There are a myriad of games with an anti-heroic main character, but none so annoying and void of personality as Rhys. Why would I want to have a boring no-good bumbling buffoon as my virtual alter ego? Unless the purpose is to plant seeds for some serious character development during the series, but nothing in the quality of writing during the first episode has got my hopes high for that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=5540855">Expand</a></span>

I bought it because of the good press the other entries in the series received, the art style and the fact that it was produced by Telltale. And boy, am I glad I did. The game switches between the perspectives of Hyperion company man, Rhys and con-woman Fiona. The game has a dark and off-beat sense of humor that never seems to falter. All the jokes made me at the very least go &quot;Ha, ha. That&apos;s funny. I should be laughing. But I&apos;m not. Probably due to my emotions being deadened from spending every waking hour in front of a computer&quot;. Which is a good thing, I guess. The menacing, crazy world of Pandora is absolutely engrossing. Learning more about it (and it&apos;s inhabitants) is an absolute delight). It&apos;s action setpieces are amazing ( a death race with Psychos and bounty hunters all racing for a Hyperion suitcase you need to get back, a battle between loader bots and bandits) but the moments I most enjoyed where when I was playing through Rhys&apos; perspective and got to analyse things with his Echo-Eye implant. Completely inconsequential objects were given funny, detailed and interesting descriptions. The attention to detail is marvelous. You also get to hack things or control technology at specific points in the story with Rhys&apos; robotic arm. Fiona&apos;s arc is touching and in my opinion the one with the best jokes. I absolutely recommend this game to anybody who like story-based point-and-click games. You won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=5240227">Expand</a></span>

Personalities clash and characters are trumpeted as the narrative unfolds in non-linear, action packed ways. Expect to have a lot of convincing to do as well as have unexpected and contradictory outcomes to result from your best attempts at steering the narrative. Here the unexpected has such a surprising, rich, and hilarious quality to it that there is almost no fault to be found in some of the slightly janky plot devices or uninspired puzzles. Many times it comes down to a matter of &apos;who cares if what happened isn&apos;t perfect - it&apos;s awesome&apos;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1---zer0-sum/user-reviews?user_review_id=5536565">Expand</a></span>
