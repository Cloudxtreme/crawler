Having just purchased for $10 in the Steam Christmas sale and seeing the game was in the &apos;Indie&apos; section, I thought that any game for the price of two coffees couldn&apos;t be that bad... and I was right! Ignite isn&apos;t going to set the world on fire with stylish,  Burnout-esque crash sequences or NFS : The Run narratives, but it delivers in the racing, and that&apos;s what matters. The handling of the cars takes a little getting used to (especially if you come from one of the aforementioned games), but once you do, the game is excellent fun. The graphics and the sound surpass my expectations of a $10 game, but the real treat comes from the game&apos;s core strategy mechanic. Your score increases throughout the race from various maneuvers, such as drifting, drafting or driving into the various items laid across the track. Once you reach the 1,000 point threshold, you can then trade off score for nitro boost. While this may sound like an easy decision to make, the kicker comes at the end of the race when your remaining score is deducted from your finishing time to give a final time. This can mean that even though you place further down the field in the race, with a high enough score, you can win the race anyway! It&apos;s an interesting twist that makes you careful about how you &apos;spend&apos; your score during a race. I really enjoyed Ignite for the price and, as an indie title, I hope that the now the race has begun, that it continues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ignite/user-reviews?user_review_id=2057832">Expand</a></span>

But overall great arcade, if you manage to get this game on sale for 5-7$ you wont regret it, but i wont recommended to pay full 20$ price for game, for 20$ better get hot pursuit or burnout. And this game has one surprise, its total size of the game, only 850Mb, so small, i&apos;m wonder why that game does not have &quot;indie&quot; tag on steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ignite/user-reviews?user_review_id=2098711">Expand</a></span>

There is no story at all, but for a short arcade game it&apos;s not a necessary. I&apos;ll start with introduction of game - it&apos;s not like the most games, where you need to drive accurate and avoid objects, but here you get points from smashing road signs, which are used to unleash nitrous. There are several tracks and in different challenges the paths changes a bit. Also there are few modes in game, like last man standing and similar. Of course the most important part of the game are cars, which divides into three classes - muscle, street, race, and 5-6 cars in each class. You can use any car in each challenge, but you have to unlock them before. Each car has color themes witch gives different bonuses, point boost from drifting and etc. It gives a game a bit of life, because there no other upgrades or tuning for cars. Graphics are average, not edgy. Gameplay is very repetitive and opponents are easy. The most annoying thing in it was that you have to use nitro almost all the time you drive, so screen is shacking like crazy, it hurts my eyes. Apart of that it is a good arcade game. The price meets the quality, so if you feel an urge to drive cheap, buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ignite/user-reviews?user_review_id=2117646">Expand</a></span>
