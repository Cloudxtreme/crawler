<br>This game lures you in with some great graphics and a neat little camera gimmick.  To be fair to the game the graphics are gorgeously rendered.  The camera&apos;s Night Vision effect in particular is well done and it&apos;s nice to actually see Mile&apos;s hands when he actually performs an action.
<br>
<br>However, the experience starts to fall apart almost immediately. What&apos;s wrong with this game?  Well where do I begin?  For one, the setting.  Asylums are seriously overplayed as horror settings.  We get it, crazy people are scary.  The so-called scares are predictable and hokey.  The story is the same warmed over pap we&apos;ve seen over and over and over and over and over again.  An evil Mega Corporation has been performing unethical experiments that got completely out of control blah blah blah blah blah blah blah Mercernaries blah blah Ham fisted religious undertones blah.  There&apos;s no mystery at all.  Furthermore it falls into the exact same trap that the Dead Space games fell into.  The graphic designers are so proud of their work on the monsters that they just can&apos;t bear to keep their babies in the dark, so they have the monsters prance around in plain view like they&apos;re so happy to be seen.  Also, the poorly designed stealth mechanics make enemy encounters frustrating rather than scary.
<br>
<br>I see that the game was heavily marketed as being &quot;designed by veterans of some of the biggest franchises in history.&quot;  This is a flaw as far as I can see.   These veterans just kept on doing the same thing they&apos;ve always done, and the result is that they did the same thing we&apos;ve always done and the game falls into the same traps it always has.  These developers could have learned so much from the Amnesia series since it&apos;s obvious that Outlast desperately wants to be Amnesia.  The developers would have benefited from another playthrough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3481596">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Seems like a bad movie where you can&apos;t wait for it to finish and say for sure &quot;yeah it sucks&quot;.
<br>It amazes me how a game that took me about 4 hours to finish, bored me as much Outlast did.
<br>
<br>The idea of &quot;can&apos;t fight any enemy&quot; made me think that &quot;this could be interesting&quot;, but the AI is really easy to outrun. I didn&apos;t ran out of battery neither died on the entire game play (pretty much the entire meta-game).
<br>
<br>And what about the notes?! Some crack-wise spiderman-like comments from a character that runs the entire game...
<br>
<br>I was expecting much, much more from this game. Very disappointing.

<br>
<br>The atmosphere is pretty good, but most of the tension comes from all the crazy people surrounding you and the corpses that are ripped apart in the most disgusting ways.
<br>
<br>People may be having another opinion on this, but I don&apos;t like that there are so many jumpscares in this game. &quot;Amnesia: The Dark Descent&quot; for example doesn&apos;t have this many jumpscares but is way scarier due to its amazing atmosphere.
<br>
<br>The camera with night vision is a great idea, I like it more that lanterns or flashlights because you can take a closer look at the amazing monster design without getting found.
<br>
<br>&quot;Outlast&quot; gets a bit over-violent in the end, I don&apos;t think it is necessary to put hundreds of litres of blood on the walls and the floor to make the player fear the final enemy.
<br>
<br>The end of &quot;Outlast&quot; is pure  in my opinion. I never like it when the main character dies at the end of a game, but in a horror game it just feels completely unnecessary. The player feels sorry for Miles because he has to go through all of this and in the end the developers think &quot;Let&apos;s just kill Miles. That&apos;ll make a great ending!&quot;
<br>
<br>Even though it has it little problems and the worst game ending since Mass Effect 3, &quot;Outlast&quot; is a very good horror game with a good atmosphere and a deep story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3524886">Expand</a></span>

I was immersed in the rather spooky, if a bit clich&#xE9; setting and tentatively moving forward, progressing at a snail&apos;s pace for fear of what was around the corner. But after that first hour or so, the linear level design and objectives begin to feel formulaic, with enemy chase scenes feeling overused to the point that one becomes slightly desensitised to the jump scares. The same could be said with the excessive blood and gore. I think Outlast could&apos;ve been improved if it relied a little more on subtle scares and building suspense instead of the overt &apos;in your face&apos; approach that the game takes throughout its entire length. That&apos;s not to say the game isn&apos;t somewhat scary. Outlast does it better than most, but it&apos;s hardly outstanding.
<br>
<br>The story is unfortunately another weak point. To put it bluntly, it&apos;s uninspired, predictable and the ending is underwhelming to say the least. On the bright side, both the visuals and audio are of high quality, the core gameplay mechanics work decently, and your character controls smoothly.

Outlast certainly has it&apos;s share of creepy moments and well timed jump scares and is still a great game overall, but beyond the polish it felt as though something more was missing.
<br>
<br>My one real gripe with the game is that the vast majority of enemies you encounter in the game all follow a similar &apos;search and chase&apos; AI that takes little effort to outsmart, which greatly detracts from the immersion and fear of evading and escaping them. There were also several times throughout the game when the &quot;activate X number of things while evading a patrol&quot; mechanic was used, all of which boiled down to performing the exact same &quot;stay out of sight and move when they move&quot; tactic, which took away from the overall experience for me. There were also a few times where I would become more frustrated than frightened over trying to deal with and evade enemies as I progressed.
<br>
<br>All of that said however, Outlast is still a very satisfying game to play, and is worth the asking price. Gameplay is smooth and fluid, character interaction with the environment is an uncommon and welcome touch, and the night vision mechanic is implemented very well. While it&apos;s not a game I would play through again, I certainly recommend it to anyone looking for another title in the horror genre to keep them occupied.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=4085085">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The scares are all done the right way. You will find yourself jumping out of your seat many times. You will find yourself in constant paranoia and getting bursts of fear-induced adrenaline for the large chunk of the game. The gameplay isn&apos;t mind-blowing, but still holds up extremely well.
<br>
<br>The only negative point I&apos;ll give this game is that some of the level design is very poor, and you could find yourself running around in circles or possibly getting killed because it can be cramped, confusing and repetitive, though that doesn&apos;t ruin the game in any sense. Overall, if horror games are your thing, this&apos;ll probably be in your top 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3985556">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The games main problem is that it loses its scare about half way in, you are no longer as frightened and do not feel as vulnerable, because evading the enemy is not too difficult, and that a close up on an enemy&apos;s deformed face really loses the scare, because no matter how scary  and menacing the enemy, it is not as scary as the unknown, the shadow, a sound etc...
<br>
<br>But overall, a lot of fun and scares, especially considering that its a new studio and an indie game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=4212348">Expand</a></span>

Though the writing and characters are not that unique and experimental as the other aspects of the game suggest, this survival horror game has a well-designed flow and balanced gameplay, which is coherent with its story.
<br>
<br>In my opinion the weakest part of the game is its writing, content and character designs, specifically its main antagonist whose appearance and nature makes an absolute flaw in the player&apos;s immersion in this hyper-realistic looking world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=4221122">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>A lot of Amnesia is borrowed in that you can&apos;t fight or do anything remotely offensive- it&apos;s just you and your ability to stay hidden. Fortunately, the *things* you&apos;re hiding from can&apos;t see in the dark. And, boy is there plenty of dark for you to hide in. As a matter of fact, without the night vision, this game would be altogether unplayable.
<br>
<br>The atmosphere is one that is horrifying even when not much is going on and that&apos;s mainly due to the incredible sounds that keep the game going. There&apos;s a constant and relentless eery feeling that there&apos;s something right around the corner.
<br>
<br>Now as for the story, I personally felt it could have been fleshed out a bit more, and I felt the ending to be a bit disappointing. But I don&apos;t want to spoil anything about the game, so I&apos;ll leave you to come to any conclusions yourself about that.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d recommend this game to ANYONE who&apos;s PC can handle it and would advise that you use headphones or your surround sound system (if playing on a TV) The game truly relies on the aforementioned atmospheric sounds to create a unique and unforgettable experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=4218553">Expand</a></span>

Atmosphere was good for first hour. There are some cheap jumpscares, but not that much. It has amazing graphics for an indie game. You must admit it. This game looks really good.</span>

A few shadows, maybe dead bodies after a long time creates anticipation. Having played Amnesia, I was a bit familiar with the mechanics. Hide from supernatural enemies and run. However, I wasn&apos;t too impressed by the protagonist here being so ridiculously helpless. A lot of times, the game just made me irk at the fact that I was surrounded by all sorts of melee weapons but couldn&apos;t use any of them against my assailants which could be easily killed. Sometimes, the frustration was such, the player character dying made feel happy. I though if he was such a **** he deserved it. The game also had exaggerated too many dead bodies and horror elements to the point it eventually felt too common to be scary and eventually turned boring. It was just trying too hard and  this ruined it for me. The camcorder was a nice touch, but I needed more. If you like horror stories, you&apos;ll find a bit of it here but nothing as good as Amnesia&apos;s. Overall, a good game, but nothing too special. If you like survival horror games, it&apos;s worth it, I suppose, otherwise, this might leave you frustrated and bored.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=5426230">Expand</a></span>

The only problem I have with the game is that I wish it was much longer., but that is such a minor complaint that I don&apos;t think it should effect it&apos;s overall score.

Exceptionally well done, ambience is top notch, controls are responsive and tension is extreme! Very graphic though; it might not be for all tastes.

Mind you, it is more like a walk (or run) through a haunted house than a game.  There are no puzzles elements other than hunting for camcorder batteries, crawlspaces to squeeze through, or various objects like key cards and fuses to get you on your way.  There is no combat.  All you can do is run and hide.
<br>I have been bored by other games in the genre with little to do but explore in the dark (Amnesia x2, Among the Sleep, Year Walk, Gone Home).
<br>Something is different about Outlast.  The atmosphere.  The sound design.  The Lighting.  It is just a great creepy experience.  The characters themselves don&apos;t have the best graphics and animation, but look at the original Silent Hill.  People eat that up and the graphics are horrible by today&apos;s standards.  Outlast sets a mood and keeps it going.
<br>Sure you can play it on easy and take a lot of hits and just run through the whole thing.  The check points are not far apart, so nobody is going to be frustrated by having to replay long passages.  But if you are as careful and possible and play with an &quot;I don&apos;t want to die&quot; attitude, you will run for your life and your heart will pound as you hope you chose the right bed under which to hide.
<br>For a $20 indie game it is excellent.  It is long enough to get to play through a few different environments with a few novel twist to the formula, but it isn&apos;t so long that it gets too repetitive and tedious.
<br>It is more like watching a movie than playing a video game.  It reminds me of the final scene of The Shinning when Danny is running for his life from Jack, except you are Danny and you are running and hiding for your life.  I don&apos;t think a game has ever gotten me so wound up that I can&apos;t play it anywhere near bedtime.  It has been a long time since a game did that, as some of the Dead Space and Silent Hill games did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=4260340">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unfortunately, the game has some &quot;problems&quot; in many areas and one of them is its duration. My experience on the &apos;Normal&apos; difficulty lasted for about 6 hours, and that can be quite dettering for people who are interested to pick this up (Price as of right now is 19.99 w/o any discounts).
<br>
<br>Another &quot;problem&quot; is its horrible, asinine and abrupt ending...
<br>
<br>Definitely worth picking up during a sale any time, any day. Awesome horror game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=4184169">Expand</a></span>

Outlast does such an amazing job of creating these unique identities for the handful of psychos stalking you in the asylum that it created this sense of realism I have not found in a game in a long time.
<br>I dodged this game for months thinking it would just be full of cheap jump scares, but it is not. It has a very detailed world to explore and a very solid story to unravel.
<br>It became apparent at some point that the developers were afraid the game was turning out to be too short and started stretching out the gameplay. This stretched gameplay is not bad quality, but serves to add a lot of question marks to your thought pattern when you reach them.
<br>My only real complaint would be the rare but over-used character models for the more common variants. Occasionally, I would come across a character that I would think was someone I had already encountered before, only to find out it was just another NPC using the same model, which would remind me that this is only a game quickly.
<br>Overall, this game scared its way into my favorite games list. Watching my little cousin jump so much during the first five minutes that I thought he was going to damage my system was worth the base price alone. I was sad to read that Whistleblower concludes the story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=4279154">Expand</a></span>

<br>The idea that you should record main happenings with the camera (it&apos;s not compulsory but you must use the camera to see something in the dark) makes everything similar to be in a movie like rec or esp, it&apos;s simply a great Idea!.
<br>As other similar games, you cannot fight foes only try to run but especially you will find yourself hiding, but remember that if they see you hiding they will still get you (of course) .
<br>Second only to amnesia:the dark descent just for the lack of little puzzles (and because amnesia cannot be defeated  ) :D .
<br>One of my best purchases. I probably will buy the dlc as soon as it is on sale!
<br>85/100 and a 9 on metacritic as a little gift for the unknown producer!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=4401814">Expand</a></span>

When I think about my favorite horror titles from all time, I think about Silent Hill 2, Penumbra Black Plague and now this one. This review is going to be made with comparisons to Amnesia the Dark Descent, as it is claimed to be one of the best horror games of all time, while I try to justify the score of 8/10.
<br>
<br>The setting is an Asylum, which is slightly overplayed in horror but there haven&apos;t actual horror games I&apos;ve played in the past decade that actually happen in it&apos;s entirety within one and it follows the rules of horror splendidly. Anyone can die at any time, including the protagonist. Bad things will happen to him and, although the ending was horrid, it still fit within the archetype of a horror story which made me appreciate it.
<br>
<br>The story is rather straightforward and somewhat clich&#xE9;d. A company has reopened a massive asylum and has been performed not so ethical treatments within it that eventually go wrong. You are a journalist who&apos;s going to expose the company by breaking into the Asylum with only your wits and your trusty camera. Bad idea.
<br>
<br>So what does Outlast do right, what does it do wrong, and why is it scary? I&apos;ll try to explain this in as much detail as possible.
<br>
<br>The first comparison I will draw to Amnesia will happen right here, monster patrols. In Outlast, monster appearances are scripted, which is okay. The game is linear, the developers know where the player will come from and what his objective will be, they predict what they are going to do and react accordingly by preparing a nasty inmate to scare the balls out of you. This is done right in some instances, wrong in others. It&apos;s done wrong when you complete an objective and a monster just starts knocking at the closed door to break into where you are, and because you already expected this from playing all sorts of horror games were already hidden in the locker making it ineffective. It does it right when you get to an illuminated area thinking you&apos;re safe and the guy is actually hiding in the darkness in the distance, fully capable of seeing you and running at you. If you manage to escape and hide, and therefore not die because you have no means of defending yourself, he will eventually go away. Amnesia, does exactly the same thing, but this is where A.I. Behavior differs. The insane men of Outlast will keep patrolling a scripted path back and forth sometimes reacting to sound, sometimes not, while the monsters of Amnesia will wander off and eventually disappear once the music queue for monsters stops playing. Outlast manages to be scarier within this aspect, because the monsters are present and might catch you again, making you have to be on your toes constantly.
<br>
<br>The game is DARK. There is no &apos;dark vision&apos; besides the night vision of your camera which in itself is horrible. This is not a bad thing. The lack of visibility makes the player more anxious, mainly if you can hear the guy who&apos;s out to kill you. You don&apos;t know where he is, and if you run into him face first you won&apos;t expect it. A careful player, who uses his camera correctly, might be able to go through the entire game without triggering any of the non-scripted encounters. But even then your heart will be pumping the entire time as the game pulls some unexpected tricks on you. Like a patient who&apos;s on a bed starts screaming calling the mad surgeon who&apos;s out to kill you to that location.
<br>
<br>Hiding spots aren&apos;t always effective, not even when a monster&apos;s seen you going into a room and closing the door to break line of sight. For the first half of the game you feel relatively safe when you see a hiding place but eventually the baddies will get smarter and actually check these places, making nowhere really safe. The player is never safe, and the game conveys this message splendidly in the second half as according to the rules of horror.
<br>
<br>However, I believe the enemies are slower than you, only having heard of a friend of mine being caught while escaping from a baddie and getting instantly killed. Because you can always escape, there is less tension than in Amnesia where the grunts were always faster. But, they balance this out by actually checking hiding spots as I&apos;ve mentioned earlier. If you&apos;re running in a panic for a long time you&apos;re liable to make mistakes that will kill you.
<br>
<br>Graphically the game is just fine. I&apos;m not a man who puts a lot of emphasis on graphics so I can&apos;t objectively tell the reader how good they are, the only thing actually bothering me in the game was how from a certain point to the very end, the blood on the main character&apos;s hands was always a wet texture. I understand that he never gets time to do anything about it, but the other explanation would be that he&apos;d die from blood loss.
<br>
<br>OverallI rate the game an 8/10, a good game in the horror genre. It makes the same mistakes as some of it&apos;s predecessors, but brings with it some changes that might scare a gamer who&apos;s experienced in the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3527353">Expand</a></span>

As far as survival-horror games go this is at least a 8 or 9 out of ten.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3546594">Expand</a></span>

And then your main objective is just to GET THE HELL OUT. And that&apos;s what you were doing all that time. So, yeah, the story is kinda basic and predictible, but everything else is top notch.
<br>This is the best horror game I&apos;ve played since Amnesia and Outlast surpasses it by a long shot. It&apos;s better in every way.
<br>This game really got me scared, to the point when I needed to take a break for like every other 30 minutes from it, because the tension was ubereable.
<br>Graphics are oustanding. One of the best looking game for the past year, effects are awesome, and it&apos;s the best in it&apos;s genre for sure.
<br>I&apos;ve tried Machine for Pigs and it just didn&apos;t cut it for me after Outlast. Amnesia was scary, right, but after this game it&apos;s like walking in the park. I wasn&apos;t scared in Machine for Pigs, it was like a kid&apos;s game. Outlast is ruined horror for me :D And I&apos;m glad it did.
<br>If you like horror games, try this out. For it&apos;s price it&apos;s excellent. This game is a strong 9 out of 10, I don&apos;t believe any horror games from the past couple of years come even close to the Outlast. I hope we will see more from this developer. Games like this come once in a decade. It&apos;s almost perfect in every way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3627381">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>To enjoy the max experience, use headset, crank it all the way up, turn off any lights, and play the game.
<br>
<br>I actually had to turn this game offf several times because i couldn&apos;t handle the pressure. The build-up for all the jump scares are really nice.</span>

<br>This game is right up my alley, the story is twisted and the setting is the last place on earth I would want to be in person, this is the first horror game since Silent Hill 2 that I have been scared and had to really push myself to proceed into the nightmare which is going on in the game  The tension in this game is awesome, having to always use the camera to see is a simple but very affective way of adding to the scary atmosphere and the fact you are defenceless sounds crap but offers excellent gameplay trying to survive the horror .
<br>I wont go into the story at all but in my opinion it just gets it right, I finished the game last night and would recommend this game to anyone, except people with heart conditions lol  The game is best played alone, at night with the surround sound pumped up  Enjoy</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3889848">Expand</a></span>

It brings me back to the good old days of Resident Evil for PlayStation, without the ability to defend myself. The only way to survive is to run, run, RUN!!! It&apos;s realism is the fact that you can&apos;t fight back, you can only hide. Do NOT underestimate the horror in this game.</span>

There are a few problems, but first let me go over what this game does right.
<br>
<br>PROS
<br>Outlast has some gorgeous environments. Major props to whoever worked on the modeling, texturing, level design, and lighting. It looks great, and runs smoothish even on low-end machines. The sound design is also fantastic, as well as the game play. The tension and exploration is some of the best in gaming. I really liked the camera gimmick, although I don&apos;t think it would work too well to keep it going through sequels (if they happen). The pacing is fairly good, except for the first 45 minutes or so. The game had a slow start, but picks up fairly quickly once you hit the sewers. The story is interesting, although nothing special.
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>Not very many cons here. The UI design is bland and uninteresting aside from the camera effects. The asylum environment is a bit played out at this point, and I would have liked a little more variety of environments. The fear elements were too often to be effective every time, and the jump scares could be seen coming a mile away. Also, a little variety in the types of encounters would have been nice. Every single encounter could be handled the exact same way.
<br>
<br>*SLIGHT SPOILER* I was digging the supernatural story until I realized that it wasn&apos;t. But what was there was done a bit confusingly. I wasn&apos;t sure what had even happened, much less why or how.
<br>
<br>Overall, worth the $20, but I would suggest getting it on sale. Very good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3907758">Expand</a></span>

The setting for the game, Mount Massive mental asylum, is a good location for horror movies or games, but admittedly is over-used. The game is mostly linear, with the exception of a few segments where you have a maze like area and you have to complete some objective, often while being hunted by a deranged ex-patient. The asylum is well done in general, there is good attention to detail and realistic design, the lighting is perfect, it is not completely dark but most sections are partially illuminated. The game is not very long, but it doesn&apos;t really have to be, nor should it be, this is not a game you blow through in an afternoon. It took me four sitting to play this game to completion, I usually got too nerve-wrecked to continue after an hour or so. As stated in the beginning the games atmosphere is great, lighting and shadows are well utilized, level design is well down to give a claustrophobic feel, and small little things like, making bloody footprints when you step in a blood puddle. One of my favorite things about this was the camcorder, you play as a journalist, so it it important to capture the certain things, and the game rewards you doing that by giving you, reports and notes about the subject. The camera also serves as your torch with it&apos;s night vision mode, which quickly drains batteries, forcing you to be vigilant in your search for replacements. Now, the game missteps in some areas, mainly the jump-scares, that was my biggest problem with the game. If you pay attention there will sometimes be a  &quot;lead up&quot; to the scares, you may see someone watching you and then run away or the like, it builds anticipation and puts you on edge. But too many times does the game give you these cheap scares, in the beginning of the game, you open a door and a figure is on the other side of the door, accompanied by a loud noise, but when you look, it is a body hung up side down by chains. What made the sound? It feels kind of cheap at some points, unfortunately this happens quite a bit. But the other scares are more than enough to make up for it, some of them are clever in their buildup, and there is some psychological scares. I don&apos;t think a scare should have to announce itself with a loud noise and someone hiding behind a door, like the player is an idiot and wouldn&apos;t be scared otherwise. One of my best examples if a good scare is when your walking on cat walk and you look behind you and see a huge figure silently walking behind you, and then turn around to run to find another one coming from the other direction. This type of scare will scare you just as much as any jump scare, but it won&apos;t make you knee the bottom of your desk. So in conclusion, despite my gripes about the overuse of cheap jump scares, Outlast is a better than average horror game, it is solid, or better in almost all areas, and is a must buy for any horror fan and if you&apos;re not a fan of horror, you may want to try it, it might turn you into one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3907565">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics are real and dim, creating a creepy mood. The constant scares and enemies are scary and good-looking (sometimes, you don&apos;t even KNOW whether he would attack!), and with the game in a first-person view is excellent. With breathing, footsteps, and limbs.
<br>
<br>However, there&apos;s so much gore, I could puke. Plus, the ending. WHAT COULD THEY POSSIBLY BE THINKING! It&apos;s really disappointing to find out at the very end of the game that the developers just said, &quot;Hey, let&apos;s just kill Miles, since we don&apos;t know what other b****in&apos; thing to do!&quot;
<br>
<br>Still, cheers for Red Barrels (as leonov said)!

I think this game achieves what others cannot; together with the great visuals and music, create a believable, yet grossly disturbing atmosphere that envelops you, making you yourself the protagonist. The gameplay consists of finding your way around and fleeing from enemies. Don&apos;t expect to do any fighting. If I recall correctly, I don&apos;t think you hurt a single soul in the game... but that&apos;s what makes this IP so unique. This may be one of the few games out there where it takes away the fight from the fight-or-flight concept, making you a victim from the beginning to the very end of the game.
<br>
<br>The AI is not bad, considering they do put up quite the scare. Since there is only a handful of enemy types, their behaviour becomes predictable. Death scenes are mediocre and not the spectacular ones you find in Dead Space. They just don&apos;t hold up to the intensity built up from your attempted escape.
<br>Maps are pretty linear unfortunately. Scripted events lock doors and unlock others to limit where you can go. Perhaps this is a good thing, as a sandbox-freeroaming asylum is something you don&apos;t want to get lost in. (Certain objectives are already hard enough to find...)
<br>
<br>Other than these minor shortcomings, the game does brilliantly in everything else. The graphics is good (but some frame rate drops), music sets the scene well, and the atmosphere is simply stunning! If you play this game, I recommend looking around for various rooms and passages, since they might contain batteries and notes. These notes are great as they help lay the background of the story, and the story is pretty good! The campaign is of a healthy length (took me around 6 hours?). From hindsight I think this could&apos;ve been a bit longer, but towards the end of the story I was asking myself when this will all finally end!
<br>
<br>If you are looking for a thrill ride, look no further. This game is worth every penny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3921547">Expand</a></span>

A true horror game, with an interesting Story, much more than i was specting . TIP: Dont buy this game if you don&#xB4;t like horror genre , or if you get scared too easy , because you will quit the game every 5 minutes , im not joking.</span>

It&apos;s very repeated - we still hiding in the cupboard and running, sometimes looking for the switchers, fuses and other stuff. Ending of the is also a bit disappointing, but the game is still worth playing, especially if you are horror fan.</span>

Even after the coast is clear the thought of crawling out and trying to slip past is nerve-wracking. Super creepy and super tense. Playing in the dark with headphones and I swear my heart was going to stop a few times.
<br>
<br>Good graphics and creepy sound effects create a really unsettling environment with night vision thrown in to make it worse. A classic horror movie soundtrack when you&apos;re being chased makes you hope you don&apos;t fall into that &quot;trip on your shoelace at the worst possible moment&quot; trope. Story line is a little cliche but not too bad.
<br>
<br>I was never really into the survival horror genre. I got a free copy of Daylight, which turned out to be... just awful... but it made me go looking for something better and I definitely found it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=4317907">Expand</a></span>

The thing I like the most about this game though is the camera, which is also similar to Amnesia&apos;s lantern in its use. you use the video camera to see in the dark using its nigh vision light thing just like you would see in a found footage film, and that&apos;s what makes this game so cool, because it makes you feel like you are in one of those movies. its a great touch that really makes outlast stand out as a creative and very scary horror game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=4181358">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Overall a fantastic game.  Great sound, graphics and atmosphere. I was creeped out from the start until the end. No game has had me this tense and actually made me jump before. My only grief (thus the 9) was that the &quot;enemies&quot; got a bit old and lost some tension because they were used so much. Other than that it was excellent.</span>

Scary, great graphics, makes you reluctant to run anywhere apart from if you&apos;re being chased of course. It didn&apos;t help when I felt quite tense and my cat clawed my leg. Great game.</span>

When I first got the game I started playing right away, with a full bladder (In future notice please use the restroom before playing game.) Originally it was praise to just be another indie game, with a few jump starters. The producers should have been telling everyone that they would have a heart pounding, suspenseful, thrilling adventure.
<br>The eerie atmosphere creates a panic in the player, were this helps set the mood. With this and the dilemma that you character has to overcome, makes this gut wrenching for anybody brave enough or foolish enough to play. Given this has the classic jumps scare, it also has better tactics in scaring the player then most games; such as using slow movements, which many of the antagonists use. This may not seem scary, but when you have nothing to do but slowly watch your doom walk towards you it becomes twice as suspenseful. My personal favorite would have to be the profiles of the characters. As the player progresses through the game you slowly build profiles on all the enemies, and so when you come face to face to them the player is rattled to the bone because they know what is about to happen to them, by the hands of these psychos/antagonists.
<br>The story line was well written. For most games that have no story and just have guns, this game is a shining gem. Most horror/thriller games have some storyline, but rely on jump scares to keep you interested. This games story was so carefully thought through to keep you on your toes, and always asking for more (even though this game may give you heart attacks). It was designed to have the player have the most fun, and have the most thrills possible. It was noticed that at gaming conventions when people went into the booth to watch the trailer, they were known to blackout because it was so scary.
<br>Over all this game is worth for what it is, and maybe even more. This game is truly a gem for this generation of games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=4433825">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_3508655"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I have to say that Outlast was quite a well made game for an indie team. The graphics/visuals are very nicely done. The story itself was rather short and felt somewhat empty sadly, and the ending was rather disappointing. It felt rushed.
<br>
<br>However my experience playing the game was for the most part, fun.
<br>The game itself wasn&apos;t scary though. It was more thrills and suspense and the odd jump scare.
<br>
<br>The atmosphere in the game was pretty good. Some of the things you see patients doing was rather surprising but at the same time, it&apos;s something you would expect to see. All in all, I think the developers got the mental patient behaviors to definitely give off the feeling that you were in a mental institution. It could have been taken further in my opinion. But still I would say it was well done.
<br>
<br>I loved the camera and it&apos;s night vision. It really went well with the game and definitely was something I was happy to have.
<br>
<br>Enemies were not really scary. Pretty much all characters in the game that you encounter look extremely similar to each other, which left me a bit disappointed to be honest. They looked weird, but not in a scary way.
<br>
<br>Also while I enjoyed not being able to attack and having to run and hide instead, it felt extremely simple and in no way scary. It was more of a suspense feeling. Getting away from enemies was very easy, and with the AI intelligence, it felt somewhat unrealistic. They were not much of a threat. More of an annoyance and rather predictable very early in the game.
<br>
<br>The AI itself for enemies was very basic when they would look around for you. It felt very simple. However I will say watching them look under beds and in lockers was quite a chilling to experience. Heck, I even once had one of the enemies open the right one which took me by complete surprise! So that over there gets a star for thrills. Though the AI itself to me was still silly. See spoiler below as to why.
<br>
<br>SPOILER
<br>In once instance where Tager is looking for you, I was hiding under a bed, he looked under a bed right ahead of me. Yet he couldn&apos;t see me. But it was light enough that he should have. So it felt a bit odd. But I didn&apos;t mind so much since he was not a very nice enemy to be around. Long story short he will NEVER be my buddy..
<br>SPOILER
<br>
<br>Another thing that I felt was a bit odd was the portable lights on the floor. Surely the player should be able to move them or turn them off to hide from enemies.. So that was rather odd to me.
<br>
<br>The institution was quite nicely done. But in some areas it felt a bit repetitive. The gore was pretty gory I suppose. Definitely felt like something horrid had happened.
<br>
<br>The sound effects were decent. Hearing the character&apos;s breathing when scared was quite a nice effect and such.
<br>
<br>Overall, I don&apos;t really write reviews but here&apos;s my sum up.
<br>
<br>Story: 5/10
<br>Gameplay: 6/10
<br>Scare: 4/10
<br>Sound: 7/10
<br>Graphics: 7.5/10
<br>
<br>I would definitely recommend playing the game. It is worth the $20 USD price. And all in all, I hope the developers will continue to create games like this, but improve from feedback. The game had far more potential. But I reckon they can bring something even greater than Outlast. They&apos;ve definitely shown some great skills in their work. All in all, I support them and I&apos;m glad I purchased the game.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re looking for some thrills and suspense, I highly recommend this game. It may be short and not the most in depth and interesting story. But it&apos;s definitely a game you should play at least once.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3508655">Expand</a></span>

However, these ingredients weren&apos;t used to the fullest.
<br>The beginning of the game was amazing. The atmosphere sucked you right in, and the scares were placed just right to both scare you and teach you the game. As it got towards the middle and end, things began to lack off. Repetitive scare tactics lost their edge, and the designers even began to announce the entrance of major enemies to let you be aware that they were there, and that you should be cautious. Over exposure to the enemies was also a minor problem. I became used to seeing freaks everywhere and didn&apos;t pay much mind if one hit me. Also, the survival horror aspect is too forgiving (I think this of Amnesia too) a huge, beast of a man is introduced to you by ripping off an inmates head and when you encounter him, he just throws you or slaps you; almost every enemy in the game has to hit you twice.
<br>The platforming was great because it felt like you were just an average man, not some star athlete. You felt the breathing and effort in the long jumps.
<br>Lastly the ending areas were lackluster at best, a cliche ending to the game and a huge let down for the mystery and buildup it had going for it. I&apos;ll leave the ending at that.
<br>Overall, it was still worth my money and easily worth playing, just don&apos;t expect the &apos;scariest game ever&apos; as it was hyped for.
<br>
<br>TL;DR
<br>Enemies lost their scariness and threat
<br>Reused scare tactics
<br>Atmosphere was stunning, but fell off near the end
<br>Had some amazing scares, but too many failed attempts
<br>7/10 would buy and play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3488141">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game suffers from the same thing as the original &quot;Assassin&apos;s Creed&quot;; repetition. You are constantly trying to find switches, levers, or keys while being hunted by a particular enemy (a lot of times, one that has chased you before...). I have to admit, the game was able to maintain it&apos;s level of scariness for the first encounter... maybe a bit during the second, but after that, the player starts to realize the patterns, understands the AI, and loses all immersion, at least I did. At this point, I found myself giving up on creeping past enemies and slowly walking around corners because I knew I would survive at least one or two hits from the enemy, and all I would have to do to escape is either climb into an air duct or close myself in a room and hide. Nine times out of ten, the enemy would break the door down, walk into my 10x10 room with one bed (which I would be hiding under), and give up his pursuit. Really?! You&apos;re not going to check the one and only possible hiding spot??? Oh well...
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t play many survival horror games. Actually, to be 100% honest, this is my first one! I figured I would give the genre the benefit of the doubt and gave the game a 6/10. Perhaps it is a masterpiece in its own right? To me though, a non-memorable and simple foray through the dark.
<br>
<br>To sum up:
<br>Pros:
<br>1) Beautifully designed
<br>2) Strong introduction and ending
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>1) Majority of game is repetitious
<br>2) A.I is predictable and easily fooled (crouching is OP)
<br>3) Extremely forgiving gameplay that removes all drama and tension from encounters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3505294">Expand</a></span>

<br>I love horror games. I play them every day. When I saw the trailer for Outlast and read the back story, I was intrigued and eager. Eager to buy. Eager to be scared.
<br>
<br>Installed and started playing right when it became available on Steam. I immediately noticed the smoothness in controls and zooming in and out with the camera added a touch of realism, immediately drawing me in even closer. This was short lived. As soon as started exploring the Asylum things got repetitive quickly. It&apos;s not that I do not like body parts and blood t all over the place or asylums, there was just something about Outlast&apos;s environments that were painfully familiar. And that&apos;s when it really it me. Throughout my entire play through, there was something that was just bothering me, gnawing at me at the back of my mind every time I thought about how much I had spent on it. Many moments in outlast felt like they were just copy and pasted from other mainstream horror media.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3578731">Expand</a></span>

<br>Walk here, dodge patrol, repeat.

<br>
<br>Its not scary, the first 20mins had me afraid and very interested but after that, i just started to laugh when i got chased and thought to myself &quot;This game is so bad&quot;.
<br>
<br>The AI is just idiotic. I ran from a guy and tried the same locker three times, and he caught me twice but after the third time he didnt see me apperently. There&apos;s no horror in the game. It&apos;s just jumpscares all the time.
<br>
<br>Imagine you going into a fight with a guy and he from nowhere - punches you in the nutsack. It aint fair and it just feels lazy. I dont wanna be scared by a 15000db scream. I wanna have a scary and disgusting feeling that i wont survive at all - such as in Condemned for example.
<br>
<br>This is more like: &quot;find this&quot; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<br>
<br>&quot;find 3 levers&quot; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADIHAuDHSIhdAuD
<br>
<br>It gets alot unserious from a time, the enemies arent scary at all.
<br>And the whole scary asylum, blood on the wall &quot;Run away, they will catch you&quot; crazy doctor that is following you and all, really? This is 20th century.
<br>
<br>I didnt complete the game, i played for around 2 hours, and i just couldnt take it serious. It feels so stupid. Like it was meant for idiotic morons like pewdiedee or 14years kid that cant handle real horror.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=4237167">Expand</a></span>

The atmosphere you breathe icy breath until the end of the back and this is definitely a great title that his promise. It really is a game of survival horror and full of unpleasant moments.
<br>
<br>What struck me at the game but was greatly disappointed by game time. I finished the game for four hours, I enjoyed so only two nights and I feel very disappointed. The game had great potential and I feel very deprived. It is above average and great horror game that the knee precipitated a very short game time and sometimes poor AI.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3487364">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s ridiculous that I can&apos;t fight back when some scrawny guy missing his skin is beating me to death.  2) because of (1) above, you tend to get your ass kicked over and over until you&apos;ve memorized a map and this is both frustrating and not scary when you get killed for the 20th time by the same wimp 3) the puzzles tend to emphasize knowing the map (collect X of some item) which relates back to (1) and (2)    and finally 4) the story isn&apos;t really all that interesting or subtle.  It&apos;s your typical sort of Resident Evil Operation Racoon stuff that&apos;s been done to death.  Otherwise the game is OK.  The graphics, sound effects, and general ambiance of the level design and atmosphere are top notch and this is why I give it 7/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3513522">Expand</a></span>

I tried playing it lights off with headphones, and let me just say I jumped more times than I care to admit. It really has an interesting story that weaves a really terrifying narrative together. I found myself glued to my screen, which I felt torn about because on the flip-side of being a great story, it was also terrifying and I did have to take breaks because it was so tense.
<br>
<br>TLDR: Great story, truly terrifying, and has a fit and finish that is really great. The graphics are top notch, and it&apos;s truly a must have if you&apos;re a fan of horror games like Dead Space 1 and the Amnesia series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3724079">Expand</a></span>

Lights off and undisturbed. Turn up the AC for a chilly room. Then blast the surround sound. You will not be disappointed.</span>

So, with that in mind, I feel I can be a bit generous with my verdict of Outlast.
<br>
<br>What I consider to be of a full price nature are the graphics (only FSAA currently missing from the limited options, surely the PS4 will be getting some AA, right?), which are very good, not amazing, but great use of lighting and perfectly smooth. The sound is also very good, excellent subtleties that don&apos;t infringe on the intended mood of the game, although the soundtrack can become slightly cliche at times. Controls are tight, movement effects (crouch, run, look behind, etc) all done ell and, more importantly, not overdone. Again, considering the price, Outlast can and does look and sound better than many full price titles.
<br>
<br>The budget elements only really come down to lacklustre character models  some could have looked a lot better  and the fact that Red Barrels add a nice touch with showing a close-up of the hand when leaning against walls, etc, but decided to leave it looking rather substandard. Small niggles that wouldn&apos;t have taken much time to resolve but would have meant that all of Outlast looked nice, not just most of it.
<br>
<br>Scary? I&apos;m not so sure, not in a Amnesia way, more like a F.E.A.R. way really; which ultimately makes it more of a shocker than an outright horror. Amnesia is the master of pretence, whereas Outlast just throws it at you. It has it&apos;s moments but it&apos;s not as clever as Amnesia.
<br>
<br>Film grain? Not my thing, but it&apos;s there.
<br>
<br>Overall, good, but considering the price tag, I&apos;m going to say very good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3488664">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros: Elegant game-play with surprisingly high production value. The trailer gives an excellent feel for this game. The experience has been a delight, and I&apos;m sure other horror genre fans will agree.
<br>
<br>Cons: Can&apos;t close doors quietly (unless I&apos;m missing something). I don&apos;t like being forced to slam doors shut as I sneak around... but this is only a minor complaint.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3480797">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The cons are: A loss of immersion after the first 1/2 an hour of play. I played in the dark with headphones and set my gamma low enough to ensure stuff would be getting the jump on me. But even with this the unoriginal story, the amount of time spend so close to the enemies (they lose their scariness), and overuse of the night-vision on the video camera killed the immersion for me. I feel that if the player only got glimpses of the enemies and used the night-vision 20% of the time (rather than 90%) would have made this a perfect game.
<br>
<br>Regardless of the fact that I just used more characters to type about the game&apos;s flaws it is easily one of the best horror games I&apos;ve played and I whole heartily recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3498479">Expand</a></span>

<br>Those who&apos;ve played it will know what I&apos;m talking about. The US did recruit a number of there former enemys specialists and they did perform questionable research...specifically biological and psychological warfare (in fact the game has in the various journals almost word for word excerpts from said research, with names dates and locations changed) and I can&apos;t fault people for being in denial over those events (for those curious I do recommend a google search or two on the subject...very chilling stuff and a real lesson in monitoring ones government, to serve and protect...sometimes the latter drives those in power to extremes to one up would be opponents.)
<br>
<br>I say this because there&apos;s already one review here based solely on this. Now onto the game: It&apos;s near flawless in execution the atmosphere is...amazing without a flaw...and the scares are therefore very well designed in that any scare in this little world is a brilliant scare, however there are sections where you are being chased and there is no alternative but to keep running and hope you can crawl or slip through an area your pursuer can&apos;t follow these are the weakest feeling parts of the game...they happen a bit to regularly and can&apos;t help but feel heavily scripted even if brilliantly so (an enemy has a set pattern of behaviors and they design a small section built around this, with very planned exits)
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve also heard tell it&apos;s rather short, which doesn&apos;t surprise me as mentioned every inch was designed with care (sometimes to it&apos;s detriment again as mentioned) but for the price it&apos;s still easily worth it.
<br>
<br>I very much look forward to see&apos;ing more from these dev&apos;s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3482323">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics are amazing, the enemies  NPCs are incredibly detailed and look fantastic. I wish there was more to find than journals and batteries. I wish you had to maintain your health as well. MINOR SPOILER: Enemies in this game do not disappear, like they do in Amnesia. This is a great plus for Outlast, but since you have no health bar and you regain health automatically, there isn&apos;t much risk trying to sneak by an enemy.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m gonna hope for some REALLY lengthy DLC to save this game. While I do not like it, I would spend a few more euro to get more of this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3501194">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I can&apos;t play this game in a dark room by myself for more then 10 minutes at a time. Even though I feel scared and afraid there is a immense feeling of adrenaline and excitement that I get from playing the game. There are so many other games that try to get that feeling and fail. The way the levels are designed make the player afraid that every corner you turn and every door you open holds a surprise or something even more disturbing. The story feels like it could be based in real life and the documents you find add even more depth and detail to the background of the asylum. I have played games like F.E.A.R, Resident Evil, Dead Space 1 and 2 and I watch Walking Dead and this game blows all of those out of the water.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3645249">Expand</a></span>

<br>Seen a guy streaming this on Twitch and knew after 5 minutes that I had to have it! From the get go its a enjoyable game, plenty of gore it also has that stealth feel to it you can run after being seen but if your smart you can stealth your way past aggressive enemies, which I enjoy in my games Eg. Deux Ex, Hitman. I suppose its best compared to Amnesia as that&apos;s the closest game I&apos;ve played that matches this.
<br>
<br>Made me jump a fun times, game is creepy and eerie through most of the journey, I wouldn&apos;t call it scary in particular, just creepy a bit gross at times and got a good few jumps in, I don&apos;t scare easily or jump for that matter and at times the game caught me completely off guard. I found the dialogue from the pair of characters you&apos;ll meet early on in the game quite disturbing and fantastic! There appearance also creeps you out haha.
<br>
<br>Game is difficult to an degree, doesn&apos;t have assisted waypoints like a lot of games these days so you have to actually look around for yourself and figure things out. Your also unarmed and cant fight back so its about your wit cunning, running and hiding! Incase anyone wonders, you can hide in lockers and usually the A.I will seemingly pick the one your not in, they can pick the one you are in, it happened to me a few times, so I guess its random luck if they find you.
<br>
<br>Game length &amp; immersion, game length is good for a cheap game and longer than every AAA on the market these days, I don&apos;t know exactly how many hours I put in but I think it was in the 4-6 hours region maybe longer, I was looking everywhere and very rarely going directly to the next part of the story unless forced there by a huge guy chasing me haha, immersion wise the game does a very good job at keeping you immersed in the game, the only thing that shattered this for me was the sudden change to a sci-fi action game at the end.
<br>
<br>Graphics are crisp and nice, the character models are well done, I didn&apos;t encounter any bugs during my play through (big plus).
<br>
<br>Voice acting and sound effects are pretty good, the antagonist is a silent one, he writes some thoughts down on a notepad at times but doesn&apos;t have a voice, the intense breathing when he&apos;s terrified is fantastic and quivery sound coming out to show he&apos;s scared, very good mood setter. There&apos;s a little &apos;easter egg&apos; I suppose that is taken from The Blair Witch Project which I did find quite enjoyable.
<br>
<br>Plenty of documents and recordings to do to get new &apos;notes&apos; from your character to read to explain how he&apos;s feeling, a.k.a easter eggs.
<br>
<br>All in all it wasn&apos;t a bad overall gaming experience.
<br>
<br>Negatives -
<br>
<br>Storyline is very generic, revolves around the typical stuff you expect, some Nazi experiment from 194X has been adopted in modern times with a twist and its all gone to sh**. I&apos;d have liked to have seen a more creative story rather than the same old stuff, the setting (an asylum) is also very generic but I felt it was a pretty good setting for what the game has.
<br>
<br>Some of the chase scenes become predictable, music begins when the big guy who hunts you is near by even before you see him, they really should have had no music at all till he actually spots you, that way you&apos;d get more of a surprise from bumping into him and a better atmosphere creation from the music while your running, the music doesn&apos;t start on 2 occasions, every other time it did.
<br>
<br>Mechanics, its an Indie developed game so I don&apos;t expect stellar mechanics especially for &#xA3;15 the A.I follows a rule set of following a certain path dependent on the location (room your hiding in) once you see it a few times you&apos;ll probably realize how to avoid those enemies. It didn&apos;t take away from the gaming experience for me but I can see why some people not like the predictability.
<br>
<br>Game drops off near the end, it goes from being a horror style game then at the end it becomes more like an sci-fi action game for the last 20 minutes, it doesn&apos;t take away from the whole game experience but I felt it was a poor way to end it on.
<br>
<br>Linear as hell, you can only take one path to the next place all other rooms and ways are just there for looks, some may contain easter eggs or battery&apos;s but the actual path you take to the end is predetermined and you cant take an alternate path.
<br>
<br>The ending is dreadful, it really undersells the game, you&apos;ll have to play it to understand, I had a really good time with the game till the last 20 minutes and the ending it gives is a horrible way to finish it.
<br>
<br>---------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>Overall I did enjoy the game a lot it gave me some jumps made me feel creeped out and immersed me for hours, I advise playing this game in the dead of the night in the dark. Its an indie game and a very good one at that it has its problems but its cheap price tag and good quality&apos;s outweigh those. I give it a 8/10 and look forward to a Sequel or another title of similar genre by Red Barrel!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3496161">Expand</a></span>

Even if you look past the walking cliche of a plot: a cynical journalist (cliche) uncovering the secrets (cliche) of an abandoned (cliche) insane asylum (big whopping cliche) where some German scientists performed questionable experiments (cliche-a palooza). Seriously even if you could look past that you couldn&apos;t look past the biggest flaw this game has: that not one part of this game hasn&apos;t been done before by previous games far superior to this one. Lets start with its much touted camera lens view. Other than the fact that its a video recorder it&apos;s blatantly obvious this has been done before in the fatal frame series. But then there&apos;s the battery life system of the camera itself. It&apos;s suspiciously similar to the lantern and oil used in amnesia in that your ability to see through the dark of the game is a limited resource. But the key difference between the two is that amnesia&apos;s was more tense and involved and ergo better in the context of a horror game. Allow me to explain:
<br>In amnesia while the lantern allowed you to actually see, the oil burned quickly and oil cans were somewhat sparse and sometime easy to overlook so you had to use it strategically because it made you easy to spot while being used and when it wasn&apos;t being used your sanity would deplete causing all sorts of difficulties making gameplay more tense.
<br>Now in outlast by comparison your night does admittedly eat through batteries quickly, however batteries are plentiful enough that in my playthroughs I never once came close to running out. Also, unlike amnesia, you don&apos;t have a sanity meter to keep watch of and your night vision does not attract enemies, so there isn&apos;t a whole lot of reason to not use night vision as much as possible. In summary outlast clearly has a knock off amnesia light mechanic and it&apos;s inferior to the original
<br>Come to think of it, a number of different cues seem to be taken from amnesia. The protagonists memos to himself, the collectible documents, the hiding places. Alot of it just seems copied. But amnesia clearly wasn&apos;t the only game the developers were copying. The deformed psychopaths throughout the game have a silent hill deformed monster feel to them. The big ugly mother who chases you around at several points even reminded me a little of pyramid head minus the helmet. And the crazed doctor who cuts your  fingers off gave me more than one Clock-tower flashback. The game simply feels stitched together from its superior peers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outlast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3608936">Expand</a></span>
