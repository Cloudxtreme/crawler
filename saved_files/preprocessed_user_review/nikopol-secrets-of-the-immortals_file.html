The plot and storyline are intriguing and engaging, set in a dystopian science fiction far future. Even the voice acting is okay. Sadly, those are the only positive aspects of Nikopol. In this point and click adventure game, you should expect terrible pixel hunting, as well as puzzles that are quite unintuitive and will certainly require hints or walkthroughs to make any progress. Worst of all, is that if you do not pick up certain items in various rooms in order, or perform certain actions in a specific order, you will need to reload a saved game and do many portions of the game over. The focus on tiny details and prearranged orderly functions make for an irrational, boring, and forcefully repetitive experience that was not even present during the late 80s and early 90s of the genre&apos;s era. In order for you to understand which action takes precedence over others requires a walkthrough. It is a must. There is no other way to approach this game whatsoever. For the developers to think that this game design decision was appropriate is an absolute disaster, and should serve as an example for others to never follow. In addition, there are several events that are timed, and require the player to perform some actions quickly, and if they do not possess certain items that were left behind in other rooms, there is simply nothing that could be done except for reloading and starting over. The save system is another serious stumbling block. You are not allowed to quick save. Instead, &quot;saving&quot; only saves your last checkpoint. This means that because of how flawed the overall design is, if you miss an item in a previous room, and find yourself farther in an area without it, there is nothing you could do except restart from the last checkpoint. You cannot walk back and correct the problem. You must restart and do it all over again. Needless to say, the only way you will know that you are stuck besides not being able to execute any useful actions for a prolonged period of time, is a walkthrough. There are no other options. The game fails horribly at providing hints, or doing anything remotely resembling intuitive reasoning. It is a truly broken point and click adventure game that has no place in the genre, or in the professional field of game design. Nikopol is an enormous waste of beautiful artwork and a riveting storyline. It is a technical and developmental malpractice of the worst kind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nikopol-secrets-of-the-immortals/user-reviews?user_review_id=2426701">Expand</a></span>

Of course this game will become boring fast if you even can&apos;t solve a simple puzzle. Did the reviewers even solve the first chapter? Or did they just skip it and write a bad review because they couldn&apos;t solve any of puzzles?</span>
