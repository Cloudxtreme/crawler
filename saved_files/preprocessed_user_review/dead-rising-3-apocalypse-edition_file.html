<br>This game isn&apos;t poorly optimized, it is not optimized AT ALL.
<br>
<br>I feel like I&apos;ve been robbed by both Capcom for their shoddy work, and Steam, who have made it abundantly clear that no refunds will be issued.
<br>
<br>My only hope is that with enough customer outrage, within the next month or two this garbage will be patched up enough to make the game at least playable.

<br>
<br>- While the performance, frame drops, crashes, and inconsistent framerate, by the second, are HUGE problems, you also have to note that the game is LOCKED at 30FPS (unless you manually go through the directory files - which then, usually ends in MORE crashes and issues than before). So yeah, 30 frames, as if this was still CURRENTLY running on a console. You might even learn to appreciate the moments when you are playing at 30 frames, because you&apos;d be lucky to reach THAT goal (for more than 10-30 seconds), as just about every visual aspect of the game will kick you down into the 20&apos;s (if you&apos;re lucky), even if it&apos;s a less demanding area (few-no zombies on-screen).
<br>- I&apos;m running a GTX 770, i5-4670k putting out 3.8ghz, 16gb DDR3 RAM, and a unfragmented and clean 2TB HDD with more than 25% free. So, by all means, my rig should be shredding this game like a stuffed animal, yet it still feels totally inconsistent.
<br>- Let me also note, that a PC-Gaming source, running SLI TITAN video cards, said that even he couldn&apos;t maintain a 30fps framerate, let alone 60fps if the game is unlocked. That doesn&apos;t mean this game is just super technical and demanding... That means the game is straight up BROKEN at the moment. Myself and double Titan-bro are using the same graphical settings, yet we both get the SAME weak framerate.
<br>-The game itself seems extremely fun, creative, and compelling in most departments, so I definitely recommend playing the game... Just DO NOT play this Port until the game has been patched a few times and fresh drivers, made specifically because of this hog, are released.
<br>-I encourage you to let Capcom know how you feel about this kind of thing, on their forums, because if you just don&apos;t buy the game, and say nothing, those greedy rats will probably just see the low sales&apos; projections and decide to move on, rather than fix the game. We need to hammer the point home, that they only sold as many copies as they have, because of loyalty (brand or IP), and our trust that our money might bring us an actual product. If their sales are low, it is almost completely their fault. Word of mouth spread, that the port is a Category 5 Catastrophe, thus, many people are holding off.
<br>
<br>Potential Customers - Don&apos;t forget about this game! When it works it&apos;s VERY enjoyable, but wait and/or insist that the developers fix the mess that they have willingly sold, as a &quot;finished&quot; product.
<br>
<br>CAPCOM - Please fix your game. If you do not, you may never have the support of many PC gamers ever again.
<br>
<br>Have a nice day!(?)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4483120">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve got it maxed out at 1440p and it still looks old. The release on XBox One must have looked very dated.
<br>
<br>With that out of the way.......I&apos;m not really one for these kind of games; once I&apos;ve had a laugh at the crazy weapons, and gruesome (second) deaths dealt out by said weapons, I&apos;m overwhelmed by the repetitive grind of it all.

<br>
<br>Switching to Intel HD works, but fps reaches an absolute rock-bottom godawful performance, not even worth playing I&apos;m afraid.
<br>
<br>The GTX 780M is capable of playing my giant library of games really well, even outperforming my PlayStation 4 with Watch_dogs, so I know I&apos;m battle ready for this game.... please fix it, okay? :D
<br>
<br>Furthermore: I did hook up my Wacom Cinqtiq with HDMI cable and it DID switch automatically to GPU only, but it crashes just as hard...
<br>
<br>So again, please fix! I was pretty stoked playing this game, but right about now all I got for my money is 48 minutes of absolute loading-terror...
<br>
<br>Lastly: saying &apos;&apos;While laptop graphics fall outside of the minimum spec requirements and aren&#x2019;t officially supported&apos;&apos;, doesn&apos;t help, because you&apos;re effectively dissing all gamers with MSI&apos;s, Alienware&apos;s and ASUS ROG laptops, who pay a pretty hefty fee so they can game anywhere they want! :D Just wanted to let you know that :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4459893">Expand</a></span>

I pre-ordered DR3 on the first day it was available even before Capcom added the free DLC to the pre-order. Too bad the PC port for DR3 is complete and utter **** This is probably the second worst PC port in history only second to GTA IV. This is ridiculous. The game crashes after changing the graphics to low, and quitting, and it can barely play up to 30 fps at all on any machine. Go buy the console version, unless you want an unstable ****ty port.
<br>
<br>EDIT: Even after more frustration, I&apos;ve run tinto MORE BUGS. Crashes to desktop, freezes to my PC, indefinitely stuck on the logo screen for eternity. This game needs a patch FAST. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It is still too buggy, ESPECIALLY FOR NVIDIA users! Wait until you hear more about this because you waste your money. Expect less than 30 fps for only a couple zombies, and once again crashes every 5 minutes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4454225">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For people having issues with framerate, for some reason that is impossibile to understand, Capcom added a system to cap your framerate to 30fps. And guess what? It will consume your system specs to do so. To solve this problem, open your game folder (the folder where the game&apos;s executable .exe is stored, usually is at C:Program Files (x86)SteamSteamAppscommon), create a text file, write on it  &#x201C;gmpcr_unlock_frame_rate = True&#x201D; (no quotes), save, and rename your .txt file as user.ini (make sure you save the file as .ini), and it&apos;s done. No more stupid framerate cap, and will improve the usage of system resources. I have an i3 2100, 8gb ram ddr3, and a GTX750ti, and I can run this game with almost everything maxed out at 45fps.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4461211">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Capcom&apos;s QA team honestly believes this game is in a fully functional state because it ran fine on 2 test machines. If you&apos;re going to port to PC, either do it right or don&apos;t do it at all.
<br>

Carnage is great but it needs something more to hold it together (like some kind of not dreadful story or characters), otherwise it gets old fast. After about the 5,000th zombie that I ran over, I caught myself getting distracted by the TV. Not a good sign. As for performance, this is the most demanding game I&apos;ve installed on my PC. I suppose you could get 30 fps on a fairly good system if you tone it down a bit, but if you max it and unlock the framerate you&apos;re most likely gonna have a problem. On my 4790K, 16 GB Ram and a 780 Ti, the framerate was inconsistent. It fluctuated constantly between 50 and 70, although it usually stayed above 60. That&apos;s fine, but the game does not look anywhere near as good as it should for it to drop to 50 on a 2500$ system. It&apos;s a marginal improvement on something like Just Cause 2, and that game runs at 4 times the framerate. So, in conclusion, if you have a good PC, and if mowing through thousands of zombies for dozens of hours is enough to keep your attention, I recommend this game. Otherwise, I suggest you wait for some patches and a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4453305">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The zombies, though numerous and scary looking, are buggy, glitching through walls, like in the previous title&#x2013; mind you I played Dead Rising 2 in the upcoming days of the release of this game, and it was still a buggy, unfinished mess. But surely this time it will be different!
<br>
<br>Having the ability to craft weapons everywhere seems well placed in a game such as Dead Rising, and is definitely a step in the right direction. No need to complicate the game any further, mashing buttons is hard enough as is. It is too bad, however, that when you find a blueprint, there are always matching items for the recipe right next to you. In fact, it seems that most every weapon that you find is near another weapon that you can combine with it! Awesome, right? No - it takes away the very experience of the craft weapons, making them as mundane as if you were to simply pick up a regular one. But I guess that you do get half a cutscene to watch, every time you craft a weapon. And there is a new attribute system. Neat!
<br>
<br>Yes, surely Capcom cares about delivering a good product to us, the consumers. This cannot be yet another example of unoriginal, unpolished, uninteresting undead action garbage. Did someone say day-one DLC? More DLCS to come? We should all purchase this game and its coming extra material; we should have even pre-purchased it, despite pirates having access to it days before us. It&#x2019;s not like we have anything better to spend our money on, right?
<br>
<br>TLDR:
<br>
<br>Dead Rising 3 is not worth buying, just like Dead Rising 2 was never worth buying. Do not let yourselves be convinced by expensive trailers and paid off reviewers &#x2013; this game is, I am sorry to say, just another example of overhyped trash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4457977">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>game-wise, DR3, is fun and incorporates many RPG-elements incorporated into its levelling up and attributes system (although, there really isn&apos;t any need to &apos;focus&apos; or make a &apos;build&apos; per se as your character will eventually get enough points to max just about everything).
<br>
<br>the &apos;time-limit&apos; feature of game play which received such mixed reviews in DR2 is also back. for those who didnt play DR2, this means that you have a set amount of (in game) time to complete the game. while it adds a certain measure of immersion to the game (as some events are obviously of the &apos;time is of the essence&apos; variety), it also detracts from the whole open-world exploration concept (which DR3 achieves a bit better than DR2). for some like me who like to spend excessive time exploring the game world and just indulge in mindless ganking, it does take away from the enjoyment somewhat.
<br>
<br>the big disappointment was that the developers did not add in a feature to toggle the &apos;time-limit&apos; game play (as they hinted that they might). that said, the time limit feature may in some instances promote multiple playthroughs (of certain chapters if not the game). it is possibly why in single player mode, you are allowed to restart the game at any point and retain all levels, attributes and recipes.
<br>
<br>i have not yet tried the multiplayer game play and thus have not commented on it. although i can imagine that if you find a good partner/friend to play with, this game can be good co-op fun.
<br>
<br>tl;dr - a solid game for fans of the series and good chance for those who have never played a DR game to get into the franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4452770">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is fun no doubt but the action can be extremely repetitive and shallow. The narrative is extremely weak and the characters are pretty uninspiring. Battling hoards of zombies in an arcade-fashion can seem mildly satisfying particularly with the customisable and rather daft weapons but this eventually becomes a chore. With no story-driven backdrop to engross you; it just gets a bit tiresome and tedious very quickly to justify a price of &#xA3;40.
<br>
<br>Credit to Capcom though; they have fixed early issues with the game very quickly and the game does run impressively considering the waves of action happening on-screen. There just isn&apos;t enough here sadly to justify the price and against some of the other titles available on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4456339">Expand</a></span>

Killing zombies with a variety of weapons is just fun. Story line is good to, only issue is how short the game is but I&apos;m cool with that, much longer and it would have seemed to be dragged out. Good fun!</span>

<br>WRONG!! Game crashes every 10 minutes or so. I cant hear the voices of any character, my resolution isnt even supported (it&apos;s a normal 16:10 resolution) and the fps actually drop below 30 FPS whenever it feels like (I have WAY more specs than recommended). The game is blurry even with everithing maxed out and since I cant play it for more than 10 minutes without it crashing (fairly common problem as stated by dozens of post in the forums) I cant even tell anything about the story. Gameplay is ok, except for some clunky fighting mechanics (specially when you try to do a hard hit but end up stomping the floor because both are the same button) and HORRIBLE mouse acceleration that makes navigating (Pathetic FOV contributes too) and specially aiming authentic chores.
<br>
<br>So, another cash grab from capcom, another 0 in my list.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4491936">Expand</a></span>

Quick and heavy melee strikes, throwing objects and the guns are pretty fun when/if you find them.
<br>The graphics are not bad for a PC port, unfortunately consoles are going to continue to drive the bar down when it comes to gameplay, but I have to say that the developers gave really good key bind options and customization for PC players.
<br>I dont mind the 30 FPS but some people may.  I think the graphics matured from DR2 to DR3 meaning the Zombies are not so silly this time around and the sense of them actually being dangerous is very present as I play.
<br>The leveling system is flushed out and provides a solid reason to keep playing.
<br>I have no tried the 4 DLC missions so far but I think this is a solid purchase if you like Zombies and/or Progression mechanics.
<br>The timed events of Dead Rising series is always a turn-off and that is why it did not get an 8.  It loses a port for not taking advantage of PC platform and loses a combined total of 3 points for simplicity over quality approach.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4454261">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ Clothes customization are fun to watch on the cut scenes

Ed &#xE8; fatto benissimo, i dialoghi sono perfetti. E a questo va dato grande riconoscimento alla Capcom, perch&#xE9; il gioco &#xE8; molto godibile con parlato in italiano, mentre i giochi Capcom sono da sempre stati solo in inglese con sottotitoli in italiano e questo faceva perdere loro molto fascino. Per il resto posso dire che questa conversione &#xE8; molto riuscita. Non date retta a chi dice che il gioco &#xE8; fermo a 30 fps, non &#xE8; affatto vero. Io ho uno schermo a 120hz e dal menu delle opzioni grafiche di Dead Rising 3 riesco a scegliere tranquillamente 1920x1080x120Hz. e il gioco &#xE8; fluidissimo. Graficamente ci sono alcune cose fatte molto bene: ad esempio i personaggi principali e gli zombie, gli effetti di luce, e anche l&apos;ambiente circostante. Si avvicina molto come qualit&#xE0; all&apos;ottima grafica di Watch Dogs, ed &#xE8; senz&apos;altro il miglior gioco Capcom uscito finora dal punto di vista grafico. Questo non significa che graficamente &#xE8; perfetto, ha i suoi difetti e alcune cose hanno un dettaglio non molto alto per&#xF2; nel complesso il lavoro fatto &#xE8; ottimo e l&apos;impressione &#xE8; davvero quella di un gioco next-gen graficamente. Per quanto riguarda la giocabilit&#xE0; &#xE8; divertentissimo, con vari modi di combinare oggetti e armi e crearne di altri, vari modi di uccidere gli zombie, la possibilit&#xE0; di guidare veicoli e l&apos;enorme ambiente di gioco. E&apos; un p&#xF2; ripetitivo come gioco, perch&#xE9; alla fine devi solo splattare zombie, ma c&apos;&#xE8; anche un p&#xF2; di suspence e di panico qua e l&#xE0; mentre si prosegue. In conclusione, io credo che l&apos;8 &#xE8; meritatissimo per questo gioco. Davvero un lavoro ben fatto questa volta Capcom. E&apos; ripeto ancora, il fatto di avere anche i dialoghi in italiano questa volta d&#xE0; un valore in pi&#xF9; al gioco e lo rende molto pi&#xF9; coinvolgente e curato.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4456284">Expand</a></span>

I played from start to finish with only 1 crash (a driver crash, though I&apos;m not using the suggested nvidia drivers). My one gripe is that the aiming and inventory will occasionally flicker off and on when held down, which can make aiming and weapon combining near impossible at times.  As for the game, i found it very enjoyable having quite liked Dead Rising 2 (once I enabled a trainer to slow the timer, something I didn&apos;t feel necessary to do in DR3).  The main character starts out a bit of a wimp, but he slowly grows into the role of the hero by the end of the game..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4511130">Expand</a></span>

A majority of buildings are open and explorable as well, and the city is diverse with interesting sites galore. Crafting can be done on-the-fly, which will surely save you from time to time.

Finished it in 20 hrs on PC doing all the &quot;named&quot; side missions, not all the random challenge/PP trial stuff. 20,000 dead zombies lie behind me, and it was fun while it lasted. Not a great challenge. But worth the experience of creating a devastating range of crazy combo weapons. Yes the kills look amazing, and the controls are good enough if you plug in a 360 controller, but the overall experience wasn&apos;t that compelling, and it&apos;s basically more of the same compared to Dead Rising 2, but just a lot less challenging, and therefore it feels too easy and not as scary. I guess you&apos;d call Dead Rising 3 the entree, and Dead Rising 2 is your main course. Perhaps Nightmare mode/Speed Run challenge will fix things, but Normal is definitely a tad easy. None of the psychos killed me, and I think I died twice in the whole game. One death was when showing the game off to a mate to show off the awesome combo vehicles and driving around on the Rollerhawg (or whatever it&apos;s called) with half a bar of HP and forgetting that zombies can attack you on motorbikes. Game ran fine with .ini FPS unlocked on 4770K, 770GTX.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4475277">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay and graphics and all that is awesome. Story is meh and voice acting is good. There are tons and I mean TONS of combo weapons and side activities to do, but since this game is terribly optimized, it&apos;s not a 10, but more of a 7. I got this game for 16&#x20AC; instead of 45&#x20AC;, so to me it wasn&apos;t that big of a loss, but I wouldn&apos;t recommend paying 45&#x20AC; for this. I wouldn&apos;t pay anything more than 20&#x20AC; for it.

<br>
<br>The rest of the package is abysmal. The netcode of online play is the worst of it&apos;s kind. One out of twenty games i actually managed to join someone online without losing connection, host booting me out instantly or me getting stuck in to the &quot;can&apos;t spawn now... please wait...&quot; screen.
<br>
<br>The game, is so heavy. And suffers from serious memory leaks. The loading times are unnaturally long. The performance is just outright horrible. The Survivor AI is the worst you will ever encounter. 99% of the time they are purposely getting killed or not being able to open a door of a car, while zombies are gnawing on their ass.
<br>
<br>I enjoyed the game for 30 hours, but after that, there&apos;s really not much replay value at all, unless if you just want to collect some statues and few missing blueprints. It&apos;s great that we now have a co-op, but why the hell don&apos;t we still have an zombie slaying sandbox WITHOUT timelimits after you&apos;ve finished the game. Is it too much to ask to have something that is not limited by time for a chance?
<br>
<br>Last, but not the least. The controls even on a controller are really finicky. Sometimes i spent a minute trying to pick up something, instead picking up stuff from the ground i wanted. This was really frustrating at times.
<br>
<br>+ Zombie slaying, so much fun, and there&apos;s more of them than you&apos;ve ever seen.
<br>+ A lot of weapons
<br>+ Combo vehicles are fun, but get destroyed way too quick.
<br>+ Plenty of collectables
<br>
<br>- Everything else about the game.
<br>- Coding is horrible.
<br>- NPC AI is the worst i&apos;ve seen
<br>- Ridicilous performance hog
<br>- Memory leaks
<br>- Really bad controls, even when using xbox controller
<br>- The network code... Never quite seen anything as bad as this.
<br>- Again, you are running against the clock constantly, which is not fun.
<br>- No replayability. You finish the campaign, it&apos;s adios.
<br>- DLC&apos;s... Meh... no co-op, no interest.
<br>
<br>In overall the zombie slaying is so much fun that it overshadows the long list of negatives, so i&apos;ll give this game 7/10. If the zombie slaying was less fun, this game would be an 4/10 title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4481858">Expand</a></span>

From the button mashing kings of Capcom comes the latest zombie slashing fun fest. (Honestly it leaves me puzzled as to why people are complaining about a port, when Capcom have always been console orientated.) This game isn&apos;t story or character driven, although it has a &quot;keeps you interested&quot; plot and believable in its world context. But this game is driven by a more base need; the amount of gratuitous blood and gore wrapped in a bow of fun.
<br>The highlights are great new ideas such as combo vehicles, being able to mod on the fly without a work bench, and no longer having to baby sit survivors as much. Three simple improvements on the previous games make this an outstanding game to play.
<br>The amount of fun I have had with roadhawg combo vehicle, a cross between a steam roller and motor bike, has left me with the real sensation of wind in my hair along with zombie guts. I could spend days lawn mown-ing zombies and still not get bored. This vehicle alone makes the whole game worth it, but there are many more vehicles with some great features.
<br>Being able to build combo weapons has become easier and makes me actively find and create these joyful monstrosities. In previous games you would get a new blueprint but then spend half your time finding the components, going to a work bench and constructing them, all within a very strict game time limit. In DR3 you find a blue print, and the components, all in the same spot and because you are now able to construct on the fly it means no more waiting. Now you can try the weapon and makes you more likely to experiment and play, which is what this game should be all about.
<br>In the previous games I use to hate survivors, partly because they would not survive. Often getting swarmed and forcing me to slash my way back to them. Then if you mistakenly hit them a couple of times they would turn on you, suddenly becoming immune to the horde and would follow you for miles. It became such a chore and forced me to enjoy kill them outright, or watch them be torn apart by the horde, or (call me sexist) rescue them if they were a fairly attractive female. Thankfully in DR3 the survivors are more clued in. You have two different survivor types, the ones that follow you and survivors that need help. The survivors that call for help are normally trapped by a surrounding horde of zombies which you need to clear up. After that they then run off and despawn which makes the whole survivor experience so much easier less of a hassle. Well I&apos;d like to think I would help my fellow man when the zombie apocalypse comes, but I am not going to baby sit, unless you are an attractive female! :)
<br>DR3&apos;s main issue is the high GPU specs for the juicy graphics. However it&apos;s rarely worth it as sadly most of the time you are travelling too fast to notice the quality of graphics. I never liked the 7 day time limit as it only serves to get you to the end as quickly as possible and worse stops you from truly exploring the world. This is such a shame!
<br>Minor game issues such as garages if you go into the menu the world is not paused. Zombies can and will attack you if you&apos;re not fast enough. Though building combo vehicles and weapons on the fly does momentarily pause zombies giving you a quick breather. Survivors that join you are still annoying and still need attention, just not as much. Some explanations are vague and can leave you wondering how to do something or interact with an object. The use of the middle button is a curse as on most PC mice, this is the scroll wheel and can often scroll through your weapons at the same time. Also sometimes a weapons zoom is the right mouse click and other weapons it will be the middle button which can be annoying. Some of the combo weapons are so effective that it can make the game extremely easy at times; I personally use the shockblaster for any &quot;Psychopaths&quot; as it makes short work of them. But of course the challenge is making sure you have the right tool at the right time.
<br>Finally bugs and issues, which seem to be highly problematic, thank fully for me I experienced none of them. But yet this would be a deal breaker and I would come here with a totally different outlook, so I can understand people&apos;s frustration. Yet it seems almost unfair to judge a game when you can&apos;t or haven&apos;t played it. Still this is a developers issue which I hope they resolve and quickly.
<br>All in all a worthy game of purchase just wait for updates and fixes if you&apos;re unsure. But sadly it&apos;s almost as if Capcom wants you to rush your way through the game, rather than saviour its open world graphical goodness. Also you might be interested to know that the game works on HD6970 2GB, of course with settings lowered to counter stuttering.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4482743">Expand</a></span>

My biggest complaint is the fact there is one button that serves multiple functions and targeting objects is a chore; so sometimes I accidentally pick up the wrong object, or accidentally give a companion my weapon, when all I really wanted to do was jump in my car.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4542167">Expand</a></span>

Perhaps it was because of the plot that I found captivating. Personally, I consider the story to be the most important part of most games (apart from racing games) and although Dead Rising 3 isn&apos;t original in story-telling it reminds me of GTA with its cut-scenes - I enjoyed them a lot. The other reason I liked the game was because it wasn&apos;t really scary - it was humorous - I could compare my overall feeling to the one I had watching Inglorious Bastards by Tarantino.
<br>Though at first I didn&apos;t like the countdown to the bomb detonation which was going to destroy the whole city I completed the game with some of the side missions 1 day before &quot;day zero&quot;.
<br>If I were to change anything about the game I would alter the way you have to go around the map. Running (as there is no walking) or driving through hordes of zombies and killing them gets boring after some time (even though there are lots of tools you can use and combine to create something new). I wish there were some helicopters to fly around - especially at the end of the game, when the number of zombies are overwhelming. Roadblocks spoil the fun of driving. You have to constantly open your big map (by pressing TAB) to check how to get to the destination as there are no gps-like directions on your mini map.
<br>When it comes to performance I managed to play at max settings with i7 3770k, GTX 760 4GB OC and 16GB of RAM @ Full HD, but the framerate oscillated between 15 and 60fps - usually about 35fps. The reason I played at max. settings was that I didn&apos;t see much difference in performance after lowering the settings but there was a huge difference in quality of the picture.
<br>All in all, if it wasn&apos;t for the performance my score would have been 8/10 as there were hardly any &quot;deal-breaking&quot; elements that modern games are full of recently. Try it if you like GTA and zombie games, but you don&apos;t like being afraid. Two more things: the game can be saved at any time (except for bosses fights) and it doesn&apos;t support nVidia 3D Vision.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4511643">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve seen the complaints about the quality of the port, and they are valid. My PC is quite powerful, and still had the occasional stutter.
<br>
<br>That said, these are the only problems I found with Dead Rising 3. It&apos;s intensely fun, and the Untold Stories DLC was also great. For me, the thing I love about the Dead Rising games is the pacing. Skip the side missions and focus on the main story, and you can finish it in 5 hours. However, nothing about the side missions or collectibles seems overly drawn out or boring to me, like it does in most games. I don&apos;t feel punished for hunting down Frank statues or blueprints.
<br>
<br>Finding the weapons that suit your play style has also been fun. The story is fine, with a few nifty twists along the way, but it&apos;s the gameplay that allows me to spend hours just killing zombies and collecting things on my way to the Left 100,004 Dead achievement. As an added bonus, there aren&apos;t BS achievements that force me to play co-op online with random people, save the lone achievement that requires me to join a co-op game. Drop in on someone, and then leave, and you&apos;re good if you&apos;re an achievement chaser like I am.
<br>
<br>Simply put, Dead Rising never feels forced and I never feel like I&apos;m being punished when I play it. The technical issues keep it from getting a 10, but that&apos;s the only reason. If you have a slightly-aged PC, it will probably not be a good experience for you, which is regrettable. You&apos;re missing out on a really fun game through no fault of your own.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4573587">Expand</a></span>

(Though, would have honestly loved to have seen one of the extreme 70+ %-off sales!)
<br>
<br>Now that I finally have the game, I&apos;m not sure why there were so many harsh reviews... perhaps there&apos;s been decent patching done since to iron out a few of the hiccups. But on a slightly-aged system, albeit a six-core, this game runs pretty great on mostly high settings, some customized to be more &quot;medium&quot;-ish. Every once in a great while, like very rarily, there might be a subtle hiccup and that&apos;s it, while still looking breath-taking and beautiful; although, the sound tends to stutter from time to time, and can&apos;t seem to find the propper options to iron this out, even after tinkering under the hood with sound-card settings directly in the OS. I also tried each of the quality ranges (720p, etc)... granted, sure, it looks crispier on the higher settings like &quot;full&quot;, but I just run it on 720p and the difference isn&apos;t to over the top.
<br>
<br>There are some tiny issues I&apos;ve noticed, but moreso that just go to point out that it&apos;s a console-port... such as when you alt-tab out of the game, the music keeps going and you have to turn off your speakers when multi-tasking... be nice if there was a patch or fix for this. Would also be nice to see a true sandbox mode as well (there is an &quot;external work-around&quot; for this, but I&apos;d REALLY rather not have to go down that route if possible)... before buying the game, certain reviews had led me to believe that there&apos;d be plenty of time for everything in plain &quot;story mode&quot;, and since it seems the time-elapse is based on checkpoints in the story I believe, technically there is... but still semi-stinks to feel that there will be looming doom after a certain period of time that could blow up in your face (pun mildly intended). Also, with the size of the city, which for the record is great... all the many side quests (which are also great)... sometimes there&apos;s an itching feel of doing lots of busy-work, or having to focus on everybody else more than your own character... which is a tad ironic considering it is a zombie apocalypse after all. xD
<br>
<br>Only real reason I could see for the over critical-nature of most reviews, is probably because Dead Rising 3 remained a Microsoft-exclusive... would really have loved to see how this game runs on a PS4 myself... but at least on PC, thank goodness for the power of Linux! ^_^
<br>
<br>PS - Only other minor issue I can think of is how the gamepad/joystick controls are hardcoded and not changeable as far as I can tell. Used to having attack and power attack on the triggers along with the aim functionality... it&apos;s strange using face buttons for attack... of course, it is Capcom; it&apos;s like playing Street Fighter in Zombieland. xD</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7379339">Expand</a></span>

<br>If this game had much richness when it comes to using weapons it would hit 8 in my score book.
<br>Graphics also doesn&apos;t offer anything special. For us who has a decent gaming PC, they are so,so, moderate, bad even some might say.
<br>In Conclusion this game loses it&apos;s charm pretty quickly but for sort period of time it  will offer you hell of a fun. That&apos;s for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4535370">Expand</a></span>

<br>Optimization is terrible and runs poorly on even very high end hardware with few graphics options available to allow you to tweak said terrible performance, although I didn&apos;t encounter too many bugs which is nice.
<br>This game follows the latest trend of releasing poor quality ports of games that should, with comparatively moderate effort to last generation, be ported with ease. But for whatever reason, arguably financial, you end up with weak, buggy and poorly optimized releases. Given the Xbox One runs an x86 processor, AMD GPU and Direct X, it is simply cost cutting and effortless porting that leaves this game running so poorly on PC.
<br>What a shame as it&apos;s actually a pretty enjoyable game overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4674730">Expand</a></span>

Once that&apos;s out of the way it&apos;s a blast, pretty tense moments, pretty rad weapons/cars and difficult but fun boss battles</span>

Despite continued issues with clunky controls, especially the bizarre delay when attempting to sprint after a jump, and console-centric design sensibilities such as the 30fps framelock, Dead Rising 3 is the most convenient title in the series to play by far, I&apos;m willing to bet. The time limit is far more generous, you can build combo weapons anywhere and experience and collectible progress persists across multiple playthroughs and into coop games.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a lot to do and mess around with in Los Perdidos. Tons of weapons to use, solid vehicle controls, and collectibles to find, and of course, silly outfits. The tone of the story is far too serious for the sort of game Dead Rising is, almost like early Saints Row with zombies. The four story add-ons are included in this release but, oddly, not the &quot;Super Turbo&quot; DLC that added four-player coop to the console versions, limiting you to only two-player coop, and only in the main story, not in the addons. Still, its an excellent game for killing time with a friend- I found it more addicting then many games I&apos;ve played in the past few years, and I had fun with it from start to finish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6930708">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is poorly optimized. After all the patches it solved some issues and now is not broken but is not the best experience if you enjoy play games at 60FPS or without pop up texturing.</span>

<br>With a single text line ini I&apos;ve unlocked 60+ FPS mode, and the game run like a charm. I&apos;ve found it quite funny, satisfying and one of the few games I&apos;ve really enjoyed to play in a while, despite all poor reviews out there. Sure, the game has some technical issues ( some pop ups, slow loading times even with a ssd) and in the long run may become a bit boring ( expecially traveling with all those road blocks), but zombie killing was funny and honestly even secondary mission are nice to play, which is not so common.
<br>To me, expecially if you got it at around 16 &#x20AC; as you can see it on sales usually is really worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-3-apocalypse-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7096084">Expand</a></span>
