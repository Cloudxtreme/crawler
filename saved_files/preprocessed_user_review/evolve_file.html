<br>Even EA and Ubisoft are not anywhere near as arrogant as 2K&apos;s CEO when it comes to dealing with their customers. He knows this game has maybe a month worth of life in it before people get bored and that is why they are offering TIME SENSITIVE bonuses that wont be available after 30 days, to ramp up as many sales as possible before they end up having to drop the price to $20 like Titanfall did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4967350">Expand</a></span>

<br>The concept sounds cool, on paper, but in actual practice it can get stale fast. Imagine a competitive shooter where players actively try to avoid each other. Ya. There are ways that players can temporarily  lock the monster down and prevent escape, but many matches still involve copious amounts of just running around.
<br>
<br>Also, as many others have mentioned, the dlc model for this game is kinda horrendous. When the developers need to create complicated
<br>graphs to try to explain their robust DLC model, we have reached a new level of absurdity. I&apos;m still not exactly sure how much you need to pay to get all the current content in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4967597">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Honestly, this is one of the few times you should go out of your way and boycott this game because it&apos;s not just about DRM and privacy (which is still very important), this is about games and their ridiculous DLC costing WAY TOO MUCH going forward (from a selfish perspective, more expensive games means, well, less games I&apos;ll be able to play).
<br>
<br>Sorry but shelling out $100+ for the full game is unacceptable. Stop buying this game before they get away with it and set a precedent in the industry. Don&apos;t buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4963485">Expand</a></span>

<br>So &#xA3;60 for a game that&apos;s not even finished, severely lacking in content, day 1 DLC and even still &#xA3;35 for the &apos;base&apos;(stripped down) version.

Basically i feel that i have to make some clarification of my position after i saw TotalBiscuit&apos;s video about DLCs and Evolve.
<br>So ok, at the moment we have 2 types of DLCs in Evolve: skin packs and unlocks. I&apos;m strongly against both of this types of DLCs. Why? Ok, let&apos;s start with skin packs. I have nothing against em in F2P games. It&apos;s basically &quot;i like this game and want to support developers while look cool so this is an ideal solution&quot;. Yeap, i agree with that. But not in full price games. I don&apos;t get this TB&apos;s argument that &quot;well, some devs have nothing to do in the end of dev circle so they make skins and **** that will be sold to you&quot;. So i miss the point when development circle became my problem. Maybe i&apos;m old or something but i remember times when character skins or additional (secret) characters were unlocks (for some in-game achievements) and absolutely free. And now it&apos;s DLCs! And i must be ok with that? No, thank you. Everyone who said &quot;oh, it&apos;s nothing! It&apos;s just a cosmetic things&quot; miss the point that most of people who disagree with that have. Yes, i can buy it or not, that&apos;s not affect anything. But my point that AAA devs sells you less and less as a &quot;complete game&quot; every year and milk cash from you for thing that were free before. Especially now, after so much AAA titles turn out to be complete disasters.
<br>Now to unlocks. This one is simple. You can&apos;t trust developers with this one. It can be ok and you can unlock everything just by playing a few hours or that can be practically impossible (or require insane amount of time). Again why not to make every option available at the beginning? Oh, some people like this rank progression system and rewards each level? No problem! Make that skins as rewards, not DLCs. Everyone is happy. Except devs not concern with our happiness any more. Just about how to get into our wallets.
<br>You see, now devs take away things from you. One thing at each step, PRing that hard as some good thing. And i see some people are very happy with that. Like mod support. Sure there is no mod suport in Evolve. Otherwise who will ever buy your DLC if you can simply mod all that skins/characters/monsters into the game? And let me remind you that a lot of great games appear as mods: Team Fortress, DotA, Counter-Strike, Natural Selection, DayZ, The Stanley Parable and so on. A lot just stayed as mods. Now we more and more denied of that.
<br>And this glorified &quot;12 unique hunters&quot;? Oh come on, this is a skip plus locked set of weapons. Let&apos;s see, in Battlefield 4 (game with it&apos;s own huge problems) there are over 100 weapons to choose from and over 40 gadgets. Combine that with various attachments and scopes. Can you imagine how much &quot;unique hunters&quot; can you possibly make out of that? Can&apos;t you see that this &quot;12 unique hunters&quot; actually is just &quot;less customization&quot;? Why are some of players are so happy about that? I can&apos;t get it.
<br>In one point i agree with TB totally. Yes, Evolve is mediocre product and deserve 5 or 6 out of 10 if not all this DLCs/pre-order **** Just so happen due to poor PR and/or marketing that Evolve make it boil out for a lot of people. So no, not only Evolve is guilty in that regard but yes, i believe did a lot of things wrong (tons of day one DLCs, pricing of the game and DLCs and etc). So i believe it&apos;s ok to rate this game at 0 to send a message to game developers/publishers that we don&apos;t want **** like this at all. You can agree with that or not, i&apos;m fine in any case. Just remember that attacking personalities and saying that everyone who doesn&apos;t agree that Evolve is wonderful are &quot;trolls&quot;, &quot;rage kids&quot; or something speaks badly about you not the person you are attacking...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4964888">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yet here we are, as of now Evolve, a full priced mediocre shooter built around a gimmicky concept worth 3 hours of fun at best brag an aggregated 79. Flashing green lights, The press agrees, go buy it. And why even denounce the disgraceful day 1 DLC policy... it s a fight those guys abandoned years ago alongside the best interest of their readers and any kind of professional integrity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4968034">Expand</a></span>

Sadly this game is ruined right off the bat with a distinct lack of content and an inflated price thanks largely to the publishers 2K.
<br>
<br>Evolve is a 4 versus 1 battle taking place on a small selection of maps in which the team progress by killing numerous monsters that spawn over and over in very mundane fashion. The lonesome player featuring as the Monster has to do the same on the other end of the map until both teams face-off in a battle to the death. The more kills as you move forward on the terrain; the greater your team and their strengths become. Unfortunately; the combat is exceptionally mundane with extremely dull shooting mechanics and underwhelming enemies. The lone player role is even more tedious as they are excluded from the co-op elements and most of the time just aimlessly killing to evolve their monster for the final battle. If you are featuring on your own; you will probably be fed up and want to leave the match before it&apos;s even concluded. This alone makes the concept extremely flawed.
<br>
<br>Unlike the likes of Left 4 Dead 2 which was fast paced, frantic, fun, humorous and filled with additional material; Evolve is just another soulless modern FPS with a linear design and weak gameplay. The absence of modes and content within the base game is a major problem and a huge insult in the knowledge that much of it is being withheld to be sold down the line as DLC. You could almost say this game is unfinished in its current state and the additional material on the horizon is nigh-essential just to give the product some meat. Sadly this will set you back nearly &#xA3;60 which is ridiculous for a PC game in this day and age.
<br>
<br>Although you can participate offline and against AI; Evolve is a game that has to be played online for any enjoyment whatsoever. It is ultimately a product that is reliant on player traffic and you will need a number of committed friends who are willing to play regularly and at any given time just to ensure that you can play to a decent standard. However, I can see many people getting bored of this after a few days and turning to other titles which is a damning problem for the longevity of the game. By the time any DLC drops; this will probably be long uninstalled from your hard drive.
<br>
<br>Overall; Evolve is a major letdown and a game ruined by a terrible DLC roll-out plan and a limited amount of content. The game itself is very poor but the amount of features available is the final nail in the coffin. After a couple of days; you will have seen all that&apos;s on offer as the game drifts into stale mediocrity. The publishers should be ashamed of themselves with their arrogant and ignorant execution of the product and even the developers have let themselves down after the unique and ongoing success they are still experiencing with Valve. This game is simply a ripoff of the highest order and further proof that the industry ethics from some companies are nothing more than a kick in the teeth to the loyal customers that blindly support them. Avoid at all costs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4960961">Expand</a></span>

Also the &quot;skins&quot; are just recolours, just a colour change not worth your money and kind of a slap in the face. I was expecting the skin to look quite a bit/completely different.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4964514">Expand</a></span>

<br>Don&apos;t buy crap games and NEVER pre-order, you might as well hand them the friggin lube and bend over.

If you are gonna put a tutorial in the beginning of the game don&apos;t make it half-assed there are 3 other classes and 2 other monster have a tutorial for the others, I got thrown in a make with one of the other classes and i was dead before i figured the class out, this isn&apos;t the kinda game to be doing crap like that.

Evolve is not the best game but its definitely not the worse. Personally you need to have a good communicating team otherwise you will die a lot and find the game very frustrating and feel like your being overpowered even by the AI. I have played for about 5 hours and already regret my purchase but i only base that on the fact i wont be playing much of Evolve in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4961205">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Listed like that, you&apos;re looking at nearly 200 bucks for all the content that would maybe be worth 40-50, total joke.

<br>At least it&apos;s fun like I said, so if you already bought it like me, silver lining?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4964051">Expand</a></span>

A horrible trend to set for a $60 game, I hope that people are intelligent enough to not support garbage like this. There&apos;s a good concept behind the game, asymmetrical multiplayer is interesting, the classes each have their roles in hunting the monster and each player is valuable to the team effort the more the monster &apos;evolves&apos;, and the fun factor in the beginning is not all too bad, sound is decent, the visuals are decent, the map designs are decent, but currently there&apos;s not enough content worthy of your $60 now and it&apos;s not worth your $20 later, if a &quot;game of the year&quot; edition is produced, MAYBE it&apos;ll be worth your time and money, but by then, there should be other quality titles vying for your attention.

DLC: The Video Game (also known as Evolve) is a mediocre first person shooter (surprise surprise!) that brings nothing new to the genre other than lacklustre asymmetrical multiplayer and standard FPS shooting mechanics that are neither good or bad, just &quot;meh&quot;.
<br>
<br>No suspense whatsoever, no anything actually. You don&apos;t care who you&apos;re partnered with, you don&apos;t care about the skill development system which may as well have the word &quot;mundane&quot; plastered over the screen.
<br>
<br>This is Titanfall, Destiny and every other FPS you&apos;ve ever played and obviously are bored with completely rolled into one, but with one key difference - you don&apos;t own the game. You don&apos;t. Oh, you bought it alright, you&apos;re probably thinking &quot;yes I do, look, it&apos;s there!&quot; - but no, you own, what, 5% of the game? 95%, at least, is locked behind DLC. You want this game in full? Be prepared to pay &#xA3;150 or something over the next six months. Not that, as a sane person, you would, because it&apos;s mediocrity personified, but this is what 2K Games wants you to do. Want a shiny new skin over your character models? &#xA3;5 PLEASE. Want a new gun or something? &#xA3;10 PLEEEEEASE...
<br>
<br>This business practice will be what causes a gaming industry crash - it&apos;s a matter of time. Game companies are treating customers like braindead simpletons and it&apos;ll backfire obviously, as at some point people en masse will say &quot;I&apos;m not paying &#xA3;50 for 5% of a game, especially a new IP that I have no idea about at all.&quot;
<br>
<br>The positives? Graphically it&apos;s alright, but not amazing. Voice acting isn&apos;t particularly awful, but who the hell cares, really, as this is a game that should be a free to play shooter on PC or through PSN or whatever that has microtransactions to buy if you&apos;ve played the game and enjoyed it.
<br>
<br>WHY do game developers have an aversion to creating a quality game off the bat, full of content, then selling expansions and meaningful content if it&apos;s felt customers would go for it? The current practice of scummy companies like Ubisoft, EA and 2K are self-harming in the long term for short term gain, and they&apos;re too stupid to see it.
<br>
<br>Delighted to see gamers rejecting this crap and scoring it 5.2 at the time of review - but that&apos;s not low enough. Give the middle finger to these cretins and reject this nonsense, as your money deserves some god-damn effort from developers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4962236">Expand</a></span>

The game needed to be cheaper so we could buy it without thought and play it the few times we&apos;d get a chance. The current price point just doesn&apos;t make the type of game attractive and so none of my friends are playing, especially when other multiplayer only games have much more replayabilty for a third of the price.
<br>
<br>If they really needed to charge &#xA3;35 for the game, they should have put modes with more players in where you can still have fun if you don&apos;t have your friends playing with you.

There are a number of different versions and editions with different bonuses. While the game&apos;s 60 price tag is relatively overpriced for the amount of content received with a game that offers day one microtransactions.</span>

<br>
<br>This game is so absolutely multiplayer, that you can almost forget the idea of playing alone. Playing with strangers in a game like this just never works out. Soon as I played it, I realised the game was a shell. If you wanted what was inside the shell you&apos;d have to pay money for DLC and microtransactions. How they think they can get away with that is beyond me and unacceptable. Terrible stuff.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4962053">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The AI on the un played human characters is pretty good (There I found a positive somehow)
<br>
<br>However, generally it is terrible. Boring weapons, boring situations a boring execution of a thoroughly tedious game with very little content and myriad ways to try to rip you off for more cash adding financial abuse to the insult of having purchased this vapourware in the first place.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4962146">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Looking at the game as a whole, it is a fantastically well made experience with great graphics, balanced gameplay, and one of the most adrenaline fueled co-op, or solo experiences if you are the monsters, that I&apos;ve had the pleasure of enjoying for some time.This review is completely based upon of course my own opinions but primarily the quality of the game at launch. As above it is extremely well polished, gun-play feels fantastic, and playing as the monsters is simply one of the most exhilarating experiences I&apos;ve had with new-gen games. Each hunter class is very unique and each have special abilities that must be utilized together with the others to beat down the monster successfully. That is one of Evolve&apos;s biggest strengths, is the co-op gameplay is simply superb. However to quote the Escapist review, it is also it&apos;s biggest weakness, as with any game relying on others, if you get matched with a poor team, and lose a few games in a row, it can be frustrating for some.
<br>
<br>On the concern of the amount of content available comes down to preference on game types and what you personally like. If you like a good story with good multiplayer, then this isn&apos;t for you. However if you like shooters, but also enjoy things like DOTA 2 or Leauge of Legends, this is a very well crafted in a sense first person MOBA on the idea of 4 v 1. I enjoy MOBA&apos;s very much which may explain why I feel there is more than enough content with 16 maps, multiple modes etc. compared to something like Leagues which when it came out had 5v5 and 3v3 modes, one map for each mode, it is a lot more content.
<br>
<br>I realize League of Legends and DOTA 2 are F2P which does change perceptions on things, as Evolve is a $60 retail game with optional DLC on top of it. The marketing this game deployed is something that has shown a light on how poorly publishers plan and how money grab they are, however I do not believe this detracts from what Turtle Rock Studios has made, as they have made an extremely well crafted, beautiful game, with fantastic gameplay that will at least keep myself and my friends entertained for months to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4961881">Expand</a></span>

<br>Some people say, that this game isn&apos;t fun to play. This is mostly due to the fact, that this players don&apos;t play with thier teams. If you play solo, better get cod. But if you are a team player, just get a few friends or get matched with some random people and enjoy the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4962251">Expand</a></span>

I can see why people may think this game isnt worth 60 bucks as is, but i have played many games that had a TON of stuff to do that were just terrible.  God knows if i could get my 60 bucks back from Unity i would. :-).  If you are a multiplayer kind of gamer its a must have.  Even if you are not i would still highly recommend.  2k, and turtle rock have created something really unique.  I truly believe gamers will be talking about this game for years to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4960713">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Don&apos;t listen to the ppl complaining it&apos;s too pricey or whatever. It is exactly what gamers expect of a shooter game to be - it is brutal, epic and to the point.
<br>
<br>The first people to come complain here are usually the ones who did not understand what they are getting into or what the game is supposed to be like.
<br>
<br>It is the top shooter of 2015! Mind my words.</span>

The matchmaking system is really poor since the start and has never been updated. Instead, they released stupid DLCs with useless characters, monsters and maps.

You should never put as a priority, making money, over your community. This is what you get, no audience months, weeks and even days after releasing the game. Hope you learned from this huge mistake and not follow what &quot;Big&quot; gaming companies are doing, milking their games to death.

<br>
<br>1.
<br>Over priced. It should at most be a half price game compared to other triple A titles. Mostly due to the pure lack of content of wait.. you don&apos;t even get most of the content unless you pay a stupid amount of money which then unlocks the already in game day one 3 hunter classes and crappy monster skins. I personally believe this alone should be criminal. That aside there&apos;s next to no maps which all look the same you seriously cannot tell the difference and game play that is all the same and boring after the very first match you&apos;ll play!
<br>
<br>2.
<br>Lack of content. as stated above, you played one match you might as well stop there its all the same. Only 3 monsters! very little hunter Classes, and if you dont pay for the full special edition you miss out on them all. no maps, the ones that there is are all identical literally.
<br>
<br>3.
<br>Gameplay. shortest yet because there isn&apos;t much to say.
<br>-Unbalanced
<br>-Repetitive
<br>-Boring
<br>-Zero replay value, despite that thats what the whole games meant to be built on.
<br>
<br>4.
<br>Graphics. couple on generations behind, colourless, lifeless, boring, dull, ugly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4998877">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>$85 of DAY ONE DLC!!! They took a meat cleaver to this game. Cut out most of the content to sell in top of the $60 entry fee. It sets terrible a precedent for future games.
<br>
<br>If you purchase this or like this you&apos;re enabling the death of gaming as we know it.</span>

<br>
<br>No real skill involved in the first person element. And as the monster you just simply run and away from the humans until you in a position to attack them once you have fully evolved.
<br>
<br>In my option in needed to me much more close quarter fights when the monster is small, with the map opening up more as it evolves bigger with more several stages and more incentive to at least confront the humans or at least tactically get past them i.e you have to go through a small area somewhere they have set up traps.
<br>
<br>As a human its very boring to chase after the monster for 20mins and he just runs away then fully evolves than you get to fight.
<br>
<br>The first person elements don&apos;t really involve any skills and its very unrewarding. I feel gutted my Mrs&apos;s had to throw money in the bin as the trade in value is terrible (probably because everyone else is getting rid of it too).

But look at it likes someone going to be getting some new cars just think if haft of the people that like the game and the DLC how much money there going to be making. Im just going to take haft of the positive one form steam, At the time is 4928. haft is 2464 Times the DLC and game cost Comes to $295,680 ^.=.^ WOW Not DLC pushing not making someone bank.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m Not giving it a 0 as its still playable with out the DLC but is just feel like a game haft of the price of the base game should have been around $35.00. SOooooo the base game is fun, I feel like I should hate the game on principle, BUT ! yes there is all was but. I do feel that you can still have some fun with this if you do wait for steam to put this thing on sell for 60 with all the DLC... why are you still reading this? go play a game or something.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=5002062">Expand</a></span>

<br>Talking about the monsters they also are going to release DLC with new monsters in it as you can expect they are going to be SO **** BROKEN THAT THE GAME WON&apos;T BE PLAYABLE! All of the hunters seem balanced except for the medic Claira WICH SHOOTS GRENADES WITH RIDICULOUS AOE THAT HEAL PEOPLE AND YES THIS CAN REVIVE A DOWNED PLAYER! In an interview with the developers i heard him saying the team playtested the game for the past 3 years THEN HOW COME ON DAY 4 YOU HAVE AN 80% LOSS RATE AS MONSTER! THE GAME FEELS WAY TO CLOSED UP IT FEELS LIKE YOU&apos;RE JUST ALWAYS WALKING THROUGH A MAZE WITH THE HUNTERS ALWAYS ON YOUR HEELS ATTACKING SEEMS WAY TO SLOW SO THE HUNTERS RARELY GET HIT  IT FEELS LIKE YOU&apos;RE TRYING TO SWAT DOWN 4 **** WASPS WHILE BEING CHAINED TO A WALL. Now for the hunters as the hunter you can pretty much know where the monster is at 24/7 because you move at the speed of sound because Claira keeps throwing speed buffs at you, assault is the main source of damage as you can imagine nothing special ive noticed, support can put a shield wich blocks all damage to wich he just dances around the monster blocking every and all attacks the monster tries to make and if you try and kill the support good luck BECAUSE HE&apos;LL JUST FLY AWAY AND THERES ALMOST NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE MEDIC HEALS THE DAMAGE YOU JUST DID TO HIM WHILE THE TRAPPER JUST THROWS DOWN SPEAR TRAPS EVERYWHER MAKING SURE YOU DON&apos;T MOVE, talking about Trapper it&apos;s easily the most boring class in the game all you do is dome it then just spam traps on the floor. And if you somehow manage to down someone don&apos;t worry BECAUSE CLAIRA **** WILL JUST SPAM BOMBS AND BRING HIM BACK TO LIVE BECAUSE **** YOU RIGHT?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4986880">Expand</a></span>

Trying to play has been a ridiculous chore, with two of my friends crashing out of the game constantly, the game inserting us into matches as spectators only, and mouse cursors staying on screen hovering around your crosshair in game. Combined with one of the monsters being kind of OP and substantially more frustrating to fight than the other two, and huge unskippable wait/load times between matches (averaging about 5 minutes) this game has fallen short of my expectations. The $95 australian price tag on steam is just the icing on top of this half baked mess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4995695">Expand</a></span>

<br>Bottom line: Fine example of a good game being destroyed by greedy publishers. If you can get the game for under 30 dollars or as a game of the year edition with all the DLC included for 59.99 it might be worth it.  Is it worth it right now? No way, I would rather plunge a screwdriver into both  of my eyes and then rub them against sand paper than buy the game in it&apos;s overpriced condition.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4978986">Expand</a></span>

Please do look at accounts giving this game 9s and 10s. You will find that most of these accounts only have 1 review (of Evolve) and all were made recently. Coincidence ? No, just UNFAIR MARKETING.
<br>Here goes my review:
<br>Sadly I have to say I am disappointed and I feel scammed out of my money (I pre-ordered). We were promised a full game, while in reality we get like 40 % of the game for 60 $ and the rest is DLC that will cost you more than 100 $ to unlock if you want it all. That much DLC in a 60 $ title is a disgrace, and a lot of it is playable characters not just cosmetics.
<br>Another problem is lack of variety, each character only has 2 unique skills, and you have 12 characters to play with, but they play the same other than their look, voice and those 2 skills, such as mines or gas grenades. Monster are way better and more unique but there are only 3 to choose from. There are more hunters and monsters, but all sold as DLC.
<br>Maps are extremely boring and repetetive, which is a shame seeing that this is a game about hunting, so enviroment should be a priority. Each and every map consists of a small complex of buildings and a patch of wilderness surrounding it. Sometimes it&apos;s rocky, sometimes swampy and sometimes the rocks are covered in snow, but do not mistake it for variety, all the textures are equally gray and uninspired. Each map has the same animals and plants. There is only one original and fun map called &quot;Aviary&quot; which has a cool dome with tropical enviroment inside and winter outside.
<br>I also sadly have to add that the game suffers from numerous bugs, the matchmaking is absolutely horrible, not letting you really affect what class you play as (you can choose, but the system overrides that easy 75 % of the time). Not enough players to find a match on an afternoon a month after release do not help. You often get kicked out of lobbies, the game tends to freeze or get you spawned under the map, the net code is a glitchy mess and should still be in beta. Cheating is rampant and leaderboards broken since day 1.
<br>It&apos;s not all bad though !Balance is okayish for release day, no character is useless and nobody is truly OP. The monster gameplay really reward clever tactics and punishes mindless run-feed-fight mentality. The hunters rely heavily on co-op, so getting some friends is highly recommended.
<br>If it gets on sale, get it. Otherwise stay clear of this disgusting cash-grab. The core game is fun to play, and the game would get probably 7 or 8 if not the huge issues that I described. 4/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=5083189">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I love the characters, each of them with their own abilities and place in the group. Assault hurts, support &quot;supports&quot;, medic cures and trapper &quot;traps&quot;, All of them are essential for the whole game. This team-work, apart from being essential, is amazing! True that Bucket may be a bit OP, though xD. Being the monster is also entertaining, although I prefer playing as a hunter. There are some original mechanics, as the fact that you have to follow footprints, or the flying birds which tell you where the monster is. I have an small complait, and that is the OP of wraith&#xB4;s &quot;duplication&quot; ability, even though its good to have varied monsters, I think thats too much. Maps are ok, animations are ok, AI IS EXTREMELY GOOD. game modes are scarce, but good. Hunting, or the main game mode, isnt that special, but defence or nest are amazing. I guess that compensates it, even though there is a huge lack of modes.
<br>
<br>The bads are that it iss extremely dependant on the ability odf the playeer. Some games will last 25 mins, and will be immersive and exciting, others will last 3 mins or 45, being a walking simulator. The biggest WTF of the game is its pricing. WFT, 2K, the game, for what it offers, should be a 30 &#x20AC; game, even a free to play (although thats asking for too much) and DLCs are, in total 37 bucks, like... are you even serios. We accept the lack of characters, monsters and game modes, but not this. NOT THIS. Bad, 2k, really bad! Thats the perfect way of ruining a game that would have been a breath of fresh air for the shooter genre. Just, ugh.
<br>
<br>GRAPHICS: good, but not astonishing. I mean, its a shooter, 7.5
<br>SOUND: ok, 8
<br>AI: Sometimes even better than real players, 9.5
<br>GAME MECHANICS: 7
<br>ANIMATIONS: 7
<br>ORIGINALITY: 8
<br>CHALLENGE: 6.5
<br>STORY: -
<br>LENGTH: Easy to get bored of. No story mode, 5
<br>ENJOYMENT: too much dependence on the ability of the player, 7
<br>PRIZING: 2
<br>
<br>MATCHMAKING: Satisfactory, 7
<br>WEAPONS: Good, bot too scarce, 7
<br>
<br>THE BEST:
<br>-AI
<br>-Varied abilities
<br>-Team work
<br>-Assymetry
<br>
<br>THE WORST:
<br>-Pricing
<br>-Walking simulator
<br>-Duration
<br>-No story mode

The core gameplay is a game of hide and seek. This is a monster game with only 3 monsters, and double the content planned for overpriced DLC. You shouldn&apos;t charge $15 dollars a monster when the base game is already severely lacking in content. It is an extremly underhanded thing to do. The DLC isn&apos;t just skins for vanity, it is core parts of the gameplay that are missing from a $60 game. The game itself deserves a mere 3/10, however as a gamer, the studio and it&apos;s practices deserve a 0/10. Hopefully the negative backlash will show AAA companies what not to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evolve/user-reviews?user_review_id=4967697">Expand</a></span>
