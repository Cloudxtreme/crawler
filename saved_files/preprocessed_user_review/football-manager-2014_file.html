<br>
<br>Here comes my earlier (second) review.
<br>&quot;Despite my earlier review, I have played FM14 for a number of hours now. I&apos;ve decided to raise my score to a 5, but unfortunately, I don&apos;t think FM14 will reach any higher. Its not because its a bad game by any means, its because its the same game as 2013. Some things are better, like match engine (offensive) and the loading speeds but others are actually worse, like simple language translations, defending, removal of sliders and fancy animations that doesn&apos;t make any sense. Sadly, most things behind the scenes remain unchanged. No money for assistants, reputation doesn&apos;t scale properly with team success and of course the graphics and sounds (worse) that stays relatively unchanged year after year.
<br>
<br>Is it a good game? I guess it is. Is it worth the price tag? definitely not. This looks and feels more like a $15 DLC package than a full priced game. Can you imagine a team spent a whole year on this?! I cant, all I see is a handful of people pressing a few buttons every year and then laugh all the way to the bank. Its gone 2 weeks and they haven&apos;t even released an update fixing some of the obvious bugs that people are having (they are to busy sipping tequilas I guess). Don&apos;t buy this game, teach sigames a lesson. If you want updated player transfers, go to sortitoutsi and get it for FM13 instead.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3683996">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is sleek and polished, with greater match day graphics, but unfortunately it ends there.
<br>Firstly, I am sick and tired of watching another game end up with me having far more shots on goal than the opposition, just to see another drawn/lost game result.
<br>Granted, this happens from time to time in reality, but here, the regularity of its occurrence is plain ridiculous.   I clocked it happening in over 100 hours of play occurring over 40% of the time, even with the new patch installed too.
<br>Especially when I know that my players have greater finishing/composure than the opposition, it leaves you feeling like why bother trying to get that striker with 17 finishing and 15 composure, when the opposition player with finishing of 11 and composure of 10 scores more throughout a season anyway?
<br>
<br>And this leads me on to my biggest gripe with the series, and that is the unlinked stats.  What I mean by that is this; Doncaster in the Championship had a player (Salvatore Foti, aged 27) valued at &#xA3;275,000 at the beginning of the season, with finished rating of 10, composure of 11 (Who needs Suarez?).   At the end of the season, he had scored 32 goals, with an average of 7.34.  By and large then he was a roaring success, but how much did his value increase?  And how many teams were queuing up to buy him?  Well, his value increased to a whopping &#xA3;425,000, with NO-ONE interested.  Not a single club.  Also, his finishing/composure rating hadn&#x2019;t moved either.
<br>This happens time and time and time again in the FM world too.  I noted another player who I had been eyeing up finish the season with a dribbles per game score of 8.48, yet his value barely moved at all, and his dribbling stat didn&#x2019;t increase either.   Again, no other manager thought it prudent to take a look at him either.
<br>This just makes the game feel devoid of any true realism.
<br>Added to this lack of realism is the appalling transfer system, which lets the game down terribly.  There is just no sense of holding onto your best player in the face of prolonged scouting, snooping and/or newspaper speculation, neither do you feel like you have just pinched a certain player from under the noses of one of your bidding rivals either.
<br>The free transfer list is comical too, with yourself the one who buys up these players.  Imagine you are the aforementioned Doncaster (again!), and are bottom of the championship, with a tight wage budget, and a team that cannot create chances.  You find a certain 33 year old David Dunn on the free transfer list, with a creativity rating of 18, and passing of 15.  Granted he&#x2019;s old with poor stamina, but would you not take a gamble, and risk him on a short term contract?
<br>I was able to get the former Ballon d&#x2019;or winner Kaka, aged 32, at Wolves in the championship on &#xA3;17,500 a week for Pete&#x2019;s sake, with not a single team interested.  Why not, especially on that wage?
<br>There is just no feel of competing for players at all, players you know would have at least half a dozen teams clamouring for their signature, if not more.
<br>And the free list is chock a block with players like this, whether it be an aging but solid defender, a midfielder with teamwork and work rate stats above 18, or a nippy winger with impressive speed stats.
<br>
<br>And talking of stats, why has &#x2018;experience&#x2019; never been included?  It would make buying those aging stars more appropriate, especially if you managed to get someone who had over 10 years of champion&#x2019;s league experience for instance, at your lowly Championship club.
<br>
<br>And I have never, in all the years of playing this game, EVER come across a transfer that made me think WOW!!  And this game continues that trend.
<br>You know the type, Man City attempting to buy Messi or Ronaldo for &#xA3;90+ million, Man U trying to bring Bale back home, or Chelsea attempting to buy Rooney.  Here, in this world, this just does not happen.  And in all of the years playing it, it never has.
<br>As I mentioned, it leaves the whole transfer system feeling sterile and cold, with no realism whatsoever attached to it.
<br>And to finish, the match engine is plain pathetic.
<br>I have lost count of the amount of times I have asked my defenders to close/man mark the opposition, only to see another lofted cross end up in the net from a striker who had been left alone in the box, with my defenders not even challenging.  Or midfielders who I have asked to harry and close down the opposition, yet allow a player to waft past them like they were swans on a lake, unopposed.
<br>
<br>This game may be great for newbs, who will love becoming lost in the world of stats, but if you have played it for more than a few years, then the glaring inadequacies will surface very quickly here.

<br>The fullbacks just drive you mad with the way they play  Can&apos;t land a good tackle and get booked for fun,even get sent off frequently.
<br>
<br>The central defenders don&apos;t give a f**k when a striker runs past them, his pace doesn&apos;t even matter. Playing a high defensive line with offside trap is committing suicide even against the minnows.
<br>
<br>In theory SI made a nice decision to turn down finishing so that it could make the conversion rates more realistic. But in the Match engine it looks laughable when your strikers continue to miss from 6 yards out. Heck even a shot from 8 yards out is considered optimistic by the ME.
<br>
<br>The amount of shots you might have in the match doesn&apos;t really matter because your players decide to shoot the first time they touch the ball. Its more kinda like Setpice manager because the amount of freekicks and corners you get is ridiculous too. If you take them short you have an advantage because the opposition doesn&apos;t close you down no matter what.
<br>
<br>This game will make you rage quit  every other match as tactics are thrown out of the window with the stupid bugs. No fun in playing this game until they sort out the match engine.

I feel FM is already fundamentally broken since very long ago. For 14, the match engine makes me sick. I definitely can&apos;t find the successive works as classic as CM 03-04 which I first encountered. All the additional features seem to be doing some superficial &quot;effort&quot; but actually making the game experience more clumsy and bizarre because they are implemented scrappily. If SI isn&apos;t gonna make it hopefully another company can do it, though it&apos;s quite difficult. Somehow FM just feels like the Microsoft in football simulation game: Now almost everybody dislikes it but can hardly find an alternative.

Football Manager 2014 is quite simply the worst Football Manager I have played.
<br>
<br>Why? The football.
<br>
<br>The actual games are now a complete lottery. The players ignore your instructions. They almost always allow the opposition to amble past them with the ball, even if they are world-class defenders. Each game has a countless number of corners, which almost always result in goals due to goalkeepers not being able to catch crosses. 8 out of 10 goals are completely comical.
<br>
<br>It is like watching a video of a bunch of 7-year-olds playing football, and trying to influence the result by shouting at the TV. It is the lack of control that grates the most.
<br>
<br>The various updates don&apos;t make things any better - they seem to introduce more weird bugs (like the latest one of wingers refusing to cross, ever).
<br>
<br>As a test I tried filling a world-class team full of the best players in the world (Lewandowski, Thiago Silva, Pogba, etc etc). Even after 12 months of all these players bedding in, we would still lose every away game by a cricket score regardless of the tactic, opposition, or how long we established a pattern of play.
<br>
<br>As I said - it is a strangely unresponsive lottery of a game. I give up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3969389">Expand</a></span>

<br>What happens is very random.
<br>The match engine is awful.
<br>It&apos;s a parody of a soccer simulation.
<br>It&apos;s very easy to win EVERY game with unreal tactics.
<br>All penalties taken are scored.
<br>The latest patch made the game completely unplayable and the number of bugs make it laughable at best.</span>

For example my CB scored 12 goals (Shawcross) and Berbatov scoring a messily 6 as my lone striker. I have repeated in 2 saves (Completely shifting tactics) and what annoys me is the change tactics system. WHAT CHANGE! Apart from some extra match plans but NOTHING has change and by this I mean the fact that when you play the same tactic 7-10 games it becomes useless since teams will always beat you if you keep playing that formation even you change the mentality and philosophy. I do love the FM series since I&apos;ve been playing FM09 but it&apos;s just getting to the point where I&apos;m starting to not enjoy the game with too little changes. As the other reviews before me have said, if you want to play a real football managing simulator without the wanting to play as the director of football, just go play FM12 with the best overall engine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3851008">Expand</a></span>

FM14! This game is almost identical to its predecessor. The difference being sliders have been replaced with a more intuitive shout system, a few new small tweaks to contract negotiations and transfers. The match engine has also been tweaked, however this change has made this installation of Football Manager the most frustrating and unresponsive yet.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been a fan of Football manager since Championship Manager, I have enjoyed each iteration and put in up to a thousand hours over the whole series. At first this version seemed really flash, polished and more accessible, the appeal of which probably attributed the high scores from the critics short playing time. Then I got into the first few matches. I thoroughly despised every moment I watched during a match, however powered through hoping to find some enjoyment from this game. I got half way through the season to realise there is no point playing a game so frustrating and unresponsive to my input.
<br>
<br>The matches were horrible to watch because no matter what instructionI used, relative to last FM games, it felt very unresponsive. Nothing I intended on doing in the tactics reflected in the match engine. Every change and shout had little effect on changing the game once it had begun. Goals would be scored and conceded mostly from outrageous places like free kicks from the corner flag or very acute angled shots from inside the box or wing backs crossing and &quot;certainly not meaning&quot; to hit it into goal. Almost every one on one situation the goalkeeper wins. So this means the only way to make a practical tactic is around the flanks and crossing. Which I did, and managed to get through half a season. It felt cheated though because I had to work around the match engine to get a decent realistic game happening. I felt like I was forced to exploiting the match engine weaknesses because it was exploiting me by not allowing goals from through balls and players in the box with the ball at their feet.
<br>
<br>I begun to slightly enjoy the game by being pigeonholed into flank cross play and trying to exploit the engine every way I could to get a decent result. Nevertheless hit half way through the season and all of a sudden world class players couldn&apos;t make a pass, strikers couldn&apos;t score from 6 yards with ball at their feet, which became expected anyway, and defenders just stood there while the opponent ran past. When I say couldn&apos;t make a pass, I mean I was making 70-75% of my passes and went from having 55% possession to 40%, and these are world class players. All the shouts were revolved around giving easy pass options and holding possession. Players would pass in the completely wrong dircetion, and not just one or two but the whole team. It was as if the Match Engine was determined to make me loss because I was winning too much; It was exploiting me back through rubber banding. Opponents would score at the final minute if I was in control just to add salt to the wound even if I implemented defensive tactics. It felt completely out of my control and unresponsive. It felt as if the matches had been decided before I even started them, which I have had gripes with in other FM games but this time it is a joke. Was sitting where I expected for my team in second place with something like 12-4-4 record. Then I started a losing streak of 5 games all 3-0 or 4-1 against me. Forums say its your tactics, players are tired etc. I changed everything to stop the slump, and I mean everything any forum has ever suggested. Nothing worked. I was going to lose no matter what, so I gave up. The tug of war which lasted half a season between me exploiting the match engine and it exploiting me was finally over, it had won. Previous installments the tug of war was between my team and the opponents teams but this time around the only way to get anything out of this game is by understanding the match engine and how to get around its flaws and playing the game it forces you to. I uninstalled it and looked back at a very frustrating experience. Buyers remorse has settled in that&apos;s why this game gets a 2, it is almost exactly the same as previous installments of the series but the match engine has made it almost unplayable; except for you masochists out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=4343477">Expand</a></span>

Having played almost all football management games in the history of gaming including greats like Premier Manager, Ultimate soccer manager, LMA Manager but the list could go on forever. For years my heart has been in love with Championship/Football Manager. Now I&apos;ll be honest I have never been interested much in 3d match engine, although I have in recent years started to use it. For me it&apos;s the remarkable detail and accuracy of there database along with their simple yet detailed interface. But Recently its exactly that interface which for the first time in 20 years has caused me to abandon FM. Just to give you an example I have clocked over 1300 hours on fm12&amp;13, but FM14 I got as far as the beta, then sold my full key to someone else because the lack of detail to the new tactics interface has killed it. I mean I was pi**ed when they changed the training in fm13. I liked to fully customise my training schedules to the needs of the players I&apos;m trying to develop, but it didn&apos;t kill the game. Here though, in FM14, they expect me to control my team the same way, Barry from row f in the east stand tries every saturday, by shouting! Shouts. Not tactics, SHOUTS. I have watched countless interviews in dressing rooms of top premier league clubs, and in the background you see a board that resembles that of the old champ 01/02 tactics screen with lines going up, down diagonal. I mean you know what you want your players to do, it&apos;s clear and when it&apos;s not working and you know what to do to fix it. Shouts are a guessing game with very little control.
<br>
<br>I am more excited than I have ever been about FM this year. Because I am a Leeds supporter. I hope that FM15 improves, and by improve, I would be happy with fm12 with fm15&apos;s database.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=4460555">Expand</a></span>

Yes I like this kind of games and I&apos;ve bought several over the years (not every year as I can clearly see there are hardly any big changes, last was FM2012) and every year I wonder whats going to be &quot;the rabbit out of the hat&quot; thats really gonna make a huge different and worth it to spend the full price. Sadly there&apos;s not much. Little change here, a few small adds there and of course the updated teams/players of this years competition. Is that all? Yup thats it. If they had stopped at FM2012 and just release an update every year for the teams/players, nobody would bother anymore to buy a new FM game, cause thats one of the main reasons (if not THE reason) someone still would buy this years version: for the new players and updated teams. I think its time that they start to realize that at Sports Interactive and stop this money robbery. So the way I see it, or come up with real notable improvements OR just drop a DLC every year so people can update their game for a small price. So my obvious advice to everyone: wait till the price drops before buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3738140">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s especially noticeable with defenders, letting balls just roll by them, crossing the pitch erratically and running into each other with surprising repetition. Other gripes include the fact it took over 20 penalty spot kicks for the first one to be scored?! Talk about bad odds... and most of my attacking players seem to want to play nothing but back heeled 15 yard passes.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s better than 2013, but still an annoyingly buggy product with regards to its game engine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3850631">Expand</a></span>

<br>While the interface and some features are very well done, like communication with players, training, press conferences, the fundamental core of the game, football, is just a train wreck.
<br>In FM 2013 I could see the effects of shouting at my team, of changing tactics and sliders, in this game its all a huge randomness, doesn&apos;t really matter if you change anything at all.
<br>The football simulator is so bad that I can&apos;t stop laughing at player movement, its better to just go on holiday and not lose my time. I would say that for each 10 goals scored, 8 of them are absolutely ridiculous, and the amount of goals scored is too high, football is not hockey.
<br>
<br>What I find interesting is people rating this game at 7+, we can even see a lot of 9&apos;s and 10&apos;s, specially by &quot;high reputation game raters&quot; which pretty much define the metacritic score.
<br>This makes me think about the reliability of this people, when you read people saying &quot;tactically-rich&quot; you have to wonder how can someone fail so much at something that they should be good at.
<br>The only reason I can accept this scores is because this people never played another football manager, nor understand anything about football, anything at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3828326">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>FM13, the team plays the type of football you instruct and players listen to shouts, The game play is dreadfull in FM14, this is such a let down as each instalment of FM has been awesome over many years.
<br>
<br>Some of the player ratings are awfull, young stars have such poor ratings you have to offload them and search for other wonderkids. I Vidic and Jones to have a go and they do sweet FA, carrick and mop head cant create anything, heavens forbid i have to use anderson to show some creativity. Rooney went 12 games without a goal, have over 100 shots but no cigar....................
<br>
<br>So its back to FM2013 for me, im tens seasons in and loving it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3877331">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Well, eventually FM2013 became playable, and enjoyable, so silly me got all excited and decided to go against my better judgement and pre-purchase FM2014... Guess what? It&apos;s broken. It was broken during &quot;beta&quot;... and now it&apos;s, somehow, even MORE broken for it&apos;s initial release. It&apos;s unplayable.
<br>
<br>Personally, I&apos;m tired of being abused by game companies... so I headed over to SI&apos;s forum and responded under the &quot;full release feedback&quot; sub-section with one word: &quot;BROKEN&quot;. Eh voila! Lifetime ban!
<br>
<br>Not only are SI incapable of bug testing... they refuse to tolerate valid, polite, and perfectly understandable customer feedback.
<br>
<br>This is the last FM I buy. No, really. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3684757">Expand</a></span>

<br>Also anyone that speaks out on steam or forums is banned and ignored.

<br>Its a tran wreck plain and simple, worst yet</span>

Every year, FM has the same bugs over and over again! And FM2014 is no different, or in fact, worse, as Sega has shown that they can&apos;t be bothered with the flaws that had bugged users over the years. Here are just some of the problems of this stupid game:
<br>- Long term injuries devastating specific positions: Tell me how are you going to play the game when 4 of your 5 first team strikers are all out for 3 months each, and your only 2 first choice keepers are out for 2 months together, at the SAME time?
<br>- You could be on a roll, but when you start losing a game, your team will lose until like there is no end in sight, even if you are using the best team in the world.
<br>- Abysmal Match Engine: It has in fact regressed since 2012. Your defenders will just stand off when the opponents put in a through ball, and your strikers just can&apos;t seem to score for love or for money! In fact, I can say I hit the post more often than I find the net! And the players can&apos;t seem to dribble or pass even to a teammate 5 metres away without no pressure, or make meaningful moves.
<br>- Poor logic overall: Your player can be injured for the past 5 months (and still injured), and yet. you have news saying that the fans are happy with his recent performances! Incredulous! and I&apos;m only scrapping the surface of more ridiculous things in this game!
<br>
<br>If you are reading this prior to buying this game, PLEASE DON&apos;T BUY IT! The game makers has shown time and again they are lazy and can&apos;t be bothered to address the flaws which has bugged EVERY version! I WILL DEFINITELY be boycotting the Football Manager franchise for good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3829927">Expand</a></span>

The match engine is somehow still worse than 12&apos;s, with players running in a mechanical and hilarious manner, but is slightly better than 13&apos;s. There are also less stupid mistakes, for both your team and the opposition, but the game just does not flow as naturally as it did in 12. It&apos;s almost immersion breaking.
<br>
<br>Out of match day, the game is vastly improved. The opposition AI now make and accept more realistic offers for players in comparison to previous installments. Team talks and team meetings also have more of an impact than they did in 13, where every player was manic-depressive. It&apos;s also nice to see a lot of younger, more out of the limelight players (e.g. lower leagues) who are showing potential and form over the past 12 or so months actually having their attributes updated, rather than just the bigger clubs. This is specifically something I noticed with Championship players, due to my team currently being there. Training is still very uninvolved in comparison to 2012, but is better than 2013.
<br>
<br>Beyond a few little cosmetic changes, such as sleeker AI than 13 and some new squad roles, I am struggling to find anything to justify a full price purchase. The match engine and AI, which has always been a problem with the series, is still neglected in favour of smaller, more gimmicky things such as &quot;classic&quot; mode. SI really need to pull something out of the bag next year, the series has stagnated since 2011-2012 and after 2013&apos;s debacle, they&apos;ve lost at least one fan in me and the demo of 2014 is doing nothing to inspire me to move on from 2012.
<br>
<br>Possible sale buy, but currently SI aren&apos;t doing anything significant updates, especially in problem areas, justify their yearly price. Market leadership has caused them to become complacent, possibly lazy, and the past two games have shown this. 4/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3816245">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I bought this game when it was initially released and it was buggy as hell and broken. I stopped playing for a bit and waiting for a couple of patches, just to realise that the same core issues are still there. If you try complaining in the forum, you get banned, or fanboys will tell you &quot;it must be your tactics&quot;. Really disappointed and I will never buy another FM straight after release. Heck I might never buy another FM again till SI makes some serious improvements.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3914442">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you are playing against ANY half decent side away from home, then forget about keeping a clean sheet. You can set your defence to &quot;drop deeper&quot; and they still push up to the half way line. Setting your team
<br>fluency to &quot;rigid and disciplined&quot; also has no effect, the opposition will still walk through you like your a bunch of nursery children.
<br>
<br>Inside Forward= Cuts inside and shoots EVERY time they get the ball.
<br>Corner= Goal (The last season I completed with Milan, Adil Rami had 16 league goals)
<br>Central Defenders= Watching every ball sail over their head as the striker goes through on goal.
<br>Playing Dortmund/Real Madrid/ Barcelona/ PSG/ Man City away = conceding minimum 5 goals no matter who you are.
<br>
<br>Look ive ranted enough, but this game really is TERRIBLE. If you&apos;re reading this and haven&apos;t bought this game yet, do yourself a favour...Save &#xA3;35 and buy something far more practical, like an inflatable dartboard.

<br>poor game from a once great franchise. Through my experiences my review will be based on the most predominant aspect within the game. This year though, I have only found many bad things about Sports Interactive&apos;s FM 2014.
<br>
<br>-Unrealistically tough Match Engine
<br>SI seems to have delivered us with a Match Engine so difficult to interpret it&apos;s like trying to break in to Pandora&apos;s box. The developers have clearly not taken into account that new players will look to play this game. With my FM 2014 experience I feel like the game decides the result of matches before you even start them which makes it feel infuriating and unrewarding considering it takes so long to create a half decent tactic.
<br>
<br>-Poor training system:
<br>Training your players does not seem to make a scrap of difference on how they perform on the pitch. I still can&apos;t wrap my head around the training but it seems pathetically limited considering this is the same  Sports Interactive that made Football Manager 2012.
<br>
<br>-Players do not seem to respond to tactics
<br>Even after &apos;training&apos; your players to understand your philosophies it seems like they don&apos;t follow them at all and pretty much every match will see defenders and the goalkeeper passing the ball around to themselves for about 2 minutes before chucking the ball to the midfield, who then pass back to the defence thus repeating, what I call, the cycle of boredom. Often you wont even notice your strikers who seem to just drift about like idiots.
<br>
<br>-Updates hinder the game
<br>Every update so far does not progress the game to fix the crappy match engine, but instead makes common working tactics useless. Seriously try using some FM 2014 tactics made during the games release and you will notice they no longer work. I cant tell if this is SI trying to keep interest high but it comes across as annoying considering the match engine is already clearly broken. And to date (29/04/2014) SI has not done anything about the underwhelming match engine.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s two years worth of bad games now as FM 2013 fared no better. SI have only dumped minor and mediocre changes to football manager 2013 and dubbed this disappointment as the most addictive football management game out there.
<br>
<br>Graphics- 8-10
<br>Despite the negatives the new 3D match simulator does look nice but the poor Match Engine spoils this.
<br>
<br>Creativity- 1-10
<br>The game offers little in regards to tactics and punishes those who think outside the box.
<br>
<br>New user friendly - 0-10
<br>Horrible for beginners. enough said.
<br>
<br>Replayability- 4-10
<br>Once you realize the problems in your team do not lie with you but the broken match engine, the game becomes bleak and uninteresting.
<br>
<br>Overall score - 3.4/10
<br>A largely dull game that specializes in frustration rather than management. Poor effort.

<br>Verdict:
<br>More of the same, but with a newer, sleeker feel to it. Definitely an improvement on the disaster that was FM13, but not worth all the praise it is getting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3682114">Expand</a></span>

Every since the 3d ME has come into the series you&apos;re no longer left to your imagination thinking about players acting like real life footballers. For the last several years though you&apos;ve been able to see the ME in action and boy did it throw up some comical moments of players running out of play for no reason, running away from the ball, passing the ball straight to the opposition, throw ins going to the opposition more often than not, sometimes your player won&apos;t even be aiming at one of your players just straight to the opposition from the edge of your penalty area.
<br>
<br>FM14 however shows that no progress has been made since that first version in making the players on the pitch behave any more human. They still bump into each other, awkwardly tackle each other and corners just turn into pinball because the bll and players simply don&apos;t act realistically. Back around FM10/11 the game was solid. It seems that since then though SI hve refused to clean up any of the bugs and just added more onto it while spending all their time on man management trough player talks and teamtalks that don&apos;t have a long lasting effect on your game as well as completely diluting the training so you&apos;re left wondering if it&apos;s actually having any effect on your players or not.
<br>
<br>I only got FM14 because it was on a Steam sale but for the first time in ten years of playing the series I feel ripped off.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll finish comparing the &apos;critics&apos; reviews who seem to&apos;ve been playing a completely different game to me, to the media reports in my current save. I&apos;m 23rdin the league without a win in what&apos;s now 12 games.  &quot;This recent poor run of form have seen the side fall to just a top half placing and whilst this is still better than many critics expected, the fans are worried that the early season promise is going to be replaced with late season disappointment.&quot; It&apos;s a fitting bug to describe the game. Critics love it for being a polished turd but the fans are seeing through it. Nothing will make me buy another FM until a new, and I mean brand new not just an updated version from the year before, Me has been designed for the game to actually make it play realistically</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3774158">Expand</a></span>

First of all, SI made changes to the tactics, but way too extreme. People easily gets confused with tons of instructions which they have to understand through hard trying filled with frustration. Such changes made the game boring and even annoying sometimes. In the past, I can directly adopt my philosophy to a new tactic and try it out on the pitch and make adjustments. Now, however, I&apos;m more like taking a chemistry class and mixing all kinds of stuff together desperately hoping that &quot;this time it may work&quot;.
<br>
<br>Secondly, the match engine in FM2014 is incredibly ridiculous. While no major improvements are made, all kinds of problems absolutely ruined the gameplay. When FM14 first came out, poor defense no matter what instructions you use,  strange turn-overs and horrible mistakes, these kind of situations occurs very often. And now it is 14.22 and I find that the opposition goal keeper is like superman no matter who he is. I can have 30 shots and 25 of them hit the target but no goal, and the opposition made one counter-attack so I lose. If this happens once for a while, I won&apos;t be too disappointed, but I can have several matches in a row losing like this. As I said before, I used to test football philosophy in FM, now I&apos;m just fighting the match engine. I searched online about tactics and all I got was how to use weakness of the ME. Come on, I bought this for 50 bucks and this is what it&apos;s worth?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3988211">Expand</a></span>

FM 2013 was really bad and i bought FM 2014 believing that they would fix some ridiculous things in the new version. they were advertising that the wages and so on are more realistic now etc. So this is my list of problems and the reasons why im not buying FM again because i feel they have no idea how to produce games:
<br>
<br>1. you start the game in year 2013 and almost no team has budget to buy players or even the wages to get cheap FREE PLAYERS. how ridiculous is that? also you have to wait at least 2-3 seasons before you get free players worth signing even for teams of the 2nd-3rd division on free transfers. no players available on free transfers. ridiculous. when u play at year 2020 you can win the champions league with swansea because u can get world class players on free transfers every season and the wages of the teams become realistic.
<br>
<br>Ridiculous 2: I was playing with the French site valenciennes and i was 3rd!!!!! in my second season  there A COUPLE of matches before the end of the season and my status was untouchable because it was the best campaign they&apos;ve ever had in their history. i sold players for 10-15 million and i got no wages or transfer budget at all. WHY? finally the chairman messaged my that im gonna have to win 5 points in the next 3 games or he will fire me. WHAT? i didn&apos;t make it and i was fired.  STILL DONT GET THAT.
<br>
<br>Rediculous 3: usually when u sign for a team mid-season you realise that there are positions that there is no one player who can play there. even a decent one. how im gonna deal with that? to get defenders to play as wingers? they want you to do the impossible with that squat though.
<br>
<br>rediculous 4: Scouters tell you that a player is a quality player and when you sign them the assistant manager says that he is a decent player. both scouters and assistant manager have high rating in judging player&apos;s ability. WHY?
<br>
<br>rediculous 5: When you are unemployed and you are looking for a team you might be unemployed for 2-3 season even if u had good results previously.  it is a game and im playing to have fun SI giniuses!!!
<br>
<br>rediculous 6:  my computer is worth 2 grand and the loading speed to move from Monday to Tuesday is redicoulous and also the drop box that comes down every time u press &apos;continue&apos; makes me want to quit the game.
<br>
<br>rediculous 7: I want to be able to sign players from france and portugal because they are cheap but i don&apos;t want to have those leagues in my playable leagues because it will reduce the game&apos;s performance. therefore if u want to play england spain and italy for ex you will have to join a big team to be able to sign good players from these countries. look for talents in countries that are not playable. you are not gonna find too many.
<br>
<br>ridiculous 8: the pointless interviews when you are unemployed is the worst thing in the game i believe. usually they don&apos;t employ you or if they do they might have a rediculous squad and empty positions and they are 15th in the league 10 games before the end and they ask u to qualify for EURO cup because they are Lyon olympique or whatever. is it possible?
<br>
<br>Also the instructions to players individually and the way you want them to play is confusing. in FM 2012 it was much better. also most of the times the team performance becomes worse if not on the default.
<br>
<br>THIS GAME IS BAD. REALLY BAD. im not buying this game again and i was one of the biggest funs of this game until last year. never again</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=4155122">Expand</a></span>

I have been a massive fan of the FM series since FM 2005 and after FM 2013 was a stinker I was hoping SI would come out with a much improved game... but no, the game is currently bugged to crap.
<br>The good things about FM14? The layout makes the game easy to navigate and it throws a lot more useful statistic at you. Players in the match itself are much improved looking more realistic animation wise and the shirts look better than ever before. Conversations with players and the media is much better giving you more interesting answer options than in previous versions.
<br>The bad things about this game? As already said, the bugs. The player performance ratings are currently broken, players are rating on average 4.5  6.0 every game even though they are performing well and not making mistakes, SI have hot fixed this in a update but its still not working. The new tactics system is a load of rubbish now that they have removed the sliders. You can&apos;t help feel that the match engine overall is broken, using a 4-4-2 formation I won 9 out of 10 matches then I lost 4-1, 3-0, 2-1 3-0 then drew 1-1 against a team at the bottom of the table.
<br>
<br>When FM13 was released we all know that it was struggling with issues until updates were made further down the line, all I can do is hope that FM14 will have updates that will make the game playable and enjoyable, until then this game can gather dust on my shelf.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3722307">Expand</a></span>

<br>2. Tactics got a little better from one side but much worse from the other. You are pretty limited in the orders you can give to your players for some reason, and it is very frustrating.
<br>3.The major issue: you have NO WAY to defend yourself against crosses and/or corners, and it&apos;s a deal breaker. It doesn&apos;t matter what tactics you use or how good your team is, you will always concede from crosses and corners. Even your 1.90 defenders with heading 19 and jumping reach 20 won&apos;t get the ball, but their striker with his 1.75 and heading 15 always will.. I am playing manager games since 1998 and it has never been so bad, so farewell for now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=4889095">Expand</a></span>

<br>so many things wrong i do not have the time to write them all down so i will just give my 5 best reasons for rating 0.
<br>
<br>1. Ryan Giggs  contact is expiring and the greedy sod wants 250k p/w the board will only allow 175k p/w so he plans on leaving, Everton put in a bid which i can do nothing about.Now when he leaves and next time i am playing Everton he is in their team and i looked at him to discover he signed for them on 20kp/w ????
<br>
<br>2. Wayne Rooney scores 5 in a game and has 2 assists in a 9-0 thumping of Fulham this is the one and only time i have seen a player get a rating of 10 for a match, i praise him in the after match team talk only for the rest of the teams morale to go to abysmal and almost all those who played in the match ask to leave!!!
<br>
<br>3. A 16 year old player at Inverness is valued at 26k so i bid 100k get refused  and so on till i hit 1mil and at this point i ask to discuss and they say they will start discussions at wait for it 2.5mil !!!!! REALLY? as if.
<br>
<br>4. Lose the match that you totally dominate to an own goal, i&apos;m talking 35 shots at goal 15 on target 10 ccc and yet still lose to that 1 shot at goal and this almost always happens to be the bottom club.
<br>
<br>5. Then we have the game that you know you are going to lose right at kickoff, one of your guys smashes the ball off the other then they both just stand there for what i can only assume is the other guy debating why his team mate just smashed the ball off him. Then we have EVERY pass will now just go to an opposition player(even goal kicks) EVERY defensive header will go straight to an opposition player EVERY throw-in will go to an opposition player. None of your defenders will tackle the whole match except that one time when he tackles the forward running into 2-3 defenders so he can just knock the ball into the path of his unmarked partner.
<br>
<br>I played this series through all the 90s when it was CM stopping 2001 and did not play again till this version and i have to say things have went backwards. I will never buy another version EVER that&apos;s how bad i rate this game.
<br>
<br>Some people tell me they like the 3D match engine but i will still give 0 as i have seen many games with better graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=5047889">Expand</a></span>

<br>Seasons and Playoffs are totally rigged... example: playoff vs a worst team: 1-1 (own goal of my gk), second match: 1-4 (was 0-4 after 20 mins). WHAT&apos;S THE FKING POINT OF THIS??? Oh wait, my team was 40-1 for the promotion, maybe that&apos;s why LMAO.</span>

Well, doesn&apos;t matter. What I want to say is that from FM12 to FM14 there is no difference, no new features, nothing...

There is no feelings says that the 3D engine is any better from what it was on FM 2013, to be honest I think it&apos;s worse. I don&apos;t think I will be buying this game anymore if SI doesn&apos;t come up with something big. I hope that someday a good game like this can come to consoles like PlayStation and Xbox.</span>

In-game AI is also not very smart at times, but these do not really deter from the experience.</span>

<br>I give points for the fact the game support having 3D stereoscopic match engine  which makes it quite a treat to watch...Also it has a huge intelligent community that invent all kinds of giz-mos to make it a better and more pleasant experience...For example I rate it as nine because it doesn&apos;t have a surround sound support which hinder the immersion...But I have found a sound pack from earlier versions that makes up for it...That&apos;s the most stunning attribute of this game...If you find something not to your liking you can be sure that someone else thought about it before and fix it...That&apos;s how committed people to it...So with a lot of patience, little by little it is going to govern your life...You would be less inclined to fulfill any social responsibilities you might have and eventually get divorce...But guess what....You are still going to be happy left alone and make love with this game....So I would like to introduce you your future bride...9 ot of ten is not bad...not bad at all...Ciao</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3773920">Expand</a></span>

Especially now that EA has ceased releasing new FIFA Manager games, there won&apos;t be any competition left for SI. Although this somewhat worries me, every new FM release typically includes a plethora of gameplay and match engine improvements. FM14 is as addicting as its predecessors (currently 486 hours played). The game is highly realistic and includes very accurate player stats. The match engine is far from perfect, though. My main complaint is that, at times, players make the weirdest mistakes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=4444097">Expand</a></span>

<br>To be honest</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">If you want a football management game then there is only really one option nowadays, and this series is it.

<br>
<br>To be honest however, unless you are really worried about having all the up to date players, you could pick up any of the Football Manager titles since the 3D match engine was introduced in about 2010 and it would make much difference. My hope is that at some point either this series or another tries to do something different as, having played management games since I was about ten years old, I am starting to lose interest in the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3886591">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This is a Sega PC game, at least the one that I have. I haven&apos;t seen a game quite anything like this. The game uses databases like Fritz 13 does. And, if you have a change of mind, about stopping a game, and starting again, you can look unusual online. I was playing Bayern F. C., before the P. C. crash, and I was wanting Rummenigge, the Club President, to be the icon that he is.</span>

I just think the are deliberately prolonging the improvement of the game, so they could improve them in years to come... But i think that as always its a lot of fun... I enjoyed almost every minute of it. I would like if they could just hire me for one day, to explain them all what to add in the game! :)</span>

Wrestling with the board is the least of my problems.  Figuring out how to positively impact the teams ability to win is my biggest problem.  It would have been nice if they allowed an option to own a team rather than sitting there fighting the board all the time.  Also, while this game is far more comprehensively detailed (IE.  one can use more and train  for formations for a match; this can not be done in Fifa Manager) and I&apos;d say even more realistic than Fifa Manager, I think I will be sticking with the Fifa Manager franchise until they make this game a little less hardcore; I easily lost 10 hours of my life and I didn&apos;t even make it to the regular season!  But, I will admit that this game is pleasantly immersive.  Just do not forget to leave autosaves on and save backups.  No matter how great your computer is, the game will crash and the save will get corrupted; manually going into the files:
<br>Documents&gt;&gt;Sports Interactive&gt;&gt;Football Manager 2014&gt;&gt;Games&gt;&gt;Restore Previous Version will be the only way to salvage a would be ruined game save.
<br>
<br>But if I was aspiring to be a real Futbol Manager, this would be the game to tinker with above all others...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=4264704">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>A great game. But i feel Sports Interactive could have done better. The game seems a lot slower on my Macbook than the 2013 version. The new features arent that impressive either. So at this moment i rather play 2013 with an updated database.

<br>If you dont own Football Manager yet, do buy it though. It simply the best Football Manager game.</span>

The idea is great, gameplay as good as can be i guess without competition. The big let down is the simulation aspect, which is a pretty huge part of it. During the match the sim is incredibly poor with odd things happening constantly. Tactics should be a big part of the game, but the game gives you an unfair/unneeded advantage at the start. You can play the worst team with worst tactics but still win 3-0 on all games. After those first 6 or so matches it changes, but as no matter what system you use you always win you don&apos;t really see how bad your tactic is. Making it very hard to tweak, or find a solution to your poor form. Don&apos;t get me wrong, i have gotten promotion with teams such as weston super mare several times, so i am not bad at the game. But that aspect ruins it a bit for me. Also attributes don&apos;t really do much. All the time i see pace 6 outrun a pace 12 player, or a 6 header head a ball past a 14 header defender. Players with low attributes become topscorers etc</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/football-manager-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=5633556">Expand</a></span>
