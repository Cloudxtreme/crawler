In any other game this would be exploiting. in AO it is the bread and butter, and is called &quot;twinking&quot; in AO lingo. no game in history has done this, or done it successfully to the scale that AO does it. when the new engine and starter areas are implemented, this game will be in a league of its own, and a perfect rating will not do it justice. until then, get some friends together and try the game. its definitely worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anarchy-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=2274097">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not a horrible MMO, but it&apos;s just not quite as good as some of the other titles out there. The gameplay was just a bit too generic. I haven&apos;t tried playing it in years though, so my review is solely based on my experiences when the game was relatively new.</span>

For the most part I find AO to be an incredibly engaging and addictive game. And seriously folks, if you read the reviews before you bought the game, then you wouldnt be in the situation you are in now, like the recommended requirements.</span>

I&apos;d get into its pros and cons, but suffice it to say that its the most atmospheric and otherworldly gaming experience I&apos;ve had in an MMO. I still love it after 10 years of play.

<br>
<br>Be warned: It does have a steep learning curve and its not for the impatient.  But, on the flip-side it has the most intelligent and mature playerbase of any online game in the world. Trust me on this.
<br>
<br>The best part? Its free to try up to the first 200 levels (out of 220). However, I HIGHLY recommend spending 5 dollars for the shadowlands expansion at least.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anarchy-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=3941363">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re not willing to trust Funcom with your identity, they will keep the account frozen forever with no alternate solutions. All your time invested in the free account will be lost. There are several discussion threads about this, on Reddit and elsewhere if you want to look them up.
<br>
<br>Some of you may not realize what a huge deal it is to send that kind of personal information to a third party in a foreign country - a company that recently had their forums hacked and is struggling financially. Don&apos;t do it. Sending that kind of information to a third party is illegal (for good reason) in some countries, and even if it&apos;s not illegal in yours - your proof of identity is more valuable than any game account, and the fact that Funcom wants it so badly even though they could verify your ID in other ways should give you pause.
<br>
<br>For the record: this happened to me, and others. I&apos;ve had no issues with my credit card ever, I had a different account that was paid without issues with the SAME credit card as the frozen account, and I didn&apos;t share the account with anyone nor was there suspicious activity. The fact that one account (by the same player) gets frozen but the second account, played at the same time and paid with the same card, does not, should tell you all you need to know about Funcom&apos;s &apos;security&apos; system.
<br>
<br>Avoid this game if you don&apos;t want to risk losing all the time you invested.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anarchy-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=6684447">Expand</a></span>
