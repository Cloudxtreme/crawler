<br>If given one word to describe this game, that is what I would use. Loading up this game is like stepping into a watercolour painting, in a room filled with poets.
<br>
<br>The question you&apos;d most likely be asking at this point is; &quot;would that really be my kind of thing?&quot; It&apos;s not really a major selling feature for most people. But, even though this game at it&apos;s core is an artpiece, it is wrapped in extremely good gameplay.
<br>
<br>You play a young Austrian girl called Aurora, who awakens in a strange world touched by darkness, in 1895. You&apos;ll explore the vivid landscapes, interact with the colourful characters, and slowly transform from a naive young girl into a bold warrior. This is aided by soon finding a sword.
<br>
<br>And you&apos;ll need that sword, because there are always enemies lurking. These encounters is where this game really shines. It&apos;s a pseudo-real-time-turn-based-strategy combat, where each thing is represented on a time bar. When you near the end, you&apos;re in a &quot;Cast&quot; zone, where you choose your attack/defense. These have different speeds; higher powered attacks will take longer to complete. If you hit something that&apos;s in this zone before they hit you (or vice versa), then they will be interrupted and sent back along the timeline. I cannot express how deeply satisfying it is to overtake an enemy by the smallest margin and send it back. There is an edge-of-your-seat level to this that I was immensely addicted to.
<br>
<br>Enemies can be tough, and attack in packs, so you know you shouldn&apos;t be alone. You&apos;ll find controllable companions along the way, who will join your party. Each of them are experts in certain types of combat; you&apos;ll find a jester which helps with healing/reviving, and a wizard that deals great elemental damage, to name just two. However, you can only battle using two at a time, but switching mid-battle is possible.
<br>
<br>You&apos;ll also have a small luminous droplet following you, which when controlled by the mouse, can aid in many ways, such as blinding enemies to slow them, or heal your party members.
<br>
<br>My best advice is to play this on expert initially, unless you want to easily win each battle. I did have to dial it bask to casual after a while, though.
<br>
<br>Aurora also soon gets the ability to fly, which greatly helps with the exploring aspect. And explore you will; there are chests and goodies everywhere for you to pick up, most importantly the Oculi. These gems, when assigned to your party members, give certain attack and defense buffs which can be critical for particular enemy types. They are also craftable, opening even more types of buffs. The sheer amount of combinations means you&apos;ll spend a lot of time here.
<br>
<br>The story is charming, with lots of humour sprinkled throughout. And although the dialogue is spoken entirely in verse, I find it refreshing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4909110">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Advantages:
<br>Truthful story, all right told, perfectly painted and just conveniently assembled in the single project!
<br>Disadvantages:
<br>No, not heard.
<br>
<br>In the modern world is so little time for contemplation: few people can afford to stay and just listen to the silence, to look at yourself and your life&apos;s path traversed. To answer the question: why all this happened? ...
<br>However, the silence itself finds us through the art of artists and musicians. Good video game, of course, can be considered a real art. After all, it is intended to bring the light of peace and joy, at the same time, it must be clear and accessible.
<br>
<br>Honestly, I did not play the last five years. But the &quot;Child of Light&quot; - this is not the case: the music has brought me to this game. I was looking for some compositions in the social network, and suddenly stumbled upon the soundtrack of this unique game.
<br>I was so carried away by the fabulous world of Lemuria that almost design my own art for this game.
<br>
<br>Fortunately, many have already written a wide variety of game- play and reviews on the game world. But my heart can not be silent, seeing such beauty as the Child of Light. This music, these poetry, it is the Kingdom of Light ... Excuse me, but then I can not keep silent! Especially when there is a bright catharsis: with every victory in Lemuria the weather changes.
<br>
<br>What I have ever learned from the Queen of Light? She gave me the meaning of life, as I was looking for it last two years of study at the university. Already I tried to find it with someone &apos;s help. And I found it!
<br>After the final scenes I was definitely clear why to live: I just put myself in the place of Aurora, and Lemuria in place of the world in which I am. &quot;I&apos;m not afraid of the threat of sleep&quot; - as Aurora would told in my place. And I just somehow wilted ...
<br>Courage, here&apos;s what you need to overcome your difficulties in life. It would seem that this conclusion is trivial. But as well as it&apos;s beautifully illustrated and you offered to play, with the courage to pass all tests in Lemuria and come out the winner. In the first place, the winner of your fears. And when you see a little girl turns out to be more courageous than you, you want to be at least as she is.
<br>
<br>Thank you all for your attention</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4584723">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Try it and you&apos;ll know if you like Child of Light very early on. The difference between an average game and a bad one is that it takes a few hours playing the former, a few minutes playing the latter, before you get bored and turn it off without any regret nor remaining curiosity.
<br>
<br>A clich&#xE9; story full of secondary clich&#xE9;s, told in rhymes in a poorly-rhyming language. Boring. Constant interruptions by dialogues, line by line, each waiting for your click, like in those annoying Japanese games back in the 80s. Boring. No dialogue branches, because not an RPG: boring. Crafting: boring. No saving, because not an RPG: shame. No control over stats, because not an RPG. And so on. Tactical combat instead of jumping on monsters like in classic platformers: probably a good idea, but the result is quickly repetitive anyway.
<br>
<br>All the points in my rating go to the aesthetics. The visuals, for the music is mediocre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=6383379">Expand</a></span>

<br>My 8 year old daughter and I play this game together. She plays all the main characters and I play the helpful faery(blinding and healing).

Good content for the price of it. A bit lacking pc optimizacion though, few ralentizations here and there. If you like hand drawn graphics and RPG, get it.</span>

Just about every line of dialogue in the game rhymes (the only time it doesn&apos;t is with one character who screws up the obvious rhymes -- ha ha ha, isn&apos;t that so silly??).  This might be a nice RPG for a kid because it&apos;s whimsical and has the silly rhyming and is *easy*... but I didn&apos;t feel like it was marketed to me as such.  The game is pretty, I&apos;ll give it that much.

<br>
<br>PROS:  -Solid graphic &amp; sound design
<br>-Fun combat &amp; puzzle mechanics
<br>-A blast to play for all ages
<br>
<br>CONS:  -Not a deep RPG
<br>-Requires internet connection
<br>-Can get repetitive

It was pretty obvious how amazing this was going to be even before this game came out and Ubisoft definitely lived up to my expectations. The artwork is very beautiful and very pleasing to the eye. You don&apos;t want to rush through but take time to enjoy the visual aspect of the game. The aesthetic side also extends into every part of the game, from the way the main character moves to the beautiful orchestral music. I definitely plan on getting the OST if/when they release it.
<br>
<br>The story is another amazing part of the game. I&apos;ve read a few reviews that try to knock it because &quot;its just a fairytale&quot;. While this is obviously true, it doesn&apos;t detract from the game in the slightest. Ubisoft does a brilliant job of telling a story that, yes, in its simplest, most watered-down form, is just your typical fairytale. There are no real plot-twists, or at least, there are none they try to hide from you. It does have the &quot;evil stepmother&quot; trope and magic and princesses and all the things fairy tales do have. The game, however, fleshes out the story so thoroughly and beautifully that the result is more than satisfactory. The characters are all developed as far as could be expected for the format of the game, and poetic telling of the story just adds to the overall effect. The only other game that is really similar is Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, another fairy tale beautifully told. In the end, the story is as satisfying as the artwork.
<br>
<br>The only thing I was worried about going into the game was the combat. I am not a fan of JRPGs or turn-based combat but I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the combat immensely. If I played it again, however, I would have played on the hard difficulty since the combat is rather easy and I only found it challenging once or twice. I never lost a fight and I only had a few characters die during a battle and that was only towards the end of the game during boss fights. If you dislike JRPG combat, don&apos;t let that stop you from enjoying the game...putting it on normal difficulty will allow you to enjoy the story without worrying about the combat. But if you like JRPG&apos;s or just want a challenge, definitely play on hard. You&apos;ll have to make more use of all the powers your characters have, especially their defensive and buff abilities. In addition, on a harder difficulty you will have to make more use of the gem system in the game, which provide passive abilities for each one of your characters.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game was well worth playing. It took longer than expected (10 hours) and was a beautiful and relaxing experience. It rivals Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons for the most beautiful indie game (yes, I know its Ubisoft, not technically indie) as well as my favorite indie game. It also shows what big gaming studios can produce when they try and hopefully points to a better future for gaming.
<br>
<br>And to anyone who decided not to get this game because of UPlay or because of &quot;first day DLC&quot;. The only DLC in my opinion worth getting is the $2.99 one that unlocks the Golum character. His powers are unique and helpful so he is worth getting. Everything else is aesthetic or unnecessary, including all the little DLC&apos;s that give you gems...you find so many of them in-game, they&apos;re unnecessary. The experience of the game is complete even without the Golum so they didn&apos;t chop out a huge part of the game and then sell it to you as extra. Don&apos;t let it stop you from getting the game. And if you don&apos;t want to play it because of Uplay, I don&apos;t know what to say to you. You&apos;re just losing out on an amazing game because you don&apos;t want to deal with a piece of software that works pretty much smoothly and really causes no problems at all. At least, I&apos;ve never had a single problem with them and I enjoy the rewards you can earn as you progress through whatever game you&apos;re playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4173593">Expand</a></span>

Child of Light not only interested me from when i first heard about it, but it blew me and my expectations away after the first 5 minutes and every minute since. The beautiful watercolour art style, the gentle and mesmeric poetic story telling, the majestic sounds as you flow through different parts of the world, the variety of interesting characters and enemies, and the deep and refreshing combat system, these are what Child of Light brings to the table, the table where not only the indie games sit but so do the AAA games, and believe me when i tell you Child of Light puts all others to shame. Easily contender for Game Of The Year already and one of the best games i have ever played on any system.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4180184">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Never thought I would get to use those lines from Portal 1&apos;s ending theme, but that&apos;s just the case with this game. I am thoroughly impressed with this game on so many levels. From the gameplay, to the music, to the art direction. Hell, to even the text in-game - iambic pentameter for most of the game? I see that as an exemplary amount of effort all around.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a really long review though... So. TL;DR : Buy this game, it&apos;s cheap, and well worth the money. Unless, of course, you dislike the JRPG system, turn-based battle system, and the like.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re willing to read, here goes:
<br>
<br>Gameplay -
<br>
<br>As far as game play goes, it&apos;s a typical RPG with turn-based battles. Pretty much like a traditional JRPG, I would say. In this game, your party comprises a multitude of characters, but you can only bring two (including your main character, the titular Child of Light). I generally enjoy the system, though, particularly the demand for quick thinking on higher difficulties, what with the time-bar thing that forces you to make snap decisions.
<br>
<br>I liked the rudimentary crafting system as well. Making tons of gems to boost my stats was relatively fun, but I am mildly disappointed by the lack of expansion. It wasn&apos;t a major concern however, given the fact there was so much goodness in other aspects to compensate for it.
<br>
<br>Music -
<br>
<br>I had always been a fan of Final Fantasy for a few reasons, one of them is the music. So when I started on this game, just in the title screen alone. Goodness gracious, I cannot believe I actually sat there just staring at the title screen because the main theme was so mesmerizing. Main theme aside, the rest of the pieces do not disappoint. The battle theme was sufficiently dramatic and engaging. The boss battles? Hell, it&apos;s epic.
<br>
<br>The musical themes for specific locations in the game world was also highly relevant. It did an excellent job of setting the right atmosphere as well. Uplifting themes for cheerful situations; depressing themes for situations gone awry. Makes it hard to leave certain locations at times.
<br>
<br>Story and Art Direction -
<br>
<br>Story-wise, this game&apos;s story-telling is definitely reminiscent of a classic fairy tale. It should be obvious from the very beginning, and even through the main character&apos;s name. I don&apos;t even have to say it.
<br>
<br>In any case, I had thought it would be a story that follows that fairy tale. I thought it was going to be something of the same as that fairy tale... And HA. I cannot express how happy I am to say it isn&apos;t. That said, I also greatly appreciate the faithful adherence to iambic pentameter throughout the entire game, from its narration to its character dialogues. Makes me feel like a sir, I would have you know.
<br>
<br>That said, I think the story is more nostalgic than it is stellar. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the story isn&apos;t bad. I just find that it doesn&apos;t exactly innovate enough to really appeal from that direction. Instead, it goes for feelings of nostalgia - something I really felt was very well enmeshed into the story-telling. Playing the game feels like reading a bedtime story - or having it read to you. Made even more amusing by the fact I mostly played it at night.
<br>
<br>Speaking of the story, I think it&apos;s important to also link it to the art direction. I really loved the art in this game. I&apos;m no art critic, but I find it highly reminiscent of children&apos;s picture books. It further ties in with the element of nostalgia as well as the story telling style. So. Bonus compatibility points!
<br>
<br>--
<br>
<br>And that&apos;s why I didn&apos;t spare the full marks. While there was room for improvements here and there, I do not consider them to be striking negatives. They&apos;re negatives, no doubt, but not to the extent that warrants a drop in the score.
<br>
<br>So. BUY IT.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4696461">Expand</a></span>

<br>Are you conflicted in how you feel?
<br>I think so, yes. At $15 it is a steal.
<br>
<br>The art style is homey as well as awing.
<br>The music, fantastic works of art.
<br>A fine RPG with interesting platforming.
<br>And not without story,
<br>A fight of light and dark.
<br>
<br>Don&#x2019;t listen to the haters.
<br>Don&#x2019;t listen to those bad men.
<br>Listen to me instead.
<br>This game is a 10/10.</span>

There&apos;s an interesting story to be told here, and some charming, if a little pretentious, writing carries you along throughout. The combat system does have a few interesting quirks and mechanics, but battles tend to drag on a little too long. Fortunately, there are no random encounters. Character development is straightforward. The skill point and Oculi enhancement system is shallow, but it does the job.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: Should you play it? Yes. Personally, I found it to be a nice change of pace, and highly recommend it to anyone who is suffering from PTSD due to the likes of Dark Souls and cookie-cutter FPS titles. It&apos;s a very pretty JRPG with a world that is easy to get lost in. Stay a while--it&apos;s like a nice warm hug rather than a ballistic round/battleaxe to the face.
<br>
<br>(Don&apos;t forget: my opinion doesn&apos;t mean anything--just like verything on this site. Cheers.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4182518">Expand</a></span>

Not usually a fan of 2D games OR turn based combat, but this game does turn based combat in a very fun way. The art style looks great, the dialogue throughout the game and rhyming style give the world a distinct feel. Soundtrack is great too.</span>

That is where the greatness of Child of Light stops. Everything else is simply not attractive enough to make me want to play, during my time with the game, I had to force myself to play it every time. The story is at first exciting and interesting, but falls flat very quickly. The actions, plots and twists of the story are too predictable, I wasn&apos;t at any point surprised. The gameplay is actually decent enough, just strolling around solving puzzles, fighting different type of monsters and exploring to find the next &apos;epic&apos; chest. Then why a score of 3? It all becomes very repetitive in a matter of minutes and it is waaay too easy, no real skill is required to succed in the game at all. The different types of enemies are way to similar for my taste.

<br>
<br>Difficulty is either too easy on &quot;Normal&quot; or an archaic grind on &quot;Hard&quot;, where everything takes 5x as long because it&apos;s simulating the grindfest difficulty of something like the original &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. HP regeneration system out of battle could be better, can&apos;t use party members abilities out of combat to heal so left gathering wishes for maybe 10hp per plant or using your cursor to heal your character for 1% of their HP every 3 seconds.
<br>
<br>You only have two active party members during combat and a larger cast to choose from than the average &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; title (excluding FF6 here), so I think it would&apos;ve been better if they&apos;d bumped the party size up to 3 and added an extra enemy or two to make the difficulty scale.
<br>
<br>Graphics are gorgeous and so is the soundtrack.
<br>
<br>No world map to explore or shops to buy equipment/items in. Outside of the grindy leveling system (only if you&apos;re playing on hard) and the classic JRPG battle system with a twist, this is really just a lip-service JRPG with some modern 2d indie adventure elements thrown in.
<br>
<br>Every line of dialogue in this game rhymes, and more often than not the writing is cringeworthy because of this.  It&apos;d be different if they wrote it as a poem to make sense, as it is it&apos;s like they went out of their way to make everything rhyme, even if it didn&apos;t make sense, it just had to fit their agenda.  It isn&apos;t nonsensical in a &quot;Doctor Suess&quot; way, it&apos;s nonsensical in an &quot;average kindergarten student writes their first haiku&quot; way.
<br>
<br>Not a &quot;must buy&quot; by any means, but if you&apos;re a fan of JRPGs it&apos;s worth checking out because not only do we rarely see games like this these days on consoles, we hardly ever get something like this on PC. Doesn&apos;t instantly make it an outstanding game for being a few drops of rain during a drought, but it&apos;s a welcome change of pace nonetheless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4170083">Expand</a></span>

It takes various element from far better games, but completely fails to emulate those elements and put them to good use. It&apos;s a poor replacement for the genre it attempts to mimic.
<br>The only positive thing I can say is that Child of Light is very pretty. If it was a visual novel and you&apos;re Japanese, that would actually matter. But in reality, pretty graphics don&apos;t mean **** So my one compliment was a back-handed one. This review is off to a great start.
<br>Everyone else&apos;s complaint is the rhyming . More me, it was the worst **** part of the game. I don&apos;t even mean from a literary stand point, I just thought it was **** stupid. It got to the point where I&apos;d mindlessly press the spacebar without reading. The need to construct all the narrative and dialog as if it was poetry was very distracting and took me out of the experience.
<br>One thing I noticed about this game was it&apos;s similarities to Eternal Sonata in terms of the story. I&apos;d rather not even talk about that game, so I&apos;ll just say: if you&apos;ve played it you know exactly what I mean with a dying person&apos;s dream aspect. If you however have not played Enternal Sonata then good for you, and don&apos;t bother playing COL either.
<br>Combat and leveling are the two most important parts of any good RPG and COL is a mismatched of Final Fantasy X and Persona 3, but mostly FFX. In battle you have access to only 2 characters at a time. At the bottom of the screen is a bar with portraits of each of the combatants. Once one of the character&apos;s cursor reaches the red portion of the time bar you can make you commands. You can then attack, defend, use an item, or switch them out for one of your reserved party members much like in FFX.
<br>If at the same time an enemy is posed to attack you can shine you mouse controlled firefly to slow down their attack. If done correctly and you hit them first, the enemy will be interrupted. Of course your attacks can be interrupted also, so deciding whether attempting to interrupt them or if defending is a better option, seeing at guarding will decrease the amount of time before your next turn.
<br>The time bar and interruptions kinda reminds me of the knock down system from Persona 3 just not nearly as fun. It does add a level of strategic thinking and make the battles more intense, but I found it mostly annoying. It sounds cool and innovative on paper but in practice it&apos;s more of a chore.
<br>Another nod toward FINAL FANTASY X is COL&apos;s skill trees. Ok it&apos;s not really a tree and there aren&apos;t many skills. The board is mostly occupied my stat upgrades, much like FFX&apos;s sphere grid. But unlike Ten, when a character levels up, so does their stats, which makes assigning skill points more like a bonus. Which isn&apos;t bad, I&apos;d just rather have access to more attacks and passive skills.
<br>There is also a rune system calls oculics. Basically you can attach the stones to one of the three slots on each character. Depending on which of the three you place the stone, their influence with change accordingly. Such as a red stone on a weapon causes fire damage while when in the armor slot increases resistance to fire. Pretty simple and basic, and boring. You can also craft the stone pieces into larger more powerful ones but wait until you got about 20 or so before you start **** with that.
<br>Since enemy during the 4th chapter will start having elemental abilities and weaknesses, it best to set up each member of you party to combat and resist a particular element. So make sure to keep multiples and leaving crafting until later.
<br>There are no random battle in COL. An enemy encounter is represented by a single enemy, much like the fore mentioned Persona 3. Also like P3 you can sneak up on the enemy by using your firefly to blind them to gain an advantage in the up coming fight. Or you could just fly over them.
<br>Now i&apos;m just going to list some more of my gripes about this game before wrapping this review up:
<br>No weapons or armor to buy or find.
<br>Items still show up when you scroll through the list in battle, even when you don&apos;t have it anymore.
<br>The Puzzles are less puzzling then the praise this game gets
<br>It&apos;s boring.
<br>I just can&apos;t get over how lame this game it. It&apos;s so boring. When it&apos;s not boring it&apos;s tedious. And when it&apos;s not tedious it&apos;s boring. Jesus who&apos;s idea was it to make everything rhyme. I spent 4 hours with this game. The first hour I really gave it a shot. My entire first hour in up on youtube so go see if I&apos;m gave this game a fair try. Because by hour 2 I was ready to stop. I don&apos;t really like to bring up other games in my reviews. I&apos;d rather base my experience on the game at hand. But I just can&apos;t help it. COL takes ideas and mechanics from other games, leaving me wishing I was playing them instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4272081">Expand</a></span>

<br>You have to pay more attention to the timeline to avoid getting pushed back, unless if your characters are lucky enough to dodge the attack.
<br>The music is what makes this game more worthy than ever. I use to reload an autosave just to listen to the boss battle music forever.
<br>How about the art? It&apos;s beautiful and sad at the same time.

Your companions are great and there are many of them to chose from. Combat can get annoying at times. Bit on the short side for an rpg.</span>

<br>*Personal Note:
<br>I had 0 (Zero) problems with the Uplay. Yes, it is annoying to install another game client but for me installing on Windows 8.1 had no problems. I was even able to play the game in Offline Mode so please give love to this game! Share it!
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>+An excelent RPG
<br>+Music, Voice Acting and SFX are remarkable!
<br>+Colorful and dark.
<br>+Easy Learning Curve
<br>+Perfect for young and new audience of the RPG genre.
<br>+It&apos;s $15! Great value!
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-Only 8-12 hours for an RPG... but is more of a nitpick. You can play again on a harder difficulty with all your Skills.
<br>-Narration toward the end stops and leaves wanting more exposition of the world and the main characters.
<br>-Main characters interactions are minimal. Sadly you will only be attach to their skills and not their personalities.
<br>-It leaves you wanting more! The ending felt kind of rush.
<br>
<br>Comment, discuss, video response, we will talk about it... next time.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t forget you can get your intro here on The Viewer by sending me a video response on YouTube! It&apos;s easier that way :D

Definitely a must play and a must buy, barring uplay issues.</span>

<br>
<br>The combination of side-scrolling exploration, challenging turn-based tactical gameplay, amusing rhyming dialogues and a wonderful art style makes Child of Light an unusual but enjoyable gem.
<br>
<br>You&apos;ll quickly fall in love with the beatifully drawn landscapes of Lemuria as you travel through its dark forests, mountains and even under the sea. They are typically riddled with secret areas you can sniff out for treasure, puzzles or hidden bosses. Often there&apos;ll be more than one path to your destination, making exploration more interesting.
<br>
<br>During your travels, you&apos;ll meet many fun characters who&apos;ll give your quests, join you in your adventure, or both. My favourite was a female jester who couldn&apos;t do the dialogues in a proper rhyming fashion, allowing the other characters to jump in and correct her. Her healing abilities were also very welcome in a fight, making her one of my most used characters during combat.
<br>
<br>The combat is turn-based but has a real-time element that lets you delay enemies&apos; turn or slightly heal your party out of turn. Timing this ability is important to winning encounters, as it lets you better use or avoid being the victim of the interrupt mechanic. Interrupting means hitting a character trying to perform an action, resulting in his turn being delayed. If you don&apos;t go for the easy difficulty, combat offers good and rewarding challenge that makes you invest time into considering how to specialise your characters.
<br>
<br>Each character has a network of specialisation trees, offering abilities unique to him while giving you a choice between the different paths. For example, there&apos;s a wizard who can specialise in lightning, water or fire, allowing him to excel against certain creature types vulnerable to his focused element. Another character can choose between improving his defense, his offense or his ability to direct enemy attacks against him.
<br>
<br>A problem that grows as the size of your party increases, is the frequency of level ups. Very quickly you&apos;ll be looking at one or multiple level ups after pretty much every battle as your characters gain levels and extra skill points to spend. It becomes tedious looking at the skill tree menu this often.
<br>
<br>Another part of character customisation is the Oculi system. Oculi are gems you gather and can use kind of like equipment items such as swords and armor in other games. They offer different bonuses depending on color and slot used, and can be combined to form more powerful gems. Oculi juggling gets a little cumbersome, but is nonetheless an important strategic element as you want to equip the right damage and resistance types depending on the opposition of your current area.
<br>
<br>Apart from having trouble with Steam starting the game through Uplay for some reason initially, the only bug I noticed in the actual game was that sometimes when entering combat, Aurora&apos;s (the main character) usually flowing hair wasn&apos;t drawn.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re not playing on Easy difficulty and like to explore and look for secrets, you should expect around 20 hours of gameplay from Child of Light.
<br>
<br>TIP: While Child of Light offers controller support, I really must recommend using mouse and keyboard. You will need the precision to properly manage the real-time element of the otherwise turn-based combat.
<br>
<br>TIP: If, like me, you have trouble starting the game through Steam, try launching Uplay directly and start the game from there. After doing that, it&apos;s been working for me no problem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=5188699">Expand</a></span>

But storyline is totally spoiled by atrocious rhyming conceit. Could have benefited from authors reading beautiful classics the Little Magic Horse during conception. Gameplay limiting, but ok. Music beautiful at first, but incredibly repetitive. Had people watching ask to turn it off. Sad, because this should be nice for viewers too... but they found the whole thing too repetitive. Tries to tell a story... fails in many ways.
<br>Wasn&apos;t enough in it for adults. Fight scenes would have benefited from indication of health of enemy. Overall, found it very intellectually dead. Great that female characters dominated... hate the only two archetypes available: simpering idiot ie Aurora and wicked stepsisters.
<br>Glad I paidfor it to see something different and interesting. I want to encourage this kind of experiment. Would still buy again. But REALLY sad that they buried that story in the awful rhyme. This is a story driven game and I was only surprised or interested at one point in the game. Other than that completely predictable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4427919">Expand</a></span>

Many of its mechanics are reminiscent of Final Fantasy X &#x2013; including some painful dialogue.
<br>
<br>The game&#x2019;s combat is actually reasonably sophisticated. The player controls two characters in combat, and faces off with up to three enemies at a time. It is somewhat reminiscent of Final Fantasy X in many respects; the player can switch out their characters at any time during combat, including replacing KOed characters with another character, and different attacks have different speeds. However, unlike Final Fantasy X, there are two different speeds which matter: the base speed of the character, and the speed at which the character acts.
<br>There are two portions of a gauge at the bottom of the screen; the first portion represents the time spent between turns, while the second, smaller section represents the time spent charging up to attack or perform some other action. Each action has its own speed through the second portion of this, and if someone is attacked while they are charging an action, their action is interrupted and their turn is reset into some random (or semi-random) portion of the between-turns section of the gauge. As such, the player can interrupt enemy attacks, or the enemies can interrupt player attacks. There are some means of protecting yourself from such things, and some monsters will automatically counterattack against certain types of attacks (physical or magical) or against attacks made while they&#x2019;re charging their actions.
<br>The characters are actually quite varied, with each character having their own skill-set which is unlocked via a character-specific skill tree. Each character has their own set of abilities, and there are two characters who are primarily magic users, a warrior who can force enemies to attack him, a character who focuses entirely on speeding up or slowing down allies and enemies, a couple of physical attack characters, and some support characters. Gauge manipulation, interrupting enemy attacks, exploiting enemy elemental vulnerabilities, and applying the right status ailments while keeping your own party healthy are all important. The ball of light you control while navigating the levels also appears here, and can be used to slow down enemies or heal your allies &#x2013; it is almost always better to slow enemies, though, as that prevents them from doing damage (and makes it easier to interrupt them) much more than healing yourself does.
<br>Unfortunately, after a while, the battles become a bit routine; while the first set of enemies in an area are new and fresh, after a while they become very routine and can be defeated via a very samey set of actions in the same way that Final Fantasy X fights often went. This makes many of the fights in the game fairly dull, and while they&#x2019;re skippable, the bosses, which are much more difficult, basically require you to beat every other enemy in the game so that you&#x2019;re the proper level to face them.
<br>
<br>The game is reasonably well-presented; the game tries to go for a sort of storybook style, with the characters appearing almost like paper cut-outs or things from a storybook, and the monsters having a similar stylized character. The music and sound are both reasonable enough, but a lot of the dialogue &#x2013; delivered entirely in rhyme &#x2013; is pretty awful. Sometimes it works well, but other times it falls down and is kind of painful to read.
<br>
<br>Child of Light is not a bad game, but it isn&#x2019;t exactly thrilling either. Everything about it is a decent enough idea, but in practice, it only shines on rare occasion. The game takes on the order of 20 hours to complete, and has no replay value; while there is a new game + mode, there is little reason to play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4965141">Expand</a></span>

Combat has its moments, some of the bosses are interesting to fight on the hard difficulties. Overall a very average game.</span>

about the</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Pros: simple yet beautiful graphics; extremely well done sound tracks (emphasis on &quot;extremely&quot;); well-crafted characters that you will care about; innovative gameplay mechanics, namely firefly and interruption; well-written dialogue lines; low price (gotta list this out).
<br>-
<br>Cons: cliche story;&quot;puzzles&quot; in the game require zero effort to solve (hence the quotation marks).
<br>-
<br>about the difficulty of this game: at normal difficulty Child of Light is quite easy, you can almost avoid taking dmg completely as you will keep interrupting enemies from completing their attacks, I completed the whole story without breaking a sweat; on hard however the role between player and played suddenly changes, enemies are much faster and interruption have little effect on them, hence making them the ones to interrupt and outplay you. When fighting regular foes feel like boss fights, you know a game is hard.
<br>-
<br>Overall Child of Light undoubtedly proves itself worthy of every gamers time and $15. Go ahead and pick it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4386136">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Update: One thing bothers me... there&apos;s only party with 2 people at once, this hurts much. Very sad that it has to be this way. Also the game progress turns out a bit too unexciting and linear in therms of character evolving and story telling.
<br>
<br>Another game which is very similar (imo also much better) but a bit more action oriented is called Aquaria which i also recommend highly.
<br>
<br>All in all, great game, great work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4990639">Expand</a></span>

Everything about this game from the story to the combat is simply a masterpiece. Let me start of by the saying the whole game has been hand drawn using the rayman engine which to me for a 10 pound game (UK currency) is simply fantastic. The amount of detail and craftsmanship that has been poured into this game is fa-nominal. The story is again scripted and planned out by absolute geniuses. The whole game and story is told with poetry though this may not appeal to everyone it still tells the story beautifully in my opinion. The game play is unique and fresh setting it apart from many other turn based strategy games. Overall the game is a masterpiece and I recommend it to be played by anyone and especially rpg fans. For 10 pounds this is a steal and is well worth the price. For anyone that has any doubts about buying this game please do its one that cant and shouldn&apos;t be missed!

<br>It is really a strange idea to mix rogue platform jumper with turn based combat which appears in tradtional rpg. In the end, both edges of the corresponding genre just lose. As a platform jumper game, you will not have a chance to finish off opponenet by fast jumping and reflex action. As a rpg game, you miss the open world experience you will generaly expect.
<br>
<br>In the end, you are playing a platform jumper game only to solve puzzle without threat, and a rpg game progressing in a linear fashion. It is just too boring. Mixing genres of game may not always be a good idea if the elements in the genres can&apos;t resonate with each other.

As others have said normal is way too easy and hard is just grindy, not actually hard. Combat system is stolen from Grandia with slight changes, e.g. making it simpler so people can pretend they are playing an actual RPG. This game has terrible rhymes and takes itself too seriously, considering the poor writing. The atmosphere and music are not half bad but this is supposed to be a game and not a children&apos;s tale or a heavy rain clone, right?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4171129">Expand</a></span>

Because you level up almost every battle, you&apos;re practically forced to fight every single battle so that you&apos;re not under leveled for bosses.  And the final boss fights were the easiest in the entire game.  My least favorite aspect to the game was all of the leveling/skill/oculi.  After every battle you had to deal with adding new skill points or managing your oculi which became incredibly tedious and frustrating.  It broke up the flow of the game when you had to constantly stop to do maintenance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4172581">Expand</a></span>

<br>*Sound* The rhymes in the dialogues create a pleasant musicality, even though they become too solemn at times. The soundtrack is very relaxing, and it plays and important part in the story.
<br>*Game* Usual clich&#xE9; of &quot;Good vs Evil&quot;, it&apos;s not surprising nor unprecedented. The fighting system is nice, being turn-based, and one has to choose the best two characters among many to fight certain enemies. Playing on &quot;Hard&quot; is actually hard only in the very first fights, becoming way too easy as the game progresses. It&apos;s possible to play with another person from the same computer, which is nice.
<br>Overall I think I would recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=4918461">Expand</a></span>

The trailer said it was a jrpg, but apart from the combats, which reminds me of some Final Fantasy games, CoL is just a simplified version of a rpg; still, the game strength lies in its beautiful graphic and in the rhymed dialogues.

<br>
<br>The great combinition Ubisoft Montr&#xE9;al has built with Child of Light of beautiful art design, wonderfully developed gameplay, music that plays feelings....build up a game that obviously inspires sorrow emotions. A masterpiece given world to players that contains amazing fantasy creatures. Levelling up system which is sort of traditional of theory more than satisfying though. Crafting which I felt a bit of &apos;unnecessary much&apos; from the plenty amount of same items encountered with each random and every chest. howerever, satisfying for a small add.
<br>
<br>Although Child of Light is great, recovers some elements of Journey and confidently overcomes games attempting to make this approach. but it doesn&apos;t seem that worth playing towards &apos;ending up&apos; somehow unfortunately left me with disappointments that it can very simply avoid rather than. indeed.

If you like games like A Tale of Two Brothers, this game is for you. I really like the small addition of skill points/tree and crafting system. Gives it a little hint of an rpg for such a simple game. Although it was quite short.</span>

Child of light is strategic, impactful, and satisfying.
<br>
<br>For those of you looking for a first game to get your significant other into gaming, you&apos;ve found it. Let your partner control the girl while you take control of the wisp to help turn the tides of battle while allowing him/her more time to decide how to orchestrate what attacks/spells/items to use. The inventory system is possibly a little tedious for the simple nature of the game, and the skill paths are perhaps a little long considering the length of the game, but overall the game comes together in a way that emphasizes playability over skill/inventory management (a common issue for RPGs) or repetition. The bosses are epic, the battles are engaging, and the characters are, for the most part, diverse and useful.
<br>
<br>While the game is visually pleasing, the art direction isn&apos;t incredibly inspired. Despite this, the animation is nonetheless unquestionably unique and memorable. The worst thing about this game hands down is the dialogue... a man can only read through so many nursery rhymes before being forced to blow his own brains out.
<br>
<br>Pick this game up if you have someone you&apos;re close with who is open-minded towards video games&#xA0;&#x2013; Child of Light may manage to captivate them and teach them the value of gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=5431550">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game was amazing! The art style is absolutely beautiful and the gameplay is turn-based RPG goodness at it&apos;s best. From the opening, I knew this was gonna be a great game, but the game actually turned out better than I was even expecting and packed some amazing boss battles. The game is pretty long for a $15 and is very well done. I didn&apos;t get bored or tired of playing this game at all, in fact I wanted to scour the world for collectibles, level up my characters, unlock more skills and complete every side mission. Though I was so focused on the story itself, I was trying to get to the next area.
<br>
<br>The gameplay itself is more inspired by games like Metroid and Castlevania (Metroidvania) with stat buffs and items spread out around the world, there&apos;s a lot of hidden goodies as well. I did a few side missions here and there, collected some confession letters, but I definitely want to go back and complete every mission, get every collectible and max out the skill tree. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes old school RPGs mixed in with some great gameplay and a beautifully written story.
<br>
<br>If you have $15 to spare, definitely consider getting Child Of Light, it&apos;s great fun from start to finish!
<br>
<br>I give it a 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=5843349">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Beautiful game. Better than I expected. Simple but very enjoyable.
<br>- The art is amazing. Another &quot;UbiArt Framework&quot; engine win.
<br>- Your party has various different characters. They are funny to read and watch the interaction with each other after a battle.
<br>- The turn-based combat system has a very understandable layout. Another good thing is that after the first half of the game you keep discovering new tricks during the battles. Is simple but is has a few interesting interactions.
<br>- The score is very good. A bit repetitive during battles but one of those OST you would love to have on your iPod / mp3 player.
<br>- Puzzles are OK. There&apos;re a few repeated ideas but they are not boring and hard.
<br>- The Oculi crafting system is good. Maybe you&apos;ll need to play more after beating the game to achieve all the 600 combinations. I think I&apos;ll replay the game on handheld (PSVita). Again, is a beautiful looking game.
<br>- Is an accessible game even for non-RPG fans.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- A bit short compared to other games in the genre but I think it was a good experience. BTW the lenght depends on how much you go to little optional areas. The bad thing about exploring too much is that if you grind and level up your party faster than is expected you can feel the game a bit easy.
<br>- UPlay...of course...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?user_review_id=7089406">Expand</a></span>
