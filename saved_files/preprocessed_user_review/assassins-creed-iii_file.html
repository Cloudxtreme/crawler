Graphics are no big improvement but the visuals are great. The characters I don&apos;t even remember... seriously who was in this game? Never touched multiplayer as this game disgusted me to no end. It was... just... awful. There is no more Assassinating in Assassin&apos;s Creed too... I noticed as I watched my friend Livestream it he just tomahawked all his victims... there was no stealthy approach or anything... 2/10 because of visual... love of God gaming industry you&apos;re just failing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3082521">Expand</a></span>

I decided I&apos;d rather watch the ending on YouTube than suffer through the insanity of game design. My monumental disappointment stems from the realization that such an incredible game series has fallen so very far since the first and second games, including their variants. Despite being a &quot;stealth&quot; game, accomplishing objectives with stealth is either impossible or unrewarding. Lockpicking is a hair-pulling affair, the enemy AI is laughable, and travel (despite being reworked in a more advantageous way) is even more of an annoyance. Heaven forbid you run into the rock wall of a cliff above you and need to choose left or right. If you choose wrong, you&apos;re running ALL the way back. There&apos;s no way to climb up, the trees nearby don&apos;t go high enough, and you can&apos;t Fast Travel to a closer location to start again because Fast Travel is turned off during a quest. The only thing I love about this game is the music. An incredible score keeps up the exciting tempo. Such a waste, though. God damnit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2810714">Expand</a></span>

My first review composed of a lot of swearing, but I have decided to refine it...
<br>I love Assasins Creed. The story, the characters, the open-world and free-running freedom and the choice to go at your own pace. The series seemed to go from strength-to-strength (with the exception of Revelations), however when I played this game, I couldn&apos;t believe at how arrogant the game is. The first 4 hours of the game, you are dictated what to do non-stop. The cut-scenes happen far too often and rather than allowing you to skip conversations during a cut-scene to speed it up, the only options you have are to watching the entire scene - which are usually incredibly drawn out and slow paced - or to skip the scene entirely. I don&apos;t like being left in the dark, but Assasins Creed 3 seems to like to test the gamer&apos;s patience with the abundantly pedantic amount of cut-scenes. It feels as if every time you are getting momentum, suddenly, a wild lengthy cut-scene appears! Also, ignore every review that addresses amazing new free-running. It&apos;s not amazing it&apos;s actually disasterous and completely unneccesary. The game has now taken away your choice as to when you want to climb/jump and when you only want to run. Now, when you run, you automatically will climb/jump. This sounds great, except for some reason, the developers decided to slow your character down when jumping/climbing to the point where I&apos;d rather just run away from enemies instead of performing the seamless parkour that was evident in the earlier titles. Most of the time, my character tries to climb or jump onto a nearby barell/box during a chase that I wasn&apos;t even aiming towards. Next up, combat. Combat is always fun right? The developers decided to find a way to mess that up too. Your counter-attacks can now be countered as well, which is kind of ridiculous when surrounded by strong enemies who take away your health each time they counter your counter-attack. So there&apos;s no way around that but to discourage combat, which nobody wants to do. The leap-back move has been taken out, because the game would rather you time your blocks, even if it means the enemy can counter your blocks which you cannot stop. You can no longer grab enemies. The menu to select weapons has now been taken from a nice, seamless, in-game experience to a full blown menu which covers your whole screen. Which you still need to hold the button in for. Instead of an easy inventory-wheel seen in previous titles, the weapon-select menu shows the weapons in a column view, which is rather annoying and doesn&apos;t allow a &quot;snap-select&quot;, you now have to scroll through each and every weapon to get to the one you want. Did I mention there are only 4 quick buttons? So we are now forced to use this unpleasant menu more frequently. Horses are completely useless when not being used on roads and trails because although they have no problem jumping up hills, they seem to have a problem jumping down again. It&apos;s little, irritating things like this that make me really not care about the game. It&apos;s just irritating and not a joy to play. Even the amazing visuals and life in the busy streets of 1700&apos;s New York isn&apos;t enough to distract the disgustingly obvious flaws. There are no bugs in this game, the entire game is even more flawed and unfinished than Dragon Age 2 ever was. It seems that the developers were so excited about finishing the game, they decided to distribute it before they could discover on how to make it better.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s just too much wrong with this game. Play it for yourself and see.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2810083">Expand</a></span>

Jump from one building to another, you just alerted a guard who was standing below you who takes aim- shoots you in mid air (1.5 seconds airborne from one building to the next) and using his IPHONE notified every single British in Boston to your EXACT location-  Every British soldier converges on your location and using their extensive PARKOUR training they all leap from building to building to kill you. All while moving around the base of the building underneath you constantly tracking your location with their XRAY vision.

<br>This shouldn&apos;t even be called AC3, they took everything that made it Assassin&apos;s Creed out. It&apos;s not like the old Splinter Cell games that the first Assassin&apos;s Creed was modeled after. The only similarity between the first one and this one is the less than perfect movement. There is a linear path in this game, no creativity at all, the only path you can choose is the order in which you complete the now mandatory Synchronizations. You have to do missions a certain way or you fail, you don&apos;t get to try new things unless it&apos;s convenient for the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2789090">Expand</a></span>

Instead it falls flat because of game design errors and a story not really suited for a &quot;open world/free roaming&quot;-game. So, what is good about AC III? The music is the best in the series, the score really adds a whole new level of cinematic feeling. The world is so huge and detailed it really makes everything feel like a real world. The art design is also amazing, making the houses, the characters and cities come alive like never before. The quality of the voice acting is very varied, with some of the best and worst voice acting ever heard in a game (the voice actor of Haytham Kenway is doing an amazing job while whoever voice acts Braddock does one of the worst and most overacted voice actings ever done). Also the PC-port is really good. The controls work well and the graphics are well optimized.  So what is bad? Basically everything that has to do with the game design. The choices made make this, what could&apos;ve been an amazing open world game like Red Dead Redemption, a linear &quot;Call of Duty-style&quot; game - with about every mission being linear with some cutscene cinematics that totally breaks the immersion of being in a living world. The combat could also have been amazing, if it weren&apos;t for the broken balance. You can EASILY kill up to 40-50 enemies at the same time without being hurt at all (haven&apos;t had the chance to meet more enemies at the same time). Not to mention the extreme curvature of difficulty levels. One mission can be dead easy (kill 100 enemies and murder some random bloke that you don&apos;t know why you are killing) while the next one is some kind of sneak mission, where when you are seen, you have to restart from the start of the mission. However, the animations are brilliant, probably some of the best combat animations I&apos;ve seen in a game up to this date, the controls work great on a keyboard and the weapons are all interesting. Too bad the game designer destroyed both the combat and the immersion of the missions. So what about the plot? Is it good? Well, the plot is all just very jumpy. The &quot;jumpiness&quot; does not add any depth (such as seen in movies like Donnie Darko) and just destroys the immersion even more. The whole animus thing just feels stupid (I think it was better made in Assassin&apos;s Creed II, where the immersion was pretty good) and the twists and turns are all very clich&#xE9; and predictable. Basically I think the story harms the game more than it helps it. So, instead of having an awesome &quot;open world&quot;-esque game (such as AC II) we are left with a jumpy, linear piece of garbage (that overuses cutscenes like never before - making this feel like a linear movie more than a game) only made for total newbs of PC-gaming. Why not add difficulty levels?? And then there are the minor flaws. The game is very buggy compared to the earlier games. The story is very predictable. The player is thrown between indoors, outdoors, animus and real world. In all these 4 different kinds of places different rules apply. You can only walk indoors (which once again removes immersion - why suddenly can&apos;t I jump, run or w/e). The UI is filled with strange popups (mission popups, Uplay popups, **** achievement popups that I don&apos;t care about at all and worst of all mail popups - why do an indian guy way back in time have access to mail??). All in all this game has amazing music, amazing voice actors, amazing combat animations, an amazing world with amazing art design but on the downside really bad game design, an UI that removes immersion, only easy difficulty with a strange difficulty curve and a strange, clich&#xE9; and jumpy plot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2781894">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Bethesda&apos;s Dishonored makes Ubisoft and their team look like fools. Assassin&apos;s Creed III is one of the more disappointing games to be released this year. Don&apos;t fool yourself by reading the review by IGN, BECAUSE Ubisoft paid for that review. I&apos;m sure over the next couple of weeks I will have to listen to all the simple minded **** who bought the game and are too afraid to admit how stagnant the series has become. The game emphasizes cinematics with a cutscene for every 5 gameplay minutes, which seems to serve as Ubisoft&apos;s effort to distract the player from the slow, simple, and glitchy gameplay. Marketing will fool the majority of the tools, hopefully not you, but this game is a failure. If you want to play it then pirate it so you can save your money for bourbon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2781073">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve waited for it, but it&apos;s not as good, as I expected. Good graphics, good gameplay, but not the best story. The character of Connor is easy to forget, not like Ezio or Altair. I liked the game, but it&apos;s not the best in this series.</span>

One of the missions to retain two main crafters is bugged so you can&apos;t hire them. The only thing you can really do is hunt and skin and sell. They did a great job on the huge areas of movement and the ship battles are spectacular and exciting! Hopefully they will stay on this path and the next chapter will be just as exciting to play. By the way it&apos;s about 4 days or so to complete at 8 hours a day so it&apos;s worth the purchase!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2779226">Expand</a></span>

<br>Initially the game felt good. But then I realized that there isn&apos;t much to do. Story is boring. Anyway to cut a long story short  people that rated 7+ /10 are obviously unfamiliar with AC 1</span>

<br>And the Desmond stuff.

<br>I owe ME3 an apology.

Done. Check.
<br>Now with the negative :
<br>1. This is the most boring and clumsiest assassin you&apos;ll ever see in your life. This character  I already forgot his name just to say  is the total opposite of Ezio  no charisma whatsoever, no substance, no facial resemblance with any of the glorious assassin family Desmond is the last heir of, boring voice and poor abilities. You can&apos;t get attached to such a dull character and have any fun using him. You just can&apos;t.
<br>2. All the Assassin&apos;s Creed games sucked me in from the very beginning of the story and glued me to my screen, wasting countless hours to make the scenario and characters progress. This one is so annoying, I have no interest in making anything progress and knowing what happened to the saga. I didn&apos;t even understand why Desmond ended up in the animus reenacting this stupid ancestor memories. Nothing&apos;s explained or makes sense. It&apos;s like, yeah whatever, just do it because well, it&apos;s an Assassin&apos;s Creed game so let&apos;s just milk the same cow again and issue a new episode of the series.
<br>3. The game-play has been revised for the worst. Listen Ubisoft, there&apos;s one golden rule in gaming and in programming in general: if it ain&apos;t broken, don&apos;t fix it. Don&apos;t. Just don&apos;t. Ever. Instead, you just frustrated millions of players who enjoyed so far the continuity of playing all Assassin&apos;s Creed games the same way but you also made it much worse by complicating for no reason a fluid interface with boring menus/sub-menus and counter-intuitive controls. This is an epic failure.
<br>4. The AI. Oh my! The AI is as equally retarded than it is deadly, depending on the time, the scenario and the situation. This is such a marker for a failed product to see the vast dichotomy between AI characters accepting you just vanished because you hid behind a barrel in their plain sight as it is when they accurately shoot you to near death when you&apos;re jumping from one roof to another, while alerting instantly every other patrols within a 50 miles radius around you.
<br>5. Gazillions of bugs everywhere. For everything. We&apos;re not talking about specific glitches in specific areas and such. Direct and obvious bugs like the character&apos;s cape going crazy and making him look like a ridiculous bat whenever climbing any tall structure. This is not something you can miss. Clearly, you haven&apos;t tested your product at all. Or if you have, you clearly have no respect for your customers in attempting to deliver any level of quality for your products. Let&apos;s just issue the damn thing and bang money as much as we can before they realize they bought a piece of crap. The fact that Ubisoft publicly told their customers they have no intention to fix any of the bugs, well I guess we all know now how they consider them (moooo!).
<br>6. Missions  90% of the time, I have no clue why I&apos;m doing a mission or what I&apos;m supposed to do. I just try random things until it seems that the mission progresses. The story is so botched that they didn&apos;t even try to provide explanations of why you&apos;re doing something in the game now.
<br>Overall, the whole thing feels very sour: the great saga that lasted for a decade now has been burnt to the ground by the greediness of Ubisoft executives in a clumsy attempt to milk their customers. From what I can read from gamers about AC IV, it&apos;s pretty much the same disaster. Guess what, won&apos;t buy it. Well, well done Ubisoft for shooting yourself in the foot and killing one of the greatest saga in gaming history.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3902701">Expand</a></span>

It&#x2019;s not acceptable!

Even if this game had no other flaws, and it most certainly does, the completely nonchalant way the entire main story is just thrown away like so much tiresome refuse is unforgivable and justifies the 0 rating. I&apos;ll stop short of spoilers here, but if you enjoyed Desmond&apos;s story save yourself the time and just avoid this game.
<br>
<br>Beyond that, Connor has to be the least likeable protagonist in any game I have ever played. His bipolar personality swings wildly between angry, whiny, and aloof. He&apos;s completely self absorbed and only one point in the game does he give any indication of empathy and self reflection. He makes no attempt to appreciate or honor the creed, the history of the order, or the man that taught him the skills. And he just generally doesn&apos;t seem to &quot;get&quot; the assassins.
<br>
<br>For instance, Altair and Ezio both practiced quick kills. Kills that are both efficient, which one needs when fighting multiple enemies, and humane. And while Ezio does add more flare, and hits, to his combos, they both respect the life they are taking, even if they don&apos;t respect actions of those they are killing. Connor does not. His combos are brutal barrages of strikes, roughly 10-15 total and nearly each one fatal all on its own, that are not only a tremendous waste of time but a disrespectful display of power and cruelty. Is it rewarding as a player? Sure, until you realize it runs completely counter to what the assassins are all about.
<br>
<br>And even all of that is just the tip of the iceberg. There are TONS of bugs in the game. One of my favorites was entering the homestead to find THREE copies of Connor&apos;s mentor, one seated in the chair and two standing one behind the other. And then there&apos;s the craptastic wardrobe malfunctions near the end of Connor&apos;s story. The &quot;stealth&quot; is useless and inconsistent in this game, as many reviews have pointed out. Missions are tremendously linear, leaving only one path to achieve full sync. Even the iconic preview movie scene is probably entirely impossible. And even if it isn&apos;t, playing out the mission like that will fail the full sync objectives. The buildings are so far apart and the roofs so heavily occupied that rooftop running is practically dead in this game.
<br>
<br>Recruiting assassins is completely borked, with many of the mission markers not showing up. But then, Connor treats everyone like crap, so who cares if you get recruits. Besides the linear nature of the missions, many of the main story missions are tedious at best and don&apos;t make a compelling case for how Connor would have been involved in these historic events.
<br>
<br>I could go on and on, honestly. I haven&apos;t even touched on half of the issues raised by others. In fact, the only remotely enjoyable thing about this game was the naval mini-game. But then, it&apos;s so completely different from the rest of the game that it really just feels like it should be part of a different game. And even then, I literally had my ship run aground by a cut scene in one mission and lost a full sync objective by a cut scene in another mission. So even as amazing as they are, they were still mired by bugs.
<br>
<br>But in the end, I just can&apos;t get over the way the ending was handled. Not just what the ending was, but how it was done. There were so many possibilities for this game to have the most amazing ending of any series I&apos;ve ever played. All of the hard work was done, the build up was complete. And then this game comes along and flushes five games worth of story down the toilet. Disrespectful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3132556">Expand</a></span>

At first I really enjoyed it. Graphics are OK, it&apos;s ported to PC really good, production values are good. The story it pretty linear at first and sort of OK, so I stuck around waiting for the open world part to kick in.
<br>
<br>But the game didn&apos;t get better, it got worse. And fast. Why? Because there is nothing really interesting to do. Or challenging for that matter.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong  the game can be hard. For example if you have to do a sneaking job and retry it until you memorize the movement of every f* guard in the vicinity. Or if you get killed for *some reason* after routinely fighting through countless enemies without a scratch.
<br>
<br>But for the most part it is pretty easy and you walk around doing pointless things. Collecting feathers for whatever reason. Trading beaver pelts to get money you don&apos;t really need. Killing beavers and wondering if this or Far Cry 3 has more pointless animal killing. Doing boring side missions. Doing boring main missions.
<br>
<br>Want an example? You obnoxious main character decides to assassinate some evil bloke and tries to find him by annoying everyone around him in some cutscenes. So walking around, cutscene.. Oh the English attack with the evil dude in command.
<br>Your job: ride around for 10-15 minutes and rouse some militia dudes. Exciting!
<br>Next: Watch a cutscene of the dudes you just roused (or whoever) get routed.
<br>Next: Ride to the next town on a timer. Great!
<br>Next: Watch a cutscene, this time being insulted by an even more annoying dude than you pc.
<br>Next: Defend some bridge by riding around and giving &quot;fire&quot; commands to some dudes. Wtf?
<br>Next: Watch cutscene getting explained that the evil dude you never tried to assassinate escaped and is now protected by so many soldiers that you have to.. bla bla bla.
<br>
<br>Why call the game Assassin&apos;s Creed anyway?
<br>
<br>I won&apos;t even start on side missions, which tend to be rather ludicrous. Like delivering mail. Or fighting ship battles that are usually over in under a minute.
<br>
<br>Once again, it is not really a bad game, it is only boring, repetetive and the story is somewhere between stupid and annoying. Same as you main character.
<br>
<br>*Spoiler*
<br>Don&apos;t get confused by the really cool character you play in the beginning, he just happens to be the plot twist. Might be one of the most disappointing feature in video game history.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3758872">Expand</a></span>

A number of times all I could think was &quot;what were the developers thinking???&quot;. There are so many bad things and glitches with this game.The characters are not compelling and Conner is just a brat who tends to lose motivation half way through the game. They have messed with the fighting combat and although visually better it is far too simple. They discourage you from using the rooftops and most of the time it is easier to be Rambo than to seek around. You cannot run around the battlefields like in the trailer. The game play is linear with WAY too many cut scenes which tend to linger for way longer than required with awkward silent moments. The forrest and frontier setting is beautiful, but the cities are not exciting at all and a waste of time. Also the game has blinding white load screens which are not fun. I 100% regret buying this game but as a big fan of the rest of the series I had to see what happens to Desmond. Next time I will be watching the cut scenes on YouTube.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3190169">Expand</a></span>

But the main problem with this game is the NPC logic. In battle with a lot of NPC (4-10) one will be attacking you while the others just stand their and watch. Once you kill him another attacks you and so on and so forth. If you go hide behind a wall right next to the battle the NPC will just totally forget about you and walk off. This games was poorly constructed. I would not recommend this game to anybody. I&apos;m only giving this a one because of the good gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3675810">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a boring game with a boring combat system, a boring story and a sh**tty ending. God that ending. They could have done something right there but no, they decided to keep milking the story.
<br>I&apos;m done with this saga.</span>

First of all, Haytham Kenway was an AWESOME character. Cunning, intelligent, sophisticated. Switching to that angry kid in the middle of the game was very disappointing. The story didn&apos;t make much sense to me either. Let me explain. Ezio, for example, had a motive, the people he was after killed his family. This douchebag? He just goes around killing templars that are actually doing GOOD things and haven&apos;t done anything that much wrong, helping people that are manipulating him and are the same, if not worse, than the Templars he&apos;s after. Killing his own father tops that all off. Sure, I get it, Connor is an assassin and they are Templars. But is he really that dumb that he can&apos;t see the relativity of the situation? He&apos;s helping people with certain interests kill people with different interests, but all he seems to see is &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;, not even trying to think about what he&apos;s doing and what a ridiculous little pawn he is. The idiocy of Connor really ruined the game for me.
<br>
<br>Lets sum this up, a beautiful living world, fun combat, countless hours of gameplay.... all ruined by having to play as a complete fool who kills random people that he shouldn&apos;t care about and doesn&apos;t even know why. I&apos;m still giving this game a solid 6, because it did bring some innovation to the already amazing AC franchise gameplay wise (naval combat, for example), but Connor and the story were an enormous let down (and the boring linear missions).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3785246">Expand</a></span>

The save system as with all the other is crap.  In most of the missions you have to complete EVERYTHING, including the bonus synchronization tasks, in one go...in other words  if you mess up just once you have to start the mission from the very beginning no matter how close you were to completing it, THAT  BLOWS.  This game is also segmented more than the others, you keep getting cut back and forth between free roam and cut scene a lot which makes the flow disjointed and jerky.  Also, the geometry and collision detection sucks as you will find yourself constantly getting stuck on the ground, or even things you&apos;re supposed to be able to climb.  Horses get stuck in corners A LOT.  Lots of random new game mechanics pop up at times too making gameplay feel inconsistent, things like quicktime events that all use different mechanics and that crap.  As for sound and visuals and story this has all the Assassin Creed trappings except for the mechanics and gameplay..they suck.  Mission save points suck, we need manual save, and the whole game interface, that animus layout interface sucks, it has ALWAYS sucked.  Also, this game doesn&apos;t give you a clear idea of what you&apos;re supposed to do.  Sometime you have NO idea what is supposed to be done.  Other times they flash directions in the middle of the event as it&apos;s happening but it&apos;s too fast to read them so what to do when can be very confusing at times.  This is a piss poor mess of bad gameplay, interface, clarity, saving.  If it doesn&apos;t have to do with the visual appearance, sound, or story then it sucks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3425314">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>STORYTELLING: While the plot and setting are interesting, the storytelling is very lazy and doesn&apos;t fit the game. For example, one early mission has you sneaking into enemy territory, getting past about half a dozen armed guards. After completing this and watching a cut-scene, you magically appear outside the danger zone. How did he get out?

After completing this and watching a cut-scene, you magically appear outside the danger zone. How did he get out?
<br>
<br>GAMEPLAY: This game is guilty of some serious &quot;press the WIN button to WIN!&quot; problems so combat is laughably easy. On &quot;Normal&quot; difficulty, a punch will kill an opponent where he stands while a riffle-shot to the player&apos;s face will take off an eight of your (regenerating) health bar.
<br>
<br>GLITCHES and BUGS: I quit the game for the last time after my assassin jumped onto the wrong side of a ladder and climbed through the floor of the room above. This type of this should not happen in any game, let alone a major AAA title.
<br>
<br>As a fan of Assassins Creed 2, I was very disappointed by this game. Get Batman: Arkham City instead!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3270202">Expand</a></span>

Those are annoying bugs where you sometimes can&apos;t take down the wanted poster, can&apos;t reach a treasure box because it&apos;s buried in the ground or you can go through closed gates. Not to speak of your horse getting stuck between trees. The graphics engine doesn&apos;t seem to be well optimized for AMD CPUs/GPUs. I have an FX-6300@4,5GHz and a Radeon HD 6870@985Mhz and sometimes frames per second drop to 25 FPS on full 1080p HD without any obvious reason i.e. at places where there is not much detail or in cities even on lowest quality settings. The game is sponsored by Nvidia so this might explain it. The sea battles are really a highlight of the game and could be even a stand alone game but they are not very well integrated in the story and overall gameplay. Overall I think the open world could be a bit more deep with more things to do, more houses to enter, more NPCs to talk to. More in the direction of a real RPG game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3182668">Expand</a></span>

Unskippable credits just rolled. These days its either nuke or ufo. Here is the latter. Some great promises from previous installments have been broken. The mysterious story of ancients turned out to be silly and shallow - some answers are best if not told. So the series is over now, completely exhausted and dried out of essentials that made first Assassins Creed establish its name. Every another game in the series was loosing its ground piece by piece, until this quite pathetic conclusion. What about game critics reviews? Game of the year awards? Did we really played the same game, or they got some bonuses together with reviewers copies?
<br>Maybe its just me, did you guys who live in USA enjoy this somehow more than me?
<br>Graphics: great. Sound: great. Story: promising at first, but completely failed in the end. Game mechanics: fights are way too easy though animations are impressive, STEALTH IS WITH NO PROPER TOOLS, eagle vision is completely useless, horses are unnecessary, leap of faith is sour becouse Connor cannot see where the spot is. Side missions: too many, not worth your time, you get nothing apart from silly dresses and minor improvements. Some whole branches of side missions should be eliminated by quality dept. (letters, deliveries, crafting, trading) these are trivial and pointless. Testers let through serious bugs, it seems that they were only able to test until New York, where glitches festival starts. Strong points: naval missions.
<br>Conclusion: for me its just one of these games that make easy money for the publisher. Consists of too many elements that can not make consistent picture. &quot;Shitload of side missions in your face player&quot;. Epic finale of the series is not there. No more please. Play first AC and make real reboot, becouse you lost direction. Not the complete failure but still huge dissapointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2924114">Expand</a></span>

Every game in the series thus far has been enjoyable despite their flaws, and if you were given an objective, you were usually given the means to actually do that objective. It seems that in this one, they&apos;ve decided to completely forgo giving you ANY of the slightest conveniences for getting a 100% synch, MAYBE adding in a distant haystack or something during missions that require stealth. I don&apos;t think they quite understood that difficulty also has to be fun. It seems like they&apos;d rather have you constantly replay the same mission with poorly-placed checkpoints until you simply go insane and destroy your computer.
<br>
<br>Now that I&apos;ve finished that little rant, on to more &quot;important&quot; issues with the game, like its ABSURD amount of glitches. It feels like every time Connor actually manages to shimmy and waddle to the place I want him to, I find disappearing people, things stuck in walls, floating objects, etc. It really feels like I&apos;m playing an early beta build or something. It&apos;s just not excusable. In addition to all of this, as I&apos;ve pointed out before, the already somewhat lacking stealth system found in previous games in the series has been even further reduced when you really need it. Coupled with the fact that guards now have sharper vision and alertness than eagles (Except for the times when they don&apos;t seem to see ANYTHING, which is rare), this really gets to be a frustrating problem.
<br>
<br>I could go on and on about how utterly flawed the game is, but I&apos;m tired, I&apos;m frustrated, and I&apos;d really like to stop thinking about all of these flaws. So lets look at the positives of this game: It looks breathtakingly beautiful, and it&apos;s pretty obvious that a lot of attention to detail was given to visuals. Every environment, every animation, every creature... it all looks very believable. Until, that is, you notice that bear that got stuck in a rock and can&apos;t do anything about it but spasm.
<br>And... well, that&apos;s pretty much all I found enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4112947">Expand</a></span>

I tried to play it for the first time about a year ago, but before even finishing the prologue sequence I got frustrated and gave up. It took me awhile to give it another try, and this time I stuck it out played all the way through. Connor&apos;s story has some really good moments, especially at the end of the prologue sequence (easily one of the best moments of the whole series). However, both Connor&apos;s and Desmond&apos;s stories went through stretches where they didn&apos;t make much sense or were just boring. Worst of all, both stories&apos; ending were pretty anticlimactic. Right when you&apos;re waiting for a big payoff (after several games and many hours of play), they just putter out. The game introduced some new features that I liked, such as having different abilities for assassin recruits, hunting game, and crafting. Unfortunately, these features failed to reach anywhere close to their full potential: once they level up some (or you recruit several) the assassin&apos;s abilities are not too helpful, as they can just kill anything anyways. Hunting is mostly used for crafting and trade, but there isn&apos;t much worth crafting after you get the few available upgrades, and money quickly becomes useless once you upgrade your ship, which you can do pretty early on. By far my favorite new aspect was the addition of naval combat missions. While quite different in nature from the traditional AC gameplay--going for all-out combat instead of stealthy kills--it was fairly well implemented and gave a welcome break from running around through endless streets and trails. One thing that this game did horribly, however, was the controls: AC games on PC have a reputation for being lazy console ports, but it seems like instead of getting better, this issue is getting worse. Instead of allowing you to take advantage of having a keyboard with more than a half dozen keys, the game wants to force you to use the same couple keys for everything, with the result that you frequently end up doing something completely different than you intended. Finally, the voice acting is pretty terrible in general, and this is especially noticeable with Connor, the protagonist, who spends the whole game sounding like he&apos;s reading his lines and just doesn&apos;t care. Overall, it&apos;s not a bad game, and it&apos;s worth playing if you&apos;re an AC fan. I just wish that Ubisoft had put more thought and effort into the game, as it had the potential to be a very good one...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4586924">Expand</a></span>

By they way, the critic reviews are paid off, no doubt.
<br>I completed the main story not making side missions (a few, max) and I explored just a little. Most of the time I just fast traveled everywhere or just rode straight from point A to point B. The game completion says &quot;20 hours&quot; in Steam, and my synchronization-% is 38. The main story is 38% of the game, maybe a little less. Rest of the game consists of vague side missions that simply aren&apos;t interesting to play. I don&apos;t feel like wasting 35 hours doing some  deliveries etc.
<br>Also the accounting system is horrible. I didn&apos;t do anything related to the manor economy, and had more than enough money to spend. Who the  wants to spend time sending some wagons to export some material to don&apos;t-know-where to get 20 bucks? It was absolutely horrible, didn&apos;t even try to understand  use that... thing.  Totally unneccessary. In AC:B the Monteriggioni repairs and stuff at least made sense and you felt like &quot;I need to do this, it&apos;s my home town.&quot; or something.
<br>Too much time is spent to travelling. Way too much.
<br>Another things:
<br>1.) I have no idea what the Almanac Pages were for.  Didn&apos;t give a ***t so didn&apos;t collect them.
<br>2.) I didn&apos;t buy anything from the stores. I didn&apos;t even find any stores in the cities every now and then when I tried. All the weapons I used were hidden blades, tomahawk and sword. I didn&apos;t even feel that I had a need for other weapons. I also don&apos;t have a clue if you could get better armor or so... Connor was pretty much immortal anyway: 10 sword hits and still standing.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m also a huge AC-fan, but in this game all I wanted to do was to get the main plot through as fast as possible, and ignore the  uninteresting side missions.
<br>
<br>About the &quot;real world&quot;, outside the animus:
<br>1.) The plot was totally f****d in AC:R with the god-sh*t and ridiculous 2012-apocalypse-sh*t.
<br>2.) In AC3 the plot has gotten very, very lame, and there will be trouble ending it all in a way that makes sense and isn&apos;t stupid.
<br>I hope the series end in AC4. It should&apos;ve ended in revelations, no doubt. It has gotten mainstream like Tomb Raider and has nothing new to offer. It all just smells like moneymaking and Ubisoft being unable to let go of something that&apos;s their number 1 profit while they should.
<br>
<br>The best possible plot in AC-series would&apos;ve been that after AC:B Ubisoft would&apos;ve made an AC game that&apos;s located in real world in the present, and the Assassin&apos;s would&apos;ve fought against the Abstergo company and defeated them for good. No paranormal/supernatural rubbish involved. There would&apos;ve been 4 games in the series, and that&apos;s it. No more.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s hard to write a solid review, because so much things pop up in my mind that needs to be said, and this text box is so damn small.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3158285">Expand</a></span>

They just keep breaking it, further and further.

The game is unfinished, they wasted too much time on the engine and graphics, so there wasn&apos;t money and time left for adding, you know? Gameplay. The missions are linear, scripted, short, and unchallenging, even Assassins creed I is better than this game and I hated Assassins Creed I. The side activities are pointless, I got bored very quickly when I discovered that most side missions required of me to watch two or more loading screens, walk half the map to just beat a random dude or to do a simple fetch quest to some generic NPC. The game is just a big interactive movie, the story is decent, but is no way as good as assssin&apos;s creed II . I really don&apos;t understand, why Ubisoft want to turn all their games into interactive movies. Do you like interactive movies? Buy Walking dead instead (the story is way better and its cheaper too). Do you like open world games? Better games for you: Skyrim, Fallout New Vegas, Read Dead Redemption. Do you really want to buy an assassins creed game? Buy assassins creed II (it&apos;s still a game an not an interactive movie, will not bore you to death with endless cutscenes, the story is way better). Really want to buy this game? Better wait for a steam sale. If you buy this game for $ 60,00, you are just wasting your money and if this game sales are good, I fear for the future of the franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2820780">Expand</a></span>

While it removes the poorly instated novelties that seemed there for only for the sake of novelty, it&apos;s not the game I wish it was. The overhaul of the combat mechanics was refreshing, and the open world movement seems more fluid now, but the team cannot seem to build controls that are fully functional with a keyboard mouse interface. The mouse-look movement was sporadic and inconsistent, and the lack of customization, and  keys that are used for more than one function are consistent with a poorly ported console title.

<br>The story was garbage, and obviously pandering to a patriotic U.S. market. It could have been a beautiful tragedy of the day the Assassins started to lose their fight, moving them to where they are today. Instead it is drivel about one man almost single handedly building the new world and killing elk.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2857115">Expand</a></span>

The story-line in this game is alright, and the naval combat is quite good, however many things from the other Assassin&apos;s Creed games have been dumbed down, or completely taken out. This game almost felt completely different compared to the others.</span>

The game itself is gorgeous and fairly large (in comparison to my Brotherhood experience). However by the end of the game, I was beginning to hate Desmond, Connor, and Washington. Their personalities got on me and I felt like it wasn&apos;t even worth it to progress through the story. Also, the story itself is extremely short, as I completed it and all the homestead missions in 21 hours, not even in a rush. Overall, this would be a good rent due to its extremely short plot, but definitely left me with an experience to remember.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2935778">Expand</a></span>

But it appears they have bitten off more than they can chew at ubisoft. The game play is mediocre at best, and buggy at worst. I usually aim to get completion of these games, but I found myself just barreling through to get the story, and then uninstalling once it was complete. The fact of the matter is the bugs over ride the fun in the game and just make much of it a chore to complete. It feels as though this game could have used another 6 months in development just getting the issues worked out. Sad.
<br>I want to love it, but its just so...... meh.
<br>I can only hope ubisoft reworks their game play mechanics for the next version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3109642">Expand</a></span>

After about an hour of &apos;game play&apos; I&apos;ve been forced to watch close to 16 cut scenes (which I can skip if I like...so I&apos;ll miss the story). I&apos;ve only actually moved my character for about 10-15 minutes. &quot;Perhaps this will improve&quot; I thought. I closed it after trying my first sword fight  not allowed to stab with my sword oh no. You must throw your first foe repeatedly into barrels, even when disarmed and on the floor. Perhaps an in-game training exercise? I also thought the first climbing scene in the theatre was a bit daft  hanging from balconies in a tiny room in clear view of everyone.

The game has many bugs and glitches that make game play rather annoying at times but as these have been covered in many other reviews i wont get too into that here.
<br>Now what really p***d me off about this game was, well for starters it almost seemed as if they had 2 teams working on the game, one making assasins creed 3, and another clueless to the series making an rpg based on a young native boy trapping and selling furs, and they just mashed them together, for example, gone is any resemblance of the stealthy sneaking around and assassinating people, this game is far more about button pounding hack n slash battles against 20-50 gaurds at a time  then you have the completely annoying naval missions which wouldn&apos;t be so bad if they were just side or optional  missions, but no this was a main mission in the story  the ship controls were horrible and very difficult to get passed and again, wtf does this have to do with assassins creed? Then you have this whole thing of hiring craftsmen and workers to fill a town to make goods for you to sell, gather resources, craft items, etc etc,, LOOK, if i wanted to play minecraft, id play it, i wanted to play assassins creed 3, no such luck this time though.
<br>Anyway i could go on and on about how bad this game is, I will just say, if you never played assassins creed before, check it out you might like it, however if you are a fan of  assassins creed, do not get this game as it will ruin it for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3135485">Expand</a></span>

The scenery in the game is gorgeous, the voice acting is amazing and the animations are fantastic.  However, by putting so much into the game, it starts to sink under because of its own weight.  The tutorial/intro was hitting upwards of 2 to 3 hours before it ended.  An over-all arching goal doesn&apos;t even come up until this time either.  One could say that this 3 hour mark of absolutely nothing happening is because of narrative pacing and storytelling, but the story is just another one of good vs. evil.  After a long-while of running around doing jobs for people I realized just how boring the game got.  After the atrociously long intro, the game devolves into, killing a high value target, killing some random people or killing people from your ship.  This quickly turns monotonous and anti-fun.  Now however, the game is fairly cheap, and it would give you an extreme amount of game time; if repetitive not game time, for your money</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3187444">Expand</a></span>

The game is mostly fun to play but has many frustrating moments filled with bugs. I have loved all the Assassin&apos;s Creed games but this one felt really sloppy at times. I played this game about 6 months after it had been released but it still has a lot of bugs in it which I can&apos;t believe they haven&apos;t fixed by now. Some of the bugs involve quest triggers not working which means you have to repeat the game from the last checkpoint to get around the bug.  All the bugs and frustrations stop this game from getting a really high score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3228209">Expand</a></span>

And BTW, since Assassin&apos;s Creed III, it&apos;s not an assassin anymore. It&apos;s still called Assassin&apos;s Creed, but they are dropping the character of an assassin more and more and it starts to become more of a pirate than an assassin. Which I don&apos;t like. I&apos;m not looking forward to AC IV because I believe it will be as bad as this game. If they actually listen to these reviews, then they should drop their whole Assassin&apos;s Creed IV concept that they have now and start all over with the will of the gamers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3287217">Expand</a></span>

I feel like I am just running between objectives, walking if it is a stealth level.
<br>Even the combat is boring. X to attack, B to block. I had not played an Assassins creed game since 2 and I had hoped they would have improved the combat by now. It seems to have sped up a little bit, but it is still just attack, attack, counter, repeat. The controls are very over simplified, I tried playing with a keyboard and also a gamepad, but the controls seem way too dumbed down.
<br>I thought firing muskets would be satisfying, but they only have the range or a throwing knife and dont feel good to shoot. Climbing the ships mast at the beginning could have been an exciting moment, but I climbed up the wrong side of the mast, so I had to climb down and go up the side they wanted me to climb to continue.
<br>It is also the glitchiest game I have played in years. During the first sword fight in the game my enemy got stuck in a wall and I had to restart from checkpoint.  When first arriving in Boston before even let off the leash enough to sprint I saw a frozen towns person and a dog stuck inside a pile of barrels. There are frequent ragdoll and other physics glitches.
<br>I only payed $5 for it in the steam sale and I still feel disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4309053">Expand</a></span>

This game featured some of the most epic scenes I have experienced in a game. Alot of the battles, especially involving ships, were on a caliber I had never seen before. The combat always kept me interested and entertained, and the world was worthy of exploration. The ability to traverse obstacles and buildings in a &quot;parkour&quot; fashion never gets old and is entertaining enough to make you want to play in its own.
<br>My largest complaint about the game is that the game has a subtle feeling throughout that it had been rushed. This is most obvious with the &quot;Homestead&quot; which felt like it was building up to something good, but in the end was unrewarding and seemed half-implemented. Its the feeling that I know I could have had a lot more from the game the entire time I was playing it that soured the experience.
<br>Also, multiplayer is fantastic and made the game worth the price. The mechanics of their pvp are extremely intuitive and are something you will never have played before. The multiplayer of Assassin&apos;s Creed deserves more attention and credit than I have seen it get. Good stuff.
<br>Added: This rating is purely for the base game. The DLC are horrible and extremely overpriced. Dont bother with them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3012290">Expand</a></span>

One thing I keep thinking while playing, that developers had so many ideas for this game - they never had time to fully complete ANY. The game also very NOT-friendly for users. There is almost no in-game tutorial, text tutorial in &quot;animus database&quot; is almost useless. Sometimes I&apos;ve needed much more time to understand what developers want from me to complete a mission, rather than fulfilling a task itself. Worst interface (PC version) I&apos;ve seen for years - another major thing, that spoiled my experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2808384">Expand</a></span>

The boat trip to arrive to america is so irrelevant, I just cant understand why they included it__1__ The mechanics have changed to worse, the controls have been simplified (probably to make it easier for a controller). Basically everything you need to do is done with the &quot;E&quot; key. __2__ there are cutscenes everywhere, and take all the immersion away. At this rate, on the next AC game you will have a cutscene every time you take out the sword.__3__ Boston (i havent seen NY but I imagine it will be similar) has wide streets and its almost impossible to reach your destination climbing and jumping through the city&apos;s roofs. Basically the developers took AC&apos;s essence and wiped they butts with it.__3__Graphics are on par with previous releases, good enough.__4__I cant say much about the Multiplayer since there are not enough players to even start a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2789175">Expand</a></span>

I watched the games grow and expand to the triple AAA franchise it is today. When I heard about the Assassins Creed 3 upcoming release, I was really excited. I&apos;ve watched the E3 game play videos countless times and pre-ordered since day one.  However when October 31st  came around and my copy of the game came in, I thought that AC3 would definitely win 2012 game of the year, but turned out to be a disappointment. The game has a great introduction and brings the player up to speed about the Assassin and Templar conflict and how Desmonds trying to save the world. You get in the animus and play the tutorial and try out the games many new features and your probably thinking to yourself &quot;wow this is a great game, look at all those new features ubisoft  implemented to this new installment!&quot; However once you&apos;re done with that the game goes downhill from there. The Pacing is god awful. I understand that you need to set the charters and setting, but the game literally takes you about 4 hours until you can start playing this so called &quot;open-world&quot; game. Speaking of open world, the games so called AnvilNext game engine that claims they can run over 100 NPCS and can&quot; render seamless worlds of nearly infinite possibility, transporting you deep inside America before it was &apos;America.&apos; From vivid, natural landscapes, to accurate portrayals of life during The American Revolution&quot; is a **** lie. The game is so glitchy it makes Skyrim look like its glitch free, running on 60 FPS. Heres an example. I&apos;m in Boston, one of the main settings in the game and I&apos;m trying to run up a building. the game suffers from so many slowdowns it just doesn&apos;t make it enjoyable. To much pop in with NPCS and buildings a whole just ruin the experience. The story is mediocre and not as absorbing as Assassin&apos;s Creed II . Conner as a character is satisfactory and is just too serious. Fortunately, the graphics are great, but like I said before, the glitches will turn you off. However the Frontier is great with the new tree climbing and mountain scaling parkour. I find the Frontier the only setting in the game where glitches wont appear as often. All in all this game totally doesn&apos;t deserve a 10 nor does it deserve and 0 or a 1. I give this game a 6,  soley for Ubisoft&apos;s somewhat effort to avoid repetition from previous games and make a jump from the over saturated franchise that it is today. Assassin&apos;s Creed III is sloppy, unpolished and rushed product that had so much potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2856270">Expand</a></span>

Did they just dumbed down one of the most popular franchises of all time? I am a huge AC nut. I&apos;ve played all of the AC titles including the NDS AND smartphone games, and have played through AC1 3 times, AC2 4 times and AC:Brotherhood 3 times. I love the franchise, despite what felt was becoming more of a CoD-scheme of release since AC2: one game/year with the same engine and pretty much the same mechanics. When they announced that AC3 was coming and this time with an enhanced engine and different gameplay mechanics I was pumped. How wrong I was. Firstly, the technical issues. I played the PC version, a version which has been heralded as a &apos;well-made port&apos; from the console version. WHAT A LOAD OF BS. My PC, which runs Crysis 2 on high with decent framerates and all the AC games on 60fps+, cannot even run AC3 properly, with fps dropping below 20fps. I tried lowering the resolution to a dismal 800 x 600. No change to the fps. I tweaked the ini file and my driver settings (which have been updated to the latest version, thank you very much). Still the same. For review purposes, I gave up on the PC version and played the 360 version. And guess what? This is NOT AC anymore. There are so many technical glitches and bugs that it just felt like a joke at times. The emphasis on the frontier woods and smaller &apos;cities&apos; means less roofs to stalk and less exploration. They basically just dumbed down the a critical element of the franchise (CITIES) and encouraged players to explore the repetitive, derivative wilderness to kill animals. Dont get me wrong. There are still a lot of things and missions to do in the cities but overall, its a huge step down from previous games. The combat...my God, why WHY did they have to change the combat mechanics???!!! It was perfect and exhilarating before  - AC1: it was too easy, AC2: they improved it, made it awesome, AC:Brotherhood: Even more refining, now brilliant, and finally, AC: Revelation: they perfected it. In AC3, the combat just felt so unfluid and felt so disjointed at times that it wasn&apos;t as fun as previous times. The controls are different too and shooting is such a pain in the ass that you&apos;ll be using the tomahawk and Assassin blade in 99% of cases. The naval combat is cool and is praised by critics as a strong point but its basically more of a visual fest than actual side game. We&apos;ve all done it before in previous AC games using carts and war machines instead of ships. Its the same fair and at times its linear as hell. Visually, its good. But seriously, this is the SAME ENGINE as the previous AC titles despite Ubisoft promoting it as a revolutionary new engine. It looks the same as AC2 but with more intricate texturing and dynamic shadows. Thats pretty much it. Just like how IW market CoD sequels as having enhanced engines, for AC3, its basically the same visual fair as the previous titles so dont expect anytime too fancy. Overall, whether you like AC3 depends on you: If you&apos;re a big AC nut like me, you&apos;ll notice the changes &amp; glitches, cut yourself and curse Ubisoft for it all but still play the crap out of it anyway. At its core, AC3 remains moderately true to its mechanics with a decent plot and ends Desmond&apos;s tale. Oh yea thats right, the ending. Its almost as bad as Mass Effect 3&apos;s ending so all I can say is...prepare yourself. As for those who haven&apos;t played AC titles or only played them sparingly, you&apos;ll definitely love this game. The PC version is definitely the superior version with highly noticeable graphical enhancements as well as patches for the niggles that the console version had been experiences. Ultimately, if you do have a console, pick AC3 up for that as the PC version is, despite its bells and whistles, a very VERY poorly optimized console port that I wont continue to play until Ubisoft releases a patch to fix the issue. Seriously guys, even the PC version of Dark Souls, a game that basically spits PC gamers in the face with a lack of graphical options, had better optimization. In the end, AC3 felt like a rushed job with poor design decisions that would polarize gamers and will leave fans of the franchise disappointed.

Sadly it seems that Revelations and AC3 were made with different dev team that made AC1-2.  AC3 is probably the worst. Dumbed down to it knees, fight mechanic, free runing... everything. No options for player, everything is scripted. You cannot control when and where to jump. Just press ASDW and everything is done for you. Occasionally (or more often) you just press E and another script will do everything for you. Cut scenes on every move, &quot;press E&quot; on every corner.. Overall for completing the game you just need 5 buttons- ASDW and E. I was looking forward to this game, but it seems that i will skip this release and will just look at the end cutscene on youtube and im done.... Im very sad that developers slapdash last two releases and ruined my whole AC enthusiasm :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2819938">Expand</a></span>

Fighting never been so easy, still its ridiculous how many times you have to stab opponent to actually kill him. Main character is just some random dude, not even close to being so charismatic as Ezio. Missions are uninteresting, most of people I&apos;m helping out i would rather leave to death.

However one of the really bad things i figured is that its literally a bug release, i am sure they wanted to role out before xmas thou, however the stockingpiling menu f.e. is totally broken, some buttons dont work and you cant quit, there, CTD the game and restart doesnt help cause you jump to the broken menue right away, i finally found some forum posts on how to fix it, but still unbelivable to me how they can release so many bugs in a quite expensive retail version. the 85 metascore is unfort. a total fake, i guess they are forced to put it so that they dont loose ubi as advertiser, still sad to see, that games which are really bad, are recommend here!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2848913">Expand</a></span>

<br>The PC version of this game is graphically beautiful especially when there is snow to run around. This game includes graphical settings that allow the users to change the environment, textures and anti-aliasing. These settings allow you to optimise your game to work freely without any lag or disturbances within the game.
<br>The combat is very similar to the other Assassin&#x2019;s Creed games in that you can either go full on attacking countering every move or take to the roofs and remove your target from a distance while standing in the shadows. The combat feels freer than the last few games with more abilities and options open to the player but does get tedious after a while.  Sometime into the game Connor will start to recruit assassins into the brotherhood that he can control, upgrade or send on missions similar to Assassin&#x2019;s Creed Revelations however they have different abilities and options.
<br>This time round your assassin has two main weapons, a brotherhood styled tomahawk and a customised hidden blade that can be detached to be used as a dagger. There are many more weapons throughout the game including darts, swords, spears and guns that can be collected from fallen enemies however the only way to maintain that weapon would be to buy it from one of the many market stores scattered throughout the game. A sort of economy in the game, AC3 has introduced a homestead for the first time, here Connor can invite people into his homestead to increase the amount of products or money he can acquire, for example you can invite some lumberjacks that will grow and harvest trees that you can buy off them and send them to market to gain a profit, this is the new economy that Ubisoft have added to Assassins Creed and I think its brilliant although it can take while to start with you can eventually be rolling in the money.
<br>Another new thing to the game are boats and ships, now in Revelations you could use a boat to travel across the river but in this you can sail a ship across the seas, just like the homestead you can upgrade your ship, more cannons, men, armour. This game includes sea battles with you matching up with ships firing multiple cannons at each other. Unfortunately sailing the ships isn&#x2019;t free-roam style, you have to be doing a mission that requires Connor to use them, and something that I hope they change in future games.
<br>This game is very enjoyable and a slight change from the earlier games however the games replay ability would be once or twice in my opinion with the first time just going through following the story and getting entwined with the characters and the second time trying to 100% it, collecting all the items and finishing all the side quests. I will give Assassin&#x2019;s Creed III a score of 7 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3068748">Expand</a></span>

Some hours into the game though the &quot;real&quot; protagonist (Connor) is introduced and from that point onwards the game gets progressively worse. Connor is a boring bloke without any kind of personality or purpose. The plot - even the one in the Animus - is bonkers as well with almost every other story mission being a historical event shoehorned in to make Connor play some completely nonsensical part in it.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m afraid there hasn&apos;t been an AC game with a good story since AC2. That one had character, interesting locations, a good plot. This one not so much. I&apos;d say if you can get it cheaply it&apos;s worth a try but don&apos;t expect too much from it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2867614">Expand</a></span>

As always, the storyline and voice acting are superb, but the majority of the game is action based and nothing ever, ever works properly. AC3 spits on the legacy of the franchise and should be ignored.

Not minor annoyances, but game-killing issues. I played v1.06, still it&apos;s a half-ready game filled with bugs... What could be 1.00 like? Was it even starting?
<br>
<br>If you need to know anything about this game, go to youtube.com because here is nothing explained... You have to find out everything on your own. Like this game is made deliberately to be hated.
<br>
<br>SOME  of the bugs/glitches:
<br>
<br>Map  how to zoom back in? BTW AC1-2 and co. had some problems with the map  it didn&apos;t centered on many times if you clicked on an icon. They fixed it. Yes, they removed... So now you can only drag the sorry map... Is it really that hard to make an interface that works? I mean, it&apos;s the 5th generation for God&apos;s sake... Thousands worked on them. Nobody cared?
<br>
<br>The climbing is still POS, try the Beacon hill climb. The game screws it up for you... It jumps automatically into bowl up there and thats it... If you want to climb up, you have to try once-twice to know the game&apos;s glitches...
<br>Sometimes you can&apos;t climb up to a rooftop, he just stands there meditating. And if you&apos;re being chased... I wonder if anybody tested the game before release.
<br>
<br>Sometimes, just walking around, you get suddenly chased by the guards... Why? And you kill them by the dozen, but they don&apos;t get less. What&apos;s the point? I&apos;m in incognito, aren&apos;t I?
<br>
<br>There are so many lock picking minigames, Why didn&apos;t just copy one of them, because this is the worst. You get through the left/right phase, and then he just pulls out the tool and you can start over... Why Connor pulls the damn thing out? He just found the right angle. It&apos;s a drag like every minigame here. Atrocious, annoying, stupid. Work of lazy developers without imagination...
<br>
<br>This guy can climb things that no human can: windows, even a piece of plaster bears his weight. What he can&apos;t climb ARE ROCKS... Rocks, that most humans can with a bit of practice. So you spend hours on pressing the forward button, to round the rocks...
<br>Tree climbing is a pain. Not working as it should be or it just not working at all. You have basically the SAME tree for every lookout point. Still the basic commands aren&apos;t working. If you climb up, Connor looks around from BEHIND THE LEAVES, and because you cant see where you jump, you&apos;re dead. Atrocious game design and logic.
<br>
<br>The inventory is confusing. Nothing explained. It&apos;s just amazingly bad. Buttons not working (backspace, space).  It&apos;s version 1.06, I&apos;ve been waiting to download 6  patches, one by one  and still they didn&apos;t fix this issue.
<br>If you touch the mouse it&apos;s frozen. It&apos;s not a bad port, it hasn&apos;t been ported to pc at all. Basic stuff not working.
<br>
<br>After a few hours of gaming when you have a task, e.g. to look for a treasure chest and you cant find it, you are not searching for it again, because you think it&apos;s a glitch again, that it&apos;s not there. You get use to the bugs...
<br>
<br>It&apos;s the 5th generation of AC so now it was high time to introduce (on a regular base) the plague, the cancer of the gaming world (at least the pc, the console gamer take it), the Quick time events. YESS. So now if you have liked the series so far, now they convince you that you were wrong... From now on you&apos;ll be on a level of a 3 year old toddler  push this, and then push that. I was so missing this...
<br>And if QTE, why isn&apos;t it enough to click the damn button once? I hit the E once or 6 times, still I die...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3409433">Expand</a></span>
