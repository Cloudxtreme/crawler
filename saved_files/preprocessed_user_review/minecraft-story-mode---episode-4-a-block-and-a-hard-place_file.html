<br>The middle portion is... Slow, unfortunately. Interesting... A little. You do get to see something spectacular but for now you&apos;ll be asking &quot;Are we there yet?&quot; Or &quot;Is it over?&quot;
<br>The ending... The god dang ENDING! Is fantastic! You *Insert spoilers*. Well, this ending is amazing anyways. Yes, you might die a few times (I did...) but it&apos;s a fun experience and one that might toy with your emotions...
<br>
<br>All in all, this episode is easily the best of all of them so far. I love this episode and i can&apos;t wait to see what Tell Tale brings us in episode 5 &quot;Order Up!&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/minecraft-story-mode---episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place/user-reviews?user_review_id=6008146">Expand</a></span>
