Ten years has passed since I&apos;ve been playing for the first time, and the impressions, emotions are still with me. Those who had sad that it has a far greater story than Deus ex, are, as far as I am speaking for myself, correct. It needs that kind correction though, that the story in fact is a amazing book story, superior, to *any* game story, we have seen so far: including original Mafia story, or any good crpg, like Baldur&apos;s Gate. It is far greater too, than a few good books, I ve been reading. But, eventually, it is not ony history told so good, but also the mechanics of the game, ideas hidden here and there, make this game, the best one out there. Everything if perfectly balanced.<br>Well, it would be great to se a another game taking place in Planescepe environment someday.

You will have to be prepared to do a lot of reading in order to enjoy this profound tale. If you&apos;ve ever come across the ideas of Nietzsche, Heidegger or Plato (and others, including Eastern philosophy and mysticism) you&apos;ll be spooked out when you play this game. It is text heavy and in this respect plays much like an old-fashioned text-adventure but otherwise it plays the same as the other (also brilliant) Infinity Engine games : there&apos;s a fair amount of combat plus plenty of quests and some of the weirdest and most wonderful locations, NPCs and enemies you&apos;re every likely to come across. The level of interaction which is possible between party members and other NPCs is still unparalleled today. The artwork is wonderful and if you can muster the patience to get involved in the deepest game you will ever play you won&apos;t notice that it&apos;s all in low resolution. There is a widescreen mod available for this game, I believe.

But they are all negligible once you get engrossed in the story and characters, which are truly great. Every quest has multiple ways of beating it, and its one of the few RPGs that allow you to play a mostly passive character if you wish (with only a handful of &apos;required&apos; battles in the game.) This game does require a lot of reading, so if your in the mood for fun gameplay look elsewhere. But if youre looking for a truly remarkable role playing experience, you would be hard pressed to find any better than this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=1493452">Expand</a></span>

Planescape torment is up there, right next to the original deus ex. And it even holds up today. Why? It has a truly unique world, populated with truly unique characters. And while this can be said about fallout - for instance, this stands alone. It is, and was - truly it&apos;s own inspiration. Original ideas are rare, and when you back them up with a game of supurb depth and length - and you are left with nothing but praise and awe. Better than dragon age origins and baldur&apos;s gate 2 both of which I consider masterpieces. That&apos;s how good planescape torment was, and is even today. And while deus ex remains a game I enjoyed more - this comes very close to taking every crown there is. 10/10, 100/100, 999/1000</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=2143546">Expand</a></span>

It has funny, personal and powerful story of identity, memory and redemption. It lacks in sheer playability and smoothness, but these do not cripple its might at all. To me Dak&apos;kon of Skrathlor, Morte, The Transcendent One and others just as important characters than Tifa, Barret or Sephiroth.<br><br>The Nameless One (YOU) wakes at morgue. Its labourers are are rotten undead and your only guide about anything is snarky skull. So you set out to Sigil (city everywhere and nowhere) in quest to find about yourself. And you can&apos;t die, so something must be amiss. And it is and in matters you (PLAYER) can only imagine. AND IT IS AWESOME.<br><br>This game is great. Story about amnesiac immortal breaks down all cliches of genre and in addition it is covered with beautiful graphics, magnificent sound and completeley adequate playability. This game was not designed not to be fighting, but more about searching, learning and finally accepting what is true. Voice-acting has skilled names doing awesome roles and characters they play are real. Even snarky skull Morte is more than it seemsa, but he still is snarky skull. And in addition to this lovable coward you face zerth Dak&apos;kon, succubus (she is chaste, prim and proper) Fall-From-Grace, tiefling Annah with most sexy scottish accent and insane Ignus- living and ecstatic conduit to Plane of Fire. All these and several more weirdos are just gravy on top of story, which ends in thoroughly epic (and nively smoothly played) Grande Finale.<br><br>Planescape: Torment is not about great AI of party members, smooth combat against hordes of goblins  or about facing insane madman who just happens to be King of Highland. Planescape: Torment is great novel told in despised format of gaming and delivers sheer Art. Even though it is crude as game, it is amgnificent as story. In my eyes encounter between The Nameless One and The Transcendent One is just as epic as any other final boss.<br><br>This game is not a masterpiece. It is The Masterpiece. And I took no pleasure in its appearance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=1803683">Expand</a></span>

How can such a classic ruin the genre for you! You complete numpty!&quot;, you might be thinking. Well, it didn&apos;t ruin RPGs for me because it was bad. Quite the opposite in fact. Torment is simply so good, that every RPG afterwards has been rather hum-drum in comparison. I&apos;m sure that part of the reason is that Torment was one of my first forays into the wonderful world of (W)RPGs, but the game really is one of the classics.<br><br>The main reason is that the story, the setting, the characters and the atmosphere of the game are all unparalleled. This is not a tale of kings and queens, of lands that need to be saved or of damsels that need to de-stress after their distress. You&apos;re not the saviour, not the chosen one and, most of the time, not much of a hero either. This tale is a personal tale. It tells the story of an apparently immortal man who has no idea who he is, where he is or how he ended up not being able to die. In his journey for answers you meet a host of rather interesting characters and companions (a talking skull, an empty suit of armour and a chaste succubus among others) and you slowly discover hints about your past and why you ended up the way you did. An amnesiac main character isn&apos;t very original, (how many books and films have employed the same trick? I can&apos;t remember. Hmmm) but it is the way the story is told that makes it so engaging. The game implies instead of explains and leaves the player to fill in blanks, which makes the tale all the more engaging. The setting is delightfully weird and a breath of fresh air for people sick of the enormous deluge of RPGs set in a faux-medieval, faux-european faux-fantasy land. In this game, no elfs in sight! No dwarves either, not even when you look down!  The game takes place, for the most part, in the city of Sigil, the city of Doors and the centre of existence. Here you can take portals to all the known and unknown planes. If you can find the right key, that is. Belief is power in the City of Doors and the power of belief manifests in reality. Get enough people to belief in your idea and see it come to pass, lose the belief of your people and even Gods might as well be dead.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, the game spins a grand tale. We get it! How about the rest? The nitty-gritty, the meat and potatoes? In short, the combat? Well, the setting, story and characters are really the main strenghts of the game. This is a game to play if you like a good story, a different world and if you enjoy reading. Do your preferences lean more towards the combat side of games, then this title is not for you.<br>There is combat in the game, reminiscent of games like Baldur&apos;s Gate and Icewind Dale, but it feels sluggish and gets boring quickly. The combat spell effects are rather special though, so playing as a mage will give you some graphical satisfaction during combat.<br><br>Graphically, the isometric 2D view works well for the game, and the detailed and colourful backgrounds are beautiful, even more than ten years later. The music and sound effects have also held up well and add to an already impressively atmospheric game.<br><br>In short, Planescape:Torment is an absolute classic for its storyline, setting and atmosphere and deserves to be played by anyone interested in a story-driven game. Combat is not the game&apos;s strong point, so action fanatics may pass this one up. Well, you should still try it just so you can say you played it, but you probably won&apos;t like it all that much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=2145189">Expand</a></span>

Make this game *known* to you. I will would literally spend my entire fortune and kill a homeless person to see a developer take up the monumental task of remaking of this game for the 21st century. WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS?

The number of characters and the length of their dialogues are incredible. Laconic, touched, witty, smarmy and demented replies are all accepted, but not always given good marks.   Your incarnation of The Nameless One, one of a vast number of permutations to make his way through the Planescape, meets other lost or downtrodden wanderers, amiable or suspicious enough to accompany him on his journey. Even these characters have vast ideologies and backgrounds to explore and will often grant you boons in return for your interest.   The attributes system grants points to each character as they gain experience. These points are allocated among traits: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma. Each character will limit him/herself in various aspects: ability to wear armour types or wield weapons, carrying capacity, capability of combat styles, magical knowledge, casting adeptness, dialogue choices and persuasiveness. It&apos;s up to you to decide how useful or fitting these abilities are to fighters, mages, thieves or priests.   The items picked up, stolen or crafted range from bog-standard to fantastical: weapons, armor or profound tattoos, that grant certain individuals additional attributes when worn; staple potions, radical medical curatives and pica chews; obscure artifacts, works of art and religious icons, usable only by certain theological alignments.   Trying to comprehend how the game was written absolutely boggles the mind. A collection of interwoven worlds with plenty of obscure, tangential areas. Enough to stretch the length of gameplay to absurd levels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=2279896">Expand</a></span>

The closet I ever got was Fate Stay/Night and other Japanese visual novels with English subtitles.<br><br>The story, as described by others, is phenomenal. The characters are bonded to the protagonist, and thus to the player. True role playing, not in the sense that the player gets to decide to write up a backstory that the CRPG doesn&apos;t even know exist, but to role play as the protagonist in a story someone else write especially for this CRPG. The graphics in a lot of ways is aesthetically more pleasing than Baldur&apos;s Gate, Icewind Dale, and Neverwinter Nights. You can see a lot of details and each character has a large enough sprite slot that the animation is smooth and the combat actions are true. In BG, half of your characters look the same and have no &quot;artistic identity&quot;. But here, there is a pure difference between all the NPCs and the main protagonist.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=2439403">Expand</a></span>

The combat and the UI are both less than stellar, so I can see why some would complain though I myself didn&apos;t find it that bad. The story however, along with the characters and to a lesser extent the setting, is enough to raise it above every other game I&apos;ve played. I just hope they never try to remake this!</span>

<br>-Dialogue trees
<br>-Several joinable factions, and a number of alignments based on player actions
<br>-Artwork, setting
<br>

<br>
<br>-Combat is pointless and uninteresting (also rare)
<br>-Game is unbalanced... Strength, dexterity and constitution attributes are useless. Wisdom unlocks most dialogue options, with a few options being unlocked by intelligence and charisma. Mage class is 10000x stronger than your other options due to the above reasons
<br>-A few bugs, most can be fixed with unofficial patches, but a couple quest-breaking bugs persist</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=5003381">Expand</a></span>

I played Planescape: Torment when I was much younger and could not grasp much of its complexity.  I return to it now and see that it is, without a doubt, the best RPG I have played so far.  The story is profound and mind-bending, as are all the characters in it.  Through many a dialogue did I feel genuinely moved, awed, or chilled to the bone.  What&apos;s more, the gameplay is open-ended and relies on you being resourceful.  It does not hold your hand, it does not walk you through tutorials--NO!  Like the Nameless One, you wake in a cold, dark world with nothing, not even your memories, and you must go forth to solve the mystery of YOURSELF using your wits and what few scraps you have.  Combat is the same way.  It forces you to constantly change your strategies and take advantage of the many spells, skills, and items you acquire along the way.  At the same time, you are required to concentrate on the dialogue in order to puzzle out the various clues you collect throughout your journey.  Torment is so well-written, however, that it unfolds like a darkly poetic novel.  Ultimately, if you put enough thought and energy into Planescape: Torment, it comes to life in an extraordinary way.  Few games (if any) can compare.  It was definitely worth the hours of finagling it took to get this old masterpiece running on my modern desktop.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=2262671">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>And good news if you like it, a new Torment game got funded and is under development^^</span>

All the characters are memorable and unique. The quests are good as well. The game is still awesome since it came out in 1999, every new walkthrough opens some new details about the story. So if you are into CRPGs you MUST play this!</span>

                                        <span>Brought to my attention by PC Gamer, I do not regret at all buying it. The story in depth and expansive, and is truly choice oriented. The art style and sprite based animations fills me with nostalgia. I am playing it for the first time, 14 years after its release, and it seems to have aged very well. THE best top down RPG ever made, and argueably one of the best games ever made.</span>

<br>The long version... it&apos;s an Infinity Engine game, which means 2D graphics in isometric view, similar to Baldur&apos;s Gate, and very low resolution. It also means that it is difficult to get this game to run on a modern machine. Do some googling for fan-made patches (which can also fix the low resolution), but even with those the game is finicky.
<br>It&apos;s a role-playing game based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Ed., in the Planescape setting (which WotC later abandoned), but the producers intentionally set out to break every role playing game cliche in the book. Stay your hand, talk to people, even creatures you&apos;d in other games kill without a second&apos;s hesitation - in *this* game it might be a lost friend with clues to your past.
<br>
<br>Planescape: Torment is something as unusual in gaming as a tragedy: you guide a small band of remarkable but ragged and broken individuals in the hard and unforgiving Planes, you watch friendship and love grow, but as the iron logic of the story unfolds you, the player, soon realize that there can be no happy end to this tale. However, while tragedies don&apos;t have happy endings, they do pack massive emotional punch and grant the viewer catharsis - and Planescape: Torment is an oh-so-very good tragedy.
<br>
<br>Some don&apos;t like the slow pace, the bizarre setting, the reams of text or the clunky combat, but if you&apos;re lucky and can immerse yourself in this game, then you&apos;re in for an experience which will stay with you for the rest of your life.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=2859747">Expand</a></span>

The protagonist is unforgettable , the NPCs are some of the best of all time (up there with BG/BG2), and the environment is amazing.  The graphics are dated even with recent patches to increase the resolution, but it&apos;s absolutely worth playing.</span>

You&apos;re given a blank slate and are free to develop them however you wish, with your choices in game actually mattering, starting with your basic stats. In the other infinite engine games, there&apos;s few minimum stat requirements for dialog or quest options, making mental stats largely a waste, while physical stats, even for casters are usually the best stats. Not so in Torment....every action you take generally has some degree of minimum requirement involved. While a combat focused character can beat the game, they will have a DRAMATICALLY different experience from a more cerebral character would. This is actually largely a part of the setting. In the outer planes, reality is more malleable then on more stabilized prime worlds, allowing things as simple as believing in something enough (or enough people believing in it) to make it happen. This lends itself to a more thought provocting story. Though I will go ahead and acknowledge that the game play might not be for everyone. If you&apos;re more interested in combat or dungeon crawling, Baldur&apos;s Gate (equal balance on story and combat) or Icewind Dale (Dungeon Crawler with minimal story) might be more up your alley. However if a quality roleplaying experience is what you want, Torment does it best. There are actually very few games that can even rival it in those terms (mostly just Fallout 1 and 2, which are very similar in quality, though using a different overall system).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=3136518">Expand</a></span>

And what makes this game the best is that it is the only one where choice does matter. In other games the biggest choice you have to make is generally being good or evil which is extremly predictable. Here it takes a whole new spin. Here when you start a conversation you dont know where its heading, which talking option is the best. And here stats matter. If you have strength you can intimidate people, if you are dexterous you might catch a npc pickpocketing you, there are also endless options available trough intelligence, wisdom or charisma. No more dump stats as in Baldurs Gate. I am playing baldurs gate 2 now and while it is a great game and the combat aspect is better than planescape is lacks that thrill of the story and the choice.
<br>
<br>Probably best videogame ever. Pity it had sold so little back in the day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=2849525">Expand</a></span>

Planescape: Torment is my favorite video game of all time and literally the only game to ever invoke an positive emotional response beyond that was awesome or cool. At the end I was literally so happy about how well the game played and about the ending I had a tear to my eye. Literally the only piece of media I have experienced in my life that has ever evoked a tear from the mix of sadness and happiness.
<br>
<br>Combat&apos;s not perfect but IDGAF the rest of the game from music to customization outshines it. The combat is even somewhat unnecessary and yet it still has all the character building available should you choose to go that route. I think it is impossible to to be disappointed by this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=5641435">Expand</a></span>

<br>First, and not</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Let&apos;s make things clear: this is the best RPG I have ever played. Yes, other games have improved on its flaws ever since, because it does have flaws (otherwise I would rate it at 10,) but it was the game changer when it was released and, being one of the very few games I replay once in a while, it is still more enjoyable than 90% of whatever has been released since.
<br>
<br>First, and not foremost, the writing is simply superb. I have been playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons since the 70s (yes, even old farts can enjoy video games,) and if there ever was one universe that left me completely indifferent in AD&amp;D, that was the Planescape universe, which on paper sounded like the epitome of what I would dislike. PS Torment brilliantly showed me an example of what terrific atmosphere I could extract from this very unusual setting.
<br>
<br>More relevantly, because not based on P&amp;P experience but compared to the computer games of the time, Torment was the first RPG that made it worth playing a wise or charismatic character. Before that, every RPG expected you to play a physical character, i.e., a warrior with high Strength and Endurance. Until then, nobody knew what to do with other traits.
<br>
<br>Maybe it sounds like I&apos;m saying it was the best RPG and that the rating is dated. Well, there might be some truth in it, and I reply it still is a valid rating on that sole basis, but you know what ? It hasn&apos;t changed that much. Take the modern Fallout franchise, pretty good games if you ask me, but all they do is reverse the trend. In Fallout 3 or NV, or (outside of Fallout) Wasteland 2, or whatever, the stat you really want to raise is your Intelligence if you care about numbers and optimising your build. That&apos;s nice and all, but if 1 stat is more important than the others, at the end of the day, this is what you had before PS Torment. So yes, even by today&apos;s standards, the stats mechanics are seldom matched. I have played Torment as a stupid barbarian, and it still was great fun. Very few games have pushed that envelope since then.
<br>
<br>Okay, so groundbreaking mechanics, broadened play styles  and terrific writing. That should be enough, right ? But don&apos;t forget the interface of the IE engine. That interface was one of the best at the time, and still stands the test of time. It is the model that has been built upon. RPGs felt so clunky before. Take the main competition of the day, Fallout and its sequel. True, they are in any way as creative and enthralling as Torment, but what good is it when their interface is so hopelessly bad that playing them becomes a chore ? You do need both to reach greatness, and PS Torment did have both. Still has, seriously. Play it today, it didn&apos;t get old.
<br>
<br>Now let&apos;s spend a minute with the real competition, Baldur&apos;s Gate, which also aged very well (At least BG2. BG1 isn&apos;t bad but is quite boring if you ask me.) BG improved on the companions. It also introduced romances, which are just fluff to me, but important for many players. That&apos;s it. Torment has the best story and protagonist by far. Also less cosmetic the choices. Also just plain awesome. I&apos;m being pedantic anyway: if you like any one of the IE engine games, try all of them.
<br>
<br>Very unusual that I spend so much time on a game&apos;s qualities, when flaws are so much easier to point at. All right, here is one, common to all IE games: combat isn&apos;t great, and comes in nonsensical quantities. Actually, today&apos;s games still do that, which means that someone, either players or devs, expect it. Anyway, few battles are memorable. On the other hand, many tactics are completely valid, even cheesy ones, so there is still a lot of fun to be had there.
<br>
<br>A groundbreaking masterpiece. And if you don&apos;t care about ancient ground breakers, you still have a masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=6675301">Expand</a></span>

Dialog trees stretch sometimes up to 10+ options, each with several subcategories, and with several more sub-sub categories. Those dialog lines often will take quite some time to absorb which is why this game is not as popular as Baldur&apos;s Gate series. The story in this game is incredibly good. You play the game as a character that can never be killed and nameless. What you do in the game is to discover who you were, why things are happening, and what to do next, so you are truly role play a Character as you want to be. Although it did a tremendous job on story telling, the gameplay in this game falls a bit short. The pacing in this game is too slow and since you can not die, it really take a lot fun from the game itself.

If it were a book, it would be War and Peace, or something by Shakespeare. It is, by far, the most artistic, mature, creative story ever penned in any media. It has characters that have the deepness of life-long friends, it has more emotion than a Rocky film and does all this in a way that makes reading enjoying again, with immersion that takes you to another world like no book or movie has done before. It is a work of art and will be remembered for as long as anyone who has played it is still alive on this planet. It is, of course, the greatest game ever published, on any format. If you have not bought this game, do so, challenge yourself, stretch your mind. You will never be the same person again and you will know yourself better than you did before playing it. It is that profound an experience to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=395465">Expand</a></span>

You will care about the characters, you will be moved, you will make choices that tell you more about yourself. It sounds trite, I know, but it really is that good. If only someone would make more of these...insightful, intelligent, devastatingly creative. Fallout is the only RPG to come close. A word of warning: You MUST read all the text, explore all the dialogue options, if you are to gain the most from the game. A decent intelligence and wisdom score is recommended.....although so is a decent score in everything else....the game does the best job of making usually superflous statistics genuinely useful that I have ever seen. Still very much worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=400477">Expand</a></span>

The game unfortunately suffered from lack of publicity upon its release, so it didn&apos;t get the recognition it truly deserved.
<br>
<br>Let loose in &apos;99, many people are just learning about this masterpiece. I can&apos;t understand anyone giving this game a negative score, but as I&apos;ve said before in my reviews, you cannot please everyone, and all are entitled to their opinion. I for one however cannot give this game anything lower than a perfect 10, and if I could rate it higher, I would without ado.
<br>
<br>PST was way ahead of its time, and it shows in every aspect of the game. The story is one of the best I&apos;ve ever experienced in any game, ever. To think you wake up in a morgue not knowing who you are or how you got there is creepy and intriguing. Then little by little, you have to piece the puzzle together. This game will make you laugh, make you cry and maybe even give you nightmares. It&apos;s that good.
<br>
<br>Despite there is just TNO (the nameless one) as the main protagonist, the game has a lot of replay value. This is mostly due to the multiple ways in which you can complete quests, how you treat people through dialogue, and of course the alignment modifier. You can be good, but treat enough people poorly, and you could end up chaotic or even evil. TNO starts as a fighter, but you have choices later to become a mage or a thief, and even switch back and forth as much as you wish (not recommended). There are also factions you can join, tattoos, romance, the list goes on and on. Probably the greatest part of PST is TNO cannot die. He&apos;s immortal. Oh sure, he can still be killed, but the final death can never take him. That&apos;s a huge plus in my book. No more loading a saved game just because your character got whacked.
<br>
<br>A word of warning however... The game is very dialogue intensive. This may be the reason some don&apos;t like it, but its necessary for the story. PST is a game to take your time with and not rush. If you do, you&apos;ll miss out on a lot. Talk to everyone, search every nook and cranny, be patient and have fun. 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=3205160">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s a great amount of attention given to setting details, and strong characterization from all of the party NPCs. Not everything gets explained to you all the time, and it leaves you with the feeling that you&apos;re one person in a larger world that&apos;s moving along with or without you.
<br>
<br>The downsides of the game are that, considering that the game is largely about dialog options and how you talk to people and so forth, the game itself won&apos;t tell you most of the time when your stats have given you a special dialog option, or your lack of stats have prevented you from picking an option. You have to read a guide to know any of that. Special dialog options being labeled didn&apos;t really become popular until some later RPGs that came after this one.
<br>
<br>Also, the game is an Infinity Engine game, so naturally you have to vaguely understand the 2nd edition ADnD rules to get what&apos;s going on some of the time (same as Baldur&apos;s Gate or Icewind Dale). Ehhhh. I know how the combat system works from playing the table-top game and Baldur&apos;s Gate, so it doesn&apos;t bother me too much, but I could easily see how it might hold back someone who was otherwise unfamiliar with it and just wanted to play an RPG with a strong story element.
<br>
<br>If you like RPGs that go in the direction of grinding for levels and stat building and so on, then this game isn&apos;t gonna be your thing. A few fights are hard, but most of the time if you just fight things that show up then you can just get through everything that&apos;s a fight without much trouble. The game doesn&apos;t even have much in the way of fights compared to most other RPGs. There&apos;s a lot of talking and doing stuff &quot;in town&quot; instead of &quot;in dungeons&quot;.
<br>
<br>If you like character based RPGs with lots of story, this game is exactly what you&apos;re looking for. A party full of interesting characters, and nice setting and quests that are a little unusual for fantasy, but not so unusual that you can&apos;t follow along with what&apos;s happening.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=3847363">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game throws the standards out the window. What is the usual end of your journey in any rpg related game? Death. That is not the case at all here, in fact you cannot die!
<br>That, however, doesn&apos;t mean a free ride through the game.
<br>Storytelling at its finest. Planescape: Torment is not just a game. It&apos;s a journey into a whole new universe. It is so unique, it doesn&apos;t get repetitive at any point, although its hack&amp;slash combat style is very simple, it&apos;s still fun, and very story-connected.  I&apos;m rooting for the sequel to meet the expectations, and resuscitate the D&amp;D RPGs. There has not been a game with story so memorable since.
<br>Hats off to Mr. Avellone for giving us this title.

One gets the impression that &quot;Torment&quot; is a product of some irretrievable, perfect circumstance whereby a team of like-minded individuals were free to think and work outside of monetary and publisher constraints. Everything about the game seems thoughtful and inherently intelligent as well as being masterfully crafted. The stellar, original art and sound direction compliment it&apos;s well-written, intricate plot. It is a detailed and subtle world inhabited by believably complex and meaningful characters with their own back stories and motivations. Instead of feeling that I was the center of the world, it seemed like it was all happening around me. I felt that I was killing real people for real reasons. Torment, like other brilliantly designed titles (i.e. Deus Ex, Fallout 2, Baldur&apos;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn) forced me to empathize and think. Such things define &apos;art&apos;. You&apos;ll really need to just play it to see what is meant.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=408334">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately this game does not have a great deal of it and I can&apos;t give it a 10, but it&apos;s still a very close run thing. Astounding. Unforgettable. Hypnotic. Exhilarating. The amnesiac storyline sounds cliched but this amnesiac storyline is so different, so well told, so deeply described that the game is more than forgiven for it. There are not many joinable NPCs, one of them is hard to find and another does not appear until near the end. But these NPCs have, individually, more personality than shelfloads of games than I could mention, so again, the game is more than forgiven. There are more than a few bugs. But this game is so engrossing that you don&apos;t really care. Game absolved again. From the constant thud thud in the Lower Ward to the very inspiring fighting music in Curst, the sounds in this game make it unforgettably atmospheric. This game does not have many areas, does not last very long and has been accused of having an unsatisfactory ending. But no other game has such a plethora of memorable characters, stimulating dialogues, great music, spell visuals and moments of great hilarity in such a short space of time. It just shows what can happen when people&apos;s motivation is belief and pride in what they are doing and a love for it too, as opposed to purely making money. As far as I know, there are two valid endings which occur about half way towards  the accepted ending (and one other  a lot closer). I can think of no other game which dares to do that. An exceptionally enduring masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=1771082">Expand</a></span>

I never had the chance to play Planescape: Torment till very recently, and let me tell you, this game is awesome, very awesome. It&apos;s not a game that would appeal to everyone, it&apos;s more or less the anti-Diablo game. One that focuses less on the combat, not saying the combat is bad, but Torment is a lot less combat intensive than the other Infinity engine games. That being said, the focus is on the story, and my oh my, what a story they have crafted, and weaved. This story in this game is emotionally engaging for the player. The game does have a plethora of text however, a necessity, but nevertheless, a warning for the illiterate. If you are a gamer out there that like RPGs, and not afraid of reading, and just happen to find it somewhere, buy it, play it... I can&apos;t possibly see how you would regret it. It seems to have stood the test of time very well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=402768">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Yes, this game is every ounce as good as people say. It&apos;s well written, well executed, and also manages to be enthralling and fun all at the same time. It&apos;s debatable whether this is the best role playing game in the medium, but I find on par with the likes of Baldur&apos;s Gate II.
<br>
<br>So, if you have never played Planescape: Torment, do so. I promise you will feel like it was worth it once you start playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=3377028">Expand</a></span>

Black Isle Studios, the titans of Dungeons &amp; Dragons CRPGs, turned convention on its head when they crafted this Planar adventure. There are no more typical fantasy races, morality is not defined, or is at least mutable, and every character attribute is tied to conversations and out of combat actions. It&#x2019;s a game of philosophy and discovery rather than a monster slaying adventure.
<br>
<br>&#x201C;What can change the nature of a man?&#x201D; is the question at the heart of Planescape: Torment. The Nameless One is an immortal amnesiac, living many lives, doing deeds terrible and great, changing the lives of those around him, often for the worst. Waking up on a mortuary slab, the mystery of his past propels the Nameless One through the Multiverse, one of the most bizarre settings of any RPG, where he deals with Gods, zealotic factions &#x2013; like the Dustmen, a faction that believes life is a fleeting precursor to the ultimate existence: death - and mazes both mechanical and magical.
<br>
<br>The ambition of Planescape: Torment would have been for naught were it not for the superb writing that accompanied it. Chris Avellone and Co penned a tale saturated with nuance and memorable characters that, even 14 years on, stands the test of time and has yet to be outdone. It&#x2019;s the only RPG where you&apos;ll find yourself searching through the protagonist&#x2019;s organs to find an important item, or where you may allow an NPC to kill you so that she could experience what it would be like to murder somebody. And all the while you&apos;ll wrestled with philosophical conundrums and questions of identity. If that all sounds a bit grisly and esoteric to you, then fret not, as the Nameless One is also accompanied by a floating, talking skull who is an unrepentant flirt and have a thing for zombies, so it&#x2019;s not all serious.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=6360523">Expand</a></span>

Cast as the Nameless One, an immortal being, you go in search of your own memories and the meaning of your life (and more...  but that would be a spoiler).  The story is vast and original, the art style marvellously gothic, and many characters in subsequent games are inspired by NPCs appearing in this one.  Still, I feel the game is overrated.  The story errs on the depressing side of tragic; it&apos;s hard to feel a connection with the Nameless One, especially on the matter of his past romance.  Game mechanics wise, it&apos;s busted; you&apos;ll want to powergame the Int/Wis/Cha stats to get extra conversation options (the meat of the game), but the later stages are full of annoyingly tough enemies for no good reason.  It&apos;s clear little effort got put into making the D&amp;D 2E system work well: combat in this game is something to skip past (you can) rather than enjoy.  I wonder if there&apos;s a fan patch to remove it?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=1681303">Expand</a></span>

PS:T is essentially a murder mystery with RPG elements, making it thoroughly enjoyable to play the first time through but limiting its replayability somewhat (which is why it gets a 9). If you like RPGs, and haven&apos;t picked up this game, you should.</span>

This game has it all: a deep, involving and at times graphic storyline that would Stephen King quit writing, healthy doses of bizarre humour and most of all, IMAGINATION. The world in which you exist is wonderfully tailored to capture the feel of a fantasy dimension, from the variety of species to the weird and wonderful locales. Indeed, the first 2 members of your party comprise of an undead immortal who can regenerate over time and a wise-cracking talking skull! There&apos;s also so much to do, as within the game are practically hundreds of quests to complete. You can even join a faction to access other areas, and the theme of character development plays hugely. Plainly, if your into D+D, this is a must have, especially at the ludicrously cheap budget price it&apos;s going at nowadays.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=366473">Expand</a></span>

Right now I am trying to find a game that could bring me at least half the joy I had from expiriencing Planescape Torment. But...no. they just don&apos;t make em like that anymore. Well Fallout 2 (or maybe Legacy of Kain Blood Omen, another great oldie) could be compared to Torment but the latter is somehow more gripping, believe me. So to the abyss with all the Final Fantasies, if you want some real stuff, which is beautiful, brutal and original, play Torment. By the way do not expect too much classic fantasy AD&amp;D from the game, though it is of course based on that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment/user-reviews?user_review_id=378369">Expand</a></span>

I can say that this is one of the BEST games I EVER had the pleasure of playing and also own...the story is so deep and so are the characters.If you love RPG games you MUST buy it, if you hate RPG games go buy it and you&apos;ll fall in love with them!Purely a work of art!!!</span>

If you like RPGs, stop reading this review now and go find yourself a copy as soon as possible. Whjy? The storyline and interactions with non-player characters have more depth than any other game. Many novels would do well to have as much depth and wel-done story.</span>

An unbelievably good story and background help make this game one of THE best things ever committed to the Computer and it certainly rules the D&amp;D CRPG roost.</span>

<br>First of all, it has way too many fedex type quests. It is too boring. That&apos;s -0.5.
<br>And then its combat is royally broken. So that&apos;s another -0.5.
<br>
<br>But then again, as I say again, it&apos;s the first true epic game, so I give it +1 bonus, that it&apos;s 10.</span>
