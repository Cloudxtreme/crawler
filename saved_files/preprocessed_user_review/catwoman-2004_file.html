                                        <span> Very very poor game by such a big name. Camera angles are the worst, controls are just as bad. Futhermore, graphics are average in my opinion. The only thing I liked was a hint of martial arts, however, that was also limited, I fund myself doing the same moves over and over! Nothing special, not at all impressed. Similar titles which are better I can suggest are Max Payne 2 and Spiderman 2.</span>

Catwoman certainly ranks as one the most beautifully rendered and animated characters to ever star in a video game. Not only is she wonderful to look at but she is equally wonderful to control. Her body responds quickly and precisely to analog gamepad input and pulling off cool moves is not terribly difficult. The combat sequences are not especially fantastic but they are for the most part well implemented and enjoyable. As stated above this is primarily a platformer and as such there is a lot of jumping and swinging, if thats not your thing then you should probably skip this release. Most reviewers have complained about the camera work and to some extent they are correct. Camera movement is constrained and focuses primarily on Catwoman, for obvious reasons. However, you can activate a first person view that allows you to look about wherever you wish, admitably only while you are standing still. I for one adjusted to this limitation and ultimately found it not to be much of an issue. And to be honest I could spend hours just watching her walk, boy oh boy can she walk. Overall the graphics are nice and should perform well on most modern gaming machines. A diamond in the rough that can be had for a song.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/catwoman-2004/user-reviews?user_review_id=395867">Expand</a></span>
