<br>I have never given a review on Metacritic before but felt it was important to review this game due to all the surrounding &quot;controversy&quot;.
<br>
<br>THE GAME itself is AWESOME. THE PORT was HORRIBLE (depending on your expectations). It&apos;s a 1:1 direct port to PC. Everyone wanted to play this game on PC and now you can, with a few caveats.
<br>
<br>IMPORTANT:
<br>To enjoy this game you MUST use a controller. The game goes from a horrible, unplayable, direct port. To a fun, exciting, easy to control game. Also, it is imperative that you download the graphic fix. Before this fix the game felt like it was straight out of 2000. With the fix, while it&apos;s no Skyrim, the graphics get a much needed boost, and become quite beautiful.
<br>
<br>PRE controller/graphics rating: 1
<br>POST controller/graphics rating: 9
<br>
<br>I wanted to do this to help people who are on the fence about this game, because while it is a direct port (some may say a lazy port) the ONLY things you need to do are a very minor graphic fix, and use a controller... I don&apos;t think thats too much to ask to enjoy a game of this caliber.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2587057">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Don&apos;t be afraid of the children raging about the controls just because they couldn&apos;t lower the camera sensitivity on the options menu. Several people already played and beaten this game on full keyboard and keyboard+mouse controls. Some even preffer not using a controler.
<br>
<br>Some people rage about the game being unfair and stupid while they try to play the game without learning the basic combat mechanics, without blocking, without locking target or trying to rush everything spaming the attack button on a game where you have a stamina bar. Enough said, the game expects you to analize your sorroundings before proceeding, to take one enemy at time, to learn how to deal with each enemy and each location  and to learn from your mistakes, something that some people just can&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Expect to die. That&apos;s part of the game not the end of it. That&apos;s how you learn to play the game: by dying and experimenting; observing enemy patterns, learning to parry attacks or when desperate calling help from other players online. Talking to the community, wanting to learn how to play the game and upgrading your gear is also for the best. If you have doubts, don&apos;t hesitate to ask.

To be frank, I played Demon&apos;s Souls as well as Dark Souls on PS3 and they both played and looked much better than this sloppy PC version. I know a lot of reviews here are biased because it is an amazing game, but it&apos;s really unfair to new comers. If you are a new player who do not own a console then you need to buy a gamepad first to make the game playable and enjoyable, then hassle for a while with the third party fan-made patch to make it look as nice as console version. I do not think those hassles should be placed on an average gamer. If you want to try this beautiful game on pc then I&apos;d say wait it on sale for $10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2604893">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Assuming you are playing with a controller (first time I&apos;ve ever hooked my xbox controller up to my PC but totally worth it)
<br>-The controls feel great.
<br>-The graphics are good once modded.
<br>-The gameplay is solid, not once did I die and think, &quot;Well that was unfair.&quot;
<br>-Combat has weight and strategy.
<br>-The world is dark medieval fantasy at its best.
<br>-Boss fights are grand, epic, challenging, and rewarding once taken down.
<br>-Armor is interesting.
<br>-Weapons look neat and feel distinct.
<br>-Difficulty is just right.
<br>-Death is an expected teaching mechanic.  -You are punished for making bad decisions but through those decisions you come up with new ideas.  -This game punishes you with death for making bad decisions but it rewards you for playing smart.
<br>-Each encounter is consistent, deliberate, and gives the player plenty of opportunity to make the right decisions.
<br>
<br>At the end of the day, Dark Souls delivers the same experience as consoles but with some extra content, a faster framerate, cheaper price point, and the potential to pickup a mod for higher resolution textures.
<br>
<br>Play this with a USB controller, my xbox controller had no issues syncing up for this game.  I highly recommend people play this game on any system they can get their hands on.  Just make sure your have a controller if you get the PC version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2578064">Expand</a></span>

I can&apos;t imagine Dark Souls being less difficult, unforgiving, it teaches you that life is more suffering than pleasure, more failure than success. But if you are persistent enough you will be awarded with a pure sense of jubilation. Nothing else in gaming compares to this experience.</span>

<br>Now with the fanfix, the game looks absolutely stunning, much better than it ever did on consoles. Only problem remaining is the 30 fps lock, that sometimes drops to 15 fps for whatever reason. I hope the modder can fix this as well, because the devs likely won&apos;t.
<br>As for the game it&apos;s unlike anything I&apos;ve played before, and most importantly the antithesis to all modern games that want to be as easy, casual, and cinematic as possible. DS shines in world design, combat mechanics, and an unforgiving but rewarding difficulty. Worth a shot for anyone who likes action RPGs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2582172">Expand</a></span>

Now, keep in mind this is a CONSOLE PORT. It was meant to be a console port and it is a console port. You need a gamepad (I used Razer Onza) to really enjoy the controls.

Out of the box the game looks horribly on 1080p screen, after switching the buffer size to 3840x2160px it&apos;s a completely different game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2578393">Expand</a></span>

One of the best games of all time down voted because it is the exact same as the console (not entirely true, extra content + durante&apos;s rez fix + better frame rates make this the ultimate version).  Just goes to show that PC gamers dont actually like great games, they like epeen things like $1000 video cards and 3-monitor setups.  Meh, their loss.</span>

The game itself is strict but fair; any mistakes made will be punished severely but the game will never cheat. Similar to Bayonetta and Devil May Cry, you will get to the end of the game not by brute-forcing it, but by becoming a better player. It is one of the most rewarding games to play on PC.
<br>
<br>It is just a shame that such an amazing game has been let down by one of the worst ports in memory, regardless of the player-made fixes available.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2579912">Expand</a></span>

Crashes, stutters, drop frame rate, no control options outside of a controller (that may or may not work), no graphics settings, and a locked frame rate make it impossible for me to enjoy this. No one should support a developer who releases sub par dross like this.</span>

<br>First off: all help messages are given for the Xbox360 controller, even though I don&apos;t have a controller plugged in.  I spent 5 minutes mashing every key on the keyboard trying to figure out how to get to the options menu before finally hitting &quot;End&quot; to open the options.  What the hell?  End?  Really?  Couldn&apos;t use the Escape key like EVERY OTHER GAME?
<br>
<br>So I find out the D-pad corresponds to the arrow keys, then when I pick up my sword and shield, it tells me to use the left and right on the D-pad to switch to my sword, so I hit left and right arrow keys a few times and nothing happens.  I have to dig through some inventory menus to equip my sword first I guess.  Why not tell me that?
<br>
<br>While we are on the topic of controls: I use a non-QWERTY keyboard, so where the W key should be, is actually a comma.  I tried to remap the move forward key and it would not let me set the W key (which is the comma character).  Why on Earth would it not accept the comma character is beyond me.  This is the first game I have EVER encountered (of the hundreds and hundreds I have played) that wouldn&apos;t let me do that.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s get to the menus.  They are absolutely not friendly to a mouse pointer at all.  Some widgets you can click, some you can&apos;t; you never know what&apos;s going to happen when you try to click on something.  The only reliable way to use the menus are with the arrow keys.
<br>
<br>Playing through the first area I noticed the camera felt pretty difficult to control and then it hit me: the camera is not moving based on how far I move my mouse!  Moving the mouse simply makes the camera move at a fixed speed.  Excuse me?  I feel like I&apos;m trying to play Doom 1 over here.  While we&apos;re talking about the mouse: I constantly see my Windows mouse cursor over top of the game and it is incredibly distracting.
<br>
<br>Sound:  I have a 5.1 sound system, but I play using headphones at night out of respect for my neighbors and roommates.  There are no audio options to switch to stereo mode, so with headphones I could not hear any voices in the game, even while subtitles were playing.
<br>
<br>Graphics:  I can accept the 30 fps cap and I can accept the 720p upscaling, but come on, this is 2012.  At least try.
<br>
<br>So all in all I rate this 0/10 because, although it may have a cool story and fun gameplay, I couldn&apos;t experience it because of the shoddy nature of the port.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2578089">Expand</a></span>

PC version is way better than the console versions its the definitive version of this superb game. There is a lot of misinformation about this being a poor port its not at all. Its certainly not the best looking game ever made but also with the upscaling graphical mods (check the neogaf forums) now available it looks very good in places &amp; is very well optimised on PC. The higher resolution alone makes it look a lot better than the console but throw in the mods, AF filtering, instant load times, vsync &amp; smooth FPS combine to make it a decent enough technical experience. Its designed around the MS 360 gamepad &amp; wokrs very well with that. KB+mouse is not the best way to play this but still possible. This game has superb atmosphere, art direction, voice acting &amp; creature/work designs. One of the best games ever made  &amp; also one of the hardest its not an easy game but also not as challenging as others its more about exploration &amp; making the right choices. GFWL works very well here but most of the time you will not even notice its present apart from the achievements appearing onscreen (you can even disable these notifications if you do not want to break atmosphere). Ignore the BS &amp; hate campaigns against this game its one of the best ever made &amp; just has a unique &amp; superb atmosphere. Only a 3.7GB install as the game is so well optimised &amp; the textures highly compressed. No pointless lengthy FMV here or dialog to waste disc space its so the install size is small but the game world is still pretty large.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2579001">Expand</a></span>

Even if we were to dismiss the graphical issues, low FPS, locked internal resolution and the technical problems on some hardware like crashes and freezes, we&apos;re still left with one plain and simple fact. Dark Souls is designed to be played with a gamepad. No effort was made to alter that fact in any way. As a result the keyboard and mouse settings are clunky, unwieldy and imprecise, the camera a cruel mistress at the best of times. Any fan of this title knows that precision is key to success and the mouse controlled camera affords none whatsoever, whereas the attempting to use solely the keyboard results in a rather awkward realization that an additional hand would be necessary to accomplish anything at all. It&apos;s unfortunate this port is such a disaster, as this is by far one of the best RPGs (if we are to define &quot;RPG&quot; in the &quot;Diablo&quot; sense of the term as opposed to say, the Baldur&apos;s Gate sense) to have come out in a good decade.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2578484">Expand</a></span>

Now, add the console port issues to that and you&apos;ve got one of the biggest mess of a game this year. If I had to rate the vanilla game, I&apos;d give it a 0 or 1. They absolutely took ZERO time to make this run better on the PC. What&apos;s funnier, a group of game developers (console experts or not) can&apos;t do, what a modder can do in 23 minutes, at all. The game itself is good, though the combat is almost identical with The Witcher 2&apos;s difficulty and combat, it&apos;s just as enjoyable. Cinematics are good, so is exploration and character customization, but god, the menus and the tutorials are atrocius. The guy who had the idea to make the End button the one which brings the menu up instead of Escape should be fired. I actually had to Alt+Tab and search how to open the menu, just like the inventory menu in Skyrim.
<br>To make this short, it&apos;s a great game, but GFWL and the issues I mentioned make this game very unfriendly. If you are patient enough to wait until modders fix the game or the developers use the modders&apos; works as patches, then wait. If you&apos;re completely fed up with GFWL, I suggest pirating is the way to go. I swore that Bulletstorm will be the last game I buy that uses GFWL, and sadly, I had to keep this promise, since there is no DRM free version. It&apos;s sad that Namco Bandai choose to go EA&apos;s way, meaning the DRM and no optimization.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2578116">Expand</a></span>

This is bonkers, and more insulting given From KNEW they had a market before doing the port. Ugly, entirely unoptimized, and terribly KB&amp;M controls. Going to have to wait for people who actually care about quality to fix this mess.</span>

At first glance it seems like something someone at Namco ported this during a lunch break. There are bad PC ports where the game menus are keyboard only and are rough around the edges, and then there is this. In my first minutes of playing the game I ran into several problems. Right off the bat there is the FPS lock, the 720p resolution, the lack of options in to &quot;options&quot; menu. The options menu has a grand total of five options. Resolution, refresh rate, full screen, AA, and motion blur. What about texture quality or MXAA or particle effects? Jumping into the game there is a prompt to &quot;press &apos;a&apos; to pick up dungeon key&quot;. Now unless the use key is actually bound to the &quot;a&quot; key there is no reason to have the xbox key prompts instead of actual keys. &quot;Press &apos;Start&apos; to open menu and arms icon&quot;. After impotently face rolling my keyboard, I discovered &quot;end&quot; was the start key. Not escape. End. People claiming that this was meant for a game pad are delusional plain and simple. The majority of people who play on PCs use a keyboard and mouse and expect to have indicators that can be easily understood. That isn&apos;t entitlement, that is a fundamental right for a gamer. It would be just as surprising to me if an imported game was still in the native language and considering this port I&apos;m surprised it isn&apos;t , in fact, in Japanese. There was no excuse to pay for a port as poor as this. After seeing how well crafted and great Dark souls was, I patiently waited for this port. It is such a shame such a beautiful gem was weighed down by such abysmal work in a port rendered this game frustratingly bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2578572">Expand</a></span>

Having analogue sticks would certainly make controlling a bit more precise, but I&apos;ve had no problems playing with keyboard alone. The default config is working fine for me, but the keys are completely remappable in-game, so there&apos;s really no excuses to complain about the controls. It&apos;s true that the in-game prompts don&apos;t display the keyboard keys, but if you can&apos;t even be bothered to read the manual and see what the controls are before playing a game you&apos;re not qualified to write a review for it in my opinion. Despite the minor issues I feel this game is fully deserving of a 10/10 based on the gameplay alone.

I cant believe this game was ever, and I mean ever released for the PC, I would feel ashamed as a developer here. I can&apos;t believe people are poking this to a anywhere near positive rating, it&apos;s unacceptable to release a game that cant run with decent controls unless gamers invest in an xbox or playstation controller, - if players wants to use that, they would have gotten the game for their consoles. Wake up people, this is not acceptable. - I was stuck at some point trying to figure out how to open the main menu to check my controls, but I never found it after pressing every damn key on my keyboard. - Don&apos;t support this - Don&apos;t buy this game...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2579574">Expand</a></span>

<br>I don&apos;t mind the limited resolution. On the first day someone already provided a fix for that.
<br>
<br>.. but what I do mind is the fact how insulting the implementation of the controls are. Wake up. This PC version isn&apos;t a love-letter from the developer to the PC community. No, the management looked at the 100&apos;000+ petition and thought... wow, easy money. Lets do a port with the least effort possible!
<br>
<br>The result is, that they didn&apos;t even bother do remove the windows mouse cursor from the screen while in game! The ingame hints are based on the xbox controller layout and cannot be changed. The keyboard / mouse control method is next to useless. You need to play it in order to see how abysmal the controls actually are.
<br>
<br>&quot;So what? Get a gamepad!&quot; some may cry. The default PC peripherals are mouse and keyboard last time I checked and if you own a gamepad then the chances are pretty decent, that you also own a console. So whats the point of a PC version in the first place? The  Dark Souls DLC is coming to consoles later this year anyway.
<br>
<br>But if you already own a gamepad or you&apos;re willing to invest into one, then ignore the user ratings, because with a gamepad the gameplay experience is as it should be. Read the official critic reviews, hype yourself up and enjoy one of the best mature RPG experiences that there is out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2579679">Expand</a></span>

Naitively the game does not support resolutions higher than 1024X720 (though that was somewhat fixed by some random guy in about...23 minutes. Apparently 23 minutes is just too much time for From to put into the game. Keep in mind he had no experience with the game nore a source code). And the controls. The windows mouse arrow is in the middle of the game screen. That is just pathetic. Oh and instead of the mouse controlling the camera (like, ya know, practically all other PC games with a moveable camera) the mouse only acts to control a virtual joystick, and this virtual joystick move the camera slower than it is moved on the PS3 or 360 version. Mouse accerlation (which is a bad thing already) was reveresed and as a result if you move the mouse quicker it actually slows down the camera. And then the game uses GFWL...

<br>This port is just horrible. It is **** Do NOT buy it you would be wasting your money on a pile of **** and telling developers and publishers &quot;Hey, I&apos;m cool if you release broken **** I&apos;ll still eat it up nom nom nom!&quot; The people giving it 10 stars or anything higher than a **** 5 are either fanboys or marketers being paid to do so. Hell, the two &quot;professional reviewers&quot; gave this **** an 92 and 89. I bet you almost anything they happened to get a little gift from Namco or FromSoft, that are the reviewers themselves are fanboys. Now, port aside. This game really is great, it is unfortunate that the port is such utter **** If you have a PS3 or 360 or if the PC version gets fixed then I do highly recommend you buy the game, but do not buy this port so long as it is a steaming pile of ****</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2578103">Expand</a></span>

So this is the game that my friends pictured to me as the &apos;&apos;Panacea of Gaming&apos;&apos; and turned out to be completely wrong. The gameplay is clunky as hell, especially when you engage in a boss fight.. The map design feels bland and very empty, not to mention that the graphics are downright terrible. Is this 2012 or 2004? Ok, continuing with this, its not open world as some people told me, its completely linear and boring and the character lacks personality and charisma. Also, it has GFWL. That is enough for anyone to stay away. I don&apos;t even know why companies still use this. I&apos;m glad i got it as a birthday gift, but sometimes i wish my friend didn&apos;t have to spend that amount of money. I&apos;m not ungrateful, on the contrary, but this game is definitely not my cup of tea. Definitely one of the most disappointing games of 2012.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2577914">Expand</a></span>

Yes, I can set the resolution to 1920 x 1080, but it&apos;s obviously still intended to be played on a big screen.  Don&apos;t get me started on the control system; if I&apos;d wanted to use a gamepad to play a game, I&apos;d have bought it for my 360 instead.  You can customize the keyboard controls and even use a mouse (mouse support is just terrible), but all of the on-screen prompts assume you&apos;re using a game pad.  So you&apos;re left either mashing keys until you get the right one, or having to look it up on the cheat-sheet you&apos;ve probably had to print out to stand any chance of even being able to press the correct button.  The camera controls are also extremely annoying.  TL;DR - If you want this game, get the console version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2577520">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Dark Souls is one of the most critically acclaimed games of all time. The game sold very well and has created the current Souls series which includes Dark Souls, Dark Souls II, Bloodborne, and Dark Souls III. Dark Souls was created by Fromsoftware it was to be the spiritual successor Demon&apos;s Souls which was worked on by the same team. People praised the game for its difficulty and thick atmosphere. I have been told by many people to play this game. I finally played it and beat it in a few weeks. I frankly did not enjoy that much. If you are expecting a positive review you can look at another review now. I felt that Dark Souls was a flawed janky game that was hamstrung by its difficulty but had well designed levels and ambiance.
<br>
<br>Presentation:
<br>
<br>Dark Souls has a passable presentation. The graphics are decent for a game that came out in 2011. The game&apos;s visuals as an overall package can look quite excellent in times and give you the feeling of hopelessness and oppression. The menus are design can be a bit clunky with your inventory filling up too much. The levels are designed with a high level of detail that greatly increases the immersion. Overall Dark Souls has a presents quite well.
<br>
<br>Story:
<br>
<br>Here is the part where I begin to not like Dark Souls. Dark Souls has a highly convoluted story that follows the theme of light and dark.  Dark Souls has a minimalistic plot. Historical events in this world and their significance are often implicit and left to player interpretation rather than fully shown or explained. Most of the story is given to the player through dialogue from characters within the game, flavor text from items, and world design.The opening cutscene begins in primeval times, with a world shrouded by grey fog and ruled by Everlasting Dragons. In this world, Gwyn happens upon the First Flame and finds a Lord Soul, and with his allies, use their power to defeat the dragons beginning the Age of Fire. But all flames must fade, so after thousands of years, the Age of Fire was dwindling. With the dwindling flame, the undead curse appears, where certain humans become branded with the Dark Sign and continually resurrect upon death, losing a small piece of their humanity and sense of self with each death. The player begins as one of these cursed undead, locked away in an undead asylum &quot;To the North&quot;. After escaping the asylum with the aid of the knight Oscar, the player ventures to Lordran attempting to follow a mysterious prophecy, given to them by Oscar. From there the story takes off. I feel that the game&apos;s story is too convoluted and minimalistic to tell a great story I understand that many will disagree with me on this.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:
<br>
<br>Dark Souls most lacking aspect is in the gameplay department. The game seems to be more focused on difficulty than eljouablbilty. Many deaths in the game can be unfair such as the games poor hit detection and physics which can cause your character to sometimes corrine off a cliff. I feel that Dark Souls has created a nasty tread in this area of creating difficulty as the center of the gameplay which can greatly take away from the experience. I believe that games should be enjoyable experiences and not frustrating ones. I believe that Dark Souls difficulty would be much more fair if it had a difficulty setting so players can choose how hard they want the game. The very well respected game critic Jim Sterling agrees with this and has wrote and said in the past that he wouldn&#x2019;t mind Dark Souls having an easy mode so it would be acceptable to less experienced players. The game uses a basic action RPG combat. The game also uses a basic leveling system where you choose a class and build it from there. The game also features many frustrating level designs especially Sen&#x2019;s Fortress which features many cheap and unfair traps that makes you often have to restart the area many times. The game also features some of the worst platforming in video game history even worse than the original Half-Life. Dark Souls combat I mostly found boring frustrating and repetitive and incompetent. Overall Dark Souls gameplay is far more frustrating than enjoyable.
<br>
<br>Technical:
<br>
<br>Dark Souls suffers from many technical problems and crashed on me many times in the middle of playing. The game also experienced many strange glitches as well. The game also had a terrible physics system which would glitch in and out and ruin the entire experience.
<br>
<br>Overall:
<br>
<br>Dark Souls is poorly made game. I don&#x2019;t understand the praise this game gets. Maybe I am not the demographic for this game. I see Dark Souls has a bad influence the game industry. Bloodborne when it came out was praised for the same reason by critics but I hated it as well and they claimed it was a true survival horror game. As a survival horror fan I see it infest and ruin recent horror games to focus on difficulty to &#x201C;scare&#x201D; the player vs. genuinely trying to scare player in creative ways. I am greatly looking forward to Resident Evil 7. And so far from the trailer and demo it looks great but I hope that it takes influence from horror games like P.T. and SIlent Hill that focussed and real storytelling and scares over cheap difficulty to stress the player. I feel that games are made to be fun and Dark Souls is not that game. I give Dark Souls a very disappointing 4/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6701758">Expand</a></span>

It has an interesting interconnected world with very different areas. It has a deppressing but interesting hidden ish lore. And most important of all, the gameplay is engaging and fun. You already know everything else about this game.</span>

<br>
<br>The people complaining about the port are just silly. Yes, it&apos;s a bad port, but you only need a controller and 2 minutes of your life to install a mod that fixes everything.</span>

<br>
<br>What&apos;s very interesting to me, and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve experienced this with a game before, is how the consciousness that you develop when playing Dark Souls leaks into the rest of your life, and you find yourself examining reality with a different mindset. That&apos;s pretty amazing. I guess YMMV
<br>
<br>A challenging, magical, life changing game for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6576426">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>After three hours of messing with options and trying different fixes I was able to get the game to actually start. I finally got through the pain of that to discover how bad the port of this game actually is. If you are potential customer please please heed my warning before buying this. It is simply not worth it. Here is some of what you will go through even IF you get the game running:
<br>
<br>The game requires you to be constantly connected to GFWL to even save the game; GFWL is a broken and discontinued service. Good luck finding some workaround.
<br>
<br>All of the default settings and control settings make no sense, and none of the tips are tied to a keyboard  mouse. A few kind souls have tried to develop some fixes (dsfix and dsmfix) but they may not work for you. Even after downloading these fixes and messing with the .ini files, I cannot get my mouse to work with this game.

I don&apos;t understand the motivation of the main character, whom you play as. You are seeking a goal but in the end the goal does nothing for your character, it is a flame that beckons and keeps you warm but upon sitting with it all it does is destroy you at the end. The end is nothing more than the relationship a moth has with a flame. So there it is at the end, after all the time you spend with the flame, after all the trials and hardships and gifts it does nothing but destroy you. Enjoy your oblivious and pointless ending of nothingness. Sounds are subtle and that&apos;s a flaw because without the audio I can not sense theme or meaning. A large example of this is during the last part of the game it will only play an obtusely and exaggerated piano solo in a vain attempt to garner an emotional response from the player when at the time all you should feel as the player is a yawning sense of unease, boredom and just general defeatism. This is something that generally carries through the entire audio library of the game, monotone clang sounds for weapons that match one another and unsatisfying sounds when a weapon connects makes nothing but a small shearing noise. Controls are heavy and slow and overall confusing, for example once you hit the attack button you have to commit to the attack animation and if it misses this will result in a longer recovery meaning you are encouraged to really never attack except in the most assuredly favorable conditions. Chances are for the player that&apos;s practically never. I don&apos;t understand why a pole-arm would work differently than a sword or saber. Graphics are substandard and the player inexplicably always casts a light source which shows technical weakness such as 2D flora, characters generally rip from all 6th century archetypes and such. Example being the sun worshipping is not unlike Zoroarastrism. Additionally the commodity system is bungled in how that it is tied to your character&apos;s experience system for levelling making the overall game an absolute chore. That&apos;s just the game in the end: a job with no joy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3644468">Expand</a></span>

<br>OK no problem about the</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">PC Review: Out of box, this was a piece of trash.

I got the latest patch and it fixed the resolution problem so I can play at 1080p. The graphics... are horrendous.  Was this really on the PS3? Wow.
<br>
<br>OK no problem about the graphics since I am not a big graphics guy anyway. Lets go into the game and play. The game is an action/rpg. The story is bland. You start off as an undead and you start working your way out of some sort of prison on an island or something. The 1st thing you fight is a boss who will kill you a few times when you first start playing. Why you might ask? Well, because the controls are even worse than the graphics.
<br>
<br>1st glaring problem is responsiveness. The game is designed to react slowly... why anyone would enjoy a twitch action game with slow response is beyond my understanding but lets continue. You click a button and the character doesnt actually move right away but rather you have to wait about 1/4 second before he does. This takes time to get used to and results in getting hit a lot initially until you get the timing. Its frustrating at first because if the controls were instant then the 1st enemy would actually be very easy to dodge and attack but whatever. They wanted us to play like we are in a 2 ton tank. Ok fine. Next problem.
<br>
<br>Camera... Oh my god... how on earth can you make a game with this type of camera in this day and age. The camera is exactly like the horrible camera in Devil May Cry 1 on the PS2. It is so so bad that I refused to buy any more DMC games after finishing the 1st because my memories of that game are only of frustration. Like DMC, the camera in this game will eventually get you killed not because an enemy is hard, but because your view gets blocked by obstacles or the enemy itself. This is unforgivable in a modern game. Yes you can still finish the game, but it is not fun.

<br>OK so with the problems above, I decided to switch to my Xbox controller so that I can control the movement speeds a bit better (its analog which cannot really be duplicated easily on keyboard) and to see if I can control the camera better with the 2nd stick. The game played better with the controller but the problem with the camera persisted because sudden motions and dodges can often get you out of alignment and make you vulnerable without being able to see the enemy.
<br>
<br>The game itself is ok. It basically plays like Zelda or similar action RPG&apos;s but with a horrible camera. I do like that it is more rpg heavy than Zelda but the slow responsiveness and camera really makes it lose a lot in gameplay. After about 2 hours of play, I realized that the game is going to revolve around memorization of enemy movement and I decided to uninstall and return the game for a refund. Sorry but memorization of enemies is not how an RPG should be. RPG are supposed to be strategic where the player can overcome with good preparation and tactics. This game is less about that than it is about trial and error. This is not what I enjoy about RPG&apos;s. If I wanted that type of game I would have purchased an adventure game not an action twitch shooter or an RPG.
<br>
<br>I wouldnt say the game is horrible but lets be real. Graphics look a step above PS2 (not PS3 era). Controls on PC are not fully realized due to analog mechanics and camera movement. Even with a controller the camera is horrible. Its an action game with purpose input delay... Thanks but no thanks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4212887">Expand</a></span>

The online of the game is that you can join a random world and help or kill someone and they can join your two, which is a nice touch but most of the time when someone join you it really lags and you can do a thing when one invades your world at lvl 60 and your lvl 12. it is a hard game and the control really bad you need a controller to play it. some of the sub boss are harder then real boss but it is a good challenge and you might like. The graphics beautiful with the mod for 1080p. A good game but with the problems it has I am going give it a 6.9 but I recommend to someone who like a good rpg.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2676684">Expand</a></span>

<br>So naturally i had to try it. And let me just tell you, this is literally the worst i have ever played.
<br>
<br>Graphics (1/10)  PREPARE TO PUKE
<br>Some games releases 10 years ago had superior visuals to this turd.
<br>I&apos;ts muddy, colorless, blurry, low contrast, not to mention low resolution.
<br>If you don&apos;t plan to play on a TV at a huge distance, you might be kinda fine?
<br>But if you try to play it on a 1920x1080 screen, you will have a bad time.
<br>
<br>Performance (1/10)  PREPARE TO LAG!
<br>Worst optimized game ever, i run skyrim and kingdoms of amalur at smooth 60 fps  and these are not the best optimized games either, but with FAR superior graphics. And yet here, despite the 30 fps cap, my fps is usually around 20. What a joke.
<br>
<br>Gameplay (1/10)
<br>Prepare to Die, yeah no kidding. This is one of the games where error margin is very tight. Basically you will have to replay the same part of the game until you get it right, one mistake or two, and you&apos;re back to the checkpoint. That&apos;s alot like Hotline Miami, but that game had insanely fun and fast combat, also you didn&apos;t want to kill yourself when you screw up, because you lose nothing, except several seconds of your life  Here combat is slow, clunky and boring, mostly due to terrible controls (even with a controller its still pretty bad). And you will die often, but checkpoints are far between, also dying causes permanent penalties, so every time you die you get so frustrated you&apos;ll want to really die, or just stop playing this game.
<br>
<br>On the bright side there is an awesome enemy variety, no wait, you just fight zombies all the times. Bummer.
<br>
<br>Voice Acting (1/10)
<br>Theres not much of dialogues here, and that&apos;s for the best, since the voice acting and writing for this game is just pathetic. Also no lipsync at all, people talk to you through their ass i suppose.
<br>
<br>On a side note, i had to start a game over again, because i accidentally attacked some NPC, and he (wait for it) KILLED ME, THEN KEPT GANKING ME WHILE I RESPAWN... OVER AND OVER AGAIN. There was a genius behind game design here i tell you.
<br>
<br>Final Rating (1/10)  There are many factors that determines if a game is good or not. Audiovisuals, fun gameplay, good story... this is lousy in every of these aspects. Basically the only thing it goes for is a challenge. But dying and failing over and over isn&apos;t fun. Especially in a ugly, choppy, clunky and boring mess of a game. That&apos;s just my opinion, some people like this game, but i say they are insane.
<br>And stuff like graphics and performance are NOT subjective, in those terms this game really deserves a (1/10), so people who rate this game 10 or even 9, are full of sh1t.
<br>
<br>Here are games that you will enjoy more than this turd:
<br>Skyrim, Kingdoms of Amalur, Two Worlds II, Witcher 2, Darksiders II</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3288645">Expand</a></span>

But only if you&#x2019;re really good, and only if you understand its systems perfectly&#x2014;that its crafting system matters, that certain items can be obtained only by fulfilling obfuscated quests. Or you can just play as Pyromancer. In a genre where systems are king, Dark Souls reigns because it&#x2019;s all about systems. Just learning how each stat affects your character&#x2019;s build is a process deeper than most D&amp;D-themed RPGs, but it&#x2019;s ultimately just as rewarding.
<br>
<br>So is discovering the rich lore of Lordran, which is told through cryptic conversations and subtle environmental clues. The depth of Dark Souls&apos; world carries over into exploration, too. Everything is connected brilliantly, and secrets and shortcuts&#x2014;including massive hidden areas and features&#x2014;await the most dedicated adventurers. Dark Souls&apos; summoning system is also unlike anything else in RPGs, but you can unplug and beat the whole game solo, or learn to love being invaded and fighting off another player.
<br>
<br>You died. Mostly because it&apos;s a terrible port  to PC; you&apos;re punished for trying to play with mouse+keynoard. The line where the fun of masochistically being killed time and again and suffering defeat because of the horrible port had to be drawn somewhere. Use a controller and get the graphic fix to alleviate the problems. Still dying?

However the only real challenge in this title comes from resisting the urge to turn it off when you&apos;re forced to repeat the journey to the &apos;Bosses&apos; for the 20th time, wading through constantly respawning enemies that just stand there until being activated. That&apos;s the challenge. Not the ingenious game design or the (non existent) AI. Avoiding mistakes because you&apos;ve repetitively completed this very journey 20 times before. Killing the exact same enemy exactly the same way for an hour.
<br>
<br>I could ignore the terrible repetitive gameplay if it there was a semblance of storyline propelling you through the game. Which is where we come to the second part of the &apos;appeal&apos; of the game, how rewarding it is. Rewarding is seeing a story develop, overcoming a challenge and being rewarded with more exposition, more areas to explore and a change in challenge. The first 4 bosses require you to cycle around the same general area over and over killing the same enemies over and over, and the reward? Getting to do it again for the next boss, as everytime you save, all the enemies re spawn. Great idea, shall we spend time on story, enemy AI, environment design? Nah just respawn them all in the same place and get &apos;em to do it again. And again. And again, after all we&apos;ve got their money right?
<br>
<br>Also the port is unplayable without an xbox controller.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2789805">Expand</a></span>

<br>The problem is that this game really does demand too much of you. If I were a teenager with nothing better to do, I would score this a 9 or 10, but as a married man that works and has two kids, this is too much. I don&apos;t have the time to go back and fight the same boss for the fifth time just to have my behind handed over to me.
<br>As a game, it&apos;s great. It is addictive as anything and very satisfying, but it does cross that line from being a game to feeling almost like a commitment. Too much for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3127303">Expand</a></span>

Playing with a keyboard and a mouse is possible but not easy (with a controller it&apos;s a lot easier).There is no excuse for these problems and as you&apos;re playing it becomes clear that the developers did not put any effort into making the game suitable for PC. You have to resort to community-created fixes and mods to get past the problems that they should&apos;ve taken care of but apparently were too lazy to. Even the tutorial is for people with X-Box controllers and the mouse is always jittery.
<br>
<br>The game is difficult but that&apos;s basically the trademark of Dark Souls so I don&apos;t consider that a negative. It was meant to be hard and it&apos;s clearly not meant to be played by casual gamers seeking purely entertainment. The game doesn&apos;t tell you the story the traditional way - by handing it for you on a silver platter. Instead you have to be interested yourself - you need to combine the pieces you got from talking to NPCs, reading item descriptions, looking at the game environment and deducing into a story. Not a groundbreaking story but a decent story.
<br>
<br>One thing I absolutely love about this game is the bosses. Oftentimes they do not really have any ties to the story but they are so difficult that beating them feels rewarding, like you truly accomplished something. The people who designed the bosses had a good imagination; each and every boss is interesting and unique. Not that there are any complaints about your everyday enemies in this game.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is absolutely fantastic and that&apos;s a good thing because that&apos;s what this game is completely based around. You don&apos;t need to sit through 30-min cutscenes, instead you can play the game itself and that&apos;s all you need to ever do. You are fighting enemies more powerful than yourself so combat is not just mindless button mashing. In combat, you have many options and not just &quot;boring attack 1&quot; and &quot;boring attack 2&quot; and to win you need to know how to use all the different mechanics. You need to be patient and getting from point A to point B is never easy as enemies never disappear - they respawn always if you rest at a checkpoint.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re looking for a challenge and a certain old RPG-charm (and you can stand playing the game with a keyboard and mouse or you are ready to buy a controller which you shouldn&apos;t have had to buy) then you&apos;ve found your game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2881804">Expand</a></span>

If you press beyond the PC port issues there is some rewarding content later on.  As long as you go the right way and have a walkthrough open most of the time.</span>

I came out of Dark Souls feeling like a man who took on the world and won. It is a horrible port, but when a game is this good it really doesn&apos;t matter as the community had fixed it before the first week was finished. || **Long Version: Ignore any review that complains about the resolution or about how its unplayable on your mouse and keyboard. This is the ultimate RPG experience for anybody with a brain, as all you need is a 1 megabyte mod extracted into the root directory of the game and a controller of some kind, which is a must have regardless of what games you play. A miniscule amount of effort will enable you to experience the game in beautiful 1080p with high quality SSAO and SMAA which makes it look as good as most PC titles. The games mechanics are flawless to say the least, with a large amount of risk vs reward that leaves you feeling like you actually accomplished something without the entire world screaming &apos;HAIL DRAGONBORN, YOU ARE OUR HERO!&apos;. The arsenal of weapons and armors are just as impressive as everything else in the game. You can wear a leather trenchcoat and wield a 40kg crossbow which fires bolts big enough to skewer a bear, and instantly swap to a 8 foot long katana. If that isn&apos;t your style though you can always wear armor the size of a truck and dual wield greatswords. The people who slander this game for things that you can fix in less than a minute really should get it for console, right after selling their PC and never infecting the platform with their lazy, misinformed, inane babble.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2635808">Expand</a></span>

First off, this game is more like an 8.5/8.75, but, whatever.  After playing quite a bit of Dark Souls now (never played it on the Xbox/PS3), I feel like the need to opine on this &quot;masterpiece.&quot;  The game is definitely fun and it&apos;s a hell of a game.  I&apos;ll be playing all through the semester.  However, I would not bring this up to the level of &quot;masterpiece&quot; by any stretch.  First and foremost, this is a game by gamers for gamers.  For people outside the hardcore gaming community, there is almost nothing going for the game.  The graphics are decent, but not spectacular; the story isn&apos;t bad, but it&apos;s poorly told; and the gameplay is repetative.  Let me expound on the story a little.  It ain&apos;t there for ya.  You&apos;ve got to find it.  But when you do, the acting and the dialouge are meh, so there&apos;s a lot less incentive to look for the hidden pieces.  (As contrast, consider the hidden dialouge of the Mass Effect series and the incredible writings - as in the books - of The Elder Scrolls and the original Deus Ex; I consider these much better examples of quality hidden plotlines).  Also, the lack of connection between the different sequences leaves you scratching your head.  I appreciate digging to find a story, but the inability to direct your search in any meaningful way means you&apos;re missing a ton unless you have outside help.  Next, and this a big one for all us gamers, I don&apos;t find this game hard.  Sure, you die a lot, but that doesn&apos;t make it hard in the technical sense.  The mechanics of the game are straightforward and the controls easy to master.  The environment does throw curveballs at you, but the reality of it is that a little examination of an area and the enemies removes any tricks.  In particular, enemy attacks are all identical in type (if not form): blockable and unblockable.  It&apos;s not rocket science to figure out.  There are still tactical choices to make involving positioning and stamina level, but once you figure out that you can block even crazy looking attacks (noted: with a 100% DR shield, but these are actually quite common) the gameplay difficult degenerates significantly.  Finally, I don&apos;t care what people say, this game cheats, just like any other.  Things like getting hit through walls, thrusting straight forward when you&apos;re locked onto a flying enemy ABOVE YOU (I will never go back to Blightown... stupid annoying bugs that refuse to get hit), and horrible camera placement at inopportune moments kill you just as much as poor gaming on your part.  So why am I giving this an 8.5?  It&apos;s a blast to kill things, the leveling mechanic is solid, the multiplayer/community is flat out brilliant, and the loot/weapon/armor/smithing is decent.  It&apos;s not that this is a bad game.  But it&apos;s lacking the technical difficulty of other hardcore games and the atmosphere and story(telling) of &quot;easier&quot; games.  In the end, it&apos;s just a game, and one that I am more than happy to waste my time on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2651384">Expand</a></span>

This game kinda disproves that hypothesis, the difficulty curve at the beginning of the game is ridiculously high and does a terrible job at easing the player into the game. It puts you straight into the action with multiple enemies just 5-10m into the game. Such a shame because the initial cut-scene showed real promise and the game seemed to have a thought out world judging purely from my first impressions.
<br>
<br>To top it of, the game is a shoddy Xbox 360 port. It&apos;s such a bad port in fact that it&apos;s almost impossible to play without an Xbox controller. An interesting premise for a game, poor execution. I wish I could play it further, but the difficulty curve is just too extreme for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=5229688">Expand</a></span>

<br>Been gaming since chrono trigger on the Snes.  In terms of best single player game,  this ties with chrono trigger.  In terms of best gameplay in a single player game, this is it.  The game is hard, and you learn by dying.  And it&apos;s awesome.  You have to pay attention to every fight, or you can die to the smallest creature.  The combat is challenging.  For the first time, I feel like I&apos;m actually exploring.  There is no map, so you have to pay attention to your surroundings.
<br>
<br>This is the first single player game I&apos;ve send more then twenty hours playing in years.  Others may be pretty, but theyare boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3100134">Expand</a></span>

The actual on-screen play area is locked to a tiny area in the upper-left corner of my screen.  Low FPS.  Graphical stuttering.

<br>The Dark Souls series are the worst-designed games ever made and have no redeeming factor. They are also the most overrated, because for reasons I can&apos;t understand, the rest of the internet adores them and actually praises their flaws as if they were virtues. &quot;Hard but fair&quot; they say? Dark Souls isn&apos;t hard, it&apos;s time-consuming and obtuse; once you waste 5 hours grinding your stats and find the &quot;cheat&quot; weapons with a walkthrough, most encounters become so easy they&apos;re boring; and it isn&apos;t fair, the game randomly punishes you (SEVERELY) often and without warning, and is totally unplayable without a step-by-step walkthrough. If someone patched the game to remove the upgrade system, properly balance the enemy encounters, and put a navigation arrow telling you where to go, a 50-hour-plus slog would turn into a 3-hour game that would bore you after the first hour.
<br>
<br>[PRESENTATION = 7]
<br>(Visuals = 7) Graphics aren&apos;t bad, but everything more or less looks alike (brick castle with vegetation); the only reason you recognize places is that the game halts your progress so much you become familiar with the most generic of locations.
<br>(Sound = 7)
<br>(Voice Acting = 5)
<br>(Vibration = 5)
<br>(Physics = 8) Enemies ragdoll when they die and the physics of broken crates/barrels is actually pretty cool, although physics never affect gameplay.
<br>(Plot = 5) The story isn&apos;t great but is unintrusive.
<br>
<br>[CONTROL = 2]
<br>(100% 3D hack-and-slash = 2) DS is a shallow hack-and-slash. Damage can penetrate blocking shields and is affected by distance and whether you press the light/fast attack or heavy attack button, with every move drawing from a limited but regenerating stamina pool. But there are only three moves:
<br>a) while locked-on, deflect an incoming attack to instant-kill; this reduces the game to a quicktime event without a button prompt
<br>b) while locked-on, hold the shield button to block a strike until the enemy staggers, then counter-attack
<br>c) do a dodge-roll to avoid a strike, then counter-attack. This is the most risky strategy, it mostly only works on bosses (whereas a and b only work on standard soldiers)
<br>All of these put you at risk when you face more than one enemy at a time, because you can only focus on one.
<br>The game also lies to you about there being other options. Supposedly it&apos;s possible to wield one heavy sword with both hands, or one weapon in each hand, but since you need the shield to block if you want to survive multiple encounters, these are impossible.
<br>There are also some purchasable projectiles, and the occasional rare item that grants you a significant advantage (like doubling your health or the weapon&apos;s damage, etc.) but you&apos;ll never use them because you die so regularly that any one-use item would be a waste.
<br>(Camera = 6)
<br>(Physics = 4)
<br>(Friendly AI = none)
<br>(Enemy AI = 3)
<br>
<br>[DESIGN = 0]
<br>(Menus = 4)
<br>(Upgrade System = 0) Non-automatic upgrade systems are a cancer on videogames, because they always result in boring grinding early on and then being boring-ly overpowered later. Of course DS embraces both flaws to both extremes. But worse, you drop all non-spent experience points where you die and they vanish if you don&apos;t collect them on the next life, so it&apos;s easily possible to waste 2 hours of your time for nothing.
<br>(Level Design = 0) Every checkpoint has like 5 paths branching from it, 2 of them hidden, only 1 of them feasible in order to advance the game, and of course there are no hints as to which path that is. It is unplayable without a walkthrough. This is a problem videogames solved around the GTA3/Crazy Taxi era: navigation arrows.
<br>(Difficulty Curve = 0) Personally, I don&apos;t like &quot;exploration&quot; games, but for those who do, one of the prerequisites is that exploration not be painful. In DS, the constant risk of losing all your experience holds you back from trying new paths or risky jumps. At one point I fell into a pit and got hit by gas that took half my health (aka &quot;cursed&quot;). PERMANENTLY. Unless you trekked across the entire map and bought one of a LIMITED number of cures. And since enemies respawn, it is totally possible to lose half your health forever.
<br>The game is so punishing that you stop feeling guilty about winning through exploits that aren&apos;t fun: spamming projectiles from outside enemy reach, tricking the enemy AI into walking off cliffs, etc.
<br>(Modes = Singleplayer campaign w/occasional online Players allowed in to fight you, 50 hours, 95% padded) Had difficulty been properly calibrated, you could get through the whole game in 3 hours if you could stand how simplistically boring the combat is.
<br>
<br>[CONCLUSION]
<br>This isn&apos;t &quot;hard&quot;, it&apos;s bad design. I&apos;ve played bad games before, but never one made intentionally so bad to purposefully frustrate its audience. Super Meat Boy is hard. ANYONE can beat Dark Souls with a walkthrough guide and the willingness to be bored and frustrated for 50 hours straight. I only wasted as much time as I did to see what the fuss was about, and I regret even that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6337836">Expand</a></span>

The framerate is cappedat 30 (often dips below that, despite largely exceeding specs). Also the camera angles are annoying, you keep dying from stuff you could not see coming (Oh, cool, a giant boulder. I&apos;ll remember that the next 75 times I come here). The information messages during loading screens aren&apos;t readable because the loading aren&apos;t long enough. The voice acting is cringingly poor (the grunting when you take damage sounds like German p*rn) and generally speaking, there isn&apos;t much of a story to this game, at least not from the outset. I regret my &#xA3;5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3277444">Expand</a></span>

I spent about 10 minutes trying to figure the keys, cause the  game use xbox layout (the **** menu is on the END key).  You die not because you suck, but because the camera keeps you changing your target between enemies. People are rating this with 10 because they are console players or because they played the game before at console and like it, Come on guys you know that this port does not deserve 10, the developers dont even botther to try make this playable with mouse and keyboard. This game should get a 5 score, but with so many people rating with 10 and defending a bad port game for no reason i will rate this with 0 to balance the score. My advice: Pirate this game from torrent sites and try it for yourself, then if you think developers should get your money for doing nothing with a pc port, feel free</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2899917">Expand</a></span>

Instead, the player needs to be observant, investigate by talking to npcs, and look at item descriptions to uncover the many gems about the Dark Souls world. I have played this game on PS3, Xbox 360, and PC. I will say the PC version is the best if you go through the 5 minutes of work to polish this game by installing dsfix. Make sure you read the readme before installing the mod! The only flaw this game has is the networking. It can be very difficult to connect to your friends worlds, but once you connect to them once, it is a lot easier to connect again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3062098">Expand</a></span>

This by far the worst pc port of a game i have ever encountered, i had heard about it but to experience the sloppy, inconsistent and at some point just plain idiotic transfer of this game is indescribable. the greatest insult came from the message that said an xbox controller (30$ new by the way) was &quot;strongly recommended&quot;. this is a lie. it is flat out required that you have a controller to enjoy this game. The basic control scheme looks as if a child designed it, and not only this but the game is incompatible with any of my other 3 controllers. and i am not willing to pay extra to play a game i already bought. The wors of it was the camera controls, you have the choice of using the j i k and l keys which interferes with combat to no end. or using the mouse which even on my computers lowest setting is more sensitive than a fresh chemical burn. i will not bore you with the graphical issues you have most likely already heard of as these were patched with a mod very quickly (although the fact that a single modder was able to accomplish this in a few hours and the entirety of the from software staff was unable to raises some questions) but this game is just plain insulting to pc players and is essentially a way of the company saying that we don&apos;t matter. I do not claim to know what they were thinking but i can say that they have lost me as a customer. i was lucky enough to purchase this game during a steam sale so i did not loose much money, but i can honestly say this game was not worth the 7 dollars i payed. It would have been better spend wadding up into a ball and throwing it at the back of the CEOs head.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3277019">Expand</a></span>

Now for the game itself, the gameplay mechanics are wonderful and the game is deep and challenging, people give it a bad rep because they have no patience and are used to the linear hack and slash two hit kills gameplay they get from other sword and shield games (the type that take about 2 hours to complete), the story is incredibly deep and is purposely shrouded in mystery in order for the player to discover it and see the depth and journey for himself instead of handing it out on a silver platter. It&apos;s a masterpiece of a game, unrivaled by any other RPG to date.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3566580">Expand</a></span>

I made it about 2 hours in, but I had to force myself to do that much, hoping to give it a chance to get better. It didn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>I honestly don&apos;t know why there are so many gushing reviews of this game. Apparently the standards for a console game are a lot lower. If this game had been released exclusively to PC, it would be relegated to obscurity in the shadow of games like Skyrim, which is superior in every way other than being so hard that you die 5 times before getting out of the tutorial. (Which could be a plus or a minus depending on who&apos;s asking I suppose.) I tried really hard to like this game, but the graphics (even after the 3rd party mod to unlock the resolution) are lack-luster, the environments are dull and uninspired, the enemies that I encountered are generic. The story is non-existant, and the protagonist has no personality what-so ever to make me want to care about him/her, neither do any of the scarce NPCs I met. The combat was bland and the character movements and animations clumsy.
<br>
<br>This game just feels through and through like something that was lazily thrown together to make some fast cash. Here are some real hallmarks of the laziness of this game. 1. NPC voice overs but static faces. I can&apos;t remember the last time I saw a game that did that. If you&apos;re not going to at least make their mouths move, don&apos;t bother giving voice overs. 2. Every single monster I killed ended up with a ragdoll corpse getting stuck in between my feet and kicked along as I  walked. Really? 3. I routinely lined up a power attack on an enemy only to have my character leap diagonally 3 feet to the right of where I was aiming, leaving me vulnerable during the 5 second recovery time. Apparently you HAVE to use target lock if you want your attacks to hit. 4. See any of the reviews that harp on about the pure laziness of the terrible PC port.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s no joy in this game, just a dull grind through generic monsters with no real goal or story in evidence. The only positive thing to say about it is that it&apos;s &quot;really really challenging&quot;. But I for one don&apos;t find that appealing in a game when it&apos;s to no end except to make you grind from the last save back through the same dull environments and bland fights again and again.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t buy this game. Go re-play Skyrim instead, you&apos;ll have way more fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-prepare-to-die-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3599699">Expand</a></span>
