<br>
<br>I really like their use of CG, speech, exploration, and diary pages etc. to reveal the story, which integrate smoothly with the game play. The art style is great and really help to develop a creepy and strange atmosphere.
<br>
<br>A hint to a reviewer complaining monster AI: you need to understand the story and hints provided to you during your game play, logic won&apos;t work in a haunted and strange environment.
<br>
<br>I give this a 10 because this gives me a new experience of horror game, which doesn&apos;t rely on jump-scary or monsters with terrible look.
<br>
<br>If there are developers watching here, here are my words to you. You guys just rock, please consider bringing more new ideas towards horror game. Many gamers are already bored with the old-fashioned style of horror game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/knock-knock/user-reviews?user_review_id=3635545">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s that uncertainty of not knowing the game rules that creates the unnerving play through of this game. One of the lights went off and your clock re winded a few hours? Maybe the light is keeping you from seeing mobile guests. Do you keep getting swarmed by monsters? Maybe that&apos;s because there is a breach open somewhere.
<br>-
<br>This game isn&apos;t about it telling you that it&apos;s a game. It&apos;s about you finding why it&apos;s a game. If you enjoy games that deviate from mainstream games, then you would be doing yourself a favor by picking this up. Just remember: Apply logic and the game&apos;s rules will be known to you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/knock-knock/user-reviews?user_review_id=3651240">Expand</a></span>

<br>Ice-Pick Lodge delivers precisely what they promised and I was personally very scared by the way the game delivers it&apos;s creepy story. It&apos;s not a big game nor a very complicated one, but it slowly creeps up on you and makes you fear the dark corners of your own home.
<br>
<br>Maybe, just maybe, you aren&apos;t alone right now  when was the last time you looked behind you...
<br>
<br>Play it in the dark and play it alone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/knock-knock/user-reviews?user_review_id=3632503">Expand</a></span>

The game is full of hidden meanings, subtleties and overall pure mindf**kery. The game mechanics, if you can call them that, are subliminally messaged to you.  So after a while you know how to play the game, without knowing how to play the game. Strange isn&apos;t it? The game has an achievement making a reference to Twin Peaks which in it self is awesome. The game is ridiculously atmospheric and creepy. The main character who&apos;s name is unknown, is a housekeeper of sorts. Or you could call him a caretaker, of the sorts. Being a caretaker he has to stay up ALL night. This is not good for the human mind. The Caretaker (that&apos;s his name now.) starts seeing things, things that aren&apos;t actually there. But that&apos;s the catch, they, are not, there. They are fake. If you see one, it disappears. It never existed. Or did it? Maybe so, maybe not. The game is entirely based around perception. How do you see the game? Instead of me telling you what it is, you have to &quot;experience&quot; it for yourself. Make up your own idea of what the hell is going on here. They  night visions are coming. Prepare yourself, stay awake until dawn. Stay sane. And whatever you do. DO NOT APPROACH THE GIRL IN THE CORNER!!! I REPEAT, DO, NOT, APPROACH, HER. Knock Knock.

<br>
<br>Knock  knock is a (supposed) horror game. The protagonist, an hermit (for lack of a better definition), spend his sleepless nights guarding his house, which dark corners are a menace to his sanity. A great incipit, right? Except, not really.
<br>
<br>The story doesn&apos;t make any sense. Most of the plot it&apos;s too scattered or too vague to scare,  with reference to mysterious games or rituals, mysterious  guests, mysterious  visions, mysterious (again,  pages of a mysterious diary of a mysterious protagonist in a mysterious place. Is it mysterious enough? Maybe too much!
<br>
<br>There isn&apos;t an explanation for anything, making the player take wild guesses on what is happening. Is the lodger crazy? Is the house hunted? Is that monster real? Is the world real? Is it a nightmare? Unfortunately, nothing will be explained. Well, almost nothing: other things will have two or three possible explanations (you know, &apos;cause why the hell not!). Why? Because mysterious!
<br>
<br>Who cares, the gameplay is awesome, right? ...right?
<br>
<br>The gameplay is just shallow. You spend time in an house waiting for the dawn to arrive, trying to avoid monsters and other nightmare-ish  stuff. Problem is, the monster A.I. is non-existent. It feels so random to be caught by a monster that it doesn&apos;t even make a difference to hide. Some time you will lose without even knowing what got you, and how. This is extremely frustrating.
<br>
<br>There may or may not be a sanity meter (explanations? Nah. Who needs them.) which declares game over if empty. And it doesn&apos;t fill up. Just not. And it isn&apos;t even present in the beginning of the game. It just pops up. Because, why not, right?
<br>
<br>Graphic wise, the game looks really god, with 2D background mixed with 3D walls and space, which is a real pleasure for the eye. And it&apos;s the only reason you may play.
<br>
<br>In the end, you may like this game for how mysterious it is, OR hate it, for how mysterious (and shallow, and random, and non-sensical) it is. Your choice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/knock-knock/user-reviews?user_review_id=3634395">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;ll do that few times and the game ends. No tactics, no puzzle, no action and absolutely no pay off; just some nice graphics and that&apos;s it. If you like brainless games and waste your time switching on lights that&apos;s the game for you.</span>

You have to start really quick and scared before enemies come to not lose suddenly, you have time but then the enemies you encounter are rather random, but that is one of many attractives on the game. It is a conceptual game and also it has unique mechanics, for me this was one of the greatest experiences ever in videogames. I just have fun, a lot of fun, I really love art and this was a very nice special game, also I have to play it all over again because I could say I didn&apos;t win, because this game has something I was missing, the clock-head.

<br>First of all, this game is for the patient.
<br>- For the first 1 or 2 hours you won&apos;t even know what is going on, how the mechanics work, what triggers what. After a while you will figure it out, but only after a long time (or if you read a guide) will it be crystal clear what to do exactly.
<br>- There won&apos;t be real action. You go around, searching, fixing lights. Maybe there will be close situations, but usually after you understood the mechanics.
<br>
<br>Second: It&apos;s for people with imagination.
<br>- Secrets, hidden things, notes are all around the game, but the story will never reveal itself completely. What is reality, what is imaginary, when the character dreams, you have to figure out a theory for yourself.
<br>- The game is full of fridge horror. Reading the diary pages really gives a plus, and you have to think about it to get you. Jump-scares won&apos;t really happen, (except when you run into a guest) the horror comes from the atmosphere and the suspense. Your own mind will scare you, but for that, you have to get into the game.
<br>
<br>So to summarize: this game won&apos;t give himself on a plate, you have to get into it, get into the mood and work for it to really appreciate it, and that is not for everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/knock-knock/user-reviews?user_review_id=6942296">Expand</a></span>
