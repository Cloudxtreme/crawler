I hate that there is no physics, except for what there is when driving, you can&apos;t destroy any environment what so ever. Also Rage&apos;s story doesn&apos;t inspire me to continue playing. Sounds suck. Blah</span>

Textures still pop-in from time to time, unexplained graphical glitches are commonplace and the occasional crash-to-desktop from a loading screen still occur. Enough about that though, most of the negative reviews cover that well enough. The game itself is... decent. The actual shooting portion is engaging, though super easy - you are functionally immortal due to regenerating health AND on-demand medikits. Really?? Add in a cover system and you&apos;ve got the trifecta. The enemies are pretty cool, and levels are a blast to play through.... the first time. Rage commits a cardinal sin in a game by padding content with maps you play though normally, then return and play through them again either reversed or with sections blocked off. It was unacceptable in Dragon Age 2, and it&apos;s unacceptable here. The racing/driving portions are fun enough but controls are odd if you don&apos;t play with a gamepad. All in all Rage could have been a much better game without the design shortcuts and if it had actual bug testing before launch.  As it stands the game doesn&apos;t have enough content (roughly 15 hours if you do all sidequests and run every race) to warrant dropping $60. If you absolutely must play it, wait until the price drops to $20-$30 probably next month.  I&apos;m uninstalling as I write this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1775217">Expand</a></span>

I would be embarassed to put my name to this paper thin plot, and i&apos;m sure other real gamers will agree with me.I wish they had just left out the &quot;story&quot; completely.2)half the time textures are too muddy. 3)There is absolutely no physics effects and no destructable enviroments at all.e.g.A  vase on a table is stuck to the table like a cast iron statue, and that is unacceptable. If this is the consequence of this new engine then its not worth it just to have pretty looking textures for some of the game. 4)I have the worst screen tearing i have ever seen in my life (i have a very decent nvidia based rig and have not been able to get rid of it even with all the suggested fixes and patch). On the plus side i havent had any crashes or the texture pop-in others are having and it stays a nice 60 fps.Also the character models are nice, the textures at a distance can look look fantastic, the combat is fairly satisfying, and the driving is kinda Mario Kartish.The post release update (that also includes the missing graphics options) has made stuff worse for me and taken some of the crispiness out of the good looking textures.With all the technical issues its had at release, its really not what we should be accepting from a modern AAA title. Looking at the game as a  whole package, its really below average in most respects apart from graphics, and not worth paying full price for, definately reccomend waiting for price drop.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1777508">Expand</a></span>

I will leave the graphics and texture issues to the other users. My biggest issue is the game play and story line....very very weak. Like &quot;Urrid&quot; (another reader) I actually registered an account here to properly rate this child game. I got caught up in the marketing and the fact I just haven&apos;t played a good game all year. Maybe Dues Ex, but that had it&apos;s shortcoming, which drove me to look for the next game to fulfill my internal itch..or ID...ir whatever.. Ok, my psychological issues aside, here is my problems with the game. 1. Story line - What is the point of me being there. I&apos;ve played for a few hours and I am just running missions with no real character need. 2. The open world is really a closed world. Visually it looks OK, but there are only a few paths to take. 3. Missions are super easy (on Difficult) and are to focused on the path the game wants to take me. I can&apos;t diverge it some other sector of the game if I wish to. Sure there are side missions, but they are completed quickly. Talking to the other characters in the game is boring and in today&apos;s market, games should provide a path to take the conversations. This is a one to one and start a mission. 4. The bosses look pretty cool but are easy and somewhat stationary.    5. Character enhancements and weapons. Just plain weak. In all this game should not be rated M. It is kids 8-14. And that is an insult for anyone over 8 years old. This game is simple in game play, story line and graphics. I will keep playing until someone recommends an alternative or until MW3 or ME3 comes out....The developers did get my money though.  *sigh* what a disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1781723">Expand</a></span>

All i received with Rage is an even more buggy game even if i experienced ctd and corrupted save games with these other titles.<br>I won&apos;t be hasty next time i see bethesda softworks as the publisher.<br>And if someone is still wondering if he should buy this, even with all these bad reviews, i would STRONGLY suggest to get a console version and wait for a BIG SALE. This game is not even close to a 60 bucks value. Maybe a 10$ that is all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1782380">Expand</a></span>

The MEGA TEXTURE was reduced to comply with the poor performance of consoles. Unfortunately that reduced quality texture work made it to the PC. The game as in gameplay is a rather generic FPS with some pretty charismatic enemies. Unfortunately those enemies are in a corridor esq environment all of the time. Though it looks like open world, it is in all reality a DOOM with a sun roof. If you are in the market for this game stay away until they Patch it, Enhance it, and update the graphics settings to comply with todays pcs. Carmack was interviewed recently and expressed his regret in making the game simultaneously for the pc and consoles, due to the fact that pc kept multiplying in power over the 6 years they took to make the game, the game suffered from having to choose between the horse power of the pc or the 50 million sold xbox and PS3s, they chose the latter and it shows. . Unfortunately, until the issues of the horrid textures (at it&apos;s best Prey at it&apos;s worst comparable to shenmue), the graphical anomalies, the no settings attributes and perhaps even the less then enthralling environments on which the game has you duke it out with its foes. It remains a game locked in the past with DOOM 3 hiding under a ruble of it&apos;s own ambition, an ambition marred by 6 year old tech</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1775461">Expand</a></span>

There seems to be a good game somewhere in here, but I may never know as I have had problem after problem with crashing (game crashes every single time I try to finish the mutant tv section of the game), flickering enemies (using the recommended up to date drivers), that has forum users offering up voodoo fixes that just don&apos;t seem to help.  I told myself that I would never again pre purchase a game after Brink, and I let the hype sway me.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.

The Bad

I actually got scared even though there was nothing to be scared of just from the music alone. Art direction is almost original. Gameplay is excellent. That shotgun is amazing! Enemies are varied. Great care put into animation noted.<br><br>The Bad<br><br>25Gb install size and all I get are blurry textures. Spin around too fast and the LOD is a split second behind. You will actually see ultra blurry textures. It&apos;s only for a split second but it is detracting from the realism of the game.<br><br>The Ugly<br><br>Don&apos;t be fooled by the &quot;auto detect your hardware to maintain 60fps.&quot; That&apos;s just market speak for &quot;Console Port.&quot; The menus are clunky, mouse is erratic when turning down sensitivity to low (essential for the 5600 DPI gamers out there), and no graphic settings. On a 570 the textures are on par with Crysis on Medium. I know it&apos;s 60 fps but who wants to play that when I could boot up Time crysis. Now there is an epic scale to the game, the vistas are downright gorgeous from afar, but it only gives the illusion of scale. The fact is, the game is linear through and through. And when it isn&apos;t, it&apos;s because it&apos;s sending you to backtrack for fetch quests.<br><br>This game is prolly awesome for the ageing consoles. But the PS2-like textures on a high end graphics card is a deal breaker. If they the gamers are allowed to see those high res textures, this game could have been better, but as is, it just appears to be a waste of 25 gigs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1775540">Expand</a></span>

Also the textures are a joke you have on decent (not good) texture right next to one that is a complete blur. No graphics settings. You have to force Vsync externally. What a joke.<br><br>Oh also: Bugs, Bugs, Bugs... Oh and some more bugs.</span>

I am running the game on an Alienware Aurora system and my machine is humming and aching like an old windmill. I truely never had any game, not even close, running that bad on my system. Come on id you are slapping this right into the face of PC customers, there are not even proper video options in the game, what a joke!!  Once again, PC gamers get cheated by the console hype and blindness. The sad story continues.

Good gunplay, and the graphics CAN look stunning (I love the clutter of everything).<br><br>The tech on PC - ATROCIOUS! Seriously, I am stunned by the state of the game on PC. it&apos;s a port, yes, but no excuse. (look at Batman AA...awesome) Brutal texture pop in, muddy low res textures (somewhere between N64 and PS2) and if it wasn&apos;t for fellow considerate gamers, a whole host of other problems (bizarre seams everywhere, distracting tearing, stutter constantly etc) I did not have problems with crashes, although of you are an ATI user, prepare for this. Do not pay more than 30 bucks for this game...better still, play Witcher 2, Stalker COP, Hard Reset, Amnesia...even Doom 3, as it&apos;s lighting effects DESTROY Rage&apos;s.<br><br>We no longer can count on iD, and really, that&apos;s ok, because WHAT&apos;S UP VALVE AND GABEN! You guys can take my money for free, whereas iD, when can I expect my payment for testing this game for you?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1776181">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The graphics are fine, they are not jaw dropping and are plagued with issues on a vast array of systems. When it works, it looks like a FPS released in 2011 should be expected to look. It&apos;s the horrible game, itself, that is the problem. There has been blurring of RPG and FPS for years, with massive success -- because, as it turns out, people actually like character development. You usually get a skill tree or two (ala Borderlands), stats and abilities you can delve deep or lightly into for character specificity (ala Fallout: NV), a more engrossing storyline (ala COD).. hell, even Space Marine, by all rights a terrible first person shooter (but enjoyable multi-player -- where it actually remembers to offer character customization) makes a better effort.
<br>
<br>Rage, in a nutshell, is a corridor shooter with quests. Boring, boring, quests. The quests themselves don&apos;t even yield a faux version of customization or development.. so you do them, for the sake of doing them. A FPS where you have to check in with NPCs before and after you do things.. just... because.
<br>
<br>The single player campaign is probably 16 hours, at best. Coming in light. But hey, they do you the courtesy of pre-installing DLC folders already.. Both Bethesda and Id can do much, much better. Wait for this game to go half-off bin at your seller before picking it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1779786">Expand</a></span>

Technical difficulties abound.
<br>Gameplay. From playing for a few hours, the AI mobs are great; combat rolls, wall bounding, general dodging to avoid my aiming. The quest line at the beginning was confusing; some guy rescues you and asks you to rescue the town? Why did you put your neck out in the first place? Perhaps that will be revealed later. No world or region map; just a small minimap in the upper corner. Voice acting is pretty good. Quests have been the typical go here, do this, come back for a reward and the advancement of the story. The game is very beautiful, just had to say that again (the only great thing going for it).
<br>Many people are saying it is a console port; I can believe it because the menu, graphical interface options are all very limited when compared to other computer games. I would suggest all PC buyers wait until a price drop to buy the game, console buyers would probably be fine with purchasing the game as it currently is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1775504">Expand</a></span>

If you want that, buy this game.<br><br>Save your eyes.  Save your money.<br><br>When textures aren&apos;t popping in turning you into an epileptic, the game looks great.  Seems like it would be a fun game.  Probably a bit short, though I&apos;ve barely played.  Supposedly the competitive multiplayer car races have been likened to Mario Kart. I wouldn&apos;t know.  My eyes are strained to the max after playing the first mission.  Half hour later they still hurt.  It&apos;s not just flickering, there&apos;s all sorts of weird artifacts.  From seems like a page of text is blinking on screen, to like a red laser sight appearing out of nowhere, yet has nothing to do with my gun or anyone else&apos;s.  Weird black blocks of all sorts of sizes, and not limited to box shape popping in or out.<br><br>It&apos;s supposed to be low capped for it&apos;s frames at 60 and work around that.  Well my i7 920, 6gb 1600mhz ddr3, and ATI 5850 gets about 25-35 while running around, and when still it goes back up to about 60.  This is without the eye candy on (what little you can mess around with).<br><br>Even has a problem when you move around the edges load up late, even close up stuff.  Also this makes me pretty lucky, since many people can&apos;t even get the game to load up, or have it crash after playing 10 minutes.<br><br>Lots of rage going on with people with uber rigs getting poor framerates as well.<br><br>It&apos;s having problems on ATI and Nvidia.  I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve only described some of the problems.  Will they patch it? Supposedly yes.  Will it fix the problems? Who the hell knows.  60 bucks for a pc game, and not one whiff of this obvious MAJOR problem from review sites right before launch = fraud.<br><br>This turd, just like so many others this year, (here&apos;s looking to you Duke Puke&apos;em) had glaringly obvious problems ignored by the reviewers observing fascist unamerican blackouts on reviews until after the game released.  I didn&apos;t preorder months or even weeks in advance, merely 30 minutes - 3 hours before launch, and in both cases, the early &apos;paid&apos; or &apos;special&apos; reviews ignored all the obvious problems, if they even came out at all (i.e. pc ones delayed so you had to read the console ones first).  When they showed us their gameplay video, of course none of these issues were in them.<br><br>It&apos;s just sad that no one spoke up about these turds like RAGE before they were released.  This is something that should of came out weeks ago, saving lots of people money.<br><br>I waited until the last second to see some reviews or whatever to trip up.  But when you don&apos;t see these things in them, you think, hey it&apos;ll be a game that works or whatever.  I also hear some console players are getting some weird stuff too.  But hey gotta pay off those wall street loans, and the only way the board sees it possible is to get the turd out before the other games launch, rather than actually fix the game before launch.  Also probably would hurt bonuses.<br><br>Wait for a working patch.  If one doesn&apos;t arrive, do not buy this game.  If one does, it would be a decent game, and worthy of a 3/5 or perhaps a 7/10.  That&apos;s still a decent, and fun game.  But for now, my eyes still hurt, and I won&apos;t be playing this much until it gets fixed. Shame on iD.  As it stands now, turn the game on, turn on some music, mix a drink, and enjoy the strobe light club experience in your own home.  This broken eye straining turd gets a 3 out of 10.  I would give it a 4, but physical pain knocks it down another point.   If the gunplay and the graphical art design wasn&apos;t fun, it would score a lot lower.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1775251">Expand</a></span>

I cannot stress to you how many tweaks and changes I&apos;ve had to make to get it to run, This is not my job.  They have wasted MY time and MY money, if you own a pc don&apos;t let them waste yours.</span>

Not to mention the corruption/artifacts when using an AMD solution for graphics.  WORST QUALITY CONTROL EVER.  No advanced graphics options.  No default support for 5.1 or greater sound.  Bugged texture quality &apos;virtual texture&apos; system, 8k resolution if you force it but if left to default it looks BAD (even on latest hardware).  No option in options to turn off mouse smoothing...  There are so many more issues with this game, go read up on them before buying. This game should not have been released - get it working on a basic level before you sell it!  But don&apos;t trust my opine, read it from *most* online journals or professional blogs (like destructoid)...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1777908">Expand</a></span>

However, I have to say that of all the ID titles I&apos;ve purchased over the years, this is the first that is really disappointing. I&apos;m not someone who is overly focused on graphics, but as soon as I saw the opening scene of the game within the arc, I knew that this game had been cannibalized for consoles. Textures were noticeably poor up close on virtually every surface that I looked at, and not just a little washed out / flat, but reminiscent of games like half life 1. In my opinion, every indoor/ close quarter environment is an order of magnitude worse than Doom 3 in terms of quality. While I have no doubt the engine can do much more, the fact that they cut it down so much just to make it look decent on the garbage console hardware is upsetting.<br><br>Now, this would be OK from an indie developer, or even a low budget game, but as the newest flagship title from a company that has consistently produced many of the best looking graphics engines over the last decade and one which has been hyped as having incredible graphics, it leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. The marketing was deceptive and the virtually nothing that I have seen so far comes remotely close to spin put out beforehand. As ID has apparently switched their focus from quality and is going the way of Bioware, I have to say that they will not get money from me again until the player reviews are in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1776229">Expand</a></span>

Dare I say that the console release is the preferred release? Terrible texture resolutions (not counting the pop-in) and lots of invisible walls or low edges or curbs, couches, or railings which will keep you from freely exploring the world. I do not find the game world fun or explorable due to this, and the sound seems completely dull and uninspired. It does not seem to use my Realtek 5.1 surround. Poor or nonexistent shadowing. It&apos;s a very poor attempt at a Borderlands-type game. Nothing during the game play has made me say &apos;Wow&apos; and I do not feel there&apos;s anything new or exciting offered. This is a budget console title at best, and frankly anyone who&apos;s not played Borderlands should make that purchase instead. Also, some keyboard mappings cannot be altered, which is a terrible sin in my book.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1776948">Expand</a></span>

Many people are having problems with the game crashing during load screens, which may or may not be video driver related.  There are even faults with the games installation process, as it does not create a required cache directory during install which helps with some of the problems.  Gameplay is good, but it&apos;s nothing groundbreaking as ID claimed.  Fairly linear, while you can drive around the world on narrow tracks, there&apos;s not much out there if it&apos;s not a defined quest area.  Overall, it&apos;s a fairly average game that you&apos;re probably better off waiting for it to go on sale, rather than buying new.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1778083">Expand</a></span>

This is sad, I was expecting a great gaming experience but instead I ended up spending my hours on the Bethesda and STEAM forums looking for fixes from other users. Nothing worked so far and the new ATI Rage driver is a joke. What&apos;s worst is that it seems that the blurry, muddy, low resolution textures are part of the design and this is just horrible for a 2011 game. I&apos;m just very disappointed so I&apos;ll go back to the Witcher 2 and to high resolution environments. But not before I&apos;ll submit my score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1776450">Expand</a></span>

Carmack will engage in self-love and and spend all his time making it run at 60fps on the 360 but he is such a weak leader that he cant hire a team of people to make an engaging game.

The graphics options are horrible. In spite of the graphics the game is not interesting either, its boring. This is by far the worst game ID. I pre ordered this game based on ID and Carmack, and this was a complete disaster. I want my money back.</span>

<br>RAGE is just horrible. Maybe 5 years ago it would have ebeen something now its just a clone of Fallout3/Borderlands minus all the good parts but saddled with a broken concept of texture streaming via megatextures regardless of how good your PC is.

<br>
<br>All you have to say is Borderlands with better graphics however missing every aspect of borderlands that made it a good game.
<br>
<br>I would say nice try FAIl, but really its just a screaming FAILURE all road.</span>

After tweeking with the settings by creating a config for Rage, the texture pop-in is hardly a concern at this point.  My game does crash at many points in the game, but even with this issue, the game play for me is pure glee.  I have a hard time thinking of the last time I have played a FPS that felt like an FPS... Emphasis on shooter, because like any id game, this game puts the shoot in shooter... I squeal with utmost satisfaction disposing of my mutant chums...  Remove the delicious eye candy, and I still have a gun and gun shooter that feeds my old soul for what is has been craving for years now. Enjoy it for what it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1780008">Expand</a></span>

Everyone else I know who owns this game has had crashing problems, and I myself can hardly stand the game at times, since there&apos;s a strange choppiness to the game unlike anything I&apos;ve seen before. Additionally, the textures load extremely slowly, so if you turn around too fast, hell, if you turn around at all, you&apos;ll end up seeing garbage textures before the high res ones load.<br><br>Overall, as a hit-or-miss game, I&apos;d say this was a miss for John Carmack. It feels like a console port, and a poor one at that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1775017">Expand</a></span>

Check the other platforms to get a better analysis of the game. I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s perfect - it&apos;s not - but it&apos;s not lower than the average AAA title by far. The largest glaring issues are the lack of VSynch and the desparate need for a hi-res texture pack for the PC. But those aren&apos;t large issues. They&apos;re not game breaking, just disappointing. But look past that and you&apos;ll find a shooter that attempts to tie itself together with a loose plot. But who&apos;s here for the plot? I mean really, did anyone see the previews and say to themselves &quot;This looks like an awesome story!&quot; - no - they said &quot;This looks like I get to kill monsters in cool ways&quot; And truth be told - you get to kill monsters in cool ways. When it comes down to brass tacks, that&apos;s why we are all buying this game and it&apos;s got it. After turning on VSynch (through the graphic card panel) all the graphical issues went away. And the game hasn&apos;t crashed. But the fighting. Oh the fighting. I can&apos;t get enough of it. And you won&apos;t be able to either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1776476">Expand</a></span>

I look forward to doom 4. the ID only Flaw is story is a little lacking but the game length should have been much longer. also consider the fact it this is ID 1st try at building a story based game,i mean a truly in depth story with meaningful characters* not doom story*. there not bio-ware kids. i honestly hope ID learned from building this game and improve this type of game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rage/user-reviews?user_review_id=1777464">Expand</a></span>
