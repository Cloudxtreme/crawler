<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong the game starts out pretty neat and the battles are entertaining.  The filler missions though are unacceptable and compounded with the lack of late game mechanics the game&apos;s hard to recommend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/knights-of-pen-paper-+1-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3893809">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The &quot;fictional adventure&quot; is decent, but not very original or engaging unless you&apos;re a stat junkie or easily fall for nostalgia. The &quot;game night advenure&quot; is a complete static one and takes place around a table.
<br>
<br>From this point, your options to level things up are limited to your vicinity. And that&apos;s kinda boring even depressive the envision your progression as providing junk food or changing furniture. I thought the real joy of a gaming night was the emotions shared by the players.
<br>
<br>Maybe the game should have been more accurately named Gaming Buddies of Ikea and Superstores. Didn&apos;t worked for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/knights-of-pen-paper-+1-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4961353">Expand</a></span>

<br>Generally, I can live with a lack of eye-candy and with a simple battles formula, but c&apos;mon! This is a pure attempt to disguise laziness as &quot;Indie and nostalgic&quot;! Add to that the in-game invitations to use real money on &quot;gold&quot; to spend in the game, and you get pure greed.

<br>While I did enjoy playing this game, I never bothered to finish the campaign, and I doubt I ever will.

If you&apos;re just in the mood to click around for 15, 20 minutes, level up some characters, and go about your day, this game is for you.

<br>
<br>However, the inclusion of a store is puzzling considering how little affect it has. God forbid the type of player that would buy stuff in-game, I can&apos;t begin to imagine the sort that would. Regardless, the developers must have been a tad bit overzealous to include such a thing knowing that they would receive little to none income from it. This was a mistake on their part; from a marketing and design viewpoint.
<br>
<br>But enough of that, as I said already, the microtransactions within the game are pointless. As I said earlier; the problem isn&apos;t this. The real problem is the game not taking itself serious for a PC platform.
<br>
<br>This game was originally designed as a mobile app/tablet game. It suits that environment very well as a quickplay sort of game.. However, marketing for the PC is a different ballgame altogether and the dev&apos;s have utterly failed in their quest to win the hearts of PC gamers, as evident by majority of reviews.
<br>
<br>The 1+ edition has alwasy been marketed as a pen &amp; paper rpg for pen &amp; paper fans; and here lies the problem. Despite all the hype, the 1+ edition is little more than a few bells and whistles attatched onto the original game and brings no real changes to the PC nor does it in anyway entice P&amp;P players (like myself) to buy this game (reviewing this game based on a copy I played on a friends PC, and no I didn&apos;t pirate it!).
<br>
<br>The game features crammy hammy dialogue that for one, isn&apos;t remotely funny, nor is it common enough to even earn the hype that this game has been given for the suppose banter that takes place. Hardly any banter takes place between your fellow NPC players, and when it does take place its over in a second and you could hardly call it banter. This would be my main complaint about the game, the lack of any real comedy value (and not the *overly slapstick can&apos;t take myself seriously enough comedy*) or banter between any of the npcs or any meaningful quests creates an incredibly repetitive dull experience that only the most blinded faithful consumers could love.
<br>
<br>The only positive thing I can say about this game, which isn&apos;t much, is the pixel art and backgrounds. They are a joy to behold, but sadly a game doesn&apos;t win on just art alone. The game is surely lacking in a lot of area&apos;s including customisation in which there hardly is any. Want to name a NPC at your table? Well, you can&apos;t! Want to create your own? Well, you can&apos;t!
<br>
<br>Enough. If you want a dull repetitive experience; buy the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/knights-of-pen-paper-+1-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3587744">Expand</a></span>

Blacksmiths cost a minimum of 150 to upgrade equipment with an extremely high chance of failing and after you&apos;ve failed enough the game prompts you to purchase more gold. Why include micro transactions in a game that already costs $9.99? I can&apos;t recommend this to anyone.</span>

The conceit behind the game is that you are sitting at a table with your game master with a group of friends, and that you are going through a campaign. The players are indeed all seated around a table, with the game master on the far side of the table dictating what is going on. It is a very clever idea, but unfortunately the game fails to execute on it at all; instead, the game is a pure hack-and-slash fest which tries to spice things up with humor and gaming references but falls flat because, quite frankly, everyone sitting around a table has already not only made all of these references, but done it better. The plot is every bad game of D&amp;D you&apos;ve ever played, every unoriginal campaign rolled into one, and it is played straight - sure, one could argue that it is almost comically bad, but it is painfully bad, like Batman and Robin, rather than camp.
<br>
<br>As the gameplay itself is thoroughly hack and slash, purely about cutting your way through an extremely large number of monsters using extremely simplistic turn-based combat reminiscent of many JRPGs, with no real coherent or interesting story to speak of, there is little to recommend this game as anything but a time waster, and even there, you can do far better. There&apos;s nothing that this game doesn&apos;t show you in the first hour, and there&apos;s nothing in that first hour worth taking. While the basic underlying idea of having a bunch of players playing a roleplaying game is an interesting one, this game is a total failure at it. Maybe someday, someone will take this idea and do something good with it, but this is not that game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/knights-of-pen-paper-+1-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4397621">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>KoPnP is all about character-building and fantasy combat. Char-build is quite simplistic, but in a good way. The combat becomes repetitive after a while, but it&apos;s ok until it gets booring.
<br>
<br>KoPnP does not deliver an enganging story or personalities, but rather a parody on pnpRPG. It does that well enough to make me laugh.</span>

                                        <span>It&apos;s really addictive. I don&apos;t get why people complain about &quot;microtransactions&quot;. You can buy everything in the game with ingame-money. You can level up a lot with a butt-load of different characters. It has a good humour and has really good adventurous old school game-feeling to it.
<br>It&apos;s a pretty good game for your buck. Especially if you are into P&amp;P or RPGs. Check it out.</span>

<br>anyway they ask another 10 euros for a character a room item and a room are you kiddin me ? the game is so small is laughable i am sick of these games marketed as good when in fact they suck ass go bankrupt you deserve it you can&apos;t make gaming you are a joke and dont trust steam reviews,
<br>almost forgot you need about 60.000 coins to buy everything to max and you need a LIFETIME to get that much honestly in the game, the game is asking you 200 coins for traveling
<br>it is built around buying coins for actually playing the thing
<br>forget crafting you need like 10.000 for that
<br>so they got some funny 3 ~  10 euro microtransactions right in the menu **** you.
<br>I still cannot belive that you needed a team of more than one people to make this thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/knights-of-pen-paper-+1-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6533456">Expand</a></span>
