The open world nature of this game is not the same as GTA, which to me is a good thing, there aren&apos;t a million half-assed mini-games to play. Each section of the city feels different, China-town feels different than Little Italy. I&apos;m not going to list any spoilers but I do feel like this plot is decent, the voice acting is pretty good for the most part, the in-car conversations are pretty humorous a lot of the time.  The driving is a HUGE improvement over the first game, the cars feel like real cars would from the 40s that is spongey suspension and sluggish acceleration, this is not bad design, it&apos;s how the actual cars behaved back then.  The map is actually displayed in the radar instead of the lame &quot;map&quot; that&apos;s in the first game.<br><br>The guns are all fun, though the pistols pretty much all seem the same power, even the magnum (and the magnum sound a little goofy, like a cartoon gun). There is an actual cover system in the game, and overall the fights are much improved over the first game. This is a great game, it&apos;s heavy on graphics card, so I recommend looking into mods on how to disable the physics of the clothing in the game.<br><br>Overall I&apos;ve really enjoyed this game and don&apos;t understand why people are criticizing it for NOT being just a GTA clone, it&apos;s a  game I honestly find more fun than GTA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1364626">Expand</a></span>

Bullets do hurt you pretty badly. If someone shoot you in the back, you are dead. Firing a Tommy Gun was never as fun as in this game. The best thing you can do to prove this is to rob a store (in a really real way), and destroy everything in the famous 1930&apos;s machine gun.<br><br>The fighting system is... well, seriously awful. It&apos;s SO lame that even a 2 years old baby can beat the strongest enemy. You just have to cover and hit while the enemy is tired.<br><br>The driving system is quite standard. Nothing new in this, but I still like it. It adds the &quot;realism&quot; driving mode, but it&apos;s pretty lame anyway. if you liked GTA IV driving system you&apos;ll surely like this one.<br><br>The story is more than awesome. It was like a movie (a really good one). Good characters, in a really dark world where anyone is what they seem to be. Uncovered cops, dirty and sadistic bosses and even the chinese mafia.<br><br>In the other hand, characters are a solid 10. You even feel what they feel and actually suffer with them. From Joe to Henry or Luca, everyone is unique and can&apos;t be better in anyway.<br><br>Some bad points: No side missions. This is the biggest mistake imo. 2K screwed it up with this one.<br><br>The cops are pretty stupid. Their AI is more than awful.<br><br>There is no complete nudity. Come on, guys. We are mature enough to see some **** some of us even have family. This is becoming seriously lame!<br><br><br>If you like intense shootings, to torn apart everything (from concrete walls to cars), to kick the **** out of the bad ones (Because they suffer when their time comes. A lot.) or even walk calmly in the huge city, this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1461258">Expand</a></span>

Second of all I would like to mention that I never got a chance to play the first one, still haven&apos;t played it and probably will not play it (so my review is based only on Mafia II). Ok, so I will begin by commenting on the story, it is great. If it was a movie, it would have probably fared well, you know with all those gun fights and Mafia meetings and going to prison and such. It is not so much a sandbox game, it is more of a shooter game, I know because when I played, all of the difficulty of the game rests on the gunfights and covering system, and even some stealth. The &quot;sandbox&quot; aspect of the game is where you have to drive to every objective, they are long drives, and sometimes when you miss an exit, you have to circle all the way back again and drive for another 2-3minutes, you can buy clothes and guns, and that&apos;s about it, oh and take care not to speed or else the cops will be at your tail fast. Also there are plenty of fist fights, where you push the right buttons and you win. The graphics though are really novel and crisp. Even at low res, this game looks amazing and sharp and performs extremely well. This is in fact your standard third person shooter, and if your good at shooters, than this game is for you. As far as &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;sandbox&quot; go, there is not very much to it, I might compare it to Just Cause 2 without all the optional side missions. Anyway story is good, gun and fist fights are good, just needed a little bit more development in the &quot;sandbox&quot; aspect of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1568720">Expand</a></span>

Mafia 2 is an excellent game with fun missions, but it&apos;s really short and there&apos;s really nothing to do when you&apos;re done with the game. It&apos;s an incredibly good game with amazing graphics and fun missions, but the story is short and there isn&apos;t any end-play.</span>

<br>
<br>+ Mafia II is one of the best looking games that was released in the year 2010. Characters and facial impressions are especially great, but the design of Empire Bay and all the little details like cars or clothes are all authentic.
<br>+ When it comes to open world games it&#x2019;s always a breath of fresh air when the devs change the game&#x2019;s setting from a modern day metropolis to the wild west or in this case: the fifties.
<br>+ Motion cap and truthful facial expressions wouldn&#x2019;t sell the story by itself, but the voice cast is also excellent. Voice actors of the game, especially of those of Vito&#x2019;s and Joe&#x2019;s give great performances to elevate the scenes.
<br>+ While in most of the similar open world games, like GTA, the police are there just because they have to be, in Mafia II they actually do their job. When you break the speed limit, pass through a red light or crash a car in the traffic, they will pursue your car and arrest or fine you. Based of the seriousness of the felony they will intensify your pursuit. And actually they can remember you clothes or the plate number of the car you were driving.  It&#x2019;s not perfect, but at least it tries and succeeds in many ways.
<br>
<br>~ The chapter-based progress of the game isn&#x2019;t the most suited for and open world game. This type of mission structure simply discourages the player to roam in the city.
<br>~ While the voice work and animations are great, you simply can&#x2019;t connect with the characters. They act, most of the time like droids without any morals. Killing a dozen people? Sure. Betraying a friend? Why not. At the end of the game you&#x2019;ll look on Vito as he is soul-less bastard&#x2026;which he is, based on his actions.
<br>
<br>- At first sight Mafia II reveals itself as an open world game, but honestly and sadly it&#x2019;s not true at all. It has a very linear mission design that leaves no room for exploration. You always have a task to do or a place to go leaving no room for exploration. Creating a great city and not use it properly is a major overkill.
<br>- Simply put: it&#x2019;s too short. There are fifteen missions of which only a couple last longer than an hour, stretching the game time to around 9 hours total. That wouldn&#x2019;t be THAT big a deal but&#x2026;
<br>- &#x2026;there are no side activities to speak of. It&#x2019;s an abuse to this great city. When you finish the campaign, you are done with Empire Bay sadly, and there&#x2019;s nothing to come back for.
<br>- The story isn&#x2019;t the strongest either. It&#x2019;s full of clich&#xE9;s and stereotypes. At one time it seems that it&#x2019;ll try to explore different routes, but soon after goes back to the overused formula. War between families and gangs, everybody is betraying everybody else, and latter is portrayed even at the very end of the game.
<br>
<br>Time to beat: 9 hours
<br>Replay Value: 1/5
<br>In one word: Step Back

                                        <span>I loved this game.  The feeling of being immersed in the 40s and 50s is just amazing due to the truly deep attention to detail.  This is not Grand Theft Auto, nor was it intended to be.  It is a tight story driven game with fun gameplay set in an open and detailed world.  Weapons are fun and rewardingly destructive.  The real treat though is the art, which really brings the era alive.</span>

They put lots of effort into writing the story it seems and the gameplay is just as amazing... I took my time to beat it instead of rushing through it so I spent about 30 or so hours on it....So what if there is nothing to do after, thats how games were in the past...A game this amazing doesnt need a multiplayer. All multiplayer does is make all the work they put into the game pointless because of how many people dont like singleplayer..... And there is a multiplayer mod being made. This game is like playing a movie its almost entirely story based, but that doesnt take away from the thrill of the gunfights and just being able to drive the city. If you dont want to do the mission then just dont follow the marker, it will be just like a GTA free roam, with more strict cops. Which brings me to the cops. They will arrest you for almost anything....Wreckless driving, speeding, hit and run etc. and its not like on GTA where you can outrun them no problem....You have to outrun them which is usually done by tricking them to crash into a wall. They will remember you by either your car, license plate, or clothing, all of which can be changed. If they see you, you will have a few seconds to get out of there sight before they go after you. This is a must have if you like games with great stories and can overcome the fact that it has no multiplayer, which I did and that doesnt affect my opinion about it at all. My only complaint is i got a large amount of lag in small portions throughout the game so some lesser computers might not be able to run it. Mine is pretty good but i could use a better graphics card. Overall amazing game, I hope to see a Mafia 2!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1460423">Expand</a></span>

For that, I highly recommend you get yourself a copy of Mafia 2 as soon as possible. Set in the fictional city of  Empire Bay, you&apos;re Vito Scalett, an Italian war-veteran trying to make a name for himself along with his childhood friend, Joe. Together, you explore the ins and outs of the Mafia.<br><br>I personally haven&apos;t seen any of the Godfather films. I know what you&apos;re thinking, blasphemous, right? Just never got around to see them but I know it&apos;s a good trilogy so cut me a break! The closest thing I&apos;ve exposure to organized crime is Martin Scorsese&apos;s The Departed. Eh, wasn&apos;t that film about the Mob? I assume the Mafia and the Mob are totally different? Whatever the case may be, Mafia 2 has got me engaged into the story so far. Captivating even, if I may add. I just purchased a copy yesterday so I&apos;m far from completion. Roughly about 25% into the game. Expressing how much I&apos;m loving every bit of it will be an understatement. If you&apos;re familiar with the Grand Theft Auto franchise (who the hell isn&apos;t?), Mafia 2 will come to you relatively easy. The basic mechanics are present. The entire city is sandbox so you can free-roam as and where you like, food &amp; beverage/clothing stores to add a hint of role-playing elements, customize the cars you stole at the various garages in the city. Just to name a few.<br><br>If you would have me describe Empire City to you in one word, stunning comes to mind. The 1940&apos;s esque is astonishingly detailed to a point where it actually feels true-to-life. Even the fashion and the various vehicles have obviously been spared no expense. The game takes place over a span of years so you can basically see the city change. From the snowy, gloom that winter brings to a city to the lush, vibrant effects of spring. To simply put it, the atmosphere the game brings is no more than fantastic. I will always like to declare that Mafia 2 is very much optimized for the PC. It&apos;s not what some of us call a &quot;console port&quot; where graphical hiccups causes a hit in framerate or frustrating controls. The gun fights are pretty nifty too. There&apos;s a cover system in which you will use most extensively. There aren&apos;t many assortment of weapons in the game. Probably at most five? I can&apos;t remember. But trust me, that&apos;s the most a game like this will ever need.<br><br>Of course when you&apos;re doing all the nasty criminal work, you&apos;ve to be wary of the law. The police will come after you for grand theft auto, running around with a firearm and even hit-and-run. There&apos;s a wanted system where you&apos;ll need to change your clothes or vehicle to elude capture. If you do get caught, you can bribe them and they&apos;ll look the other way. Depends on what your wanted level is though. Too high and they&apos;ll shoot on sight. If it&apos;s low enough, you&apos;ll get away with a fine. Also, I&apos;m having difficulty naming another game that allows you to collect vintage Playboy magazines. I&apos;ve collected one at the moment so I&apos;m no Hugh Hefner. I guess going around the city hunting for pictures of bare-naked women can be seen as an incentive for some people.<br><br>Just not me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1549137">Expand</a></span>

The game provides an excellent story with solid graphics and  gameplay, but it doesn&apos;t provide a bang for your buck at all, in fact it feels unfinished, and for this I wouldn&apos;t recommend a full purchase.    Let&apos;s start with the good points, of which there are many of. The main draw of the game is the plot, which, while being the standard 8-10 hours, is one of the better of 2010. You play as Vito Scaletta, who came to America with his family when he was a child, and soon fell into small time crime with school buddy Joe. Until, that is, when Mafia 2 takes an unexpected twist, before you&apos;ve performed any actual gameplay. They show you being arrested and, as the year was 1943, put into the army, to fight with the army in Italy.  It&apos;s here where you have the tutorial level, in what&apos;s a surreal experience, a third-person World War 2 level. After you finish, Vito explains that he got shot a couple of years later, and comes home to Empire Bay for a month&apos;s leave, where he meets with Joe and his mother and sister. Joe throws you a solid and orders a forged doctor&apos;s note explaining you can&apos;t fight anymore, through his connections with the mafia. It&apos;s here you begin doing a few errands for the family he&apos;s with. After a few levels doing this, Mafia 2 throws unexpected twist number two: you get thrown in the big house. A federal big house, to that. And you actually play some of this time, to which I laughed and made a joke about a mission involving you trying to not drop the soap, something which almost came terrifyingly true. Anyway, you get out 6 years later, meet up with Joe again, and work from there, not giving anything away. Safe to say, the ride you do take is a great one.    As mentioned in the intro, both gameplay and graphics are stellar. The shooting controls are mainly Grand Theft Auto style, except with no auto aim, which isn&apos;t all too bad. However, sprinting is performed by L1/LT, which has no stamina limit.  For actions such as opening a door or jacking a car, there are two options; a quiet option where you either open or pick the lock (a cool new feature) and don&apos;t gain attention easily, or a fast, loud option, where you smash everything, which will gain attention. Driving is also GTA-esque, with heavy mid-century cars handling pretty well (and reach impressive 125 mph+ speeds) , although there is no option to perform a drive-by, which is sorely missed.  The graphics are very good, with faces looking realistic, but there isn&apos;t much chance to appreciate it in the open world.    There is, however, one draw back, which drags it down severely: the lack of extra things to do and re- playability. The game is a linear game, i.e. not open world like GTA, which isn&apos;t bad by any means, but limits your wondering around. Also, there isn&apos;t a &quot;free-roam&quot; option at the end of the game. This makes it quite hard to gauge when to do things in Empire Bay. There are 2 collectibles during the game; wanted posters, which you don&apos;t know when to go finding, and there is no incentive to do so. There also isn&apos;t a gameplay incentive to collect the Playboy magazines, but you will. You can also buy various clothes, which add to the feel of the game, and some of the suits are pretty sweet. To gain money to do this you can crush or sell cars, apart from completing missions. And that&apos;s about it. No multiplayer, which is fine, in fact I prefer single player-orientated games.  But there aren&apos;t any side missions either, which isn&apos;t fine. Why? Because this is an unfinished game. Two contacts appear early in the game; Mike and Derek, and they appear in Level 2. After this, their icons appear on the map, and you can go talk to them, to which they say something on the lines of &quot;Sorry kid, there&apos;s nothing for you today.&quot; There never is. Ever. Why would they put this in if there aren&apos;t any? Because they planned on having some, but then took them out, probably because they ran out of time, for a game they spent a long time working on. And on the internet, I&apos;ve watched an entire, working level, which didn&apos;t  appear in the game. Why? Because of creative purposes, I hear you say Take 2? Of course not, because you ran out of time to integrate it , or you couldn&apos;t be bothered. And that&apos;s what&apos;s annoying.    Overall, rating wise:<br>Gameplay: 8.5<br>Graphics: 8.5<br>Story: 9<br>Lasting Appeal: 5</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1484186">Expand</a></span>

Imo, 2K should abandoned the strictly linear, movie-style gameplay that worked so well for Mafia. The only way to really capture an audience is with some sort of engaging/interactive gameplay with repercussions to the story.
<br>Bottom line - for as much as 2K raved about how great the story was going to be, it really wasn&apos;t .  The suspense/excitement was minimal. I really looked forward to this game coming out ever since they announced, but unfortunately I was left feeling a bit disappointed overall. Maybe the hypothetical Mafia 3 will make amends.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1463398">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Mafia 2 is solid gangster game with excelent graphic and animation. Personally i like it more than first mafia. If you play all the DLCs, the game gets even better.</span>

Everything about the city - the music, the advertisements, the cars, and more - are all historically precise. The voice acting is incredible, the storyline is addicting, and the music combines familiar themes with a new modern twist to make this game play more like a Godfather movie than a simple third-person shooter. You will fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them. Almost every aspect of this game makes you feel like a true 50s mobster.<br>That being said, there are some downsides to it. The combat is somewhat exciting, but it could use a little work - not to mention there could be more of it, and earlier on as well. The game boasts less than 10 hours of gameplay, a good chunk of which is spent doing mundane tasks like driving to your house or to a bar on the other side of the city. The story itself, thrilling as it is, has a letdown of an ending that makes you feel that the game can&apos;t possibly be done. The DLC for the game consists mostly of clothes and cars, which aren&apos;t very useful as there is practically nothing to do in free roam mode. Of course, there are a couple of campaigns out to extend the value of the game - if you can dish another 20 bucks out.<br>All in all, it&apos;s got a great storyline, an AMAZING musical score, great characters and voiceacting, and great gameplay. On the flip side, it&apos;s short, incomplete, and there&apos;s really not much to do outside of the campaign. Any fan of the iconic 50&apos;s mafia should give this game a shot. Worth 30 bucks on Steam? I&apos;d say, unless you&apos;re starving for cash. Of course, if you&apos;re lucky like me, you&apos;ll catch it on sale for 10 bucks.<br><br>Oh and one more note: There is a glitch on one of the chapters that may cause you to become stuck and have to replay a significant chunk of the game to (possibly) fix it. Hopefully they&apos;ll patch it soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1562767">Expand</a></span>

I just want you to play it and fall in love with it. 2k Czech did a great job, and Mafia II feels like a labor of love.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2076955">Expand</a></span>

A huge negative of this game is besides the story and some of the characters, this game feels lifeless. Yes, there are many different shops and restaurants to go to (hell you can rob them if you want) but there is nothing much to do. The story is the main driving force the of the game. The game is actually a very linear, story based action adventure, that just happens to be set in an open-world.
<br>
<br>The shooting and melee combat are fine. Nothing to write home and about. They certainly do get stale after a few hours. Don&apos;t expect anything great here.
<br>
<br>But don&apos;t get me wrong, Mafia 2 has positives. The best part of this game is it&apos;s atmosphere. It totally looks and feels like you are in 1940s-1950s. The soundtrack is also top-notch with some great songs from the era (though I do not like how most of the songs were actually from the late 50s, while you are in fact in the early part of the decade for the game). If this game did anything right, it was nailing the that old vibe. Because I really felt I was there, blasting some Dean Martin while blasting some mob thugs. It&apos;s too bad that everything is just so barren.
<br>
<br>Vito as a main character is great but he does have a few flaws that detract from the experience. For the sake of spoilers though, I&apos;ll just say he goes along with everything ALL the time, which seems dumb. It seems like he really doesn&apos;t have a mind of his own. But, I still like him as a character (great voice acting).
<br>
<br>So, the story. Every review I have seen says the story is great, the story is amazing, the reason to get this game is the story (aka the point of the game). So how is the story?
<br>
<br>It&apos;s the same old mobster story you have heard a million times.
<br>
<br>I know. I can hear the people yelling at this review now. But seriously, if you have seen The Godfather, Goodfellas or any other mob movie, you have already seen this one. EXCEPT one thing, which is the ending (and again no spoilers). All I will say is the ending of this game floored me. Totally unexpected.
<br>
<br>Do I recommend Mafia 2? It depends. If you are a sucker for the time period or Mafia/Mob games, then I will say Yes, go buy it now. But if you are expecting a true open world experience set in the 1950s (like I was) then I would probably say no. It is not that at all. I would advise the people to look up how much cut-content there was for Mafia 2 because there was a lot. This game was going to have over 180 missions and it definitely does not have that. I beat the game in around 10 hours.
<br>
<br>So Final Breakdown:
<br>+40s-50s Atmosphere
<br>+Soundtrack
<br>+Voice Acting is good
<br>+Graphics are nice for the time
<br>+Vito as a main character
<br>
<br>-... even though he has questionable character flaws

The first Mafia was a love letter to really old cars. You had a huge garage (which somehow made sense) where you collected them, start to finish. Mafia II, cars, even though a good chunk of your time is spent behind the wheel, you could drive the first car you get through the whole game and not miss much.  Most of the cars handle the same. The story in Mafia II is a MESS.  It starts out really promising, establishing characters, motives, etc, then falls apart. It feels like the game was originally twice as long and they edited out major scenes to save length or something. By the climax, you have no real idea why your shooting it out with the guy your fighting. Speaking of combat, the same problems in the first one crop up in the sequel. Combat in Mafia II is really fun, I won&apos;t take that away from it. But in such a story driven game, its problematic. Accidentally killing a minor character in one part of the game spawns a whole mission where you have to sneakily dispose of the body and smooth things over with the powers that be. Fine, that&apos;s Mob Movie 101: The old guard doesn&apos;t approve what the reckless cowboy young gangsters are doing.  The problem is that one mission earlier, you wasted 30 guys in broad daylight and never heard about it again. The biggest complaint: No free ride, WTF?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1607299">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s hardly any interaction with non-story related characters, meaning there are no side missions. But with that being said I still easily put 20 hours of play time into the game, it&apos;s well worth the money.</span>

That&apos;s right - Mafia 2 is just too simple, when it supposed to be much more complicated - it&apos;s even more simple than the first game. All you do is, you take a care, you go to place marked on a map, you do what you&apos;re asked for and you go back home, you take a sleep, next chapter begins and a cycle starts over again. Fortunately, it&apos;s not all that bad - 2K Czech took care about a few gameplay twists, to the game isn&apos;t boring, while the whole &quot;get to the point&quot; thing helps to speed up the plot and somehow build a great atmosphere. Speaking of plot, it isn&apos;t better than in Mafia (1), but that doesn&apos;t stop it from being great and surprising player... although, I figured out some of a surprises in game long before, they happened (especially when it comes to Vito&apos;s father death). Also, players who played Mafia (1) will be pleasantly surprised here and there, seeing the referees to the first game (I almost cried in Chapter 14: Stairway to Heaven... I won&apos;t spoil it what it was, anyway who finished the first game, will notice it as soon as cutscene starts). Before, I get to the technical part, I must mention thought, that was haunting me through almost entire game and that is - &quot;Give me, more freedom!&quot;. That&apos;s right, developers gave the players some ability to choose (for example who to get rid of cops, who to dress, what to change in car)... but when you watch cutscenes, you will quickly notice that there was supposed to be some choices in game - after watching the main part of dialogue there, the character usually ask &quot;So, are you in?&quot;. You&apos;d like to grab a mouse and choose the action, but unfortunately, you won&apos;t get that chance... too bad, because watching Vito wrong decisions is kind of annoying sometimes. When it comes to a technical part of Mafia - it&apos;s almost a masterpiece! The sounds are great! It&apos;s been a long time, since I&apos;ve heard such a great sounds in video games and the graphics? Well, let&apos;s just say it&apos;s the best looking game, I&apos;ve seen so far. The city is extremely highly detailed - I couldn&apos;t believed that the all that was rendered in real-time and ran over 30 frames per seconds on my already old PC. Better, a lot of elements of environment can be destroyed, metal that covers a car folds when you hit some obstacles and there is even a realistic snow that will cover parts of a car, not to mention scratches... with that said, the game&apos;s engine has a one major problem - it isn&apos;t very stable. It has a tendency to crash in some certain parts of game. The last thing, that I have to mention is that players will be disappointed after finishing the game (it took me about 8 hours on Hard difficulty, so it&apos;s not a long game)... why? Because there&apos;s nothing. All you get is &quot;Family Album&quot; and that&apos;s it. There&apos;s not Free Ride mode, nothing. You can only load a previous save and replay some episode - that&apos;s probably the biggest flaws of this game... but overall - it&apos;s a good sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1365617">Expand</a></span>

And on the game: If you are looking for a story driven game (story is good but not super amazing), that is strictly mission based (missions are mostly good), then this game is for you. It is nothing more, nothing less.</span>

<br>
<br>Like many people reviewing, the first thing I have to say is that the game is short, without any extra depth to the side missions, so if you are buying this for the replay value, don&apos;t.  The game may be fun, but after you complete the campaign, there is nothing left to do, hell, even during the game there are few options to do side-missions, and even then, the extra money can&apos;t be used for a whole lot, and because of a plot development, becomes useless.  Additionally, auto-saving can be a bit of a pain in the ass, since it only autosaves before a big fight, rather than after mission objectives are completed, so if you crash, you&apos;re  and have to replay several minutes of gameplay at least.
<br>
<br>Despite this, I love this game, because the plot kept me hooked.  I went into this game expecting GTA mafia edition, and came out feeling like I finished a good movie.   Additionally, this game went with a balance leaning towards realism, albeit keeping game elements in.  For instance, if you get into a fist-fight with a random bystander, the police won&apos;t run over to you and cap you for it, but rather they will tell you to break it up, and keep the fighting off the streets.  If you are speeding, they will attempt to pursue, but if you go around a corner they pretty much stop caring.  Likewise, if you steal a car, or kill someone, they could take down your description or license plate, so those would have to be changed too, either by a new outfit, or buying a license plate from a shady garage.
<br>
<br>Overall, I loved this game, and wish there were more like it.  Too many games sacrifice plot and MEANINGFUL gameplay for appealing to a wider audience.  This might be the part where I&apos;d say I would definitively play again, except I already have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3593050">Expand</a></span>

Mafia 2 set you in the shoes of Vito Scaletta, a young boy that that is sent to the army....well you probably know the small details already, since this will probably not be the first review you will read.<br><br>I decided to put my review up here because this game has been getting some questionable scores from very known sites.  I however see it in a different approach then these have. Actually it has been getting some false hate because most people have expected something that wasn`t really there, and was properly advertised in this way to. Mafia II is in fact a story game, with Empire Bay just as an extra asset. This isn`t you`re typical free roam game, simply because it really wasn`t designed as one either.<br><br>It heavily relies on the story, which is in fact really great put, though there could have been some better pacing at certain times. Some of the missions actually has some really great locations and good action packed is it also. All from simply lifting boxes in to a truck, to be telephone operator that steals jewelery, it goes away from the dated &quot;go there and kill these people&quot; and that was the mission. In fact, most of the missions is like this, but it hides it in such a good way that it really immerses you in every way possible. In this aspect, it shines more than I have seen in almost any game, if not the most of them all. Remember, this could have been just a game that didn`t actually have a city at all, but it`s still there. This was never a free roam game, the developers have stated this several times. Soundtrack in itself is simply put amazing. It fits the 40s and the 50s era perfect, even if some of the songs it not entirely accurate of the timeline. Voice acting is as strong as you can get in a video game, it really is believable and makes the characters more believable than there actions make them out to be. You feel sympathy with Vito and his situation, it is really close to perfection this area. In the end, if you can retract the fact that this is not a free roam game like GTA, you will have one of the best experiences this gen.  9.2</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1364860">Expand</a></span>

However, should you be looking for anything more than that, then you might play this game feeling unfulfilled. The high point of this game is in its presentation, where it truly immerses you into the 1940&apos;s, and you could tell that it really took advantage of this era when it provides 40&apos;s music (whether you like it or not) all the way to the clothing styles. It&apos;s all very intricate and nice to look at, even if there are some elements that seem to be added in with no purpose (such as the ability to turn on sinks and flush toilets).<br><br>However, apart from this, Mafia II is a pretty average third-person shooter. Nothing prolific, but still fun to play. Don&apos;t expect a fun open world game such as Grand Theft Auto, because Mafia II seems to really discourage you from toying around in the beautiful New York rendition they had crafted. For example, there are no side missions, few enterable buildings, and your time to explore is limited to a few sections during missions. And as such, Mafia II doesn&apos;t feel like a Sandbox game, but rather a third-person shooter taking place in a somewhat open-world environment.<br><br>Gameplay consists of shooting from the third person perspective, cover playing a large role. Most cover can be destroyed easily, which adds a cool perspective to combat. Weapon selection is standard, and there really isn&apos;t anything here that hasn&apos;t been done before in other third-person shooters. When you are not participating in these gunfights, you will often be doing some tedious driving missions which are long-winded and unnecessary.<br><br>However, the  story is what is really going to hook people in to buy Mafia II. So, is it any good? Well, if you look at it by itself without any knowledge of other mobster films, then I suppose it is an alright story, but since I&apos;m sure we&apos;ve all watched Goodfellas and The Godfather, then Mafia II seems unoriginal and downright boring at times, but does have some very cool moments amidst the tedium.<br><br>I had really hyped up this game due to its predecessor being groundbreaking and great fun, and Mafia II was slightly disappointing. But in its own right, its a fun game; nothing special. You&apos;ll likely be hooked to it until the finish, don&apos;t expect a clean resolution. The setpiece battles can be quite visceral at times, and everything in the game works with few bugs.<br><br>Overall, I don&apos;t think you should go into this game with the high expectations that the original Mafia may have brought, but as a third-person shooter with nothing to hide, Mafia II is a good game. Even without a true open world structure, the world still manages to feel massive and alive, and the 40&apos;s environment is used to its fullest potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1365700">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s been said before but it bears repeating: you can not save your game and go explore the open world as you please. The game only saves at checkpoints, and if you die before the next checkpoint it drags you all the way back. Your weapons, money, outfits, etc are taken away from you every other mission. This is a linear story with the beautiful open world only there to make you forget you&apos;re driving the exact same route across town for the 50th time (there are what, a dozen destinations total?). Every once in a while I would spend my money on all of the guns and ammo available and soup up a nice vehicle, and try to cause a little chaos. Don&apos;t even bother. There is no dying and restarting at a hospital, and there is no getting arrested and going to jail. If either of those happen you&apos;re taken back to the last time the game decided to autosave-- often this is way further back than you thought. I&apos;ve beaten a mission, been told to go home to sleep on my couch, gotten killed, and started back 2/3rds through my previous mission (usually a long driving trip ahead of me...). I don&apos;t want to come off as just trying to find problems, so I probably shouldn&apos;t mention the story. I will say that it was cliche and predictable (as many of these mob stories tend to be), and ultimately is rather fruitless. All the characters are forgettable to the point where they have to reintroduce them with your character exclaiming their name and a little exposition about what you should remember them by. This is really telling in a game that only take a day or so to beat (depending on how many times you turn off the game in disbelief because you died and went to a check point that was 10+ minutes ago). As far as the PC version itself, it appears fine to me. Graphics could be turned up to look stunning. I used a 360 controller and the buttons it showed on screen were the correct color (not sure if they just used common sense or if it adjusts to known controllers). I don&apos;t know that I encountered any bugs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1367972">Expand</a></span>

Good controls, challenging but not frustrating combat, but it&apos;s not the game I was expecting when I bought it. This release seems to be formulated entirely to sell DLC. On the one hand there&apos;s a large, detailed open world, on the other hand there&apos;s absolutely nothing to do in it outside of the 6-10 hours of story missions. The only real reason to rob stores or scrap/export stolen cars is for the steam achievements. The story missions provide you with everything you need from the get-go. Lo and behold, it turns out that 2K Czech has a ton of completed sandbox content they simply chose not to release with the box copy. You&apos;ll be buying it in DLC format at $10 a pop. If you&apos;re after a sandbox wait a year and buy the bundle with DLC for half the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1368339">Expand</a></span>

The city, characters and cars all looked good, each district felt and looked completely different, providing a nice environment for the city. Many of the nicer looking areas of the city were not essential to the story mode, leaving them unappreciated and un required really. I liked the ability to customise your character and cars, it added a nice touch to the game, even though there were not that many options, a minor problem that could easily be fixed by mods or DLC.<br><br>The Story of a young Italian going from war-hero to leading a life of crime, a story that was bursting with potential, but went no where. No &quot;depth&quot; given to the story left many things unanswered. The &quot;ending&quot; to Mafia 2 was probably the biggest disappointment the game had to offer. Looking past how the actual &quot;story&quot; was rushed along from chapter to chapter, the ending only showed you that little or no effort had been put into it.<br><br>A major let down was the lack of freedom that Mafia 2 offered. There are no side missions, no mini games, and no free-ride mode, offering little to no reason to replay this game. Restricting players to follow the story makes the &quot;open world&quot; a bit redundant. Ok you could drive around anywhere before or after the missions, but there was no reason to, nothing to do other than to take in the graphics of the city.<br><br>Missing features like shooting whilst driving and melee weapons, took out some of the &quot;realism&quot; of the mafia world. Hand to Hand combat had been greatly improved, but was only really needed during story elements, everyone else you just shot. Many reviews say that this is because its not like GTA, which is true, its not, but its not even like the first Mafia game anymore. I think that if Mafia 2 had been made by Rockstar Games, or had fixed the mistakes of Mafia, and added from there, this review would have been very different. To me it seems that 2K Games have destroyed a potentially great sequel, to a very good first game. DLC will probably be released for Mafia 2 to try to incorporate features that should have been in the game in the first place.<br><br>End Result - Disaster 1/10<br><br>Poor Game Play, Worst Story, No Replay Value, Far Too Short.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1366545">Expand</a></span>

SO MUCH WASTED SPACE in this game<br><br>The AI of the enemy be police or mobster needs fixed asap as this game is totally unplayable. Though some of the bugs did have a plus.. like watching the police ram into a gas station, killing ten wee!<br><br>The only thing that saved this game was the scenery and voice acting which itself is not enough to hold a game together.<br><br>Its like owning a really beautiful world in a snow globe... you can look at it but when you try to interact, all you can do is just watch. I for one will never say I&apos;m the proud owner of this game and I&apos;ve spent a lot of time with it and waiting for it.<br><br>I for one will not recommend this game to anyone...in fact steer very clear until the price drop, and there WILL be one. All those are giving this decent scores need to play the game fully not for 10 min and go WOW..<br>really play the game then compare it to other open world titles and you will see this is an epic fail with an awesome soundtrack and cool voice overs.<br><br>other than that.. run far.. run fast..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1368955">Expand</a></span>

It is true that maybe the car driving part was bigger than expected, but I also enjoyed these, because it was good to drive in an enviroment like this. Vito&apos;s character is good, but it cannot beat the first game&apos;s perfect Tommy Angelo. On the other hand Joe is one of the best side-kicks I ever seen in a game. The rest of the characters are very well made. In Mafia II, we have experienced the most special way to connect two game&apos;s stories, I really couldn&apos;t believe my eyes, when I arrived THAT house in Chapter 14. I really liked the idea of starting the game in the world war II. I think there is only one big problem with this game. I don&apos;t mind that it is short. I don&apos;t mind that most of the time I had to drive a car (what I really enjoyed, as I said before), but the ending of the game is terrible. I mean, the way the game ends, is not a real ending. Yeah, Joe has to die, and maybe Vito should die too, I am not saying this is a bad ending. The way the game ends is what I don&apos;t like. It isn&apos;t dramatic enough. Leo&apos;s last words meant to be dramatic, but they aren&apos;t. There isn&apos;t a &quot;The End&quot;, or a Mafia II logo before the credits roll, and all this doesn&apos;t make a good ending. Normally I would give a 10 to this game, but with this ending I would say only 7 or 8. But... I think the story is intended to not to be closed down, and I think we will see DLCs in the future, which will continue the game&apos;s story. With this being said, I really trust in Mafia II&apos;s story being continued, and I am sure the developers can make such a good ending, that the first game has. This is why I give the game 9 points of 10...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1369025">Expand</a></span>

The plot is okay and  it could have been good if they didn&apos;t set the climax like they did, it was absolutely idiotic, I honestly felt there was atleast 5 more chapters when the credits started rolling, and what more once you finish the game, THATS IT, you cant even go back to explore, what a way to waste such a beautiful city !!!
<br>The soundtrack and the radio setting is good, and like you can see when the game is analysed every element is done not too badly, but the core of the game is taken away and there is just the story and even the character depth is not too good, Vito and Joe are two goons and nothing more, not as respectful as tommy angelo from the original game..
<br>
<br>Wait for the game to get to the bargain bin to experience its pros..
<br>It wont take long anyway..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1370286">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m really on the fence with this one because there are so many things I like but a few things I really don&apos;t like. I&apos;ll categorize my Pros, Cons, and Recommendations to the developers. PROS<br>1. Great story line that draws you in. Good Cut scenes. 2. Great Graphics and design<br>3. Great sound tracks from the 40&apos;s and 50&apos;s. I LOVE THE 1950&apos;s time period. You feel like you really are in the time period. 4.Weather and Lighting - Amazing job with the lighting. Morning feels like morning with the sun light correctly highlighting on buildings and cars. Evening feels like evening. And night is night. The Snow and Ice is a nice change from dry pavement in so many games. 5. Audio Design is great! Good sound effects and top quality sounds. 6. The story really pulls you in and you keep playing to see what happens next. I actually cared about what was happening to the characters in the game. I found myself saying (WTF) a few times out loud as the story progressed and a few surprises popped up I didn&apos;t expect. 6. Shoot Outs. I love the shoot outs! The Duck and Cover ability and the weapons. You feel like you are really in an action movie in a gun fight. The PhysX are great too with bullet holes, breaking glass, sparks and fire. Awesome! Over all the feel and design was a #10. But I only gave it a 7 due to the CONS listed below.  CONS.<br><br>1. Too short. (Play on at least Medium or HARD level to extend the playability of this game. It&apos;s only about 15 chapters long and it ends fast. It&apos;s way too short for $30 dollar game.<br>There is content you can download like cars and clothes, but half the time you spend changing your clothes because you are wanted by the police, or using different cars anyway. For a game that has very little RE-PLAY value, it doesn&apos;t make the extra content worth having. (Yes, I purchased 2 content packs) 2. MOST of the driving physics are modeled very real. However the control of the cars is frustrating and not that fun. It feels like you are always fighting just to drive the car.  For a game that is centered so heavily around DRIVING it&apos;s a real CON. But not bad enough to not play. Just annoying.  3. Vehicle Views is another huge CON for me. The 3rd person car camera RESETS to a default position every time you try and get a different angle or view while driving.   It&apos;s very annoying. (Developers, it should be more like GTA4 where you can keep the camera position where you want it when driving. The second CON is when using the HOOD CAM or Full View Driving Cam you can&apos;t move your view to check for traffic when crossing streets or making turns. This is a HUGE problem. It makes the other views pretty much worthless. If you are going to have so much driving in a game, you need to make sure these issues are FIXED!<br><br>Over all I loved the feel and style of the game. It ended a bit abrupt as if the developers wanted an excuse to create Mafia 3. It leaves you saying...&quot;Eh, What? That&apos;s the end?&quot; If the game wasn&apos;t $30 bucks, it wouldn&apos;t be a huge deal since there are other Downloadable missions and content. I didn&apos;t pay full price ($7 bucks on Steam) but for a $30 dollar game it needed more. And idea would be to sell the BASE GAME and Story for a lower price of $9.99 and then sell additional story packs for $5 bucks. You would make more money and players would get more game time and not feel ripped off. Just an idea. I&apos;d buy extra story packs if the base game was cheaper and a bit longer. Hope this helps the creators as well as the potential players of this game. (LOVED THE 1950&apos;S MUSIC AND THEME! A great and refreshing change!)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1700569">Expand</a></span>

Next to that the missions are fun and I liked the mafia story a lot. The ending was one of the best I&apos;ve seen in a video game, it really makes you think about the tough world of the past. My only critique about the game is that there is not much to do after the story, but since the story was so good it&apos;s no big deal to me. So that&apos;s why I definitely recommend getting this game, just don&apos;t expect an open world game like GTA or Saints Row, as this one is far more story based.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3398126">Expand</a></span>

There was no glitches for me, maybe because my game is a LEGAL VERSION. I love the way that they have made this game. The first time you play, you just run through the missions. Next time you look for the hidden bonus stuff. Good thing is that they have real music from the era of this game, too bad they didn&apos;t license the car names. This should not be compared to GTA. If you want GTA, don&apos;t play this game. If you love trench coats and american-italian accents, you&apos;ll love this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1369107">Expand</a></span>

The story, voice acting and cinematics are outstanding, but the grand city of Empire Bay feels rather hollow and empty. There are a couple of clothing stores to customize Vito Scaletta&apos;s appearance, and some body shops to paint and upgrade your cars, but soon you realize that you can do just as well with a dusty old family car as an upgraded 50000 dollar sports-car, and that the clothing options are rather thin. And if you want to go out and explore the city you will have to do so in between two checkpoints in a mission. The whole city feels like a big tease. Now, the game itself is good, gunfights are entertaining (though certainly not challenging, even on the highest difficulty) and the overall game mechanic is good, but it doesn&apos;t reach higher than that. Mafia 2 is a game you will play for the story and the atmosphere. Simply put: Good but not great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1461051">Expand</a></span>

I found that the beginning was too easy, the middle was boring, repetitive and overly-linear with gunfights starting and ending from one piece of cover; and the end was die-a-thousand-deaths frustrating. The AI can almost always shoot you first.<br><br>Throughout the game, you don&apos;t get to make a single decision. You just watch while your character ruins his life and the lives of those around him. Yes, this is mob life but I would feel a little better about it if I had some say. On top of that, the game basically requires no thought on behalf of the player. The game is always telling you exactly what to do and where to go. It even gives you an NPC buddy on all the missions to guide you through the level. Just follow him through the levels and you&apos;ll never get lost. Oh, and he can&apos;t be killed. Use him as a bullet sponge.<br><br>Then there&apos;s the driving. Who wants to play a video game where you can get speeding tickets? Seriously? And hit and run fines? And whenever whassname is in the car and I run a red light he says &quot;what do you have an aversion to red lights?&quot; I don&apos;t play video games to wait in traffic!! I also came into this game hoping it would be a sandbox game. Just so you know, it is not. You do a mission, and you can either 1. drive around and, well, there&apos;s not really anything to do because there are no minigames, or 2. sleep and go to the next chapter. Which almost always starts with the phone ringing.<br><br>And another thing. There are times in the game where you lose all your money. More than one. So you save up all this cash,  maybe you&apos;re looking to buy that special something, and boom. Gone. Yeah.<br><br>It&apos;s a good thing I only paid $7.50 for this game. Gotta love midweek madness on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1535934">Expand</a></span>

The game engine is fantastic, and makes everything feel realistic. The driving (in simulation mode), the combat, the cover system,the guns, the AI, the lighting, the textures, cutscenes, animations and of course, PhysX  are all brilliant. I&apos;d go as far as saying that this game&apos;s visuals and physics programming are superior to that of GTA IV. On top of that, the game is of good length and has decent characters and a nice story. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE  this is not even in the same league compared to the original. The first game really had it cracked  the pacing, the level design, the variety, the characters, the story, the soundtrack, the realism etc. Mafia II is still a Mafia game  it&apos;s not a generic third-person shooter and is character driven, so don&apos;t expect much free-roam. I&apos;m glad that this isn&apos;t a GTA clone, but in some aspects it has tried to be to appeal to a wider crowd. I felt like this game was heavily influenced by Grand Theft Auto IV. The story and missions aren&apos;t anywhere near as special as The City of Lost Heaven, and the characters are more shallow. Joe is almost a clone of Roman from GTA IV. There&apos;s also no Free Ride mode as in the first game either. However, what this game manages to do is make you feel like you&apos;ve actually lived a day in the life of the main character, because each chapter Is packed with content and is of perfect length. Overall the game is a bit more predictable and more generic, and does nothing new. It&apos;s pretty much a combination of Mafia and GTA IV, which isn&apos;t a bad thing but the story isn&apos;t as good as in Mafia 1 and there&apos;s no extra content such as multiplayer or free-roam and side missions. It&apos;s worth playing if you liked GTA IV but if you&apos;re expecting it to even come close to touching the first game on any department, you&apos;re gonna be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3835942">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I found the game quite on the awesome side but only for people who likes cars because this game has lots of driving around. Also has very nice graphics if you have a nice PC to play on and the music is simply the best. The downside of this is that the game is too short and to be an interesting game you have to buy all the DLCs which is almost 30&#xE2;</span>

Let&apos;s start off with the atmosphere: the game has superb voice acting, great artistic style and overall a high level of authenticity. When you&apos;re driving around Empire bay in the winter of 1945 listening to real 40s music on the radio, it makes for a very special experience - it really makes you feel like you&apos;re there. Everything from the street signs to the clothes people wear to the cars on the street has a very authentic ring to it. Some scenes, such as the skyscraper one are very memorable and amazing in their own right. Everything in this game was done right except for a few things:
<br>1. It&apos;s not possible to have interactive conversations with other characters. Everything is prerecorded and while it does make for a nice cinematic experience (and makes you feel like you&apos;re watching a great movie), it does sometimes make you feel like you&apos;re not fully in control.
<br>2. Empire bay is very authentic and amazing but you don&apos;t get to do a whole lot. Interaction with the environment is somewhat limited.
<br>3. Some chapters were written poorly. Out of 15 chapters, you spend the first 10 doing small time jobs and basically feeling like a small time street criminal vs. a real mafia member. The story is pretty slow to pick up, though once it does it&apos;s very good. I only wish the game made you feel like a real mafia member for the greater part of the game and not only the last 33%.
<br>
<br>Otherwise, this game is amazing and plays like a good movie. Definitely worth it, even more so if you pick it up during a sale. You shouldn&apos;t have a problem getting 15 hours out of it assuming you&apos;re not trying to rush through it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2612389">Expand</a></span>

<br>What sucks is that it had no free roam and almost nothing to do besides the quests. Driving was fun and AI was not as retarded as in GTA series.

<br>the story is pretty short 11 hours and the replay is low.
<br>you can not move free like in gta so you need to play a chapter where you had good cars and money.
<br>its a small open world but fun its just a good game only they gut don hit much beter.

<br>
<br>First few times I played, I liked it, but didn&apos;t find it anything special.
<br>Then, after a while without touching it, I decided to give it another chance.
<br>Well, that was a revelation. Taking this game serious, getting used to the controls and the way the game works has made me see it in a totally different light. I&apos;ve now finished two of the main campaigns and will start another soon.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Graphically very impressive
<br>The sound is great, too
<br>Combat is well thought out, with few problems (mainly the boring hand-to-hand combat)
<br>Driving is basically perfect
<br>The missions are varied and enticing
<br>The extra content is great (despite a dependency on timed missions)
<br>Huge arsenal at your disposal
<br>Going on a rampage is a great stress-reliever
<br>Huge city to explore
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>I can only see one  the fact that, despite the city&apos;s magnificence, I was left wanting more places to go (and destroy). Most of the building are just there for cosmetic purposes. I wanted banks to rob, post offices to terrorise, a full stadium to go berserk (it&apos;s there, but you can&apos;t enter it), etc.
<br>As it stands, you have restaurants, gun shops, gas stations and cloth shops and nothing else (except on select missions).
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>Awesome game, that could be only improved by extending what&apos;s already there.
<br>Unfortunately, that doesn&apos;t seem likely, given the game&apos;s age and lack of any news about it...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3874726">Expand</a></span>

The biggest con for me with this game was lack of additional side quests after completing the main story, which offered little replay incentive. Still recommend giving this game a chance.</span>

I am a new fan to the first Mafia, and as soon as I played it, I was simply amazed. Like many games, this one still has its flaws, such as not having side quests/missions, because when I play an open world game I expect some side missions. But otherwise, this game is simply beautiful, and the cut scenes were fun to watch. The city feels sorta empty, but it doesn&apos;t  bother me. I do hate that the gun shops around the cities only have a Police .38 Revolver, a Colt 1911, or a shotgun. When I go to a gun shop I expect a Thompson Police Issue or something like that. But of course, you have to drive a mile to get to Harry who has more guns than the gun shops around the city combined, but of course the drive is worth it. The driving in this game is very realistic. If you&apos;re planning on trying to reach 120 MPH and expect to stop unharmed, you&apos;re wrong, he-he.  I&apos;m saddened by the length of this game.  I beat it in about 10-11 hours, but of course this is longer than most games out in the market, but in Mafia 1 terms this is short. The collectibles in this game will want gamers want to replay the game just to find them, such as the playboys, wanted posters, etc, etc.  I give this game a 9.2, for being a gritty, beautiful, and fun game that i&apos;m sure anyone that loves the original Mafia game and the Godfather series will enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1366613">Expand</a></span>

I cannot praise the immersiveness and evocativeness of the period recreation highly enough. Just driving around nighttime 1940s New-York style streets listening to old-time jazz, blues and other wartime music and seeing all the old-fashioned cars and the snow-covered streets is a wonderfully enjoyable treat, particularly on the PC version with its superlative, realistic graphics. It really gave me enormous joy and pleasure to just drive around listening to the radio whilst completing the early missions, I found the period setting superbly evocative, and the snowy nighttime setting of one of the missions and the music really evoked a lovely wistful feeling as I drove around, it really was very emotionally engaging indeed just from the visuals and music. The design of the city is very convincing, you see lots of realistic-looking streets and sights as you drive around, you almost feel you are watching a film, it&apos;s terrific. I loved it. Also the shooting is great in this game, the reaction of the enemies when you shoot them is very realistic, and the ragdoll physics are better and more realistic than in any other game I&apos;ve seen. So I thoroughly enjoy the shooting also, I find it fun and immersive and satisfyingly convincing shooting the enemies. I rate this game very highly for these three reasons, the visuals, the music, and the shooting. Fantastic.<br><br>As to the story, well, I&apos;m still near the beginning, but it&apos;s pretty good too. Get this game on the PC if you can. If you can&apos;t but think you would enjoy being transported to an atmosphere-laden 40s and 50s New York anyway, get it on console. I liked it. Try the demo anyway, but bear in mind the demo doesn&apos;t include the whole city, and is daytime-only.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1367238">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I was hovering on this forum, and i must say. Did you guys play the same game as me? Most people here said that, Mafia 2 is a good game? There was really nothing good about this game, and here is why:
<br>
<br>Story
<br>
<br>The story was pretty bad, even if you can call it a story. You mostly drive from your apartment to Joe to do some random events. And in no particle order, like burring someone in the ground after the prison chapter. And then some chapters later you distribution some smokes to people. That has nothing to do with any story. Or like all of the sudden, we going to talk about why your father died.  I mean common, the story is completely random. So I must say, there is no story in this game.
<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>
<br>The Gameplay mostly consist of get a car, go to someone (mostly Joe), drive him around a bit, go home and sleep and do it all over again. And at some points, you need to fight multiple enemies, that spawn mostly right around the corner. And that is the Gameplay of Mafia 2, nothing more nothing less.
<br>
<br>At multiple points in the game, you are stripped down of your cash, guns and suits and after you finished that chapter you need to start earning everything back again. This I never saw in a game before, you work towards nothing. You lose it all every few chapters, so the multiple stores that are in the game are pointless. Because you just lose your guns, or you can find plenty in the missions. Also the game is mostly based on luck, multiple scenes will kill you right away. Like the getaway scene were they are firing Tommy Guns at you. You just need some luck to get past the first corner, this has absolutely  nothing to do with experience or strategy just pure luck. Conclusion
<br>
<br>So my conclusion is that I never have seen a worst sequel to a game then Mafia 2. The game is boring, from the first minutes you played it, till the bitter end. Plenty of times you need to drive from one end of the town to the other end and then go back again. Were you did nothing at all, then picking someone up and driving them to a different point again.
<br>
<br>Also at the end Joe almost turned against you. If they did that, they would have been promoted to the worst game of the Century. But now, it is the worst game of the year. Because it does not make any senses for him to turn against you. I only finished this game on Hard, because I did not wanted to waste my 50 bucks on nothing. Pity that I got it from Steam, because I would have gone back to the shop and trade it for something else. Even a bloody WII game, is better than this piece of crap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1367790">Expand</a></span>

When I heard about Mafia II I jumped for joy, I cannot say one bad thing about it, It is full of action and adventure and is very entertaining right to the end.  The game is set from 1943 to 1955 in Empire Bay, a fictional city based on New York city and Detroit. You follow the life of a War Hero named Vito Scaletta getting back on his feet in a life of crime after he came back from World War II. Just to get it out of the way no this game is not Grand Theft Auto in the 40-50&apos;s, it is alot better and more involved than GTA is and always will be. There are no limits on the map from the second the game boots up, you can go anywhere and do anything, lots of cars from the era and weapons to match. This game is defiantly worth picking up buying or renting, It&apos;s alot of fun and worth you money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1386424">Expand</a></span>

There are even NO Side Missions in the game, even the guys from 2k said there will be lots of them, there are still the guys who should give you that mission but who never have any job for you to do. 2K killed Mafia.

The ending isn&apos;t as bad as some people would lead you to believe.  But in general this a great looking game that has hardly any substance.  It&apos;s like the developers were told to make a 50s version of GTA, but then halfway through they ran out of money and shipped what they had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1369534">Expand</a></span>

The main thing that I am getting on 2 tell u about it the )*&amp;%@#*($&amp;) cops in this game. There is literally 1 every friggn block WTF!!! that isnt even realistic in real life u (*$&amp;@*(# d bag programmers )*&amp;#$)*@&amp;#()* u guys ruined the game right there. Pretty much u cant do anything bad... NOT EVEN SPEED without gettting tailed. Then of course u have to lose the fuzz before u can even start the mission, and u had better not die bc u r going to end up right back at the beggining of the ()*$&amp;@*(#&amp;(@* chapter bc 4 some reason this game will never let u save ur ()$&amp;@()&amp;#$()@ progress!!!!! The handling of the cars is i guess pretty accurate bc u they sure dont handle 4 crap.... which means u r def going to run in2 crap and of course get tailed whereever u need to go. Its funny how the game puts ssooooooo much emphasis on driving across the entire )*$&amp;@*(#&amp; city to do missions, so it takes forever just for the driving, and yet u have to do the driving correctly or u r 100% guaranteed to get a cop on u!!! Then of course u have to pass ur destination up 2 lose the (&amp;$@()# cops, also chances r those cops will end up killing u or making u wreck ur piss poor handling car and die.... and dont 4get since the )($&amp;@()#$ game wouldnt let u save anything... so u just wasted 10 min and have to start from the begging again and skip evvvvvvvery cut scene.... drive alllllll over the pos city just 2 get 2 destination.... and dont 4get u have to drive slow and hit nothing so the )*$&amp;@*)$ cop at every corner doesnt start tailing u AND then u reapeat the same )*$&amp;@*(#&amp;@(_#&amp;@()&#xB4A; CYCLE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!! r u ssssssseeeeeinnngggg where I am coming from..... If i knew just 1 of the developers 4 this game i would drag him in2 the )(&amp;$@()&amp;$() street and run his )*($&amp;@()&amp;#$()@&amp;$)( d bag self over with a 1950s chev pickup... then mayb just mayb.... i would feel that i got my moneys worth out of this worthless game!!!! sad thing is I got it on the steam sale at 12 bux and I still feel like i have been ripped off!!!!!!! $)&amp;@*)$*@()$&amp;@*()#&amp;@(*#()@#*&amp;@()*#&amp;@*(#&amp;@) dont buy this game!!!!!! worthless!!!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1472591">Expand</a></span>

Now this could be fun if the whole shooting wouldn&apos;t be soo boring. Yes you can shoot trough wood.. well some  wood, you can&apos;t shoot trough wooden crates or anything so that&apos;s a let down. Not as much action or fun as Mafia was. Really the story is terrible in comparison. In the first one you were happy when you stopped being a cab driver because the driving annoyed you. Now you are the cabdriver all day long. The chases are not fun. the shooting is easy and borring. You have no choices in the whole game. The most fun thing in this game must be to drive cars from the 50s. The fistfighting is only happening a few times and it&apos;s only 1 vs 1 as the other 3 friends won&apos;t attack you. It&apos;s also really annoying and not really fun either. Realy this game sucks. I wish I wouldn&apos;t have payed or just bought the hitman saga again.. at least there you don&apos;t have to deal with costumization that shouldn&apos;t rbe there in the first place.. it&apos;s like a short GTA4 1950s mod with worse driving.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mafia-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1366270">Expand</a></span>
