I bought this on the basis of an IGN review and was sadly disappointed to find that a 3rd of the whole game was essentially shown during their developer preview/blog/playthrough video.
<br>
<br>The navigation and constant travelling was particularly bad, but it was made cumbersome by the fact that it felt simply like unnecessary monotony just to skip to the next &quot;scene&quot;.
<br>
<br>I found myself a few times getting stuck on rocks trying to find the right direction on the left stick that might get me back in onto the navigable path. The push-to-climb, jump, drop, rappel felt like an unnecessary annoyance.
<br>
<br>I tend to not play games for particularly long, so game length usually doesn&apos;t bother me. In this game it bothered me in two ways: 1. the game couldn&apos;t end quickly enough AND SOMEHOW 2. the game was still too short! (just 4 hours).
<br>
<br>I like the idea and the presentation, but ultimately this is lacking in gameplay and substance. Definitely not worth the sticker price. Definitely wish I could have my money back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6080885">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is centered around the plot, but the ending leaves you thinking &quot;Well, that was a whole bunch of nothing.&quot;
<br>
<br>Do not listen to the shills creaming their jeans, Firewatch is exceedingly mediocre.</span>

<br>This game is only 3 - 4 hours long, on rails walking simulator.
<br>Devs mislead players into thinking that this a open world game, which it isn&apos;t.
<br>Don&apos;t support lying devs and price tag of 20$ for a game that offers nothing new.

<br>I will keep posting my review back here everytime someone removes it

<br>Room for improvement:
<br>- Open world level design is fine, but some areas feels empty. World looks like decoration and I think that the game doesn&apos;t really reward you for deep exploring of hardly accessible places
<br>- Unity engine. I don&apos;t know why, but I don&apos;t like how it works on a PC. Controls and rendering feels weird and slow, but maybe it&apos;s just me.

<br>Had a lot of potential, I liked the approach but it felt short. I would love to see a sequel with an improved story, more freedom around exploration and interaction with the environment.</span>

<br>Anyway, the game basically shows its full potential in the first in game day. Which is superb. After that it literally becomes a walking dialogue simulator.
<br>
<br>It takes the whole game to build an atmosphere of doubt and conspiracy around the plot, only to end the game abruptly making 100% of your choices meaningless, which at the end makes you feel that you only had the illusion of choice, making you feel tricked as well.
<br>
<br>What I did like a lot, was the visuals. They&apos;re beautiful and the game runs smooth most of the time.
<br>
<br>Possible spoilers:
<br>
<br>The relationship you build with delilah, is gorgeous. However, you never even get to see a pic of her... which is really disappointing imho.
<br>The ending is just a middle finger to the player, plain and simple.
<br>
<br>End of spoilers:
<br>
<br>So I give a 6/10 just because I kinda like these unique games, even though this one was very falsely advertised, never fulfilling what the trailers showed it to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6083905">Expand</a></span>

And this game was short, it should have been at least a week before patching. Honestly, just either buy it at maybe $5 or do not bother. I already refunded it, with 2.1 hours, hopefully I get my money back. This game is not a 0, 1, or 2. But, it&apos;s not a 9 or 10, it is a awful value in every way. Just watch a lets play.

<br>
<br>The game revolves around the life of a man who takes up a job that is typically known as deathly boring and uses it to form a story of in-depth relationships and trust. This game is all about Henry and Delilah, and the way that they interact after their own personal lives go up in flames. How their relationship plays out is almost entirely up to you, and it makes the characters feel much different. You can stick to the life you ran away from, or try to seek a better one in the middle of the wild. It&apos;s all up to you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=7397984">Expand</a></span>

<br>It looks good, voice acting is superb, story is great, ending is underwhelming (and it is supposed to be).
<br>But, there is no game play and it is way way too short.
<br>This could have been a good movie, instead it became a pretty average game.</span>

The conversations between Henry and Delilah are ok, but its hard to pay attention to them when trees pop in and out of existence, or when the ground disappears. The 15 FPS is great too, I have a pretty nice Pc and I&apos;m above the system requirements but I still have to endure a god awful framerate. [[SPOILERS]] The endings piss poor, the second they introduced the weird hiker guy with his son I knew that he would have a big role to play. Sure enough, he was the one that was doing all the weird **** After that, you just get rejected no matter what, and nothing you did affects the outcome of the story. Now you can say the ending doesn&apos;t matter and that its all about the journey, but you can&apos;t say that when the **** journey was &quot;walk to this place, walk to another place, talk a bit&quot;. Another game that had a **** ending was Fallout New Vegas, you get a **** slideshow and you realize nothing matters. BUT the difference is in fallout new vegas I can **** do stuff, I don&apos;t just walk and walk and walk. So in the end, don&apos;t buy this game, you won&apos;t really have fun, it&apos;s just walking. Watch a full walkthrough with no commentary. You will get more out of just watching everything happen than actually playing the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6202949">Expand</a></span>

The story is pretty interesting, but it feels like at the end, the writers were fired, because nearing the ending is just ridiculous. The actual gameplay time is a few hours, which is pretty sad, considering the price of the game and the game has absolutely no replay value. The decisions you make have no impact on the game itself, it&apos;s just for you to do something. Whatever you choose, whatever you do, the entire game will still be exactly the same.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6621025">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;ll spend 90% of your time either exploring the wilderness or talking to your fellow fire-watchman, a woman by the name of Delilah, over the radio. So it&apos;s good then that these two parts of the game really are excellent, there is real chemistry in the radio banter between you and D. and the exploration is also fantastically done. I really applaud them for going with a handheld map and compass rather than just an automatic mini-map, it really makes the game that much more immersive and realistic.
<br>
<br>I also think that the graphics and audio design was very well done for such a small studio, there is a lot of love put in here. However - the problem I have with this game (and why the score stays at a seven) is that the game pretends like there&apos;s choice and consequence, but there really isn&apos;t. No matter what choices you make basically everyone who play this game is going to have the same emotional roller-coaster and the same ending.
<br>
<br>And while I understand that branching story lines and alternate endings take time and money to create it&apos;s especially painful this time around since I think this game could have been a real masterpiece, had we been allowed to explore some different endings depending on our choices. The net effect is that rather than feeling like we&apos;ve been given something decent, the feeling I have is that I&apos;ve been robbed of greatness. Video games are a unique medium in that they have the possibility to allow for choice and consequence, and to not take advantage of that in this case almost feels like a cardinal sin.
<br>
<br>There is so much that could have been done here in terms of keeping quiet on the radio, or not saying certain things on the radio, or delaying saying certain things to a certain someone, or not falling for someone&apos;s obvious trap. But nothing of that ever happens or pays off, this game is a &quot;corridor-adventure-game&quot; for a lack of a better term. You might initially think that there is choice and consequence, but this game is sadly a lot dumber than it initially makes itself out to be.
<br>
<br>I will also say that while I personally liked the current ending I think it may be a little too realistic, mature and underwhelming for mass-market tastes. Had the current ending been one of say three possible endings it would have been stellar, but since it&apos;s the only ending I think many will find it underwhelming.
<br>
<br>I debated long and hard whether I should give this game a 7 or an 8. In the end I decided that I can&apos;t reward coming this close to greatness and then falling short of the mark. This could have been a 9, or maybe even a 10, score game with the right branching story treatment but it simply falls short, and that is indeed painful</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6084272">Expand</a></span>

It creates a dramatic game without having to sacrifice gameplay for cutscenes and it creates a realistic and incredibly captivating relationship between to people who have never met and never see each other, which is further helped by the games amazing voice acting.
<br>The game&apos;s story relays on mystery and tension that gets built up by the large amount of quiet time created by hiking from place to place, making moments of high level action and suspense all the more effective at scaring or intensifying you. Gameplay revolves around hiking from place to place to do things (I&apos;m using things as speaking about any plot points is going to take away a large proportion of the game away as I will later elaborate on) you get a map and a compass and for some reason the game automatically has it so you know where you are. I instantly changed this as it allowed for a more immersive experience, having to accurately read a map in order to not get lost was a real treat. The graphics are cartoon-y and stunning and really goes to show that photo-realism in gaming is not always (or at all) the way forward, however, for an indie developer making a game of this scope seems to have taken its toll. The game has a tendency to have lag spikes even on my high spec pc (I just thank god I&apos;m not on ps4) and I had two crashes while playing (one game breaking and incredibly annoying one during an important moment). Aloe as you probably know its only 4.5 hours long. For the  &#xA3;15 price tag its pretty bad even if the game is polished and is consistently good as I&apos;ve been saying it is. But the last third of the really sucked and was appallingly unclimatic and disappointing. It seems like the writer built up the tension then had no idea what to do with it so he panicked and wrote this in at the last second.
<br>I like Firewatch, despite its shortcomings and found the first two thirds of the game so strong and the conversations between the two characters so good I couldn&apos;t help but like it. However, I can&apos;t recommend it due to its crappy ending.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6085395">Expand</a></span>

Enjoyable visuals, script &amp; voice acting are the only redeeming qualities in what is, otherwise, more akin to a chore than a game.</span>

<br>- It gives you the illusion of choice that changes how your character and the &quot;companion&quot; character that you never meet communicate to one another. There is no actual choice though.
<br>- There is virtually no difference between watching and playing this game. Go watch any of the LPs for it and save your $20.
<br>- It&apos;s not even appealing to look at. At the very least it could have given us that.
<br>
<br>I honestly don&apos;t know what drugs the positive reviewers were on when they posted their reviews. Maybe they&apos;re only reviewing the demo (which was solid), but the full game is just trash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6121936">Expand</a></span>

Rest of it would be great in another game with a better story and more expanded gameplay. So... I feel ripped off. I mean I knew it was going to be a story game / walking simulator, but there&apos;s just no meat here. Also there&apos;s no real choice in what happens, just different dialogue as far as I can tell. Pretty disappointed as from the reviews I&apos;d read they made it sound like there&apos;d be multiple endings or something so at least that would&apos;ve given it some meat, but nope.

<br>
<br>It falls short in literally every department. The game is painfully short for the price tag of $20. 3 hours long with zero depth in the gameplay and a massively disappointing story. Do yourself a favor and ignore this game.</span>

<br>
<br>The above might have been forgivable if the game had a strong story to keep you interested throughout. Unfortunately, while the story starts off strong, it proceeds to jump of a cliff near the end, which is almost as bad as having it be bad all throughout as it leaves a very sour taste in many people&apos;s mouths.
<br>
<br>The only positive aspects of Firewatch are the dialogue and the environment design, however, this just adds fuel to the idea that Firewatch would have functioned much better as a story then as a game, as well as having a story that didn&apos;t stop giving a **** near the end.
<br>
<br>Finally, it&apos;s extremely short for it&apos;s asking price of $19.99 US. This &quot;game&quot; is nothing more then an interactive book, calling Firewatch a game is an insult to other games and it&apos;s proclamation of being of good quality by mainstream game sites is more proof that mainstream games media have ****ing lost the plot and/or become filled with agenda-pushing morons.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6084219">Expand</a></span>

At one point that yo normally feel a awkward by it? The experience is divided by three major acts, the first one is when you are really excited by all that you see and hear, to see yourself in a Wyoming forest and walking around a lake, being mocked by some drunk teenagers girls, your relationship falling apart because you can&apos;t handle it. Then, it&apos;s just a walk from point A to point B type of game that you expect something out of nothing, and the third act is when you have your expectations up high and you are throw away by a really bad ending story.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s the kinda game that you have to buy during a sale, it&apos;s short, and as the main character says at the end, disappointing. Because, well, there is no ending, there is no nothing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6079482">Expand</a></span>

The art style is what brought me to it in the first place. The story line keeps you going until you realize how many loose ends there are. There is little to no interaction and any hopes that you have regarding the storyline will be crushed. This could&apos;ve easily been one of the greatest games this year but there is just so much unused potential it&apos;s just sad. Still, if you enjoy walking around in a beautifully designed environment then you might want to try it. Is it overhyped? Absolutely. Is it worth a try? Yes if you can get it for 10$ or less.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6094956">Expand</a></span>

The game had great potential but it didn&apos;t really live up to the hype they generated with their excellent (albeit sensationalized) trailers.
<br>
<br>The premise of the gameplay is fine.  I don&apos;t think it needed any more features, but the ones that were there could have been developed a bit more.   I had read an interview about how they put effort into making an outhouse so that your guy could use the bathroom...but its just a model.  This is a good example on how the developer doesn&apos;t seem to quite understand what is lacking from their game.  All the &quot;things&quot; you can do rely on the players imagination.
<br>
<br>You need to imagine that you are wandering in a vast forest (when its really on rails)
<br>You need to imagine you are fishing (when you are really just walking to the next scripted event)
<br>You need to imagine how Henry feels about his situation (because you aren&apos;t given any insight into this)
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t think the decision to funnel players to destinations by limiting where then can walk (due to downs trees that any normal person could hop over) was a good one.
<br>I don&apos;t think the game needed a conspiracy theory arc.
<br>
<br>I do think the game needed more from the antagonist, as hinted in the trailer
<br>I do think that their could have been more stress from the missing girls in the game (as hinted in the trailer)
<br>I do think there was opportunity for some cool options, like losing you map and compass and needing to either camp out or find your way back on memory alone.
<br>
<br>Overall I&apos;d say that the world is very pretty, the dialogue can be charming, but the story ends up being terrible despite starting strong.  It starts to fall apart when the conspiracies start.  It sort of reminds me how Indigo Prophecy fell apart near the end with A.I and the like.
<br>
<br>Decent game, not stellar.  I&apos;m a bit sad regarding its unrealized potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6084984">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is a short game (if it could be called that at all), at about 3 hours long to complete.  It was closer to a novel than a game, and had no challenge elements. It reminded me a lot of the &apos;Coming Home&apos; game, even though it was a completely different setting and slightly longer. The mystery/ suspense elements, which there wasn&apos;t much to speak of, took a back seat to the conversation/relationship between Delilah and Henry.
<br>If you want to experience a emotional novel like experience, then get the game because this is what it does well. If you want an actual game, DO NOT GET IT! It is no more a game than &apos;Coming Home&apos; was.
<br>At the start of the game I enjoyed the natural beauty of the wilderness setting, which was truly beautiful. But by the end, I was so sick of the whole place and just wanted to get out.
<br>Compared to an open world experience it was very limited. There were many places that were cut off for no reason other than they didn&apos;t want you to go there yet (e.g. a rock was in the way). You could no go where you wanted for most of the game for various reasons.
<br>Overall, I&apos;d give it a 2/10 as a game and a 9/10 as a story/novel experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6078627">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is centered around the plot, but the ending leaves you thinking &quot;Well, that was a whole bunch of nothing.&quot;
<br>
<br>Do not listen to the shills creaming their jeans, Firewatch is exceedingly mediocre.</span>

So first of all, gameplay. I liked to walk around the map for about 1-1,5 hours. Then it became really boring. I swear to god, at the final stages of the game I just wanted to teleport to the main objective. So I didn&apos;t really like the walk-to-point-a-and-then-to-point-b-gameplay. Now, story. Well, the story is indeed good but it&apos;s completely linear. You can say that you can choose different phrases to say while talking to Delilah using a radio but it doesn&apos;t really matter what you say.. It will bring you to the same path. Also, the game is very short. It took me about 4 hours to play it to the end. So yeah, it&apos;s a great game that you should try out. Not worth 20 bucks though. 6/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6085124">Expand</a></span>

The MC&apos;s backstory and as to why he became a Firewatcher is also interesting. The graphics are also pretty nice and the game gives you that comfortable feeling while playing it. There are also many interesting plot points brought up, and the halfway segment gets you emotionally invested as the duo finds out their being spied upon.
<br>
<br>Sadly this is where my praise for the game ends. There are so many interesting plot points such as the scattered snow gear, who Deliah was talking to over the other walkie talkie, the missing girls, and even the main plotline, they just go nowhere and the ending makes you feel empty as well. I understand the ending is telling you that you can&apos;t just simply run away from your problems, but when everything else in the game just went nowhere, the moral just feels weak and the story feels unfilling (and the fact that it technically wouldn&apos;t be running away since the MC&apos;s wife has Dementia and can&apos;t even remember him) Not to mention the various optimization issues such as framerate drops, constant crashes, frame skips which is just unacceptable at this moment in time. There is also the complete lack of gameplay elements; I understand this is a story based game but there could be at least be a puzzle or two. The dialogue choices barely matter at all and do not contribute to an ending, so if the choices don&apos;t matter, why even have them in the first place? Also, for a game that takes place in the wilderness, you only meet 3 animals in the entire game, and two of them are completely optional.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game or &quot;walking simulator&quot; is mediocre, it&apos;s not a bad game as it does have its good points, but it&apos;s not a good game as well as the optimization issues and the story choices hold it back. I personally think it would have been better if they just focused on the whole firewatching aspect and you meet interesting people and woodland creatures. Maybe some people might like this game, but I sure didn&apos;t and it&apos;s definetely not worth a full price purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6078064">Expand</a></span>

It builds up this big mystery and conspiracy only for it all to suddenly deflate and lead nowhere exciting.
<br>
<br>Just like Henry&apos;s relationship with Delilah. It just goes nowhere.
<br>
<br>The game pretends to be something it&apos;s not for the entirety of its length until the &quot;mystery&quot; is solved, which is going to annoy a lot of people.
<br>
<br>That being said, I still think it deserves a high score because although the destination sucked, the journey there was gorgeous and a lot of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6078030">Expand</a></span>

But towards the end something happened and all the mystery went poof. For story based game story felt too simple and straightforward with ending that didnt satisfy me at all. I hope next game from this company will bring a more indepth mystery.</span>

From the mundane conversations to the hollow and non-existent plot...this game may be what stops me from playing  games forever. I&apos;ve just finished it and it left such an empty feeling inside of me that I just don&apos;t want to touch video games for the foreseeable future. Thanks Firewatch.</span>

Every piece of dialogue between Henry and Delilah was something to look forward to as they conversed about the hardships of life. Through this, Firewatch explores the degradation of relationships and the tendency for escapism. This is accompanied by a very fitting ambient soundtrack and an occasional dose of wit and comedy. I thought the resolution to the mystery/thriller aspect was a bit contrived, and perhaps the setting could&apos;ve felt that more authentic if there was more wildlife and things to see and interact with, but on the whole I found Firewatch to be a fulfilling experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6910519">Expand</a></span>

The way the game is established is quite unique and whilst I don&apos;t think the choices made in that opening make any difference whatsoever, it is quite an interesting opening none the less, establishing the protagonist and his sad past. Unfortunately with a game like this the story is key, there is no real skill in the gameplay and whilst the environments are a joy to explore without something driving you through it&apos;s all for nothing. That said the story does a good job of driving you through the game, it&apos;s offers mystery and suspense, however the ending (explanation of the events) is utterly mundane and delivered in a very direct manner which counter acts the prior more subtle delivery methods on display in the rest of the game. Firewatch is part of an ever growing selection of exploration story games, and it adds some great things to the mix, but ultimately all of these games live and die on the story and unfortunately this one just doesn&apos;t round off well at all. In short you&apos;ll have fun playing it, but probably won&apos;t remember it with much fondness.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6088313">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game had &quot;something&quot; of an interesting premise at the start. Before actually taking control of the story, you read a series of text excerpts detailing the events leading up to the beginning of the game. However, as soon as we get into the game itself, you instantly become aware of the fact that the game is... well... nothing. Even by the standards of &quot;narrative driven&quot; games, this one just sucks. A clunky, confusing build up, that ultimately leads to a resolution that is simultaneously nonsensical and completely unsatisfying. That&apos;s what you&apos;re getting when you buy this game.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s nothing worse than a bad ending, and boy does this game deliver in that regard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=7526762">Expand</a></span>

<br>I would of given it higher but the developers also change their policy on streaming to whoever they please and have taken down streams using DMCA claims even though they clearly state on their website anyone can stream the game and even profit from it.</span>

It also does a good job at making you feel a variety of emotions based on what&apos;s going on at any given point. A spoiler-free note on the ending, I&apos;ve seen many criticisms of the plot and its conclusion, but almost all of those criticisms ignore every note from the prologue and the characters&apos; development. From the very start, as you craft Henry&apos;s backstory and get to know Delilah, Firewatch makes it very clear that there are no clean and easy paths in life. The sort of plot that most people seem to have wanted would have conflicted jarringly with Firewatch&apos;s entire philosophy.
<br>
<br>Firewatch is certainly not for everyone, it wasn&apos;t necessarily even great for me. But considering how many books that I&apos;ve started and never finished it&apos;s worth pointing out that I finished Firewatch, and did not regret the time put in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6089547">Expand</a></span>

<br>Overall the game was enjoyable with a great atmosphere, I spent a large portion of the game on edge, with a feeling that something terrible was about to happen to me. The audio was top notch with amazing voice work from all involved, especially the main characters themselves, this was definitely the high point of the game. Visually it was just OK, with some low quality assets and textures that just looked off at times. Technically once again just OK, being a Unity engine game it did have some jank like asset load stutter, hitching and random frame rate drops even when installed on a SSD with a PC capable of running the game maxed out at well north of 60fps, it&apos;s definitely not the worst Unity title I&apos;ve played, though.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m a big fan of this genre and I do recommend Firewatch if you are too but it&apos;s not the cream of the crop, for that you&apos;d want to play something like &quot;What Remains of Edith Finch&quot; which is just incredible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=7324386">Expand</a></span>

Maybe it&apos;s not all perfect, but who cares, nothing you&apos;ll ever love will be, and this game makes that case throughout, making this game quite often a truely moving experience.

It requires a certain maturity and attention span to play. Most cellphone-addicted teenagers wouldn&apos;t find this very interesting. It&apos;s a very short game, which is its best strength: it&apos;s great for casual gamers who want a fun experience without too much time commitment, but also a quick change of pace for most hardcore gamers out there. But if you&apos;re someone who wants a lot of content out of his game, you should probably skip this. This is all about the ambiance and the mystery.
<br>
<br>As someone who hasn&apos;t played a great many story-driven single player games, I found myself interested in this one. I didn&apos;t feel overwhelmed with things to do, because it&apos;s driven by a single &quot;quest&quot; every day, and you have a friendly voice guiding you. The mystery is effective. The ending is slightly disappointing, and you&apos;d have hoped of at least finding a picture of Delilah in her tower or something. When I saw that she wasn&apos;t there, I started thinking it had all been a lie, until I found her drawing. So the mystery does keep going until the very end.
<br>
<br>The biggest flaw with this game is how you can&apos;t go past certain objects and terrain elevation that looks like you easily could. It takes away from the immersion tremendously. The small list of actions gets repetitive as well. I would have liked to see a little bit of extra content/hidden areas that aren&apos;t related to the main story, and having the opportunity to explore the area that you can see a little more would have made this an absolutely amazing game.
<br>
<br>Despite its flaws, it&apos;s a gorgeous game with great voice acting and an effective, realistic mystery. Recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6088125">Expand</a></span>

<br>A very short game and very bad story, my advice would be to avoid this game.
<br>No replay value at all,l i also see that Anita Sarkeesian is in the end credits,that could explain why this game is a huge failure.</span>

The story is well told and very  intriguing. The only reason the game doesn&apos;t get 10 in rating is because it is a one time play through. At least in my opinion. But truly it is an amazing game Panic. Inc has created here :) Highly Recommend it...</span>

<br>
<br>-Background Music (7): There are hardly any music through the gameplay, what you heard is the sound of nature or the existence of yourself.
<br>
<br>-Plot (6): Many folks say that the game has a **** ending. THAT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU EXPLAIN THE STORY. Personally thinking, the story is pretty intense except the ending. And it lack of explanation or predictive things we expected. But overall the story itself is fine. Not satisfying but fine. Consider it is an indie.
<br>
<br>-Performance (7): I think my computer&apos;s spec is way higher than the recommendation. But the framerate sometimes drop to 40 fps. Considering there&apos;s nothing GPU intense scene, I think this is due to poor optimization. But overall it is fine.
<br>
<br>-Control (8): There&apos;s no unresponsive control. And the overall control design is fine.
<br>
<br>-Pros:
<br>//The comm system. It&apos;s very creative. And I enjoy the deep dialogue. And it&apos;s an important element in the game.
<br>//The entire firewatch concept is nice. A place without crowd and living with natural.
<br>//There&apos;re many thing trying to express during the gameplay. I think you should try it yourself and you will know what I&apos;m talking about.
<br>
<br>-Cons:
<br>//There&apos;re only one story and the dialogue you choose doesn&apos;t effect anything at all. Maybe it&apos;s because I played a few visual novel before. Then the dialogue may show nothing to some gamer.
<br>//To tell the truth, I don&apos;t spend much of time exploring. But the devs use the map just for story telling, which is kind of pity.
<br>//The lack of interactive around the environment and the collection. There are few things you can take, or it&apos;s meaningless to take it.
<br>
<br>-Overall: I will suggest you to play this game. It&apos;s kind of refreshing and creative.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6080543">Expand</a></span>

<br>Also. the ending, critisized by some, worked well in my opinion. It felt right. There doesn&apos;t need to be a payout or reward or whatever else some might have been expecting. In live, not everything pays out. Sometimes all you get are lessons learned.
<br>
<br>In any way, fantastic game. :) If you like well told stories then this is up there amongst the best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6086058">Expand</a></span>

But I wanted to mention that this game stays with you long after you have finished it. The experience was so immersive, that even 3-4 days after completing it I miss the characters and world it all happened in. I want to go back to my tower, look at the breathtaking view, push my walkie-talkie&apos;s button and ask Delilah: &quot;Hey, what&apos;s up?&quot; :)
<br>
<br>But what I am worried about is a new trend with players complaining about the cost of the game. Since everybody is downloading games on Steam, there are no more physical packages. So that kind of gives a feeling of games and money quickly moving both ways and some players feel that they always have to have a say on this subject. Steam has (too) consumer-friendly refund rules and some players have started to become vile and childish exploiting those rules.
<br>
<br>Good example is Firewatch. Some reviewers here say it is too short and it&apos;s not worth the asking price. That the &quot;fair&quot; asking price should be 2-3 times lower. How can someone judge if the price for a product is fair or not? If its too expensive don&apos;t buy it. If you bought it and didn&apos;t like, tough luck. That&apos;s life. Then in the future avoid games from the same developer. Same thing with movies and books. If the movie sucked then you don&apos;t go to movie theater&apos;s website complaining and claiming that instead of 8 bucks the ticket should have cost 2 bucks. If you saw your first Michael Bay movie and you think it was horrible, then suck it up and in the future don&apos;t go to another Michael Bay movie. It is that simple.
<br>
<br>Is there a manual how to evaluate games? Reading the negative reviews here it seems there is. First and most important criteria must be -  more hours of play equals a better game. If a game leaves you a deep impression then whats the difference if play time is 3 hours or 30 hours? My humble opinion is that the value of a game should be measured in the amount of positive emotion not in hours played. So if you didn&apos;t like the game, or you didn&apos;t understand it then just say so. It is ok to say that you didn&apos;t like the game. Complaining about short play time is absurd.
<br>
<br>And last but not least - this is a game for adults. By that I mean someone older than 14 :) Main driving force behind this game is a quite layered and somewhat complicated relationship between the main characters. Middle aged and older people are not really into games, that is changing, but slowly. So most reviewers are younger and you can really see that in the users reviews here. This game should be reviewed like a movie or a book. On that scale this game is a full 11 :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6129187">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>WIth all that said, I could look past it. However the biggest negative is the STORY! What a pathetic story for a game. I mean why spend all this time for something so minor and insignificant. I can tell you exactly what happened. They started with the art direction and this game was solely made with that in mind and the story game later. That&apos;s great and all until you realize how pointless it was and what a waste of time it all was. My advice for the developers...hire a better writer next time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firewatch/user-reviews?user_review_id=6099784">Expand</a></span>
