I&apos;ve been a gamer since the 70&apos;s and I&apos;ve never ever played a game that was so &quot;piss your pants&quot; scary. If you have a heart condition, think twice before buying it. Good God... The ones that make me jump are the ones that creep up on you, and suddenly they are right in your face(or arse). The controls feel very &quot;porty&quot; however, they work, and do their job. I think its more of Isaac&apos;s clumsy untrained motions rather than control lag. It does get a knock for that, even though I have corrected the issue by modifying some vid issues. So slight knock against the game for that. Otherwise, the quality of the production, story, and downright creepiness factor are a top act.

The action was great, the satisfying feel of tearing apart an alien with your power boots with that scream is just unforgettable.<br>As far as with the storyline, it&apos;s nothing breathtaking or amazing, but it definitely keeps you at the front (and, at the same amount, edge) of the seat until the last second of what happens.<br>The controls will take some time to get used to, and by the middle of the game you&apos;ll be shooting aliens like it&apos;s cutting butter with a knife, and by the end, you&apos;ll be ready for Dead Space 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=2103844">Expand</a></span>

If you did not like the game because of it&apos;s &quot;horrible controls&quot; or some other **** I will just say this one thing: You are doing it wrong. To enjoy &quot;Dead Space&quot; put the difficulty on the highest you can possibly manage (I played on hardest, best feel), get a good headset/speaker set and sit back, relax and get scared. I will admit, the game did drag a little on the end and sure the controls did take a little getting used to, but after all of this, if you look deep into it&apos;s core (like the Resident Evil 4 port to the pc) it&apos;s an amazing game. The scares are often great, the atmosphere is dark, grim and the entire feel of the game is just described in two words: &quot;Insanity&quot; and &quot;Loneliness&quot;. Just to be clear too, Dead Space 2 is not the same type of game. Dead Space 2 is a 7/10 for me. What they did with Dead Space 2 is that they took everything Dead Space did very, very well... And dulled it down. The feeling of being alone with nobody else around, it&apos;s gone in Dead Space 2. The very creepy and dark atmosphere, it&apos;s still there, just not that much, instead of being in an &quot;abandoned&quot; space ship you are in Dead Space 2 in one where the outbreak has just started. So my advice is; Pick up Dead Space 1 for all the scary and awesome bits and then get Dead Space 2 for the action.
<br>
<br>Expect lots of gory death in Dead Space. Expect to be scared in Dead Space. Expect a memorable story. Expect exactly what it&apos;s title says: Dead.

Gaming dynamics like dismemberment, holographic displays that keep you in the game even when accessing inventory and selective upgrading of your weapons always keeps the player interested. Plus I a have never seen such ridiculous amounts of gore like this, limbs fly all over the place and blood flows like water. On the difficulty side I&apos;d say you&apos;ll have to play the game on Hard otherwise it might be slightly too easy. Talking about the length of the game well, I finished it in about 15 hours and I was taking my time. Replayability factor is definitely there though, because after you finish the game, you unlock some goodies for a second play through and also unlock impossible difficulty. Controls were a non issue for me, if you&apos;ve played something like Mass Effect then you&apos;ll have a good idea of how it handles. In closing, Dead Space is a must play for any fans of gaming, particulary those that like a Sci-Fi horror setting .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=419464">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m going to spoil the very beginning of the game in this comment, but this part of the game reflects the entire game well. The beginning of the game is calm with a vague ominous feeling. This feeling is eased by the conversation between the crew members of the ship you&apos;re on. Various things are wrong with the ship your crew has come to repair, such as the absence of a ship captain or flight crew, but your groups leader is confident that everything is fine, and his voice acting and dialogue effectively reassure the player. Your crew begins to investigate the ship. It is empty. Your character, some kind of ship engineer, recieves his orders to get to work on repairs, your crew is there to repair, not investigate. You follow commands and are temporarily seperated from your group by a large glass window. Suddenly, the lights cut out and the doors around your crew lock. Horrifying, mutated monsters break through the vents below your crew. The lights are flickering on and off so you can only catch glimpses of the assailants, but those glimpses are enough to let you know that your crew doesn&apos;t stand a chance. They scream for you to run, and that is all you can do. The monsters hear you open the door as you try to escape. One of them breaks through a vent in the ceiling and starts to chase you. You run as fast as you can through the ship, making a break for the nearest elevator. As you run you can hear the creatures claws hit the ground directly behind you. It is clearly starting to gain on you. You finally make it to the elevator and turn around to slam the A button to close the door. You get your first full look at the creature. It looks like a human, only all of its limbs have been extended and the bones in its arms have formed into massive, razor sharp blades. It has no skin anymore and the muscles, bones, and blood are clearly visible. Its face is monstrous. The creature slashes at you and knocks you back into the elevator as the doors close. The creature pounds on the doors. This is where I breathed a huge sigh of relief. About five seconds pass. A bloody blade stabs through the slit between the elevator doors. Another blade follows. The doors are pried open to reveal the same creature that was chasing you. The doors lock into the open position. You know you&apos;re going to die. The creature knows it too. He pulls back his arms and juts out his head into the elevator, letting out a hideous scream. Suddenly the doors slam shut and smash the creatures neck. Its head falls into the elevator to lay next to your feet. The elevator reaches its destination. You don&apos;t know if your crew is alive, and you don&apos;t believe you will be alive for long. You set out to find a way to defend yourself, knowing full well that if one of those creatures finds you you are as good as dead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=421171">Expand</a></span>

This game has to be the best 3rd person shooter I have ever played. Scary as shit kept my on the edge of my chair the whole time. Love the monsters all of them esp the big ass one that has the ripped coat thats scary. Overall loved the game beat it 3 times and every time was better.</span>

The game itself is only scary if you expect it to play out like a Barbie game, and though it did give me the jibbers when an alien that I thought was dead took a decent chunk out of myu neck, I stopped being surprised by it after the 3rd one. But all of these criticisms I have for it I found easy to overlook because it played so well. I bought this for PS3 but also played it on PC at a friend&apos;s house, They are exactly the same, but it does play6 easier on the console. Both ways, the best way to kill aliens was to chop off a leg and stomp it to death.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=84005">Expand</a></span>

And I think it has elements that will appeal to most every type of gamer. First, it&apos;s a FPS, and it does that well. The weapons are amazingly creative, and while some may be turned off by the lack of traditional weapons like grenades and rocket launchers; don&apos;t be! You&apos;ll have much more fun using a spinning saw blade on a tether that rips through enemies. The game also has elements of an RPG, where you purchase upgrades and decide how to level up your character&apos;s suit or weapons. The game is also not really linear as there are oftentimes multiple ways to go and multiple missions to address. For people that like linearity, or if you simply get lost, there&apos;s a breadcrumbs option that highlights the route you should take. And I haven&apos;t had any issues with the controls--at any level. I find them to be intuitive and extremely responsive; I really have no idea what people are complaining about. This is really the perfect game. It&apos;s immersive, beautiful, addictive, very creepy, and it has elements that all types of gamers will love. The only downside is the activation DRM. But that&apos;s the idiot executives at EA&apos;s fault--not the developers or creative crew.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=419761">Expand</a></span>

The designers of this game should be given a lot of credit actually, because the way you move adds to the suspense of the game. Just ignore the mouse when you are using menus. This game is gorgeous, and MUCH BETTER than anything I&apos;ve see come out this year in the sci-fi arena. Forget complaining about DRM, this is a great game. (And I hate DRM!) ... you won&apos;t regret purchasing this.

It has the elements to make a great horror history and for keep you playing to unlock new things. The graphics are great, you really feel that you are in the space; the sounds are very good too, always very atmospheric to create the tension over you in every place of the ship. The creatures are creepy and some of them are fast and they coming for everywere, so you have to be ready all the time.

Speaking of which, it&apos;s supposed to be a really scary game, but I can&apos;t say it is. Not one time I was scared. Well, only one time I thought &quot;What the hell?&quot; when I entered a vacuum in space and an enemy suddenly hit me from behind a wall, but it didn&apos;t scare me. Other than that, often a sudden change in music or a roar from the enemy indicates that you are about to be ambushed. Not to mention that the area you are in will be in lockdown untill all enemies are complete, making it rather easy to know if there are still enemies left or not. The bosses look great, pretty epic. The last time I saw such fun bosses was in Crysis. Overall, the game is pretty enjoyable, and a good gameplay system. However, it only partly lives up to it&apos;s promises as it&apos;s factor for being scary is rather low.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=421642">Expand</a></span>

The way the controls operate is different but highly functional. The angle at which the camera is set above the right shoulder makes it extremely difficult to accurately orient yourself behind objects and usually had me moving about a foot too far to the left. Now usually this isn&apos;t a problem, but when that one foot is say...in front of a meteor shower that kills you instantly or in front of the exhaust from a spaceships main thrusters; it gets to be annoying reloading the game two or three times because the insight that maybe you need perspective to gauge distance effectively to not die didn&apos;t occur to the developers. The visuals are very good in this game, it offers some very unique and tense environments you&apos;d be hard pressed to see recreated elsewhere; the Zero-G segments are very cool and very accurate as is the vacuum segments. The sound is stellar in this game, I bring this up next because the vacuum segments are almost completely soundless, you can only hear your own breathing and some of the vibrations from your weapons on the outside of the suit. the rest of the sound production is extremely well done; from the horror orchestration to the scratching of claws behind double thick bulkheads it&apos;ll test your surround sound very well. Unfortunately, the worst part of the game is probably the storyline; it consists of a reason to bring you to the &quot;big scary space ship&quot; and the rest is composed of what awful place you have to go to find a computer component to open the next door. Any character development is split between the two bookends on either side of the actual game. I actually forgot why the main character was in this situation by the time I got to the end because it&apos;s never mentioned again until practically before the credits roll...and I beat the game in slightly less than eight hours on medium. The one furiously aggravating part about this game is that you are continuously separated from catching the &quot;bad guy&quot; by various windows throughout the game, CONSTANTLY. You will exit a room you just fixed only to the have the door lock and the &quot;bad guy&quot; appear on the inside of the room destroying everything you just did and belittling you while he does it and you just have to play along, criminally annoying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=744174">Expand</a></span>

For some reason the game came up with a lot of different things to do to get me on the edge of my chair, unlike the novelty scary games where you push buttons, lights go off and the same monster spawns behind you, over and over again... Also, they didn&apos;t make it pitch black 95% of the game, which is a very big plus. The HUD and other interactive items were brilliant, the graphics were pretty good, the sound effects and tense music was awesome and the variety in objectives, scenery, thrilling moments, weaponry and tactics were overall terrific. Replay value is maybe once to none, considering you know what&apos;s going to happen (roughly). Only big minus I&apos;d give, but doesn&apos;t have to do a lot with the game, is the DRM.

It&apos;s more of like a short film actually, it&apos;s about an hour and 15 minutes long but its gives you an idea about the events that lead up to you and your poor crew. They don&apos;t even see it coming. I was hooked from the moment i poped in the disc. The idea of no HUD is nice too. The replay value is second to none. Every subsequent time you start a new game you get to keep your upgraded weapons and armor!! A must have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=741700">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are very awesome and really get you into the game more. The sounds in the game make it really creepy to walk down a hall. The gameplay takes getting used to because you have to deal with looking behind the character the whole time. The story is very good and is not hard to follow. Its one of those games you have to play twice to fully understand everything. It is a great game and a perfect length for this type of game. I loved playing it!

If you have played games like resident evil, this game will seem familiar but different. There are times where you will constantly be looking behind you hoping an enemy is not sneaking up behind you and then you let your guard down and bam. Unlike most shooters were you aim and shoot for the head and the enemy is done, that&apos;s the last thing you want to aim for because the enemy will transform into something more deadlier. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the game, the constant tension will draw you into the game, the combat is great but can get a lil old toward the end, and the enemy&apos;s are great, The character you play may not ever speak a word but he does not need to. I think it&apos;s great how they incorporate the health bar on the spine of your character and the ammo count is project on the side of the gun, its nice that hud is simple and does not distract you from whats going on,If your a fan of sci fi movies such as the thing, and alien this is the game for you. There are some draw backs though, eventually you start to figure out where some enemies will spawn, wish there was more enemy types. I wish there were more weapons but the few that are there do an admirable job. There is not much other things to complain about this game, i think, is great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=1466388">Expand</a></span>

I would describe Dead Space as an atmospheric game, not a scary one (Amnesia: The Dark Descent, on the other hand, IS a scary game).  While I like this game overall, I can&apos;t rate it better than a 7 due to the motion sickness I experience from the camera movements.  The feeling of nausea it produces prevents me from rating the game higher than a 6.  Try the demo.  If you don&apos;t feel sick (literally) playing it, this game could be a 9 for you.  For me, it&apos;s a 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=2245929">Expand</a></span>

The fact that I only paid a few quid for it on Steam meant it didn&apos;t bother me as much, but they should have picked up on the control thing.<br><br>However, when Dead Space 2 came out I thought I would give it another try and decided to play as a console player, PC connected to the TV and using an Xbox controller. The controls took a little getting used to but then I soon got the hand of it. In a way slightly more difficult control method added to the atmosphere in a similar way that the Wii controls added to the Resident Evil 4 experience.<br>The game itself seemed incredibly long and is very atmospheric, it reminded me somewhat of Event Horizon and is very gory. Overall worth a punt if you are willing to make a few concessions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=1594786">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s also not scary at all, not sure who really found this scary. The challenge is turning your big, clumsy protagonist in the right direction in time, nothing more. The game is way too linear and the encounters are too predictable. It could probably have been good but it ends up being a much worse copy of Doom3.</span>

                                        <span>Dead Space is a good action game. It has a thrilling atmosphere even though it isn&apos;t so scary as I supposed it to be. Also dismembering large packs of grotesque monsters is very rewarding. Main drawbacks are controls (you can&apos;t use arrow keys to move e.g.) and mouse movement is unwieldy.</span>

Sure enough, a common problem with many console ports it seems is V-Sync related mouse lag, a real party pooper. I had it with Deus Ex Human Revolution (just used a 360 controller instead, no lag there) and sure enough I had it with Dead Space, however disabling V-Sync removed the lag and boosted the framerate quite significantly. There are a few jagged edges (the game doesn&apos;t allow variable anti-aliasing settings) but it still looks better than it does on the consoles, so I won&apos;t complain.<br><br>Technical issues aside, there are some interesting &apos;tributes&apos; to a certain 1999 classic, System Shock 2. Aside from the obvious setting similarities, and occasional gameplay comparisons that could be made, there are very significant parts of plot that are basically lifted from that older game (an entire mission on the hydroponics deck is basically the same as it appears in SS2), which isn&apos;t any great sin, but it&apos;s indicative of a generally derivative tone for the bulk of the game. The monsters are largely a mixture between the creature effects from John Carpenters film &apos;The Thing&apos;, and the Los Ganados from Resident Evil 4. Again, nothing terribly wrong with this, they are imaginatively rendered and truly gruesome, but still, not particularly original.<br><br>The games visuals are stunningly realised, the game is simply gorgeous. The atmosphere is unrelentingly pressurised, making the game deeply tense throughout, with many scares of the typically jumpy variety underpinned by genuine discomfort. The sound design is superb, with a cacophany of terrible screams, moans, rumblings and sounds of all things liquid bursting, popping and spilling everywhere. The weapons, though there are few of them, feel suitably powerful and quite capable all of them at dismembering enemies - though some rather rough physics tends to make body parts and other objects sort of flop and roll around quite comically, the high volume of blood and accompanying squishy noises tends to nullify any distraction this might cause.<br><br>The game is a reasonable length, though not particularly long, and reasonably challenging on &apos;Normal&apos; difficulty, though the learning curve is somewhat steep at the beginning (prepare to die often for the first hour or two), it balances out and eventually becomes perhaps a little easy once you get the hang of managing your weapons and ammunition properly.<br><br>Items are at first quite sparse, and upgrades (via &apos;power nodes&apos;) are a slow but sure process for weapons and your suit armour, but later in the game, when weapons are powered up, less ammunition is needed, and so you tend to end up with an abundance of it in my experience. There is something of an imbalance, but it is not dreadful - after all, despite the game becoming less plainly difficult, there are many sections that will still get your adrenaline pounding as some truly horrific creatures come bounding towards you, eyes-a-glowing.<br><br>So, a fun game, with some niggly flaws but on the whole there is little that could actually be described as being &apos;bad&apos; about the game, but it could be more original and there is room for improvement - of which, so far, Dead Space 2 has in some ways definitely fixed, but there are other things that the first game gets right that the sequel does not (I&apos;m past the half-way point already with DS2 after only maybe three or four hours worth - this game is definitely going to be over quickly, whereas DS1 is slower paced and more tense).<br><br>A very good game, but perhaps not quite original enough to be a true classic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=1832230">Expand</a></span>

As I booted up the campaign and got approximately 4 minutes into the game I began to ask myself, &quot;what sort of mad drunken sailor came up with the controls?&quot; Even with rebinding I found myself wobbling down corridors and frequently pressing keys I&apos;d always attributed as safety keys becoming a pain as Isaac would end up trying to force pull a necromorph towards me. Also as an aside, what sort of game outside of  strict RPGs doesn&apos;t allow you to jump?! But putting my initial frustrations aside I will say this, Deadspace delivers on the scare while keeping things entertaining enough to mask the generally linear game play. In my first go around of play I found out very early on that ammo and health become a rarity into the later levels and a restart later saw me utilizing the vault much more frequently in the stores to store precious ammo and other goodies for later undertakings. I found that the story-line was very compelling and the few plot twists late in the game, while potentially obvious to somebody more intuitive than myself, were quite welcome and enjoyable in a gaming scene where you can usually see conclusions coming a mile away. The range of weapons was quite good and while I chose not to use them due to the randomization of ammo drops based on your arsenal,  I found there were multiple ways to dismember and destroy. Overall once you can get used to the awkward controls (I&apos;d recommend going through the first level on easy to get yourself settled then restarting on a harder difficulty) the story line is interesting enough to keep you playing, the puzzles are just difficult enough for interest but not so hard that you&apos;re pulling your hair out trying to figure out what to do, and the game play (controls aside) is a good mix of fright and fight to keep you on your toes. Honestly, I was so curious to find out what happened to Isaac at the end of the first game that I had to go out and buy the second one! Generally a good game for the horror/sci-fi fans out there and the control issues were greatly improved for #2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=1819540">Expand</a></span>

Aside from the controls, the game was glorious. The detail in the levels and aliens were astounding. They didn&apos;t skimp on anything it seemed. The cinematic sequences were so well done. I loved dieing just so i could watch the aliens nom my face off. No 2 deaths were the same. This game also has a very high fear factor. It keeps you on edge the whole game. You never know whats gunna pop around that corner. If you can overlook the the slightly laggy controls, you&apos;ll definitely be able to enjoy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=2089954">Expand</a></span>

<br>Small range of weapons (I just used the initial weapon throughout the whole game) and many limbs to cut off. Gameplay is varied by zero gravity sections and some walk in open space.

<br>-Incredible sound and graphics
<br>
<br>I just can&apos;t recommend this game enough if you like shooters that require thinking and wise resource use.  Its a challenging game but very well crafted and is so enjoyable to play.  I would say to look for it on sale  got mine with DS2 for $10.  $5 for this game is such a complete steal.  If you missed the earlier sale I am sure that Steam will put it on sale again.  Would be worth $30 easily as I am 7 chapters in of 12 and have played for 13 hours and expect to play for at least another 10 hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=3187674">Expand</a></span>

<br>Now, plenty of people that gave lower marks here can agree with me that the controls are totally horrible. The camera angle is also a handicap for the player, and if I hate something, it&apos;s games that are difficult because they handicap the player, thus cheating in a way, and not because there are better or stronger enemies, which would be normal.
<br>On Easy I felt like Doom 3 on normal. The controls contributed to that and the camera&apos;s 3rd person POV  shoulder cam instead of GTA/Max Payne/Tomb Raider style 3rd person gameplay, which I love.
<br>As for the story, it&apos;s sort of like a B-movie which has the action stretched on over 9 hours. That&apos;s how long it took, 9 hours on easy. I wouldn&apos;t complain if they wouldn&apos;t have stretched it so much. Every time you completed a mission and were suddenly one step ahead BANG life support is off, or hull is breached, or your cat died. Something like that.
<br>And the ending was again stretched too much, just to create something difficult for the player, and delay the inevitable (which was using Cheat Engine to add ammo so that I never run out, frak the devs!). I kept finding credits, and stasis modules, and also those tiny microprocessors or power nodes, all of those being useless in the final level, where you don&apos;t have a store anymore to exchange them for money and then ammunition. Highly illogical and again a cheat from the AI/devs part.
<br>
<br>The only really positive side was the upgrade system for the armor, and maybe the environments.
<br>
<br>Also, this game is advertised as horror SF. It&apos;s not. It&apos;s just a bad SF, nothing horror besides some weird looking mutants.
<br>
<br>If you want a good SF horror, play DOOM 3 or any Alien versus Predator game. Hell, play Doom 1 and 2, they&apos;re a thousand times better than Dead Space. Another good option would be F.E.A.R. 1 and 2, which are really good in the horror shooter part. As for a good SF, try Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Star Wars Kotor or Mass Effect. They&apos;re not all shooters (the last two are RPGs), but they&apos;re much better. Just don&apos;t touch this thing, please, you will lose at least 9 hours in which you could have played Call of Duty.
<br>
<br>Yes, even Call of Duty, aka FIFA with guns (because it has a new instance each year) is better than this. And I haven&apos;t played Call of Duty since the 3rd Modern Warfare...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=3746484">Expand</a></span>

Dead Space provides this premise in one of the more memorable survival horror games of the generation.
<br>
<br>The gameplay of Dead Space is centered around Isaac utilizing everyday engineering tools to fight off the necromorphs not by simple chest shots, but by dismemberment which doles out more punishment. Using the third person control scheme, Dead Space&apos;s combat is extremely satisfying since every shot feels like it has impact and the dismemberment of enemies is  astounding in an audiovisual standpoint. Backing this up is the game&apos;s attempt to immerse you with the lack of a distracting HUD. Everything is displayed in real time or displayed on Isaac&apos;s person himself, increasing the immersion and tension twofold.
<br>
<br>The setting where the game takes place, the USG Ishimura, is a deeply interesting and terrifying place to explore but gods be damned if they don&apos;t have half of all the flickering lights in existence. Despite that, it is a believable place where people lived once and takes Isaac into countless memorable places. The necromorphs that inhabit this decrepit setting serves as the real star of Dead Space. They&apos;re expertly designed while being just as disturbing. The regenerator in particular served as an exciting setpiece with how it cannot be killed with conventional means forcing you to use the environment to dispose of it. Enemy encounter is well paced throughout the Ishimura although I wished there were a few more enemy types to vary the encounters a slight bit.
<br>
<br>The story which serves as the driving force of the game centers around Isaac Clarke navigating the Ishimura in search of his girlfriend Nicole, who is somewhere in the Necromorph infested ship. The story takes cues from films like Event Horizon and the original Alien by instilling a fear of both dread and mystery. While slightly on the predictable in terms of who double crosses who, the plot is enthralling and serves the mood and tone of the story incredibly well. Although I didn&apos;t enjoy the ending as much as I would like considering it ends too much like a horror film. The layer of intrigue and memos scattered about covey just enough information to the player to prod them about without getting too exposition heavy, though at one point the supposed villain delivers an unnecessary exposition dump. The characters that inhabit Dead Space deliver some eye rolling lines but behave appropriately for the given situation and their voice acting is well above average.
<br>
<br>Despite the number of praises I might have for the game, Dead Space fails to deliver in one key area: horror. The first few hours of Dead Space are without a doubt excruciatingly terrifying given that this is the player&apos;s first encounter with the Necromorphs supplemented by the phenomenal sound design, which is an excellent mix of ambient and panic. However, the game loses much of its horror towards its conclusion not as a result of non-terrifying enemies, but rather how you encounter them and the tools the game gives you. Playing Dead Space on normal was shockingly easy to get by and because of that, enemies don&apos;t terrify you if you don&apos;t fear dying in-game. This is added by the fact the game throws enemies at you like mad. It&apos;s important to convey horror by pacing the horror to build suspense, and instead Dead Space throws enemies at you whenever possible. It becomes predictable to guess where they may come about and because of this repetition, the horror aspect become almost a distant reality and makes way for the fun of the game, which becomes its saving grace.
<br>
<br>Dead Space failing in this cornerstone should not detract players from enjoying one of the finer survival horror games in a long time. The gameplay is excellent and gratifying backed by an upgrade system that encourages a second run (though the lack of changing difficulties is a bummer). The sound design is pitch perfect. The plot is interesting and ambitious, which caters an awesome setting to explore. Dead Space more than makes up its shortcoming by being that game in the unorthodox survival horror game which prioritizes fun over scares, and I&apos;m more than happy for that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=6902875">Expand</a></span>

The horror aspect is top notch leaving the thought in your mind that you are never safe while giving the actual encounters a special degree of unpredictability. Graphics are great, controls work fine, but it does get a little tiring seeing the same sections of the ship over and over. Dead Space is a solid 8, maybe a 9 if the combat was a little better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=3438108">Expand</a></span>

Also not a fan of the shallowness of the main character. He could&apos;ve been a robot with how cold his character was (except for the incredibly passionate foot stomp). The story? Eh. I started making up my own story. In mine, I was an alien exterminator hired to rid the ship of a pesky infestation with annoying clients that kept making me go above and beyond my duties with tasks they were to lazy to complete themselves. I know many love the game, but it&apos;s definitely not for me. Oh, and the port was horribly done, especially the keyboard and mouse controls. There were times where I had to hit the reload button several times to get the action going...even while standing around and doing absolutely nothing but hitting reload. Which brings me to another point, the reloading time (after dying) was horrendous! Made me play more carefully not because I wanted to avoid dying, but because I didn&apos;t want to wait for the full minute it takes to reload after. And yes, my computer goes above and beyond the requirements so certainly not the issue (many others have discussed this).
<br>
<br>Certainly better games out there that are worth 14-18 hours of time investment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=3959585">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is not so much scary as atmospheric and that&apos;s fine, although parts definitely were scary and there were a bunch of jump scares thrown in for good measure. It was just the right level of creepy for me, it kept me on my toes without giving me a heart attack.
<br>
<br>Dead Space is a very linear game, the wrong way is often blocked and it&apos;s impossible to get lost with the breadcrumb system which points you in the right direction, this is a scripted experience above all else, and a good one at that.  When playing on normal or above ammo is quite scarce and enemies are tough, often killing you in a few hits, however there is an easy difficulty which is very easy, you&apos;re basically the Terminator so if you just want to tag along for the ride then there&apos;s an option for you.
<br>
<br>The story is interesting and told well, and unlike a lot of games it ends well too. The main character isn&apos;t voiced which hurts immersion IMO, this is often a developer choice, just not one I agree with. All the other NPCs you encounter are voiced very well though, no poor performances to speak of.
<br>
<br>Overall it&apos;s a well made, story-driven experience with solid gameplay and mechanics that I definitely recommend. EA Access is currently &#xA3;3.99/month and the entire trilogy is available to you, that&apos;s how I played them and you also get access to a bunch of other great games like Titanfall 2 so it&apos;s a no brainer if you wish to start the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=7453211">Expand</a></span>

<br>At first I was very disappointed with the PC version. It was a horrible port with game breaking bugs; like **** up physics when your FPS is unlocked. Or the Vsync locking the FPS at just 30. I needed a 3rd party software to get the FPS stay at 60 just to make the game playable. That also fixed the issues with mouse, which alone were making the game unplayable.
<br>
<br>Once I got actually started with the game I was hooked instantly. Every step felt dangerous and enemies couldn&apos;t be stopped with a single bullet to the head. Overall the game play was decent, but controls were a bit clunky. While I kinda dislike quick-time events and **** something could have been done about stomping enemies or punching them, it felt pretty random and frustrating at times.. the lack of control.
<br>
<br>There were some puzzles in this game. Some them were fun, but challenging and some were just bad; simple, but with annoying mechanics. Overall they added some nice variation to the game.
<br>
<br>The game looked decent for a 360 port...there were times though where I wished they would have allowed PC to have much higher shadow resolution for example, but it wasn&apos;t too annoying except in a couple of scenes.
<br>
<br>I really liked the Ishimura as a location. It was dark and industrial. I didn&apos;t really like how scripted everything was though. There were times you see enemies lurking, but they&apos;re flagged as invulnerable. They also always come from the same spot with the same timing, so if you died you just get frustrated to repeat the same scripted stuff.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not a huge lore-geek, but I thought the writing was of good quality. There were also tapes and notes from the NPCs  to be found to add into that, for those who like to find more about the world.
<br>
<br>With all the issues in the rushed PC version I can&apos;t really give it more than 7. It was still worth the 4&#x20AC; or whatever it costed, but at 50&#x20AC; this game would have been very disappointing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=4407576">Expand</a></span>

The selling point of this game is neither horror nor disgusting, but the combination of these two plus a very challenging style of gameplay makes dead space really a game that can really catch every nerves of the player. Sometimes, many necromorphs (your enemies in the game) suddenly come in your face when you just about to relax, and the producers really know how to make the players &apos;suffer&apos;...and there are many technical object for you to complete, and some of them require you to work under zero gravity, where you even have to walk on the roof, and necromorphs may appears right in front of you, which really challenge your sense of dimension. Even in easy mode, the game is hard to play, thus makes me even more nervous when facing the necromorphs. The overall mood of the game is not too depressed, but there are so many things can scare you, and keep you nervous for every single second. The bonus is that you could even be more satisfied with your real life after playing this game, the reason is obvious. However, I don&apos;t recommend teens play this game, because it is too bloody and scary.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=2158723">Expand</a></span>

I see a lot of complaining about the PC port here but I found the game perfectly playable, just some getting used to at first (but it would be better with a wider view). The story is good and contains a few nice twists, the  graphics and environment designs are quite nice (I liked the fact that there&apos;s no hud), and no need of a super computer. I liked the &quot;no gravity&quot; gameplay, but it can get really  confusing as to finding the ground again and since you don&apos;t have a wide view (which is okay in small corridors) it is difficult to spot enemies. I found the objective track clever and very useful as it allows you to know exactly where to go. Being able to upgrade your equipment as you wish and to dispose your inventory as you see fit is quite nice. There&apos;s about 12 chapters in the game that takes around 1h to complete each.<br>So all in all, it&apos;s not the best game of all time nor is it a very innovative one but it is well achieved and worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=1704609">Expand</a></span>

Note 1st that I only play the campaign so my review does not cover PvP. Dead Space is a good shooter although somewhat limited in design but then again almost every new shooter is in its first incarnation. I played the game on the PC and had no issues with the install. I didnt even bother to update the game since it was working fine out of the box. Controls are intuitive except for the slow turn speed while aiming your gun. A few in game mouse adjustments and the problem was solved within acceptable tolerance. The only other issue I ran into is when you grab an item with telekinesis and run up to a wall with the item floating in front of you. This causes the camera to spin 90 to 180 degrees, and if you are in combat it can be disorienting. This however, was a very minor issue because once you realize that it only happens on wall collisions you simply stop running into walls... why you would run into a wall during combat is beyond my understanding but as long you stop doing that it is no longer an issue. I played the entire game without the camera spin being a problem after the 1st time I experienced and analyzed the issue. This problem is insanely over dramatized by reviewers here (grow up people).
<br>
<br>The Good :: The game does a lot of basic FPS stuff well like area specific damage, dismemberment as a part of strategy rather than just aesthetics, very interesting weapons each with their own unique advantage and disadvantage, an actual inventory system (not used to seeing this in FPS and I like it), an upgrade system for your guns, armor and abilities (almost like an RPG lite), and decent graphics and sound.
<br>
<br>The Bad :: Game design is good but its repetitive. Then again, shooters are basically all very repetitive and that is why it is not my favorite genre of games. You will quickly note that graphics are re-used in every chapter of the game and the enemy variety is actually fairly low with only about 6 different enemy types and a few bosses. Guns and abilities are also limited to only about 8 total (6 guns and two abilities) and although they are interesting, I would like to have seen even more but then again I am an RPG guy so anything less than 20 would probably be boring to me.
<br>
<br>The So So :: The story is cheesy and has been done to death and back but again, this is coming from a RPG gamer who puts a lot more weight into story than others. The game is supposed to be a horror survival... I personally did not find it scary in the least. They do include a lot of sudden attacks that just surprise you and enemies are designed and animated in a way that makes them awkward (like a horror movie) but at no time was I scared of an enemy once I noticed it. In fact, I found myself running towards enemies fairly often especially the baby aliens. The only time I ran away from enemies is when the small swarming things attacked in large numbers and that is only because I couldnt shoot them fast enough. The game is not that scary. I remember being more on edge playing FEAR although even that was not really all that scary. Then again I think movies like The Grudge are comedies...
<br>
<br>Overall a good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=4223366">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The camera view takes a little time to get used to but it serves the claustrophobic feeling the game has very well, it adds not detracts from the atmosphere.
<br>
<br>It also has a nice monster variety that requires you to use all your skills ( stasis and kinetics ) and a variety of weapons not just stick to one weapon.
<br>
<br>Add to that cool segments that break the typical gameplay ( zero-G, Vacuum, Asteroids shooting and even more mini-games ), ad the tightly engineered sound design ( probably one of the very few games that uses sound effect perfectly ) and you have a very fulfilling, immersive and engaging experience.
<br>
<br>And while the tasks also have variety some of them get slightly repetitive ( Issac fix that, Issac fetch this, ... ) i felt at some point that i&apos;m an errand boy, but still i enjoyed it very much cause every task requires you to face different difficulties and obstacles to do it.
<br>
<br>So the game is really awesome and enjoyable but there is still room for more improvements and additions, more varied locations ( like the colony  ) more mission variety and mini-games, more complex puzzles, et etc ... i hope DS2 will build on DS an improve all the good things in it ... if it did it will be a fantastic game just like DS is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=78057">Expand</a></span>

It suffers from all the symptoms: Low rez textures, Low FOV, frame cap at 30 fps (with v-sync on) and terrible&#x2026;.TERRIBLE controls.
<br>The Mouse and keyboard controls are half broken: The mouse in particular, if you enable v-sync the mouse will become extremely unresponsive and laggy. However, If you disable v-sync, and crank up the mouse sensitivity and mouse DPI to the max, you might end up with half usable controls, but the caveat is, a bit of screen tearing. But even if you do that, the mouse will still behave in a sluggish manner, especially when switching to aim mode.
<br>The keyboard controls aren&#x2019;t better also, sometimes the game will dismiss key inputs for no apparent reason, and the keymaping is also badly conceived.
<br>In resume, if you don&#x2019;t have a gamepad, prepare to die&#x2026; a lot, especially on the Boss fights, or when the game decides to throw hordes of necromorfs, at you, from all sides!
<br>Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, this game is NOT difficult, not even on hard mode, what makes it difficult is the terrible controls.
<br>The other thing about this game is that it&#x2019;s not a real survival/horror game, It tries to, really hard actually, but the problem is, survival horror is not about jump scares, but about building tension, and playing with your expectation. And this game rarely does that successfully; it overuses jumps scares too much, it&#x2019;s too predictable at times and a bit cheesy in the gore department, and in the survival department, let&#x2019;s just say you will rarely die from lack of ammo or med packs.
<br>However, Visceral did one thing really well: the sound design.
<br>The Story, is a Cross between Aliens and Resident Evil, in other words, a System Shock clone but without SHODAN :-(. The Story is not bad, but it&#x2019;s a bit too clich&#xE9; for my taste.
<br>The game is also a bit buggy, for example if you play on hard mode and reload a save by pressing continue on the main menu, the game will reset the difficulty to medium.
<br>So, is it a bad game? In my opinion, If you approach it like an Action/Horror third person shooter game, HELL NO, just don&#x2019;t play it with mouse and keyboard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=4098276">Expand</a></span>

I have heard over and over that this game is &quot;Resident Evil in space!&quot; and now I know that there was a reason behind my avoidance of Resident Evil my whole life.  This game is more like the Resident Evil in my couch: every time I sit down to play it, I immediately regret it, my eyes start to water, I start swearing, and I want to run from the room to escape the stench of this humongous pile of reeking feces.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=3277212">Expand</a></span>

The game is VERY hard to control though, it feels less like I&apos;m controlling a guy and more like I&apos;m driving a tank. The mushy controls however are half the reason the game is so intense since it&apos;s so hard to keep a good sense of situational awareness.</span>

It was the same &quot;scare&quot; tactic used way too many times. &quot;Oh look, a alien/creature, I wonder if it will get up once I walk by. Oh there is a vent too, wonder if I should worry.&quot; It was repetitive after the first 30mins of play. It also expects you to feel something about the guy you are supposedly running around as. There was no build up to he background, just a picture and a ship log? Something bad happened? You walk into a room on the &quot;problem&quot; ship with 2-8 people that are armed, and you are doing something that happened to corner you off from them and they all die(except for 2 people), but you are to do better and somehow survive with primitive tools compared to them? Why is he still alive after that? The aliens/creatures  feel bad for him? What kind of crap story is this so far? The whole room was killed off except for 2 people and you. After that and trying to give it a shot still I just stopped. I bought a bundle pack and have both ds1 and 2 but didn&apos;t even try 2. Compared to other games this one doesn&apos;t shine at all. The only thing scary about this game is the amount of praise it gets.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=2927701">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I can&apos;t believe it&apos;s a 2008 game, looks like a 1999 game, terrible graphics. I have a i7, 8GB RAM, Nvidia 560GTx, etc, no it&apos;s not performance issues, the game really sucks.</span>

As unbelievable as I have read over the years I&apos;m still not sure why Steam allows for their gamerscore to be allowed in what buyers see and see only before purchase unless one is to actually have a paid membership into a well versed gaming review site that is paid directly by gamers for gamers. Metacritic allows a pick of the hat magazines and websites to vote or tally their score into the final tally. Gamers of PC&apos;s are the beginning and the end of gaming! Trust me all you console flunkies whom have paid a mere $200 tops at a pawnshop to purchase your &quot;gaming ride&quot; as get to use those big big words of &quot;port&quot; and then you have the breath left or $20 bucks in your paycheck left to put together a hunk of AMD crap and expect us PC Gamers to allow you to stomp on our world in which gaming was created and trust me will take it back after mom and dad stop buying these type of games for you as the depression goes on in our global economy. Watch and see my friends that day will be here soon that EA and whom ever is left able to make games will be kissing my wallet again first and Sonic will be your console game of choice that month! Oh Yea! This game rocks and Metacritic grab those balls and stop picking the bottom of the barrel for gaming reviews, you have a great market saturation and a nice advertising money coming in and I would rethink whom I quote in the upcoming games this year of 2009 or well as Hellgate London will teach ya the golden parachutes will start coming down from the top!!!

Graphics are great, and although the camera angle was a bit strange at first, I really think it works.  I can&apos;t quite explain what it does for the game, but it&apos;s almost like it ironically makes you feel MORE like you&apos;re this guy.  In most 3rd-person games like this the camera angle is a pretty typical chase-cam or maybe in the case of games like Silent Hill something that changes or moves around during certain moments.  This game has made excellent use of the Unreal 3 Engine.  It looks amazing but doesn&apos;t place any strain on my hardware (8800GT).  In fact, it even let me record a full-resolution 1280x720 video in fraps without taking a noticeable fps hit.  The atmosphere is what really does it for this game.  I think it even gives games like Silent Hill 2, Doom 3 or STALKER a run for their money atmosphere-wise.  The lighting is spot-on, the slightly warm blurry tinge to the edges of things works well.  Graphically, this game isn&apos;t just great because it uses a modern engine and modern graphics.  It isn&apos;t just that it&apos;s a high resolution or there&apos;s lots of anti-aliasing and cheap tricks going on.  The developers clearly understand how to use lighting to set the mood.  The sound is amazing...the music is spot-on and there were some genuinely frightening moments in the game.  It&apos;s overall a very disturbing game that really brings to mind movies like Event Horizon.  They&apos;ve got the horror in space thing down pat here.  As for the plot, I don&apos;t really care too much.  Yeah, some of the other characters are a little mundane, but it&apos;s really really great single-player fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=78078">Expand</a></span>
