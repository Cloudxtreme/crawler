This time around, everyone expected a more refined version, with deeper features.  
<br>Unfortunately that didn&apos;t happen.  The game is (somehow) a resource hog - largely because of the &quot;patriotic glow&quot; on the map, and the animated bobble heads.  I have no idea why they would demand so many resources, but regardless.  
<br>Secondly, the game dynamics are pretty much exactly the same.  The same endorsements, the same political hires, mostly the same issues.  The determinations as to who is &quot;strong&quot; on what issue are still very arbitrary.  
<br>There are no debates.  There are no primaries.  There are very few questions on the &quot;TV Interviews&quot; that you can have.  There are no independent happenings or events that impact the campaign.  
<br>This game had great potential, but they didn&apos;t bother to actually act on it.  Sad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-political-machine-2008/user-reviews?user_review_id=73119">Expand</a></span>
