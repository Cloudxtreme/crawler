But for a console port, this game is excellent! Agreed, listening to Welcome to the Jungle can be tedious, however load times aren&apos;t too bad on my PC, possibly helped by skipping logging into an account - just hit backspace, as it shows when you&apos;re prompted to log in, just as you can choose not to install EA&apos;s Download manager when installing the game. As soon as I am in game, I hit the skip track song to get bring up a new track. The gameplay is exactly what I&apos;ve come to expect from a Burnout game - good, simple, fun! The PC controls work much better than I had expected, that is to say I crashed into walls/traffic/off cliffs no more than I would have with a PlayStation controller. I like the variety in what you can do... from straight out racing, to finding as many shortcuts as possible, smashing billboards, to finding and driving through the best/highest/longest jumps and chains of stunts. This is a game I will keep coming back to!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=421705">Expand</a></span>

Going online is a breeze with a menu system that you activate while driving, and lobbies where you also continue to drive between events. In fact the lobbies are just another way to play the game. Still unlocking new cars (and bikes), and finding new things to do after 30 hours of play means I will be playing this for a long time to come! This is the perfect example of how an open world game should play. Makes all other driving games feel outdated and predictable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=421699">Expand</a></span>

As far as gameplay is concerned, the game is a lot of fun, and I feel that the introduction of showtime more than makes up for the removal of aftertouch and crash mode. Rule the Road is an interesting feature, which, with a few friends online, will keep you up, running, and competing with them for top spot on different roads for hours and hours. The game life really is expanded by online play, with even more challenges to complete with and against your friends. My main complaint is the menu, it takes some time to get the hang of, and is not structured well towards the PC. Otherwise, if you picked up and enjoyed Burnout 3, with the exception of a few minor annoyances, you won&apos;t be disappointed with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=423361">Expand</a></span>

Racing has never been easier and finding a faster rout that the other computer cars are too stupid to take has never been more fun. and the keyboard controls DO NOT SUCK. They just need fixing. for example, boost needs to be space bar and e brake needs to be shift while showtime MUST be changed to d so you dont accidently press s all the time during a race and piss yourself off. For these minor problems which can be fixed with a little bit of brainpower, i give it a 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=423438">Expand</a></span>

The game does NOT make heavy use of &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; as he says. Instead the name of the song is &quot;Paradise City&quot; and it is only used as the opening song as the game loads up, big deal. :P lol In terms of performance, the game runs really good, that is if your computer isn&apos;t running on Windows Ancient Edition with only 10 Mb of RAM like Micah&apos;s does. I&apos;m running this game on an 8800GT with 4 gigs of RAM. The official LOW requirements list says that you need at LEAST one gig of RAM and a Pentium 4 processor running on Vista or XP and that&apos;s at the LOWEST. So if you don&apos;t have that or BETTER, then don&apos;t even try to play it. The controls on the keyboard are a little tedious so I would suggest either using one of those steering wheel peripherals or an Xbox 360 controller. The game play is actually pretty good, I only wish the activities around the city were a little more varied. Multiplayer and single player work together pretty flawlessly. And contrary to Micah&apos;s post, creating an online account takes less than a minute or so. And once you are signed up, the online play is pretty competitive and really fun. All-in-all, this game is a reminder of how games SHOULD be ported to the PC. If you&apos;re a racing fan or just like FUN games then this one is a blast. It has great game play, great graphics and fun online modes that will keep you entertained for countless hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=421696">Expand</a></span>

Criterion purport the idea of race events on a free roam map as something new, &quot;unlike any other driving experience&quot;, even though Need for Speed Underground 2 and Test Drive Unlimited had both done similar things prior to its release. All events are extremely easy, and with no difficulty option (at least not one I could find in the ill-conceived labyrinthine menu system), the game soon becomes very dull.
<br>
<br>In-game advertisements are a spit in the face from the developers. Perhaps it would be understandable if the game were free to play, or if it were trying to emulate a &quot;real world&quot;, but it&apos;s not. These were clearly only put in for profit, not an attempt at realism, since the game is set in a fictional city and none of the cars are licensed. I paid for the game  I don&apos;t want to see Burger King and EVGA advertisements while playing it.
<br>
<br>Various elements of the game are at cross-purposes with each other. Events are put at every intersection, supposedly to cut down on monotony and so there&apos;s never an event too far away, but the races aren&apos;t gated and the route isn&apos;t highlighted on the map as with other arcade racers, which means you have to open your map at the beginning of each race and spend time planning your route. You can&apos;t jump to events either, which, in the case of Burning Route events, often means you have to drive halfway across the map just to begin a race.
<br>
<br>On the topic of Burning Route events; the game boasts a range of 75 cars, when in actuality, in terms of unique vehicles there is about half that, with the other half being practically carbon-copies with different paint jobs which are rewarded after completing time trials. By the end of the game, you&apos;ll only be using about 3 of the cars anyway (the best in each category; stunt, aggression and speed), since the others are relatively useless.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack is awful. For reasons unknown to anyone but the developers, there are 3 different styles of music in this game; pop/rock songs, instrumental songs from the three previous Burnout games, and classical compositions. The loudness levels are not normalized either, which means that some songs are barely audible while others are quite loud. The &quot;CrashFM&quot; DJ is obnoxious and detestable.
<br>
<br>There are many other annoyances, but I think I&apos;ve made my point already. Does this game deserve a rating of 3/10? No, but it doesn&apos;t deserve the inflated rating of 7.6/10 either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=3500665">Expand</a></span>

Maybe it&apos;s not a real Burnout game, but it is still fun as hell and I can just recommend it. Just because it&apos;s such a great port I still give thise game a 10/10, even if it&apos;s not a real Burnout game.

<br>I was a fan of the old linear burnout games and I do miss selecting a mode and just going instead of driving around looking for missions I want to do as my favorite is road rage and least favorite is raced I also enjoy Marked man.
<br>
<br>For people looking for a racing game that feels like it has some innovation this isnt bad and coming from someone who doesn&apos;t care for the racing genre.
<br>
<br>I would give the game a higher score but its a console port with a wacky menu and carries the stench of EA as it repeatedly asked for my EA account information which yes I had one but it was only for the old republic which I no longer play and for reasons that do not matter here I do not like EA.
<br>
<br>Graphics are ok for its time kind of bland and lifeless for now.

The most important thing to mention is this is a good console to PC port, not buggy like others usually are. Very efficiently coded, lots of fun to be had.</span>

This was very nicely ported to the PC, not buggy, just a perfect game. But make sure to have a computer to run this game or else loading screens can take up to minutes at a time. Though, my only complaint is the lack of support towards the PC version. They stop updating the PC version after the &quot;Boost Specials&quot; pack was released, and then shut down the store in October 2010, by my understanding. So if you&apos;re a person wanting to have access to the game&apos;s DLC, buy it for Xbox360 or PS3. Otherwise, a true masterpiece!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=2459227">Expand</a></span>

<br>&gt; PROS
The world is pretty big and heterogeneous, maybe just with a bit too much &quot;shortcuts&quot;.
Cars are either accurate (I felt like I was driving a proper Lancer) or funny (in a good way).
Challenges are as they should be, easy at start and hard (but still not insane) toward the end of the game.

<br>The world is pretty big and heterogeneous, maybe just with a bit too much &quot;shortcuts&quot;.
<br>Cars are either accurate (I felt like I was driving a proper Lancer) or funny (in a good way).
<br>Challenges are as they should be, easy at start and hard (but still not insane) toward the end of the game.
<br>You get to listen even classical music on the &quot;radio&quot; and so music is good...
<br>
<br>&gt; CONS
<br>Sadly the login/login-server system is a huge mess (couldn&apos;t ever connect to game-servers because the game crashed if I tried so).
<br>Running through the city is fun but not being able to pick a race without moving to the starting location &quot;manually&quot; is a bit stressing after 5+ total hours played. Also, to compete &quot;equally&quot; in every type of race you have often to change your current car for another (moving to one of the &quot;bases&quot;)... additional stress.
<br>The menu system is just plainly wrong and confusing.
<br>
<br>To recap, the game itself is quite good and enjoyable but it&apos;s still a console port and most of the cons come from that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=4391366">Expand</a></span>

The choice in music was so so, but I just muted the music and played my iTunes over it. For the people who say they hate GNR... that&apos;s your opinion, if you don&apos;t like them then remove it.

I spent more time sitting through videos (and listening to Paradise City from GNR play over and over) that I was not able to skip than I did actually playing. That is how much this game pissed me off. If I would have actually spent money on it I think I would of lost my  mind.</span>

<br>This is a guideline for how to properly review games. Many reviewers like to get a &#x201C;feel&#x201D; for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score.
<br>
<br>The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no &#x201C;half&#x201D; or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal.
<br>
<br>The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing.
<br>
<br>Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, if a game has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a &#x201C;feature quota&#x201D;. Games that excel in both areas of a section don&#x2019;t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section
<br>
<br>The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the &#x201C;wildcard&#x201D; section. This section is for how the reviewer &#x201C;feels&#x201D; about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=3797138">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As for what you get in the game, the beginning cut scenes are completely unnecessary and explain nothing you can&apos;t see on screen, as they do not relate to either a story or character you would expect them to be a sort of tutorial. They also cannot be skipped.
<br>The controls are not obvious and as previously stated, there does not seem to be a way to consult the game to find out how to play. What is even worse is that since you can&apos;t alt-tab out (Can&apos;t even access the Task Manager), you can&apos;t look up the controls on the internet either. The car you start off with is also rather ugly and caters to people who think a large exhaust pipe and spoilers are cool when driving slower than 250Km/h.
<br>
<br>Overall impression? A terribly designed game that caters to boy racers you would expect to call the police on, not a decent racing game in the slightest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=4191349">Expand</a></span>

The game probably gets a 5. The graphics are good but pretty standard for a modern racing game. The soundtrack has a few good tracks but mostly sucks. They have about an hours worth of classical music for no good reason. Anyone who says this was a quality port is lying to you. This was a very lazy job, the menus are completely designed for a controller and make no use of the mouse. You have to press F1 and F2 to switch between menus this took me 5 minutes to discover. The cut-scenes are constant, useless, and unskipable. You will want to punch the &quot;Radio DJ&quot; in the face the first time you hear him and it only get&apos;s worse from there. Probably the worst part of the game is the handling of the cars. It&apos;s about on par with GTA which is sad for a game whose only purpose is driving. The races are extremely easy. The only time you will lose is if you go the wrong way or crash a lot, and even then you will usually win. All in all the game can be fun at times, it&apos;s good for a 10 minute break of mindless crashing, but there isn&apos;t much meat here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=2256629">Expand</a></span>

To me, the Burnout series has been about driving skill, quick reactions and has always provided adrenaline fuelled moments. But I feel these things have been put on the back burner to route finding and city memorization. I don&apos;t have the time to learn all the streets of yet another virtual city, and so I often lose races simply because I took a wrong turn. The map is very small and there are no visual clues in the city that show a suggested route you could take to get to your goal. Temporary road markers would be fine, anything so I don&apos;t have to learn the entire city just to know which way I should be going. Which way to go is not something I want to consider when playing an arcade style racing games. And you have to drive around looking for things to do, I don&apos;t have time for this! Just let me select from a list.
<br>You got a new a new car delivered to the junkyard!  Great! Where is it? No idea. You know what, I&apos;m not going to go to the map, try and work out which icon is the junk yard, meticulously memorize a route to get there (as I couldn&apos;t find a way to set way points). I&apos;m not going to do that. I&apos;ll just not play any more.
<br>
<br>If open-world city racing sounds like fun to you and you have time on your hands, you&apos;ll probably love it. If, like me, you don&apos;t have a whole lot of time to burn and you just want to get straight into some no-nonsense racing, I would avoid it.
<br>
<br>Also, the store is never available, and I don&apos;t know why. It teases you me content I can&apos;t actually buy, even if i wanted to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=3523483">Expand</a></span>

While the racing parts are still just as good as burnout 3 I am getting that feeling of dissapointment with this version as it starts reminding of some of the need for speed games that got boring real quick. Maybe its because they borrowed some of the need for speed develpoers :) but if there is another sequel to come please bring us crash mode back and stop the repetivness (fillers to make the game seem longer, another typicall EA strategy) and put some real work into it this time. Taking out crash mode is like buying a Challenger without the Hemi... whats the point :) Think I will go play some Burnout 3 now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=424626">Expand</a></span>

If it does then maybe this wont be like licking a dead dogs anus to you. To me, it&apos;s kind of like being trapped in a city of ripe and festering cheese that&apos;s slowly weeping onto the top of my noggin. Call we weird but I don&apos;t want to pay for that, that&apos;s not my thing.</span>

After I got this games I was so happy, because when you race it&apos;s completely open world. Althought it is a little challenging that they made the races open world. I really didn&apos;t like party mode. The campaign is very long, and it&apos;s really worth your money. This games is WAY off realism, this game isn&apos;t even close to bieng realistic, so if your someone who&apos;s trying to find a game with realism this really won&apos;t be the game for you. Althought if you want a game that has action, challenging moments, and extreme fun, this game will totally be for you. So far this is the best racing game I have ever played so far. The graphics for a 2009 game are just amzaing. The PC controls are a little quirky and not very smooth. Luckily I was able to hook up my PS3 Controller to my PC, and play Burnout Paradise with it. Overall I would give it 9 stars out of ten. Because I was really looking forward to party mode, but sadly it seemed to be that the developers payed WAY more attention to the campaign then the party mode. Again the PC controlles are a little quircky , so thats why I hooked up my PC controller to my PC.
<br>
<br>Overall it&apos;s one of the best racing games ever in my opinion. I&apos;ve never had this much fun with Burnout Paradise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=2680487">Expand</a></span>

<br>And where unlocking a new car should be cool and rewarding, it&apos;s annoying because of the 2  15 seconds presentation just to say &quot;congrats you unlock a car&quot; that you CAN&apos;T SKIP!
<br>Graphics are kinda nice, but lake imagination. Otherwise, controls SUCKS, and the gameplay is AWFUL (lose a race? gotta go back to the beginning, because the menu will not give you the option to stop it or restart or anything...). Way too much slow-mo.
<br>It may not deserve a 0, but no more than 3, and seeing all the other 10 or 9 and the description, I&apos;ll just guess some EA or criterion dev post these comments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=3453177">Expand</a></span>

If you are angry, or sad, just turn on the PC and play some races in Moto Racer, and you&apos;ll see what I mean. And this is what I feel with this burnout. It&apos;s just so much fun to jump around everywhere, doing stunts and making other drivers crash. And Paradise City is an awesome place, with a mediocre soundtrack, unfortunately. I would prefer some classic rock or heavy metal, but there&apos;s Guns N&apos; Roses, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, Faith no More and some other cool artists. And yes, classical music is awesome to drive while wrecking and blowing the **** of the city.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=4777774">Expand</a></span>

I mention this because practically the entire song plays out as the game loads after you launch it. I would say that the loading takes at least two minutes for me, then there&apos;s some strange problems I won&apos;t even bother to discuss in detail, and then the game starts -- kind of. Usually I have to sit and watch some kind of video about different vehicles. Keyboard controls aren&apos;t terribly good, and whoever wrote the in-game tutorial seemingly got the order of the brake and afterburner buttons switched around. Oh, and it requires that you create an account before you can play. More tedium. And it has crashed my PC one of the two times I&apos;ve had enough downtime to play it. And now I&apos;m trying to uninstall it (sigh) and it can&apos;t even do that in a timely manner. And it installs some EA Download manager that runs when Windows boots. And ... the list goes on. It might be a fine console game, but the port seems terrible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=421630">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> This game is a mediocre game with a crappy port to the pc. I tried this game on four PCs before I found one it didn&apos;t crash on. I logged a bug with criterion which seemed to be ignored. Perhaps on a console this would be a 5, but for anyone who has played PC games for long this is a stinker</span>

What made me most annoyed was the races has been slowed down as a normal racing game. I remember burnout to be the super fast racing game, that actually was and felt fast in comparison to something like Need For Speed. Another thing that&apos;s annoying is the open world, it&apos;s like comparing Need For Speed Underground with Underground 2. Open-world racing games gets extremely BORING after a while (it&apos;s fun in the beginning). Then on top of all, you can&apos;t not restart a race in burnout paradise WTF.

It&apos;s a real shame because it just feels like the devs spent all their time building the best foundation they could possibly make and then failed to build anything on top of it. The core elements of the game - the way the cars drive, the hilarious (and anti-realistic) physics, the sense of speed the game is capable of creating - 100% genius, seriously. But this game is crippled by a lack of content (there are only like 6 races in the game despite the 100&apos;s of events at all of the different intersections, and racing is the only thing most people want to do in this game) despite the large size of the city, and its console roots. The interface is terrible for a PC game - sometimes it just simply will not work unless you use your keyboard. I haven&apos;t figured out how to get the multiplayer working, but if it was easier, I could play this game with my Steam friends and that would be awesome (assuming there was more content to work with). Stock key bindings are garbage - stick to the GTA IV layout and put boost on shift - so much easier.
<br>
<br>In terms of playing the game, I agree with other reviewers, having to navigate and drive at the same time is slightly more frustrating than it is rewarding. In rally sport, drivers are not expected to navigate at the same time, and in Formula 1, the track is a single route, like Burnout 3 Takedown. It makes the game mentally challenging in a non-traditional way. Missing a turn isn&apos;t necessarily the end of the world, as the city is grid-like enough that you can afford to, but it &quot;breaks immersion&quot; as they say, to have to bring up the map mid-race and sit there and carefully plot your moves (since the minimap is almost useless).
<br>
<br>Overall, I have to say, this is such a great game, but I&apos;ve put about 4 hours into it and that&apos;s about all I can do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=3935244">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Want realistic racing, or expect something like the older Burnout games then don&apos;t buy.
<br>If you want one of the best arcade racing games out there then this is a must buy.
<br>
<br>P.S. I own this game on both the PS3 and PC.  PC Graphics slightly better than PS3, both versions are great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=4297240">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is not quite what I was expecting. It&apos;s very different to what I thought it would be. That&apos;s not to say some of the changes are not for the better, but on the other hand, some aren&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Graphics look brilliant, and the cars still have that same Burnout &quot;feel&quot; to them. The game modes all make a return too - but this time in an open world map. Think NFSU 2 and you will be on the right tracks. This is great, but you seem to spent a lot of time driving around for no reason. I would much prefer to just race and perform the stages without this unnecessary addition. The races themselves also suffer from the same problem of being given too much freedom - you will accidentally go the wrong way because you are concentrating on driving and not constantly looking at the map.
<br>
<br>O yes, and no 2 player split screen? Not good :-(
<br>
<br>Bar the problems I have with it though, it&apos;s still a good game. Burnout fans will find something to their liking here.

The city is big and fun to explore. There are some &quot;collectibles&quot;  for the player to find which is always nice. The cars handles for the most part pretty good and the visuals are nice. What burnout lack however is variety. There aren&apos;t a whole lot of different tracks and the campaign is based around playing the same track over and over again against tougher opponents. Which gets a bit repetitive. The fact that there aren&apos;t a whole lot of different racing modes doesn&apos;t help. Some other stuff i am missing in the game is the option to restart a race during or after the race, turning off the cinematic view and the option to fast travel to the racing event.The game is still an enjoyable racing game and if you are looking for an arcade racing game for a couple of hours fun then burnout is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=2893712">Expand</a></span>

<br>First, I&apos;ll give a short review:
The graphics are stunning, and that&apos;s pretty much all you can say about the graphics.
The slow-motion crashes never get old, since they happen throughout the massive map, so even if you get the same type of crash, you&apos;ll be getting the crash in a different way/reason throughout the game.</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Both a review and a response to &apos;Captain Murph&apos; that gave it a 0.

<br>First, I&apos;ll give a short review:
<br>The graphics are stunning, and that&apos;s pretty much all you can say about the graphics.
<br>The slow-motion crashes never get old, since they happen throughout the massive map, so even if you get the same type of crash, you&apos;ll be getting the crash in a different way/reason throughout the game.
<br>The game play is fast paced, and even for messing around, you&apos;ll be able to have hours of fun. If you play it for long enough, and learn the street names, you&apos;ll be able to find your way around the map without the use of a mini-map at all. The different types of cars are awesome since each car is for different playstyles, which adds even more fun to the game.  I do however wish that there was more in-depth customization; it would compliment the amazing graphics that the game features.
<br>
<br>In response to CaptainMurph:
<br>
<br>First off, he rated it a 0 simply because his opinions have convinced himself that he&apos;s the only one that&apos;s right when it comes to the quality of this game. But you can already probably tell by just reading his review  that everything he wrote is based on his preferences and opinions alone, as opposed to facts.
<br>
<br>A portion of his review is him criticizing the lack of mouse control and how it is designed for a controller. The fact that he expects racing games to be optimized for keyboards is stupid in itself, and even then, if he plans on playing the game by remaining in the menu the entire time, then what he says is still stupid.
<br>
<br>With the music and radio that HE doesn&apos;t like, you can just turn them off in the settings, which obviously is too difficult for him if he can&apos;t spend 10 seconds navigating to the &apos;options&apos; in the menu.
<br>
<br>The handling of the cars is nothing like GTA; if you&apos;re able to drift for 30 seconds+ in GTA, then he is still wrong, since the other aspects of the mechanics are different from GTA. If you&apos;re reviewing this game, you already know that.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d like to finish by noting that when he said  &quot; The only time you will lose is if you go the wrong way or crash a lot, and even then you will usually win.&quot;, he displayed a perfect example of contradicting yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=4919639">Expand</a></span>

<br>The free run mode is the only nice thing.

It means you have to stare at the map all the time when you&apos;re racing so you can&apos;t focus on what&apos;s happening on the screen. The best element of Burnout 3 - Aftertouch got removed. You have to buy extra DLCs for a bunch of cars that aren&apos;t included in THE ULTIMATE BOX. Don&apos;t call it ULTIMATE if you aren&apos;t including all DLCs in it! The pop punk soundtrack is still annoying.
<br>
<br>That said, I enjoyed it a lot. Very disappointed hat EA is not going to let Criterion make another Burnout game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=6542180">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Paradise is an excellent arcade racer with all the Burnout DNA in open world setting. Game plays smoothly, controls work wonderfully even on kboard and overall PC version is done very well, kudos to Criterion. One small but for me cool option was the matching game time to your local PC&apos;s time, it was kinda cool playing at night irl and having night in game aswell, havent played any other open world game that does that which is a shame. As for cars, theyre designed beautifully and sound aggressive with fine detail as hell, like it should in every self respecting arcade racer. Bike riding was also done really well, imo better than some full blown bike racing games. Paradise city itself is pretty detailed and interesting place to explore with insane jumps and stunt locations, having for the time great graphics. Crashing your car and crushing your competition is always fun, maybe after some time gets bit too repetative.
<br>
<br>Only real shame is that EA shut down game&apos;s servers, never got to enjoy the MP carnage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box/user-reviews?user_review_id=6784313">Expand</a></span>
