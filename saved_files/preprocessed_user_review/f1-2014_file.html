If this game was given a discount it would be just about acceptable because at the end of the day you expect to pay for the effort they put into producing the game which in this case should have cost a tenner. I really hope they are throwing all their manpower and resources at 2015 because this was a very poor effort.</span>

The cars are very planted through corners (almost as planted as on F1 2013) and the cars only experience sliding through slow corners and on the exit of hairpins when you apply the throttle. In my opinion, the wheelspin doesn&apos;t feel accurate and realistic, neither does the handling. The car is far too easy to drive. Handing: 3/5
<br>
<br>Another problem with the game is that pad and wheel users have significantly different experiences whilst playing the game, due to artificial advantages given to the gamepad. These advantages include extra traction and less oversteer, although slightly more understeer. In wet conditions, this renders pad users roughly 1-2 seconds quicker than wheel users. Wheel and pad users should be equal on track, but they aren&apos;t.
<br>
<br>The online experience has not been improved over F1 2013, with desync and lag hits common during races. For some reason, it seems worse on this game than on F1 2013. The sidepod glitch of previous games is also in this game. The lag and glitches ruin the chance to have a close battle with someone else during races.
<br>
<br>The graphics are slightly improved and the car models are relatively good, giving a realistic rendition of the 2014 F1 cars. The tracks are also modelled well, although some glitches with kerbs and barriers exist on some tracks. Graphics: 4/5.
<br>
<br>The AI in singleplayer are still poor, forming trains during races and backing out of overtakes during every opportunity. The AI also have a pace advantage during some conditions as they run different assists compared to the player.
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;d give this game 3/10. The experience of racing isn&apos;t great, but Codemasters could improve if they remove glitches and make the cars more realistic to drive. Despite this, the game looks graphically appealing and the cars look good on track.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve put 150 hours into this game so I&apos;d thought I&apos;d write a review, giving my honest thoughts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/f1-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=5240320">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The only letdown for me is the lack of classic content, 2013&apos;s iteration had some classic cars from the 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s that were very interesting (and fun) to drive but this title lacks that classic content. Perhaps there was a good reason but it still is some thing that is missed.
<br>
<br>Overall, if you are looking for a game that reinvents the wheel, perhaps you should not ask that of a game based on a sport. F1 2014 gives you the 2014 cars on the 2014 tracks, I am not sure what everyone else was really expecting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/f1-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=4876311">Expand</a></span>

I own all F1 games from Codemasters, and I consider this iteration of simcade F1 cars to be the most challenging, interesting, and enjoyable to drive.
<br>
<br>The biggest difference?  If you push too hard into a turn and slam the brakes in a desperate attempt to still hit the apex, the front wheels DO NOT lockup and the cars DO NOT understeer straight off the track.  Instead the cars have braking oversteer which can lead to a 4-tire-drift around the apex, which requires accurate throttle/brake input and appropriate steering to correct and minimize the time lost.  That&apos;s right, these F1 cars like to drift under aggressive deceleration.  And that is incredibly more fun than locking up the Pirilli&apos;s and cutting a chicane to regain control and speed.  Is it accurate to the real motorsport?  Perhaps not, but it&apos;s considerably more fun.
<br>
<br>Second biggest difference: Holy crap, the torque.  I haven&apos;t driven every car yet, but if you load up that rear axle mid turn on a sweeper while pounding up through the gears, full throttle will result in lighting up the rear tires.  Throttle control is critical; turns that were flat in F1 2013 now require some throttle manipulation to keep the car on the a fast racing line.  You can also go deep into the rev&apos;s without losing too much acceleration, a pleasant situation because the gear ratios are fixed.
<br>
<br>Why are people not talking about these improvements to car handling and the positive impact it has on the gameplay?  I imagine most people use a joypad, and I don&apos;t know how these changes translate a stick and a couple triggers.  Or if they have a wheel and pedal setup, they keep some driving assists on, completely negating the fun of pushing the fastest cars in the world while exploring the limits of grip.
<br>
<br>As for what everyone else is saying:  Yes, in general there is less content and Codemasters should have anticipated this response.  But if you have the racing peripherals and the skills to drive with all assists off, you will be surprised at how much fun it is to toss a Codies F1&apos;14 car around the race tracks.

<br>It&apos;s only 7 because unlike the previous versions I&apos;ve played, 2010 being the worst for a specific problem in gameplay, the game runs like a damned charm. It&apos;s about time it did too. Whatever Codemasters have been up to for it to disappointingly bork the framerate so unnecessarily is beyond me, and clearly they&apos;ve done something to fix that.
<br>
<br>I am disappointed however, in the lack of the familiar environments of the paddock, complete with it&apos;s (albeit not quite well drawn) ladies being photographed and it&apos;s journalists looking to get some answers from someone who clearly isn&apos;t you most of the time.
<br>I am also disappointed by the blatant cut scene copying. A victory in a short grand prix race revealed a cut scene that was ripped straight from it&apos;s predecessor, which kind of ruined it, and fell short of expectations. Sure, it&apos;s not really about the FMVs for some people, but it always will be for me, and I like to see some differences when a particular type of game follows the same topic (like all the FIFA games, all the NHL games, all the NBA games, etc etc). It adds to the novelty value of a game that otherwise would simply be largely repetitive, and not changing the cut scenes to something different seems to have made it more repetitive than it needs to be.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not a blinding disappointment, smooth gameplay, even on high settings with a mid to high end system makes it a pleasure to play.
<br>The new game modes I haven&apos;t tried yet, but they do look promising. The only thing that really let this game down was the cut scenes, which is a great shame. If they can improve on those, and keep the framerate from being so clunky like it was in previous versions, the next version could be perfect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/f1-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=4605917">Expand</a></span>
