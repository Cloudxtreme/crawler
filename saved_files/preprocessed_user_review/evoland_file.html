There is absolutely no story and no message--that is unless the story is that the author has played a few RPGs over the years and he also remembers some of the mechanics from those games.  The experience can be described as  &quot;walk a little and then we mention something RPGs used to have&quot;.   Evoland fails to deliver, or even propose, as much as a single aesthetic other than this.
<br>
<br>What&apos;s more is that the creators of Evoland have managed to reference this list of RPG mechanics and then fully divorce them from the reason we played the games that originally used them.  Sure, these mechanics were present In the original works that inspired Evoland.  However, in those works, we had a reason to fight the random battles, we had a reason to pick up the first sword, we had a reason to visit a village.  In Evoland, these mechanics serve no purpose other than for the sake of listing them.
<br>
<br>A lot of game makers have made the mistake of analyzing a successful game and concluding that the game&apos;s success is only due to the mechanics that make up the game.  When a game maker tries to follow a &quot;formula&quot; in this manner but also fails to adequately serve any aesthetic, then you have a guaranteed bad game because the audience will not have a reason to engage in any of those mechanics.  I thought since Evoland was supposed to be a nod to the history of RPG mechanics, that it would naturally avoid this pitfall by using those mechanics as a means to remind us why we played those old RPGs in the first place.  Sadly, it&apos;s just a rote list of disembodied RPG mechanics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evoland/user-reviews?user_review_id=3090495">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s like an RPG, but instead of upgrading your character, you upgrade the game itself. For instance, you might unlock &quot;256 bit color&quot; as opposed to 16 bit, or &quot;free roaming&quot; as opposed to moving along a grid. Some areas even allow you to cycle from modern graphics/mechanics to older ones, allowing you to bypass some limitations introduced in more modern games. This makes for a very interesting and enjoyable way to solve puzzles.
<br>
<br>You progressively move from a sidescroller to a game like Torchlight or Diablo, without lingering on one particular thing; except for random-encounters. Random-encounters appear literally every few seconds in specific portions (mainly fast-travel) of the game-- and it&apos;s terribly boring. The whole point of the game is to continue moving from one thing to another, except for some odd reason they decided to keep those through the entire game. Now, sometimes they&apos;re fun, but the main character only has one attack for the better part of the game. This really discourages exploration-- and it takes a lot of time, mainly because you are granted a mini-map very late in the game. (It&apos;s sometimes hard to find where you need to go with random-encounters interrupting you every few seconds.)
<br>
<br>That aside, it&apos;s honestly a refreshing experience to see all the generations of gaming packed into one 3.5 hour game. The gameplay mimics the gameplay of the generation you are currently dwelling in, and it does it very well. It seems like a lot of time was put into Evoland, everything was polished well to fit with the various themes.
<br>
<br>I think this game is worth it at full price for some people, but also would not be enjoyed by others. I certainly enjoyed it, and if anything I&apos;ve said sounds interesting, I recommend that you give it a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evoland/user-reviews?user_review_id=3138050">Expand</a></span>

The difficulty is not unreasonable, although the gameplay isn&apos;t very varied either, so isn&apos;t deep. The final hour on the other hand is a perfect demonstration of why these types of games are no longer popular and are relegated to nostalgic memories. As the difficulty ramps up you have to hope for the best that spamming the attack button will save you, and in the case of the final two bosses, of the first you must exploit the terrain if you want a real chance of winning, and for the final boss they have implemented a typical early-2000s timing attack boss with a doughnut shaped platform. This is an exercise in frustration and taints the rest of the relatively easy, nostalgia filled, game.
<br>
<br>I went into the game wondering why the reviews were generally negative, and while the game was still constantly rewarding me with upgrades to the engine, and being genuinely fun, I still considered it good, but by the end it was clear the designer does not know the difference between difficulty and frustrating situations.
<br>
<br>Before the frustrating parts of the game settled in, I had another major problem; the designer was trying too hard to be funny. It came off as trite and bland, and constant attempts to parody the genre (and Final Fantasy in particular) were forced, unfunny and broke the sense of nostalgic immersion I was experiencing. This game would have worked better as a simple, easy, nostalgia fueled game that had references, but not parodies, to other games in the genre.
<br>
<br>I would not recommend this to anyone who didn&apos;t experience the first generations of action/adventure/RPG games, pre-2005, because if you didn&apos;t, you probably won&apos;t find this game fun at all, and I instead recommend you play games that actually came out pre-2005 to experience them first hand. This game does not do them justice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evoland/user-reviews?user_review_id=3290873">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s ridiculous how someone charges 10&#x20AC; for such basic game (i mean demo) and where most of the names are pretty much taken from other games and even movies with just a letter change (such as Noria Mines, which is Moria from Lord of the Rings) and then worst, the duration of the game is pathetic at best and to think i was kinda hyped when i got the game (i mean demo).
<br>
<br>Basically i feel like this is a &quot;tech&quot; demo for a great potential game, turns out the author just threw the demo at us and that&apos;s it.
<br>
<br>If i want nostalgia there&apos;s plenty of games i can play (i can go play Final Fantasy 7, 8, 9, Chrono Trigger/Cross, Pokemon and so many others) with at least 50+ hours of duration each, and that&apos;s just doing the main story and some exploration for better gear).
<br>
<br>Overall i do NOT recommend buying this game (i mean demo) unless you pay 2.5 for it instead of the base 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evoland/user-reviews?user_review_id=3879022">Expand</a></span>

The game is short, I beat it in one sitting, but even at only 2-3 hours it dragged. The game continually upgrades into different types and styles of varying classic rpgs, but for some reason it can&apos;t decide on the overworld and in dungeon style to stay with. HP and XP Final Fantasy style in the overworld, diablo style fighting without leveling in dungeons.  I wanted more story, more towns, more shops, more upgrades, more consistency. It&apos;s as if the devs grew tired of the concept and cut it short with their half assed ending.
<br>
<br>I bought this at full price because my interest was piqued when I heard about it. It wasn&apos;t worth half.
<br>
<br>Hopefully somebody else takes the idea and runs with it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evoland/user-reviews?user_review_id=3762597">Expand</a></span>

A game which evolves technologically throughout the course of gameplay, advancing from a top-down monochrome adventure to full-color 3D. The goal is to act as something of a gaming history lesson, while deriving enjoyment from the act of calling out conventions of gaming that have evolved over the years.
<br>
<br>While the concept is interesting, the execution is somewhat flawed. The pacing of &quot;upgrades&quot; feels stilted. In the first five minutes of play you progress from monochrome to 8-bit to 16-bit color, but the latter half of the game features almost no evolution at all. The transition to 3D is similarly flawed, moving from solid colored polygons to high-rez textures in the course of a single level. For a game built around evolution, these transitions should be metered more thoughtfully.
<br>
<br>Speaking of evolution, the treatment of upgrades is woefully inconsistent. One of the potential joys of this game would be exploring the changes to previously visited locations with new technology. But if you attempt to see the first village after earning 3D graphics, you will be kicked back to the 16-bit era with little fanfare. The only area that you really get to enjoy at multiple levels of technology is the starting one, and that&apos;s more than a little disappointing.
<br>
<br>As stated earlier, the rate of tech enhancements tails off about halfway through the game. At this point, the focus turns to completing the storyline, solving puzzles, and collecting all the little doodads hidden around the map. The storyline and gameplay are both purposefully generic, meant to highlight silly tropes in the medium and heavily reference memorable/frustrating events from Final Fantasy and Zelda. This is all well and good, since the game itself is merely a vehicle for the commentary provided by the evolution jumps. But since the evolution gives out at around the halfway point, the rest of the game is laid bare in a way it can&apos;t really handle. As a result, despite how short the game is, it really starts to drag by the end. A few more evolutionary advances (for example, &quot;limit breaks&quot; that lets you bypass combat encounters quickly), would have fixed both issues.

<br>The collectibles are similarly problematic. They are meant to reference the myriad of collectible items in adventure games, but don&apos;t seem to fit in well enough. There was a lot of promise for these little collectibles. They should have provided optional evolutions, becoming references worth hunting down. Instead, they just collect in your inventory and move you towards 100% and nag at your inner completionist. Do yourself a favor and ignore them. You aren&apos;t missing anything.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, Evoland is an acceptable game, but one that fails to deliver its initial promise because of minor missteps in execution. Purchase this game if you see it on sale for less than $5, and attempt to complete it without wasting too much time chasing unrewarding side objectives. This mode of play will give you the most enjoyable experience that Evoland has to offer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evoland/user-reviews?user_review_id=3105936">Expand</a></span>

Even so, there are times when you have to grind pointless trash fights to get all of the achievements; this is made all the more tiresome because for the most part there is absolutely no chance of failure unless you are just really, really incompetent.  On top of all that, it&apos;s pretty darned short (which in retrospect may be a blessing).  You can tell the creators put some thought and effort into it  sadly, it turns out they are clearly game FANS, not game designers.  I bought this while it was on sale for 10 percent off, and I still feel like I paid way too much for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evoland/user-reviews?user_review_id=3117429">Expand</a></span>

I t starts with a gameboy-like image of a typical blocky character in well know 8 shades of greyish yellow and leads us further and further up the road to a N64-like 3D character in quest of chest that, instead of enhancing your firepower and armor classes, rather enhance the gameworld from 8-bit retro to 64 bit advanced, uncluding shaders, colors, music and general gameplay. It also includes a fun minigame where you have to achieve a pretty challenging cardgame.
<br>
<br>The game in itself is a real pleasure to play. The overall design is extremely well done, the music is enjoyable and there is, of course, a pretty big portion of humor around every corner. My only real gripe is that it didn&apos;t last very long. Actually, it was finished in about 3 hours and I felt that the pretty vast gameworld in which the game took place could easily have contained a couple of additional quests. In the end, despite all the fun and the enchantment over the beauty of the design, I felt a bit like I had been rushed through a world and a concept that could easily have offered a lot more. I sincerely do hope that the developers will come up with a significantly larger version of the game.
<br>I also feel that the game was a little bit overpriced for what it offered, although I understand that most work has probably gone into the different designs and time layers and that, thus, the developers probably feel that around 10$ is cheap enough, they should not forget that a player measures a game&apos;s worth in totally different units.
<br>
<br>Please give us Evoland 2, Evoland Forever, Evoland Infinite... Whatever! Just make it BIG!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evoland/user-reviews?user_review_id=3109882">Expand</a></span>

The first hour is fun as you go about collecting the powerups that create the 3D RPG world as we know it, but beyond that, the last two hours are all drudgery. Near the end, certain RPG tripes are introduced that are interesting (e.g. a quest based around talking to villagers, a Diablo-esque mission, and an interesting final boss battle), but everything leading up to that point is mostly worthless. I was mostly disappointed in the number of encounters that you face on the world map. I honestly couldn&apos;t walk on the world map for more than 4 seconds without an encounter. It was very annoying traveling between locations knowing that it would take 5-10 minutes longer than I want because of the random encounters. Your character can level up through these battles, but there&apos;s no reason to- all you gain is a bit more life. All the enemies are either killed in one hit, two hits, or more- leveling up doesn&apos;t change that.
<br>
<br>Luckily, I got this game for cheap so I got enough satisfaction from it from the actual evolution stages of the game, but I guarantee that I&apos;ll never play the game again or recommend it to friends.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evoland/user-reviews?user_review_id=3927251">Expand</a></span>

It has a suitably generic storyline but that suits the rest of the game perfectly.  It&apos;s also cool how you swap between new  old style.</span>

This game is only designed for those older guys who have experienced the fun in 8 bit games, 16 bit games until now. Don&apos;t dump your **** like &quot;this game sux, only talk and talk etc&quot;.</span>

Boring enemies, boring combat, excuse plot, character who dies who you just don&#x2019;t care about at all (or indeed, care about any of the characters at all), ect.
<br>
<br>The game is meant to poke fun at old RPGs, including Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Zelda, Diablo, and others, but frankly, it falls flat. All of the &#x201C;humor&#x201D; in the game is basically the game pointing and saying &#x201C;isn&#x2019;t this dumb?&#x201D; It is basically explaining the joke, except there is no joke, just a reference to an older game which isn&#x2019;t very funny.
<br>
<br>The game seems to suggest that you&#x2019;re going to gradually move through various eras of games, but by about a third of the way into the game, you&#x2019;re already up to 3D graphics, and it doesn&#x2019;t really go beyond that. The game feels almost as if it has to rush through to unlock all the earlier stuff and then get to 3D for some reason, even though, quite frankly, the 3D gameplay isn&#x2019;t very good (but then, neither is the 2D gameplay).
<br>
<br>Ultimately, the game is meant to be funny, but isn&#x2019;t, and is meant to be fun, and also isn&#x2019;t. The gameplay is as tedious as any old, poorly designed game with very little content; the JRPG overworld encounters happen every five steps or so and are pointless and tedious, while the dungeon Zelda-type movement is very basic, containing very little variety of monsters, none of which are particularly interesting to fight. The game contains three bosses, two of which are pretty boring; one of them is basically &#x201C;stand there and hit it until it dies&#x201D;, and another is a standard &#x201C;dodge the charge and hit them&#x201D; boss. Only the final boss shows any signs of real gameplay, and even there, it was kind of tepid.
<br>
<br>There&#x2019;s just nothing here for anyone. If you&#x2019;re looking for humor, the game isn&#x2019;t funny; if you&#x2019;re looking for a game which is fun to play, this isn&#x2019;t. It doesn&#x2019;t even feel original, as literally everything in it is referential, meaning any &#x201C;originality&#x201D; it might have from the whole idea of evolving into the modern day of gameplay is basically dead on arrival, buried under a pile of old video game references.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evoland/user-reviews?user_review_id=6460066">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros
<br>+Unique progression evolves the visuals and gameplay the more you play
<br>+References from different RPGs and anime series in both gameplay and during conversations with NPCs
<br>+Turn based like Final Fantasy, Action-Adventure like Zelda and Dungeon Crawler like Mechanics in certain parts of the game
<br>+Sidequests which are not important to the storyline are included which will help you make the game easier or get achievements
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-Advertised as Full Controller Support however does not detect controllers automatically as it should, compatibility settings need to be changed on pad.exe and evoland.exe to windows 7. Also PS4 controller does not work at all, Xbox360 controller and Keyboard/Mouse works fine
<br>-Very short
<br>-Controls feel sluggish at times
<br>-Story not memorable at all</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evoland/user-reviews?user_review_id=7023522">Expand</a></span>

<br>First, it&apos;s very poorly coded. Want to see if you can beat the game without autoscrolling? Well, hope you like guessing where your character is, since he&apos;ll be spending much of his time off camera wandering around trying to trigger the invisible scroll points. Don&apos;t pick up mode-7 either, since without auto-scrolling, it make all graphics in the overworld completely misaligned. On the plus side though, you can move while doing the &quot;got item&quot; animation after opening a treasure chest, which isn&apos;t possible with autoscrolling. A good coder assumes all possibilities and accounts for them when making a game. Obviously, they assumed every player would play the same way they did and didn&apos;t bother to test the alternatives. To put a little icing on the cake, there&apos;s plenty of typos too. It&apos;s almost like there wasn&apos;t any QA at all.
<br>
<br>Second, even if the game was great, it&apos;s like a demo version of the games it&apos;s trying to pay homage to. It reminds me of FF, A link to the Past, and Illusion of Gaia, but what made those games memorable wasn&apos;t their turn-based combat or use of mode-7, but their combination of engaging (well-coded) gameplay, deep storylines, and memorable characters.  Lacking any real storyline or characters, and only offering a thin imitation of the gameplay, Evoland doesn&apos;t come close to having the same effect those games did.
<br>
<br>If it was a free flash game, the quality and shallowness would be a lot more fitting, almost endearing. But since it&apos;s the same price as considerably better made and more thought out games, it&apos;s practically a scam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evoland/user-reviews?user_review_id=3866871">Expand</a></span>

The turn based battling like FF isn&apos;t that deep, but it&apos;s still something interesting and fun, and it would be great if the developer could further develop this game. The legend of zelda style puzzles and gameplay is also quite fun. Two words = TOO.SHORT.

<br>
<br>Because it was reminding me it&apos;s a game, I continued noting the evolution of play and spoting inconsistencies as things updated. The game can&apos;t help but do this. And after awhile, I began to miss playing Zelda because Evoland might as well have said, &quot;Hey, I&apos;m not Zelda, but this is sort of how that game works and we are imitating something already created.&quot; In fact, I stopped playing and turned on that great NES classic.
<br>
<br>Buy this if you&apos;re curious but wait for it to go on sale. Evoland is not a game that seems to want to stand on its own merit except for novelty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evoland/user-reviews?user_review_id=4124515">Expand</a></span>

Even if you don&apos;t necessarily remember the classic games that this game pays homage to, the history lesson and the beautiful progression of graphics.  No, the gameplay itself isn&apos;t the best, and sometimes the controls are kludgy, but I love the originality of the idea and think it&apos;s terrific.</span>

The music, the graphics, the sense of progression, the in-jokes and the overall style of the game is unique and gives a good feeling, reminding me of good times spent playing RPGs for hours and hours on end.

<br>Yes, as a game of it&apos;s own, this game is average at best and I&apos;d give it maybe 4.510 or something like that.
<br>Its own graphics aren&apos;t spectacular, its own soundtrack is kinda dull, the story is a pretty lame save-the-town-from-evil kind of thing.
<br>
<br>And maybe I&apos;ve got it all wrong, but I don&apos;t think that in any way this game tries to be any good on its own.
<br>The idea here is to bring the evolution of video games in one product, with great emphasis on the RPG genre. And that it does well, in my opinion, and I don&apos;t remember any other game doing that as good as Evoland does, I don&apos;t remember any developer even trying out this idea, which is actually a pretty good and interesting one!
<br>
<br>I really enjoyed this game, and really enjoyed seeing the old good 2D 2-colors graphics turning gradually into a nicely done 3D HD manymany-colors graphics.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a short experience, but that&apos;s the way it should be, and it costs accordingly (10 bucks is alright for this).
<br>
<br>Also, you&apos;ll probably enjoy the game more if you&apos;re familiar with the old-classic RPG&apos;s because this game has many specific references.
<br>
<br>One thing that annoyed me, to make the game more interesting the developers added achievements. They&apos;re pretty cool actually, and added a lot to the game, and I even wanted to complete them all. That&apos;s until I realized you don&apos;t really have any way to track your progress...UNLESS you own Evoland on Steam. Because Steam has an achievements system. The game itself, doesn&apos;t. So, if you&apos;re like me, and bought the game on GOG, and wish to track your achievements, you can only do so by manually check the list on Steam, or simply purchasing the game again on Steam.
<br>Does it worth it? naaah. It&apos;s a shame there&apos;s no achievements tracking in the game!
<br>
<br>All in all, the game is nice for a one-time playthrough. Give it a try if you&apos;re familiar with the old time of video gaming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evoland/user-reviews?user_review_id=4437252">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_5143579"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Evoland made me really excited (when I saw it on sale on Steam...$10 bucks? Ha!) because conceptually, it seems quite exciting. Being able to play through an action-RPG that changes and evolves to match the different mechanics we&apos;ve seen over the years would be amazing, provided the game itself was also there to deliver.
<br>
<br>The problem with Evoland is that it doesn&apos;t stand up alone as a game. They intended to create a series of references and then put them in order. It doesn&apos;t play like a game at any point, it makes no sense, and it doesn&apos;t try to engage you at all. Because the concept is so strong and the idea of nostalgia pulls at us all, Evoland neglected to make a challenging, entertaining, or even remotely fun game. It&apos;s these kinds of indie games that will bury a really great trend over the past few years when it comes to experimentation. If they had actually created a story and game and then simultaneously had you building the world, you might have had something here.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played a number of RPGs over the year where you actually had to build up the world around you. They&apos;re not much different than Evoland, except that they still brought a story and gameplay to stand alongside their gimmick. Evoland will make you smile once or twice, not because you&apos;re enjoying the game, but because you&apos;ll go &quot;Oh yeah, monochrome games were pretty fun&quot; or &quot;Yeah, Diablo is a great game.&quot; You&apos;re just smiling because you were reminded there are great games out there you played before and many of them are still pretty easy to get your hands on.
<br>
<br>There is a brief moment in Evoland where you have switch between &quot;time,&quot; and in doing so, you change between old 16-bit gameplay back to 3-D, and it changes how you can interact with the map. This is ingenious. This is the kind of thing that the game should be doing. Puzzles based on its gimmick. Early on, when you switch from monochrome to colour or from no health to hearts, there&apos;s no reason and no bonus to your progression. It just happens. So the gimmick isn&apos;t actually doing anything to boost the game, to pull you in, or to make it fun, it&apos;s just kind of happening in the background. You go through one forest, now it&apos;s a more detailed dungeon, now it&apos;s a 3D forest, now its an &quot;HD&quot; final boss fight. It doesn&apos;t change the gameplay much.
<br>
<br>As many have mentioned, the evolution pacing is terrible. For me, most of the greatest RPGs I Played are going to be from a 2D era. So when I started in monochrome, super excited to explore in this throwback world, and was almost instantly booted to colour, I was incredibly disappointed. The rush to 3D happens pretty much right away as well, meaning you play half the game as monochrome/16-bit/2D, and then you just flatline at 3D. The game also forgets there are modern RPGs that didn&apos;t have pre-rendered backgrounds, but apparently that&apos;s where evolution stops here.
<br>
<br>So, moving past the disappointing gimmicks is combat. It&apos;s awful. Any of the Zelda-esque levels have almost no puzzles, and if you were playing Zelda for the thrilling combat...look, nobody plays Zelda for thrilling combat. You play for puzzles and level-design and awesome bosses. When you play the FF-style stuff, you deal with incredibly frequent random encounters, and for a while, it&apos;s just your one character, and the only action you have is Attack. That&apos;s it. Pile on the excitement though, because the second character you get brings the first spell in the game (Heal) and does no damage when attacking, so you&apos;re just going to hit attack and heal between your two party members. That&apos;s all. Later in the game she learns a new damage spell, but it doesn&apos;t do much either. That&apos;s all there is to it. The Diablo sections also strip you of any skills, leaving you with only attack. That&apos;s all you&apos;ll do the entire level. Careful not to break your space bar.
<br>
<br>This game frustrates because it had so much potential, and they really only get one shot at this. Nobody had done this specific gimmick before, and now anyone trying it in the future will have Evoland&apos;s taint hanging around it. Plus it&apos;ll be a &quot;Yeah, we saw it&quot; feeling, so we&apos;ll never get a really interesting RPG that is both a throwback, and modern game at the same time, while still being original. Instead we got a demoreel for a game these guys could probably make if you gave them money. You&apos;re pretty much just watching the code be read and that&apos;s all.
<br>
<br>And don&apos;t collect things. Anything. Don&apos;t. Those chests don&apos;t contain optional evolutions. All the stars doesn&apos;t do anything. All the cards doesn&apos;t do anything. The card game is fun, and would be kind of nice if you had any additional say over your deck or anything, but its basically evolved tic-tac-toe, so I guess you can pay some money to get your hands on that?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evoland/user-reviews?user_review_id=5143579">Expand</a></span>
