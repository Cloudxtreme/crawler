While I absolutely loved episode 1+2 and though ep3 was somewhat good I have to say that episode 4 is by far the weakest part of the game. In the early Episodes you get a lot of freedom, you can roam around, discover stuff on your own, use your phone, PC and files to solve your own cases. The use of your special powers is fun but limited. Episode 4 on the other hand feels rather weak. There is no more real investigation (apart from 1 part), absolutely no freedom, you are on rails the entire time. There is literally 90% story and 10% gameplay in the last episode, to me it felt like cutscenes after cutscene with you making some clicks inbetween. There are also very awkward and illogical personal relationships revealed. Another change in the final episode is the addition of a trust-meter where you can either side with someone or against them. What I didn&apos;t like is the fact that the character, despite of my choices, tended to say the exact opposite of what I actually thought (in terms of who to support, who to blame etc). The ending was alright, it wasn&apos;t the most satisfying closure to a story I have ever experienced but I have seen worse. It is pretty clich&#xE9;. There is also far too much focus on your powers as the story progresses, it get&apos;s repetitive and dull and isn&apos;t nearly as fun as the investigative style of the first episodes. Still a good game just not anywhere near as good as it started of.
<br>
<br>Beware of minor bugs, I ran into many clipping and animation bugs. Episode 2 was bugged as every action would  have a several second delay between them. Ep3+4 seem to have less bugs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cognition-an-erica-reed-thriller-episode-4---the-cain-killer/user-reviews?user_review_id=3582908">Expand</a></span>

<br>Still, it&apos;s a very nice conclusion to the, overall, great adventure series.
