You play &quot;You&quot;, the lone survivor in a city plagued by horrors and disease. This is survival horror in definition, you&apos;ll need to scavenge for food, ammo, batteries and so on to survive, while hiding or facing the Silent Hill 2 inspired monstrosities. The psychological element is the element that messes with your head, you have no idea what&apos;s real, what isn&apos;t and what you want to be real. Gameplaywise you&apos;ll need to keep &quot;you&quot; fed properly, not that it&apos;s a necessity, but your mental health and well-being relies on it, with multiple endings being the consequent of nearly all of your actions. You have a flash-light and ammo for your pistol, and supplies for these are scarce, meaning you&apos;ll have to be rummaging around in the twisted surrounding for these. With the gun, you aim and shoot as an untrained ordinary person would, you can aim up, down or straight forward and you&apos;ll need to get in close for the headshots. Its refreshing to see combat like this again after Silent Hill 1-4 as a major part of the tension in combat doesn&apos;t come from being an action hero. Silent Hill 5 was guilty of this horror crime and Lone Survivor does it brilliantly. There&apos;s also pills you can take, or not, that will give you different dreams that transport you to bizarre realms with intriguing characters. Much of this is however optional and whether you take drugs to keep going or abstain from them impacts upon the course of events the game will take.<br><br>The game uses a distinctive retro style which surprisingly works wonderfully for the horror. The monsters look more horrifying as you can&apos;t exactly make out all the features. They look mangled and lanky with features enveloped by flesh Silent Hill 2 style. It always seems as graphics and gameplay get better, survival horror gets worse and Lone Survivor brings it right back. How good all the other features are demonstrate that pixelated  graphics can still provide genuine horror and atmosphere. There&apos;s no use saying anything about the story as so much is up for interpretation or a spoiler. The music, created by Jasper Byrne himself, is utterly magnificent. It isn&apos;t hard to tell the soundtrack is inspired from both Silent Hill and Twin Peaks, including the industrial twangs and acoustic melodies from Silent Hill, and the creepy jazzy tunes from Twin Peaks. In short, the soundtrack plays a major role in creating the tense creepy atmosphere. As far as criticisms go, there aren&apos;t many. The map has an overhead view of the surroundings which can sometimes be a little confusing as the gameplay is in 2D. this just means you&apos;ll have move left and right a bit whilst checking the map to see if you&apos;re moving upwards of downwards on the map. Another issue with the map is that is doesn&apos;t pause the game while you look at it. I guess you could consider it adding to the realism but I just found it a little annoying. In short, if you like Silent Hill 2, get this game right now. If you&apos;re wanting to try something new, get this game. Even if you&apos;re not interested in horror I&apos;d try it out seeing as at around 4 hours gameplay it doesn&apos;t take up much of your time. However with multiple endings  and various play styles, there&apos;s excellent replay value there if you want. It is a genuinely emotional and scary game that will leave you satisfied. Seriously, get the ending you want and you&apos;ll feel something. Old school survival horror is finally back. Although Amnesia was truly terrifying, it lacked the feel and atmosphere of hope, despair and survival that Lone Survivor and Silent Hill 2 bring to the table. Get this game!<br><br>-You might notice that the two negative user reviews for this game are from someone who &quot;hates&quot; survival horror and someone who is angry that this game&apos;s success and gives no indication what-so-ever that he even played the game. Just throwing that out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lone-survivor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2417023">Expand</a></span>

I can understand that this genre appeals to some people but it is a very specific niche and if you are like most people out there, you will probably be hard pressed to like this game. Furthermore, contrary to some reviews here, the game isn&apos;t scary at all. I don&apos;t know how a 8bit 2d game with extremely low resolution can possibly be scary. If you want to experience a truly terrifying game, you&apos;re better off playing Amnesia The Dark Descent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lone-survivor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2798553">Expand</a></span>

This is silent hill in the 2D world.  The game provides a very spooky atmosphere with very spooky sounds.  And frankly, you won&apos;t want to play this game with the lights off.

Just like many other bundle games, the game is very retro style with a gameplay system somewhat akin to Silent Hill; creeping through dark hallways and using a map to navigate apartments.

Overall though, I enjoyed Lone Survivor: it&apos;s atmospheric, intriguing and quite well-paced.

<br>
<br>The gameplay revolves around making your way through the rooms of the building. You will find many obstacles along your way and also monsters that you will have to kill or sneak by. The difficulty of the game is just right as it&apos;s not overly simplistic but not ridiculously hard either.
<br>
<br>The atmosphere is great despite the retro style, 2d graphics, although I can see that being a reason for many people to dislike the game  The music is very fitting too. I can&apos;t really comment on the storyline, since I haven&apos;t beaten the game yet but it definitely has a surreal tone to it.
<br>
<br>I wouldn&apos;t go that far, saying that it&apos;s a masterpiece but it is certainly an enjoyable game that fans of old school survival  horror games will love.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lone-survivor/user-reviews?user_review_id=3633629">Expand</a></span>

You cant really enjoy the story or the &quot;fear&quot; because your more worried about when its gonna spam you to sleep or eat, thats far more scary than what was intended...spend your 10 bucks elseware...if you dont believe me then try it..............</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lone-survivor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2406984">Expand</a></span>

I thought these games were buried long time ago...I&apos;m glad I was wrong:<br><br>This game made me travel to the past,to the golden era of videogames,when the graphics were pixels in exchange for an AWESOME gameplay. For the last years i&apos;ve been complaining about the loss of the old game experiences that sent you beyond the screen limits,making you feel like you&apos;re part of the game. This phenomenom won&apos;t be understanded by those who started gaming a few years ago,but for the old playeres like me,it&apos;s the best experience that a videogame can offer.Let me explain: Games today are driven mainly through the graphics,it&apos;s not a bad thing,in fact it&apos;s great to see such fact of realism in our virtual entertainment,but with time,the developers have gradually started to focus more on the graphics than any other things,and that ended with the loss of the old magic of videogames,that which could make you feel a monster slayer in diablo 2,make you feel misplaced on the odd world of Silent Hill,make you feel a Badass in doom or duke nukem,those games,their dark style,their therrorific enviroment created by desolated depiction and threatening (and i mean REALLY THREATENING) sound effects (which were in fact pretty simple,but effective as hell) transported you to their world and turned you into a hardcore bastard as cold as ice and as hard as steel,this doesn&apos;t happen nowadays,since developers are investing their budgets in graphics,which end up costing 70% of the game allowance,but not this game, this game has no resident evil-dead space graphics,but has the essence of the old Silent Hill: Pure Psychological Therror,A feeling of misplace that makes you feel really uncomfortable in a GREAT way: you feel like you&apos;ve abandoned this world,and sooner or later you will be asking yourself if you (your character) is still human,if it exist,and even if you can trust him (you),you feel indefense and vulnerable against the constant changing world and  the mysteries that riddle your way to...&#xC2;&#xBF;exist? at the begining of the game theres no real objective,you just want to meet other survivors in order to reaffirm your existance,to feel like a human,and trust me,YOU WILL SUFFER...Those pixels will turn into a threatening world as soon as you wake up in your appartment and start to live your life. It&apos;s a MUST BUY for therror lovers,you wont regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lone-survivor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2419087">Expand</a></span>

<br>Lone survivor was an indie game primarily made by Jasper Byrne. I got it in the Humble Bundle 5 sale. This is a interesting game to review because it&apos;s easy to spoil things which leaves the review being more broad with an lack of examples. I do hope this review  will give you an understanding about the game though.
<br>
<br>Story:
<br>	You play as a guy named &quot;You&quot; who is supposed to be a stand in for your self. An incident has happened where you have locked yourself in your apartment for days. Running out of supplies and losing your sanity you decided to venture out. The most interesting part of this game in my opinion is the story. It&apos;s vague and mysterious at first like random sets of puzzle pieces. I found myself constantly questioning what was going on in the game and try to figure out how things relate. Once you reach the end things will start to make sense but you kind of need to get the other two endings to really get the story. It deals with a theme that all of us have dealt with or will deal with sometime in our lives and is done well. I could relate to some parts of the theme and the story.
<br>
<br>Game play:
<br>
<br>The game is a 2D side-scrolling survival horror game. I emphasize on survival as you have to take care of yourself in the game. You have to feed yourself good food, sleep when tired, take care of your sanity by  to healthy activities, and other things that I can&apos;t spoil. Experiment and try things out, use your head and read the notes. Depending on what you say and do affects the ending you get and the scenes you see at the end. The game is not easy and can be very unforgiving if you make a mistake or don&apos;t realize about the sanity system. It does not tell you about the sanity system but hints at it in dialogue nor does it tell you what can affect sanity. Controls in this game are non-reprogrammable and can take time to get use to. They are not the best and could have been much better. Reaching the shortcut keys requires you to move your hand to reach the number keys. Combat is okay with one standard enemy if you shoot them in the head but it best to avoid all combat if possible. Another annoying aspect is that your game only saves when you sleep but your strongly encouraged not to do it when ever you feel like otherwise you will be penalized. It can be frustrating when you have gone through a hard part but can&apos;t save yet. Unless you want to risk a penalty. A nitpick I have with the level design is that  you will end up using a lot of flares to get past area&apos;s due to the lack of hiding spots. This means you will have to backtrack often to trade for new flares. One other problem with the level design is that sometimes you will stumble into a combat situation due to how close they are to the entryway that you come in from with the flashlight on, or if they block your way to getting an item.  I sometimes wonder if the developer intended it to have more combat at first and these were leftovers of that idea. Despite these problems I did manage to enjoy playing it. It can take you between 1 hour and 8 hours tops.
<br>
<br>Graphics:
<br>
<br>The graphics are in a old style 16bit pixilated style. The low quality gives it  a horror feel due to how hard it is to distinguish some of the backgrounds. It&apos;s not that you can&apos;t see what is important but rather environments and enemies only have enough details to be their but leave a lot to your imagination. It adds a nice touch but it can be awful to look at in full screen or resolutions higher then 720p in window mode. Window mode has to be configured in the programs location outside the game. Thanks to some people on the steam forums this is how you ahve to do it. Open up the application.xml inside the META-INFAIR folder from Lone Survivor with your favorite text editor and take a look at line 57 and 60.

An actual survival unlike many games that call themselves that, manages to use 2d modern-retro graphics and to integrate them so well in such a kind of game, references to magnificent works such as Twin Peaks and Silent Hill, gorgeous music and atmosphere, a bit of replayability. Would be tempting to say this is a 10/10 if my opinions weren&apos;t a bit altered by the moment AND by being a fan of stuff this game references, but even without all that I can easily say this is a 8 or even a 9/10.
<br>
<br>And a thing about the ever-complaining guys: the stuff about being hungry and sleepy are apparently not stuff you die for or that you are forced to acknowledge, but it will give you a better ending. I&apos;ll give you that those mechanics are pretty unclear, I didn&apos;t find the frequency of the text boxes annoying though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lone-survivor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2513897">Expand</a></span>

The 2D handpainted art style is creepy and fits very well with the music Jasper Byrne has composed (which may I add is phenomenal on its own) for the game.  The art style may not be for everyone - nowadays a lot of people seem to like big, fancy blockbuster titles and graphics to go with it - but these kind of *good* indie games are truly a refreshing experience for the retro and modern gamer alike.  Lone Survivor features multiple endings that change depending on your decisions and actions in-game, even those that you&apos;d think are irrelevant, but the psyche report at the end of the game lists &apos;contributing factors&apos; which surprised me, and made sense after I thought about it.  A lot of things aren&apos;t explained, but it&apos;s left open to interpretation and is a truly clever piece in that sense.  The combat is simple, but it isn&apos;t a combat-centric game - the real selling point is a compelling story and creepy ambience which will keep you on edge throughout.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lone-survivor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2883543">Expand</a></span>

I cant say that i&apos;m a fan of the indie feel of it, with the side-scrolling and sprites, but surprisingly this game pulls it off pretty well. You would think that ugly sprites wouldn&apos;t be scary, well you&apos;d be wrong. The enemies, as mentioned before, are very Silent Hill-like, same with the environments, making the game have an absolutely horrid vibe to it, but one of the best feels out of a horror game you can get. Main complain that comes out of this game though is the way you keep your character healthy, you have to eat, sleep, make sure you don&apos;t eat bad things (i.e. rotten meat), etc. While that is an interesting concept, it gets kind of annoying having to scarf down cheese and crackers every 5 minutes to keep your character from complaining. But, overall, the vibe, visuals, and even story out-weigh the bad things in this game heavily, its definitely worth picking up if your a fan of Silent Hill, or any kind of survival horror kind of game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lone-survivor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2825166">Expand</a></span>

The story is muddled, a combination of Silent Hill and Resident Evil written in a hurry. I&apos;m just completely unimpressed with this as an indie game, let alone one I paid $3 for on sale. I haven&apos;t completed it, but from what I&apos;ve played over several hours (broken up), I am not impressed. This is flash game quality.</span>

<br>Some people will say it doesn&apos;t do justice to the colossal work of a 1-man team, and in this they&apos;re probably right: the retro, pixelated graphics are good. Not excellent, but they work just fine. The music score is well chosen and well placed, the sound effects are really good. So what&apos;s so bad, what&apos;s so lazy about this game?
<br>Gameplay, for once. It places a strong emphasis on the survival aspects but it makes no efforts whatsoever to make it even remotely bearable for the player. I mean, a game where you run out of food, batteries and fatigue is good, but no effort has been made to look for a hint of realism. Your character will easily tire out after a 5 minutes walk, and he&apos;ll constantly remind you of his needs so much that it feels like playing The Sims.
<br>Originality is another factor of laziness. This game is more Silent Hill than it is Lone Survivor, and it&apos;s a pity because the premises were good.
<br>But the laziest, duller of all things is the plot. I won&apos;t spoil it here, but after finishing it I feel cheated. It&apos;s a huge clich&#xE9; and you can see it coming from two miles. It involves things being not exactly what they look like, of course, but no effort whatsoever is made to link elements and characters together. The game&apos;s resolution is a massive hole for you to fill with huge amounts of speculation. Now, I understand this is a matter of personal preference but while I don&apos;t particularly like this genre I recognize there are some games that can pull it off (like Braid or even The Binding of Isaac) and this one failes to deliver so hard that it mocks the entire experience of the player.
<br>Why? Because the creator couldn&apos;t be bothered to come up with elements that made sense in his established setting.
<br>I&apos;m sorry, but this is just a no. This game starts with a lot of personality and ends up underplaying its qualities.
<br>Color me disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lone-survivor/user-reviews?user_review_id=3578989">Expand</a></span>

As a supposed &quot;nod&quot; to Silent Hill, I get what the game is going for, but it steals from every aspect of Silent Hill, down to the sound effects and flashlight. If you want to make good games, make your own games.
<br>
<br>Pro: Pixels always look cool.
<br>Cons: Completely unoriginal.</span>

<br>
<br>Not only that, but I think some gameplay mechanics aren&apos;t explained particularly well within the game either. For example, besides a vague description of making you &apos;duller&apos; or &apos;sharper&apos;. it isn&apos;t clear what each pill does EXACTLY and how it affects your mental health.
<br>
<br>Additionally, Lone Survivor is called a survival horror, and while it fulfills the survival part in a solid enough manner, the psychological horror aspect is rather lacking. There weren&apos;t many instances where it felt particularly horrifying and suspenseful.
<br>
<br>Last point, I don&apos;t usually mind retro visuals, but I felt that the game was just a little too pixelated for my liking, though the sound design is excellent and reinforces the game&apos;s isolating atmosphere.
