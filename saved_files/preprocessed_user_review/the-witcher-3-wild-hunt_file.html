<br>
<br>I really was hyped for this game although I did not play the precedessors. I bought myself a new gaming rig right now so I could enjoy this new release in it&apos;s full glory and to hard test my new hardware.
<br>
<br>I had to wait for my new rig and for the games key until two weeks after release and read a view reviews here about it. I got to say I tend to read the negative reviews first to get an idea of what might be not so pleasant about the game. Those negative Nancys got me for quite some time and I first was grateful I did not pay extra for the game - it came with my video card.
<br>
<br>Those claimed down points were mostly grafics, controls and character development.
<br>
<br>All I can say to this is: What the **** is wrong with people?!
<br>
<br>Jesus! This brings back my personal memories of Gothic 2 where I was drawn in as a teenager for weeks.
<br>
<br>Despite my nostalgic feel I can only say this game is top notch in every aspect.
<br>
<br>Every time I launch this game I am overwhelmed by it&apos;s visual beauty - I stop often and just walk (!) through villages or with a torch in a dark forest at night to experience this great atmosphere. Just awesome. I normally do not feel the need to spend more time than necessarry in games so I fast travel or run in villages and cities but not here.
<br>
<br>Concerning the controls all I can say is that it is nothing new but far from being &quot;obnoxious&quot; or &quot;awful&quot;. I am playing at the hardest difficulty which gives the game another feel of realism and authenticism since health is only restored with the potion or with food. Fights feel also a lot more challenging because blind rushing into enemies and blade flurring serves you nothing but ending dead soon after. You got to plan, you have to dodge, roll, break guards and use your signs to overcome enemies, be them beast or man.
<br>The controls always feel right to he point and accurate enough to fight tactically. Maybe the other reviewers have no talent in general for games...
<br>
<br>Last but not least the story. What are people expacting here? I may just beat 25% of the game yet but in my opinion it is a decent dark fantasy story with interesting characters and entertaining side stories.
<br>You cannot reinvent the wheel and it is no stand alone or new story beginning, it is a sequel of a series based on books. No wonder you cannot play as an old wizard killing enemies with fire bolts or a she elf archer. The protagonist is Geralt of Rivia a professional Monster slayer and swordsman. You know this before playing the game so it&apos;s no surprise you cannot create a new character or play as an archer.
<br>You either like Geralt and his style or not. End of discussion.
<br>
<br>To sum it up: One of the best games I played in my 18 years of gaming. Hands down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5323159">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s way bigger that even GTA 5 map and in that game you get around by car instead of horse and fast travel. So far the story is great and the cut scenes are absolutely fantastic. I&apos;m not a huge fan of the whole crafting system but other than that, great game so far. Glad I bought it.</span>

In regards to the story, which is the most important part of any story driven rpg, I should note that the significant accomplishment here isn&apos;t the amazing main quest storyline (which is amazing) but rather the quality of the side quests. Until now -every single- open world game (I&apos;m looking at you TES, DAI) suffers from boring, unscripted, often dialog-less side quests ranging from &quot;go kill this&quot; to &quot;go fetch that&quot;. In Witcher3 practically every single side quest I have encountered, and make no mistake there are a LOT of them, has not only had scripted dialog but often has fully fleshed out stories filled with plot twists and interesting characters. This is contrasted with the latest Dragon Age game in which pretty much every side quest was a piece of paper you read off the ground that directs you to go loot a chest or kill something, without even a word of dialog. How the devs managed such detail is beyond me, it&apos;s an absolutely outstanding accomplishment.
<br>
<br>The graphics were &quot;downgraded&quot; for consoles a little bit, sure, but the game still is the best looking rpg I have ever played, and I found the framerate to be optimized very well, which is something people often overlook. I can run everything on Ultra (except Hairworks) with my old 7970 and maintain &gt;50 fps. I just don&apos;t get the 100 negative reviews on here. No other open world game even comes CLOSE to Witcher 3. Looking through those reviews these morons are giving the game 1/10 because they don&apos;t like the controls (which are fine), or they claim the graphics are not &quot;great&quot;, even though no other open world game comes close in this regard. Ignore them, this game should be rated 100/100.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5282567">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is absolutely massive. Even if all you do is the main story, you&apos;ll roam all across the map, sail across the sea, see many different and amazing things. The points of interest and secondary wuests scattered around the world feel organic, and the people who give you the quests genuinely feel in need, and make you want to help them.
<br>
<br>Of all the secondary objectives, Witcher contracts are by far my favorite. You track down the monster who you&apos;ve been contracted to kill to find out what it is, so you can prepare yourself for the fight. The bestiary then gives you information on the monster and what is required to kill it, including it&apos;s weaknesses and how to make it vulnerable. Tracking and killing the monsters in this game is an incredibly rewarding experience, and by far my favorite thing to do in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5288141">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The hype was worth it, and more. A morally grey world with the best quests ever made in a game. It is officially the best video game I have ever played in my life. It will stick with me forever.
<br>
<br>The best story I&apos;ve ever seen in a game and it rivals even Lord of the Rings for books and movies. It has amazing graphics, and continues to impress as you crank it to 1600p and ultra everything.
<br>
<br>The most innovative and intriguing thing about the game is that decisions you make matter (without a simple good/evil bar), and often you will not know the extent of your decisions for hours or even tens of hours (none of this &quot;so and so will remember that&quot; from Telltale games and none of the simple and obvious good/bad choices of almost every other game ever.
<br>
<br>It also has fantastic setting and lore, which pays lots of fan service to Witcher 2 fans (like me) but is absolutely accessible to people who never played either other game (like my wife). Finally, it is just plain ridiculously fun and never got old even after 135 hours.
<br>
<br>Yes, it is a bit clunky to control (but only out of combat), the swimming is atrociously bad, the inventory cannot be sorted, and some other minor issues as well. But when you absolutely nail every other part of your game, it just doesn&apos;t matter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5291964">Expand</a></span>

Fantastic detail in the world and the characters that inhabit it makes the game totally immersive.
<br>
<br>The combat can at first feel clunky, but it&apos;s simply a learning curve. Once you adjust to the control scheme you will be flowing through the battles like a leaf on the wind, moving effortlessly through waves of monsters and humans alike, every motion feeling accurate and satisfying. The mixture of melee combat and the use of signs (your spells) is really satisfying, and once you invest skill points into the attributes you want, choose your appropriate bombs and potions and develop your own style of playing, each battle will feel more and more rewarding.
<br>
<br>Of course the more you fight the same monsters you also develop specific tactics against them, you learn their attack patterns and can predict their movements to a degree, making you a better monster hunter as time goes on. Having a well detailed bestiary to consult is also very useful, reading the entries carefully will give you a huge advantage compared to going in blind. It makes you want to go out and find every book about monsters you can, to make sure you are prepared when encountering something you haven&apos;t fought before.
<br>
<br>A big concern was the lack of scaled levelling on monsters and human enemies, but don&apos;t concern yourself with that. The game is designed in such a way that even enemies with a few levels beneath you can still be tough if you make a mistake, and enemies above you can still be taken out if you prepare well for a fight and utilize your weapons, signs and other gear well. That being said don&apos;t expect to be taking out some of the higher level monsters you may encounter, a lot of them are strong mythical beasts that will one shot you even if you are fully prepared for the fight. But all this means is that you have something to strive for.
<br>
<br>Which brings me to my next point. The game is extremely story driven. There is so much dialogue, most of which is very important. Optional dialogue choices can provide you with so much information, be it a main quest or side quest and the voice acting is so well done you won&apos;t mind sitting there listening to the various characters chatting away about this or that.
<br>
<br>The questing is set up into a few categories, Main quests which follow the story of the protagonist Geralt and his friends. Side quests which can range from helping a random traveller at the roadside to partaking in events that will in some way affect the main campaign. Witcher contracts that are notices placed up for you to identify and hunt a specific monster whilst also being able to negotiate your fee. Treasure hunts that are exactly what they sound like, hunts for treasure, and the many undiscovered locations throughout the world that can range from clearing a bandit camp and destroying a monster net, to finding places of power that will grant you skill points and buff you for a time.
<br>
<br>All of this culminates in a game that will keep you busy for hours and there is so much to do at your level that the lack of scaled enemies won&apos;t even trouble you at all. There is real challenge as soon as you enter the world and you are completely free to explore and run around and discover.complete things however you wish.
<br>
<br>Overall the game is rich, beautiful and exciting. If you are looking for a fast paced hack and slash fest you can rush to completion then this is not for you. Witcher 3 is meant to be enjoyed, and while you can play at whatever pace you wish, it would be a shame and totally irresponsible to skip through dialogue and rush through content, despite how exciting it is to reach the next big monster hunt.
<br>
<br>If you had any doubts about buying this game because you are new to the series don&apos;t worry, everything that precedes the game is explained in decent detail, even allowing you to take part in an interactive cutscene that will allow you to make decisions from Witcher 2 that will directly affect your world. I am only 25 hours in and have hardly scratched the surface but I can safely say this is a GOTY contender.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5264839">Expand</a></span>

While The Witcher 3 is not perfect, it is one of the finest games I&apos;ve ever played in 30 years of playing video games.  The scope and size of the game is enormous, feels like 2x the size of Skyrim. At about 35 hours in, I&apos;ve only explored about 50% of the map.  This game takes all that was good about Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Skyrim, and of course, previous Witcher titles and wraps them in one cohesive package.  Graphics, atmosphere, sound is second to none, the attention to detail is amazing.  And the game runs well and is stable: I struggle to remember coming across any bugs.
<br>
<br>I would like to give a shout out to the writers and translators.  I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve vocally chuckled or thought that&apos;s impressive forshadowing, symbolism, clever writing ect so many times in a game.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d also like to thank the animators for making human and animal movement soooo very good.  For the first time in any game I  can remember, character&apos;s faces actually express emotion correctly and consistantly!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5281507">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I think this game has many flaws, such as mechanics, skills and abilities design, enemy and encounter designs and level design so on. Games like Skyrim and Bloodborne have much more entertaining core gameplay.
<br>
<br>But the Witcher 3 redefines the scope and depth of what a game&apos;s narrative can hold. Although the narrative isn&apos;t terribly interesting in the beginning, it soon expands into a vast variety of different stories that are woven together into a coherent and vigorous narrative spanning many hours. This is something we haven&apos;t seen in RPG storytelling before. I suspect this was where the bulk of the game&apos;s efforts went into, and it&apos;s the part that remains with you after the credits roll.
<br>
<br>If RPG&apos;s before the witcher were analogous to teenage fiction with A to B straightforward storytelling, the Witcher 3 feels like a complex novel you have to struggle through, but the very act of navigating such a complex narrative is an entertaining and rewarding exercise in itself.
<br>
<br>I think the scoring of this game as a 9.3 vs a 9.5 comes down to what weighting you give to the &quot;game&quot; portion vs the &quot;role-playing&quot; portion. With my criteria prior to playing this game, I would have given it a 9.3, because I believed that games should foremost be games. However, The Witcher 3 completely works as just a piece of interactive entertainment, with the emphasis on the participation in the broader narrative more than the moment to moment gameplay. As an experience, even with its gameplay shortcomings, I think this game deserves the distinction of one of the top 10 video&quot;game&quot; experiences ever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5296889">Expand</a></span>

The quests are interesting, and the cut scenes are cinematic quality...and there are TONS of them with great dialogue.  The combat excellent, and there&apos;s a lot of interesting stuff that you find if you jump off the trail and just explore around.  Sometimes just riding your horse through the countryside and listening to the gorgeous soundtrack can be a satisfying experience by itself. I&apos;m about 50 hours in, and there&apos;s still so much more to go.  There are three sets of awesome witcher gear you can craft (light, medium, heavy armor sets) and whichever you like the best you can keep upgrading it for four levels (base, enhanced, superior, master crafted) over the course of the game, so that&apos;s cool.  Beware, your rig must have a pretty good graphics card and cpu to run this, or you will encounter slowdown, and even worse (such as in my case initially), the animations and the sound in the cut scenes will be way out of sync.  This game actually prompted me to purchase a new GTX 960 just so I can see it properly.  But wow, does the game look great.  Trees blowing in the wind, the glare of the sun and billow of the sail as you sail your boat, the rippling water....people are making way too much of a fuss about the &quot;graphics downgrade&quot;.  It still looks great, and maybe it will get enhanced even more through mods in the future.  There are possibly a few too many &quot;follow the footprints&quot; side quests, but there also a ton of really original quests and well written dialogue exchanges as well.  I do wish that there were some &quot;deeper&quot; dungeons or ruins to explore, a bit more like Skyrim had, but the game is still a masterpiece RPG. And the in-game game of Gwent is pretty fun too.  I&apos;ve become obsessed with getting better Gwent cards...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5292054">Expand</a></span>

I only played an hour of The Witcher, but Witcher 2 was one of my favorite games. I was worried Witcher 3 was going to lose something in going open world, much like Inquisiton did. I was worried it wouldn&apos;t live up to my hopes, dreams, and imagination. I&apos;m happy to say it did. The only things that hinder the game are the inevitable glitches of an open world game, and minor issues. Interacting with the environment objects when trying to loot, Roach not wanting to go over bridges, and difficulty looting because your not in the exact right spot. The quest have not devolved into &quot;Collect 5 of these&quot; like Inquisiton somewhat did. Many complained about Inquisiton that the opening area was large, and all subsequent areas varied from slightly smaller to much smaller. Witcher 3 does the opposite. The opening area is relatively small. My first thought was, &quot; Oh **** Im going to blow through this in a week if it&apos;s this small. Then as soon as I finished the starting area I realized how immense the world was, and how filled it was with things to do. Every quest has character and importance to the local populace. I can go on for hours. Or at least an hour or two. The simplest way to put it is that this is the greatest Role Playing Game created to date. A must play for anyone who enjoys RPG&apos;s. CDProjekt accomplished what they set out to do. Now they just have to clean up the bugs, create some good DLC, and hopefully begin working on their next masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5282230">Expand</a></span>

What it&apos;s really important, the story, climate, immersion, filing and just pure pleasure, fact that you fill that you make a difference, choices which really matters and you take a while when balancing options, this all important things that made RPG a RPG, not a action game with rpg elements like Skyrim, this all important stuff is on Superior level to anything that I seen in last 13 years!

The developers have released two patches to address issues and community concerns already. I have 28 hours of playtime under my belt and I can honestly say this is the most fun I have had in a video game in over a decade. A single player video game, even longer. The Witcher 3 is a 10/10, CD Projekt Red has hit a home run with this one guys.
<br>
<br>The main difference between this game and other RPGs is the quests are all wonderful. Every side-quest is well thought out and fun to complete. There is absolutely none of that &quot;kill 10 x and loot 8 y&quot; nonsense that plagues modern RPGs like a pox. Everything I have experienced in this game has been consistently enriching and enjoyable. The Witcher 3 even comes loaded with a full-blown TCG that is associated with quests lines of its own that span the entire continent. I have enjoyed traveling from village to village to challenge innkeepers and win their special cards as much as I have enjoyed hunting monsters during witcher contracts.
<br>
<br>It has been a long time since I felt the need to eagerly listen to and dissect every piece of dialogue in a video game. The voice acting is top notch, leading to wonderful, compelling character encounters. In terms of side-quests there is so much to do, so many monsters to hunt, so many problems to solve, and so many Gwent cards to win that most players will find themselves completely overwhelmed in the best possible way.
<br>
<br>The combat is a stellar improvement over The Witcher 2, adapting to the type of monster you&apos;re encountering is probably the most exciting part for me. Bringing down a wyvern with a crossbow just feels wonderful, binding a wraith to the physical plain to do maximum damage really immerses you in the game. Preparing for a tough monster during a contract quest feels great, going in knowing you&apos;re prepared for the situation is as rewarding as collecting the sweet sweet loot after.
<br>
<br>It has been a long long time since a game convinced me it is occurring in its own world, but the Witcher 3 does it. The last time I felt this way was Ultima Online, circa 1997. Like I said at the beginning of my review, The Witcher 3 is a 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5266351">Expand</a></span>

The game is well optimized and run great considering how big the world is and the landscape, lightning and faces details are gorgeous. As for the gameplay, it&apos;s head and shoulders above Witcher 2, very pleased especially about how smooth the combat is, and the story is so damn immersive that I have to cut this review short and get back to it. So many things to do in a truly grandiose open world grander than anything you&apos;ve seen before.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5252774">Expand</a></span>

I have been a gamer for nearly 30 years, and every now and then a game company comes along and breaks with the trends of the day and delivers something innovative, something fresh, and something special. Witcher 3 is that type of trend breaking game. CDPR set out to break a few ideals with the whole monetized gaming trend and I for one am very thankful they did just that with their game. But Witcher 3 houses something different, that at first I was frustrated with, but as my time within the game grew, I started to realize exactly what I was experiencing.
<br>There are two schools of thought on providing players with a sense of choice and freedom within a game story system. Mass Effect, where the player is not aware of the choices long term impacts, yet has the freedom to return and correct their choices, or the Walking Dead style of choice where the player is granted knowledge of the choices they are about to make and thus can make a choice with some level of long term awareness. In both cases the sense of accountability and ownership of the choice is lost with the player, and thus, the choice losses its sense of purpose, or meaning, which hurts the story and the players experience within the game.
<br>Witcher 3 just changed player choice entirely. Here I became immediately annoyed at the sheer amount of choices from big to small, I was constantly having to make choices as to quests, side quests, main stories, exploration, how to handle a random encounter with bandits, and I was forced to give up trying to even track or pay attention to them all. It just becomes impossible, but in this annoyance I found peace, and a whole new immersive experience. Rather than trying to track my choices so I could attempt to know how my choices would work out later, I just gave up, and let the game work its magic on me. Now I was making choices out of my own feelings, emotions, and mood. If I hated a character I was dealing with, I might react too quickly or aggressively, or if I liked the character I might grant them their life, or let them keep their gold.
<br>But I was not prepared for the first full realization of my choices until much later when faced with a harsh situation, and my choices ended up costing someone their life. I will not spoil that moment for anyone, but trust me when Gerald ended up flashing back to important moments in my past choices, I realized just how responsible I was for that death. Now the magic here is I wanted to save this person but I could not even if I wanted to, see although I had made important choices are important moments, it really was the smaller choices in between those important moments that shaped the long term out come. I would have had to literally start my game over to have any hope of ensuring different choices for a possible different outcome. The choices are so numerous it caused me to feel ownership and be accountable for my choices, much in the same way we do in real life.
<br>That moment in Witcher 3 made me realize that CDPR have changed the industry and set a new high standard for player choice in games. Choices that should make the player aware of potential long term impacts were clear just as they would be in real life. The difference is that you had no idea how they would later impact the other multiple story lines within the game. Each having multiple further impacts, all building or taking away from long term changes. It was impossible to track, or understand how a moment earlier could potentially impact something long term later, and this was special.
<br>As a player I was now fully aware that how I reacted to even the smallest of situations had purpose, had depth, and was important to the world I was playing within Witcher 3. People felt alive, and reacted as such. For the first time in a video game I felt ownership for my choices, and I felt grief and sadness for what I had caused, even though I didn&apos;t know it until it was to late. For this reason, I have found myself excited about CDPR and Witcher 3.
<br>The game is beautiful on so many levels outside of just graphics, and honestly graphics should not be the purpose behind why a game succeeds or fails. Game play, story, immersion, and entertainment are all the right reasons to support a game. The ability for the story to be told on multiple levels, and through the use of player interaction with a world that is alive and fully aware of the player in that world, matters. You will find yourself wanting to know more about the smallest of side quests, and each one has its own story that you will care to learn and explore. Witcher 3 is a special game, many are not even aware of that fact yet, but they will soon enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5280399">Expand</a></span>

The only challenger on the horizon is Just Cause 3 &amp; that doesn&apos;t come out till Holiday 2015. You might want to set an alarm when playing as it is so  immersive you can easily lose track of time. Step aside Skyrim your RPG reign is at an end.</span>

<br>
<br>This is a truly deep and mature RPG, brutally hard on the two highest difficulty settings and requiring much, much more from the player than simple button mashing. This is a deep, complex, intelligent and mature RPG for a mature audience. The story goes to great lengths to avoid clich&#xE9;s, and even pokes fun at them at times. For someone like myself, who has more than 15 years of RPG experience, it is a real treat to be able to take part in this world.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t give out perfect 10/10 easily but here is a game that truly deserves it, CD Projekt RED has gone above and beyond to realize their vision. There are few niggles here and there, small things that could be improved perhaps. But knowing CD Projekt RED they will continue to polish this masterpiece a few more times before they finally call it done.
<br>
<br>If you like RPG&apos;s buying the Witcher 3 is a no brainer, it is a game you simply have to play. And when you do be sure to savour it and take your time. This is one of the finest RPG&apos;s of our generation</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5264098">Expand</a></span>

It demands a significant time investment however you are rewarded at every step. In a climate where gamers are being groomed to believe season passes, timed DLC and disc-locked content are completely acceptable, CD Projekt Red exists as a shining beacon in the darkness. They have delivered a beautiful and content-rich game to explore and a thrilling story to experience. In a rare move there is also DLC both large and small being offered free of charge down the line. It is obvious CD Projekt Red is comprised of gamers making games that they themselves would love and they deserve all the support we can muster. Do the industry a favour and vote with your wallet. Show the corporate fat cats that honesty and integrity are profitable commodities, and that games as an experience are supposed to transcend petty commercialism.
<br>
<br>The Witcher III is a reminder of what we used to take for granted as gamers. It gives you much more than the retail price attached to it, and stands as a proud entry developed by a great studio from which only more greatness can come in the future.

This sparked a &quot;Downgrade&quot; controversy that has 13 year olds claiming this game looks like a cartoony console port.
<br>Let me get this out of the way. Despite the &quot;downgraded&quot; visuals, this is the most visually stunning open world game I have seen so far. I am constantly stopping my horse and telling myself &quot;Geez, this looks amazing!&quot;.
<br>
<br>What&apos;s really incredible is how well it looks and performs with modest hardware. My i5 3570k+R9 280 handles the game just fine at 1080p with every thing set to Ultra except for shadows and foliage distance (set to High). Had this game been developed by Ubisoft, you would&apos;ve needed a Quad SLI/Crossfire set up to run it at 720P with only half the draw distance.
<br>
<br>There has also been claims of the game crashing. I started playing with patch 1.03 and have not had a single technical issue the 18hrs I&apos;ve played so far. Can you say the same about any other AAA title out there? CDProjectRed needs to be commended for delivering such a solid title, specially when you consider the scope of the game.
<br>
<br>Gameplay-wise, this is truly an evolution of previous Witcher games. The stories and environments are familiar but in a much grander scale. Complex political machinations are delivered in a simple enough way that even a simpleton like myself can understand, yet do not sacrifice any of the entertainment value.
<br>The combat is much better than previous titles. Don&apos;t expect tight controls like Dark Souls, but it is fun and  satisfying enough to stop it like feeling like a chore.
<br>
<br>I could go on forever talking about this game and how good it is. I really could! But let me just say it has been years since I bought a game that has made me stop my life just so I could play. The Witcher 3 has exceeded my expectations in every way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5269202">Expand</a></span>

<br>When a man that does not read more books than 2 per year and suddenly gets deeply addicted to the Witcher&apos;s series by Andrzej Sapkowski and read all 8 within 6 weeks - I tell you - it is something about that story.
<br>I highly recommend to enter the universe through the paper and then play (or play again ;) ).
<br>
<br>The people you meet, the places you visit and the situations you go through are getting even more interesting and absorbing. Remember you can also play two previous games!
<br>
<br>Enough about the back story.
<br>The game is just full of things I fell in love with in Sapkowki&apos;s books. Various quests, perfect surroundings (my joy is multiplied as I am from Poland and those Slavic accents are closer to my soul) outstanding characters, models, dubbing and the magic that is added through DETAILS.
<br>
<br>Not only visual details but the sense of humour, dialogues and other things that cannot be measured. That gives you an opportunity to join the game and enjoy it like no other.
<br>
<br>Just take that risk and go deep. Do not skip dialogues, read the books and feel the game, its magic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5264184">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m just an avid gamer and this is simply one of the best videogames ever released, period. I then searched for reviews on the internet and alas! many people crying over the graphical downgrade and rating this masterpiece with 1/10 and 2/10 hahahah! Madness! Seriously people stop puting your nose in the screens examining every pixel and enjoy this work of art. Someday I will expland this review (I hope), but I felt the urge to say something about the lame criticism this game is getting, it&apos;s beyond ridiculous. Btw, fear not because right now the optimization is really good. I&apos;m playing it on my 970M SLI laptop in Ultra (xept for the quantity of foliage and people (high) and hairworks off) and I&apos;m getting a clear and smooth 57-60 constant fps. I can&apos;t imagine how this game will be in a few months with a few updates and patches... Don&apos;t listen to &apos;graphics inquisition&apos; and do yourself a favor: Buy this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5263134">Expand</a></span>

<br>All pumping out on an old Logitech 5500 5.1 THX system.

<br>About 20 hours in and only 1 crash. None of this stuttering Nvidia folks seem to be complaining a lot about. No hard crashes. No jerky camera movement. Swordplay is fluid and dynamic. Entire world is breathing with things to see and do and conquer.
<br>
<br>By far the best open world RPG ever created. Hands down. I&apos;ve been gaming for 40 years and I&apos;ve yet experienced such a cinematic, fluid and creative rpg. If Cyberpunk (CDPR&apos;s next game) is as amazing as the 3rd Witcher we are in for a serious treat. Kudos.

<br>Graphics - 8/10 . Game looks awesome.Not as good as was shown during 2013 trailer .Gotta mid range PC so i would never have been able to make it run like that so i don&apos;t care.Facial animations are probably the best iv seen so far.Makes even the lowliest roadside merchant come alive. Only complaint is trees and foliage looks pretty bad under certain lightings.</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Absolutely Brilliant.

<br>Graphics - 8/10 . Game looks awesome.Not as good as was shown during 2013 trailer .Gotta mid range PC so i would never have been able to make it run like that so i don&apos;t care.Facial animations are probably the best iv seen so far.Makes even the lowliest roadside merchant come alive. Only complaint is trees and foliage looks pretty bad under certain lightings.
<br>
<br>Sound and Music - 10/10. Love the soundtracks personally. Side quests,merchants everything has voice acting and is done really well.
<br>
<br>Controls and combat - 10/10.Personally had no problem whatsoever with controls. Combat is precise and all about timing and am loving it.Monsters are done really well as they have done a good job separting each different types with their own style plus speed of attacking, dodging and all . Truly comes alive in the hardest two difficulty . If you don&apos;t lock on, target can switch unexpectedly if button mashing and if you do lock on, its hard to keep an eye on all the enemies. So jus take it slow and methodical for first few levels and soon ull be chopping heads off left and right. One problem people might have is with the FOV as it can&apos;t be changed plus some keys such as WASD can&apos;t be rebinded.
<br>
<br>Story and contents 9.5/10 - Been a long time fan of the series since the books plus the first two witcher. They have done a really good job of making the world come alive and meaningful side quests with superb voice acting plus cutscenes makes the game truly immersive. Only complaint is wish the hidden areas werent permanently marked on map and had to talk to people or find books,notes to unlock em.
<br>
<br>Inventory,alchemy and crafting 8/10 - Money is hard to come by and theres lotsa goodies to buy,craft and find. Loot everything u find.Almost everything can be sold or dismantled for crafting. Alchemy has been changed. Once u craft something its permanent with fixed number of uses .U jus need hard alcohol in ur inventory to refill it while meditating. I like this as u dont have to go around picking every herbs and plants as there are lots.Main gripe is inventory can get very cluttered and wish there was a sort button.
<br>
<br>Final verdict. 10/10. Gonna give it a perfect score. They&apos;ve done a brilliant job .Few complaints but rest of the game is soo good iam gonna overlook it .Plus its gonna have awesome mod support which will tenfold its longevity.
<br>The wait was worth it and am so satisfied with the product that i had to make an account and review it.Been gaming since the awesome Ultima series and this is my first time ever commenting on anything over the net.

<br>
<br>+ huge interesting world
<br>+ no dumb quests (DA inquisition treats you like a retard in that aspect even though you are allegedly superhero, in Witcher you are one of many cogs in the geopolitical and supernatural conflict and the quests  are just interesting)
<br>+ graphics, downgrade? just check the uber settings on PC.
<br>+ combat, was skeptical at first cuz of witcher 2 combat but WWH encapsulates how Geralt fought in the books, dodges, reading opponents, parades, quick jabs, rhythm and pace. Beauty!
<br>+ number of references to books and Slavic culture + other Polish writers. It&apos;s a pity that western players will miss some of those but there are so many other that I&apos;m sure they will catch and thoroughly enjoy.
<br>
<br>- i will let you know when (if) I find anything.
<br>
<br>Masterpiece, Skyrim&apos;s enjoyment of exploration, Red Dead Redemption lone badass feel, Mass Effect 2 quality of story and characters, countless little eastereggs and flavours and most importantly - climate and atmosphere of the books.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5260231">Expand</a></span>

The game is well optimized and run great considering how big the world is and the landscape, lightning and faces details are gorgeous. As for the gameplay, it&apos;s head and shoulders above Witcher 2, very pleased especially about how smooth the combat is, and the story is so damn immersive that I have to cut this review short and get back to it. So many things to do in a truly grandiose open world grander than anything you&apos;ve seen before.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5262221">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m probably one of the few that believed TW1&gt;TW2.
<br>
<br>For me, TW3 is the sequel TW1 deserved.

<br>I miss dice poker...
<br>
<br>Performance is great minus the pre-rendered cutscenes. Something needs to be fixes there.
<br>1080p 60fps[locked], all &apos;Ultra&apos; settings with &apos;High&apos; shadows and &apos;High&apos; foliage draw distance. No fancy hair either. GTX 970 + 3570K.</span>

<br>Anyways, the game still looks amazing as it is, right now! right f**king now! Graphics are better than DA:I (especially in tree/grass animation and weather system) if not much better. A litter worse than Crysis 3 tho. And yes, I agree that the downgrade is quite noticable. However, considering that my liquid cooling system with overclocked i7-4770K, 780TI SLI, and Z97 deluxe MB can barely run game at 60fps with 2x supersample AA for transparent textures set in NVidia Control Panel, I consider such an &quot;opotomization&quot; acceptable. Played it for 10 hours, give it 9/10 because of the graphics downgrade and a few CTD.
<br>
<br>Be reasonable, the game still deverses a 9/10 as it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5265527">Expand</a></span>

There are a few bugs here and there but nothing game breaking. The graphics are slightly different than that of the VGX trailer shown about 2 years ago, but they are still truly amazing. The world just looks gorgeous and it&apos;s more alive than anything i&apos;ve played so far.
<br>The game easily deserves a 9 or maybe even more. The reason i am giving it a 10 is because of all the zero that keep popping up. A person that gives this game a zero has obviously NEVER played it or is just a hater and biased against it.
<br>A truly magnificent game, buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5261963">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m not extremely familiar with a lot of technical language so forgive me if this isn&apos;t the most. I am probably one of the few gamers that care more about story then I necessarily about play; however there has definitely been games in the past that have been unplayable for me due to strange mechanics.
<br>
<br>With said, I feel like the game play mostly follows suit with the previous witchers, especially the second one. There are times it&apos;s harder to control Geralt, and when I&apos;m fighting, especially by edges, I find myself tumbling down the side of it.
<br>
<br>Despite the &quot;down grade&quot; I think the graphics are definitely up to standard and on my computer I can&apos;t even play max settings; I have heard that max setting don&apos;t change that much from medium or high, however they look fine to me. I have a bigger issue with the lack of motion within the camera, and my ability to control it more so then the graphics.
<br>
<br>Anyway, despite some issues I have with how the mechanics of the game play, or interface work, I find the story and world thrilling.
<br>
<br>I like the fact that Geralt in this game as so many more options when it comes to gear and customizing him. The world is dark and grim; the witcher and game of thrones have much in common.
<br>
<br>Because I find the world and the story so fascinating and view playing RPGs as interacting with a novel (or something along those lines).
<br>

It has really really breathtaking graphics, and I&apos;m surprised how well it runs on my GTX 660, the card being the minimum specs but still running on high in solid 30 FPS. It&apos;s huge notch up from the trilogy&apos;s earlier games, Geralt now has emotions, as do the others, very well put up together, so all in all, the acting and dialogues are really superb. The story is really compelling, and gameplay-wise it plays really smoothly, with little minor problems being movement, for example Geralt strafes forward in a whim when you tap the buttons. The world is truly open, with satisfying content all over, the loot gets you feeling every time, not spoiling you though.

I was engrossed within the story in a few minutes of starting the game which adds to the overall sense of the atmosphere.  Superb voice acting which is something I always appreciate.  The combat system is what is always is in the Witcher, some love it some could do without it.  Have found a few minor bugs, one quest would not finish because of how I entered the area I found a clue out of sequence, but reloaded and finished no problem.  Have not had that problem on other quest.  Overall very happy with the game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5254837">Expand</a></span>

I have put about two and a half hours in so far and I love everything in it, the only real downside so far is that when riding your horse around it can become quite difficult to make him go where you want to, but you get used to it quickly. I especially like the way that they have made it so that you do not have to had already played the previous Witcher games to enjoy Wild Hunt. I&apos;d still say it&apos;s a good idea so that you can remember who some of the returning characters are, but it is not necessary. From what I&apos;ve heard about the console versions, it does not run too well. especially on PS4. But the consoles will always struggle to keep up with the PC version and for me at least I have been fully able to run the game maxed out with over 60 FPS constantly. If you are a fan of The Witcher or RPGs in general, then the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is a game for you. With over 100 hours playtime just for the campaign, I believe this to be one of the best made games yet, hence the high rating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5260354">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Why are you so with the fans? That is with you since 2007? Or maybe even earlier. It originally came out Witcher for PC. To hell with Rockstar, they need the money, but you do it? If the console can not draw such a picture , why do not you do this for the PC what was?
<br>
<br>Ah ... CDPR what you&apos;ve done , I&apos;m very much cried when I realized that you did downgrade the graphics ... the whole atmosphere lost . Maybe I do not understand , but one thing I know ... Money talks , yes, talks in this age of **** money and connections . I am very disappointed , because I have never doubted and always has been for you. But from that moment , my faith in you shaken.
<br>
<br>CD PROJEKT RED I will still be with you, but just more do not do it , I&apos;m sick and not me alone , have a lot of PC gamers.

<br>Pros:
<br>-Finally I feel like Im a witcher, not just a dude with swords. Quests, contracts, citizens attitude, witcher sense, combat. Everything adds to this feeling. I didnt have it in W2, I have it now.
<br>-Even being tuned down, graphics looks awesome. Especially characters faces and towns.
<br>-Amazing soundtrack that adds to the mood.
<br>-Combat and particularly battles against big monsters. Reminded me of Monster Hunter series. Absolutely awesome on Death March, make me sweat, curse but so satisfying when I finally beat these big bastards.
<br>-Story, quests and storytelling in general are top notch. The pacing is also very good.
<br>-Rather balanced economy. I dont **** coin and have to choose where to spend it. Alot goes for food since there is no auto regen on highest difficulty.
<br>-Horse riding is fluent and feels great.
<br>-Huge world. It took me 11 hours to just finish first tutorial map. I can see spending hundreds of hours finishing everything. And there is so much to see and explore.
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-Freezes and crashes in the beginning. Shame that they had so much time to polish game and released it with critical bugs.
<br>-I dont like changes to alchemy. Would rather see ingredients being useful throught the game.
<br>-Alot of upgrades to signs and alchemy are meh. I can hardly justify spending points there.
<br>-Sometimes looting can be a pain since you have to stay directly in front of object.
<br>-Some armors look silly on Gerald.
<br>-They had to limit looting inside village houses. I feel like a bandit robbing everyone and it wastes too much time.
<br>-No cooking. It would fit well here instead of just eating raw meat.
<br>
<br>But pros far outweight cons. The game is definetly one of the best RPGs ever made and you just dont want to leave this brutal but damn interesting world. Well done CD Project RED.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5258928">Expand</a></span>

Pillars of Eternity was awesome, but I can not remember the last time a video game world has sucked me in like this one. The amount of content is staggering, but unlike most other open world games, it never feels stale or repetitive. Every side quest feels unique, and almost every small &quot;?&quot; on the map leads to a new mystery to unravel, or treasure to be discovered. There are so many villages to liberate, caves and temples to explore, and missing people to find, that you almost forget that there was even a main storyline in the first place. In this regard, it is much like Elder Scrolls games, but with more unique and interesting back stories to each quest.
<br>
<br>The combat is a vast improvement over the previous 2 games in the series, and is quite enjoyable and challenging. The main story arc, although I am not that far into it, seems incredible so far. I have a medium level rig, and on medium/high settings, the game runs smooth as silk, and it is a gorgeous, so no complaints in that department. The only negatives I have been able to spot so far have been some minor clipping issues, and the movement can be a little awkward at times. Nothing major to detract from one of the greatest games I can remember playing in quite some time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5260711">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Witcher 3 have a fairly monumental life. Art direction that pushes to contemplation, a dense open world in which we like to get lost in the discovery of new places.  Witcher 3 have a unique atmosphere, with very striking passages. The quality of the writing of quests and their interconnection is amazing !
<br>
<br>it is a masterpiece !

<br>Meilleur jeu de l&apos;ann&#xE9;e!
<br>The Witcher 3 est un beau jeu. Witcher 3 est ph&#xE9;nom&#xE9;nale. Witcher 3 est un monde ouvert magnifique qui juxtapose la violence avec la beaut&#xE9;. Il est un fantastique d&#xE9;taillant r&#xE9;v&#xE8;le les cons&#xE9;quences de vos actions. La conception des armures et leur beaut&#xE9;, le syst&#xE8;me de potion, et les mises &#xE0; niveau des signes fournissent un excellent sens de la croissance (je suis d&apos;accord avec Gamespot)
<br>The Witcher 3 a une vie assez monumentale. Une direction artistique qui pousse &#xE0; la contemplation, un monde ouvert dense dans lequel nous aimons &#xE0; se perdre dans la d&#xE9;couverte de nouveaux endroits. Witcher 3 a une atmosph&#xE8;re unique, avec des passages m&#xE9;morables. La qualit&#xE9; de l&apos;&#xE9;criture des qu&#xEA;tes et leur interconnexion est incroyable!
<br>
<br>C&apos;est un chef-d&apos;&#x153;uvre!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5254157">Expand</a></span>

A beautifully realized art style and most of all, takes centre stage in using all the modern gfx tech you could wish for. The only criticism I have is that the game didn&apos;t take advantage of AMD&apos;s TressFx2.0 and Mantle API support as well as Nv Hairworks; but this is so minor because a top end AMD GFX card is still capable of producing the goods even on Nvidia Optimized code. One NOT to miss. I look forward to a DirectX 12 version of the game in the coming months for even more awesomeness!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5260734">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve read all the books, finished the prequels and now that this baby is finally released, all I can say is that it was definitely worth the waiting and money.
<br>
<br>This game is definitely the best RPG I&apos;ve played to date, I&apos;ve got 14 hours game time in 1 day and I can&apos;t get away from it. The atmosphere, the story, the gameplay, everything is brilliant.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m playing on the second hardest setting and have more or less cleared the first area (all points of interest, etc.), and I can say it was fairly difficult and now that I&apos;m in Velen the game is really challenging at times. I think I&apos;ve died about 30 times so far, quick-saves are really important, even though auto-saves work pretty good too.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve nothing bad to say about the game. The talk about downgrade is completely baseless and untrue. The game looks better to me than on the gameplay trailers and even if you don&apos;t like how it looks now, you can always mod it or tweak the .ini settings to make it look differently.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5259893">Expand</a></span>

I like the books and played The Witcher 2, which I liked but did not love like a lot of people, but I couldn&apos;t bring myself to play the dated original Witcher game. I loved Skyrim, but this far exceeds it, IMO. Fantastic graphics, gameplay, and story. On top of that, CDPR has been extremely consumer-friendly, with no DRM and free DLC. Even if you hate open world RPGs, I don&apos;t see how anyone could deny the quality of this title. It certainly raises the bar.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5255908">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphics are stunning, even in low settings. The trees sway in wind and bend when it&apos;s stormy! How cool is that?
<br>
<br>Overall I couldn&apos;t recommend the game more, I have played over 8 hours during the first day and just had to write a little review here. Oh and Geralt grows a mighty beard when days pass in the game, that is awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5260000">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>After deactivating the Nvidia Hairworks programm everything runs smooth and fine on ultra settings and all activated post processing effects.
<br>
<br>The Witcher 3 is like a fullfilling of every pc gamers dream...A huge, impressive open world...great written and very human characters....a ton of quests and an unbelievable immersive gaming atmosphere.
<br>
<br>In short words....I am in love with Geralt and his world :)
<br>
<br>Thx CD Red Project....In contrast to Rockstar Nord also the preload and installing of the game worked without any problem.
<br>
<br>All dumbs up for the best roleplay game ever!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5260351">Expand</a></span>

There was many complaints about downgrade graphic, but its barely noticeable, for me at least its still look gorgeous. Sometime there are some problems with camera. Its one of the best action RPG, mix Red Dead, Skyrim, DA:I with Witcher 2.</span>

<br>
<br>That said, the amazing depth to the game, that takes you so far in that you lose yourself, more than makes up for it. Granted I am only level 3 at the moment and it&apos;s been out about 48 hours, I can only say I&apos;ve scratched the surface.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m running an I7-2600k at 5GHz and a GTX-970 at 1420MHz, and at everything 100% ultra settings. I average anywhere from 40-50 FPS, so that&apos;s why I gave it a 9. With only the slightest decrease  in graphics I can get 10 more frames so it isn&apos;t too bad really I suppose, I&apos;m just a complainer lol.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5263329">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So far i&apos;ve played for about 5 hours and the game has a fantastic atmosphere, music and visuals. The combat system seems very fluid and satisfying (big step forward compared to 2nd instalment). Writting is as always outstanding. The world looks and feels alive. Even the smallest quests I encountered are well written and simply interesting. Everything looks astonishing and runs great on i5-4570, 8GB and msi gtx 760 2GB Twin Froz in 1080p on high settings (number of background character on ultra and shadows on medium) with depth of field, blur, ssao, light shafts, sharpening, vignette on. I have solid 30fps (with 30 fps cap)
<br>
<br>Now I am sitting in my job, writting this review but the only thing I can think of is where will I go and what will I do as Geralt. This is how modern RPGs should look - with great technology but not deprived of the most important aspects of this genre: great story, characters, choices and depth - this game will not offend your intelligence (and i am a long-time fan of Planscape Torment, Vampire: Bloodlines, Fallout 1&amp;2 and Arcanum fan). Now run to the store and buy it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5259186">Expand</a></span>

<br>You won&apos;t find any forced lecture on transgenderism in Witcher 3 which is refreshing after playing the Inquisition debacle.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s compare:
<br>
<br>Triss looks like a woman, Cassandra Pentaghast looks like a man.
<br>Ciri is simply gorgeous, Sera looks like gollum.
<br>Yennefer&apos;s beauty captures the imagination, Josephine&apos;s face is terrifying.
<br>
<br>Witcher 3 introduces thought provoking and intellectually stimulating content. Quests don&apos;t feel like simple fetch &amp; kill quests. It feels like an old Bioware game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5261366">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Combat is excellent with lots of depth - between your crossbow, swords, magic signs, bombs, potions, and the specific environment, you can approach combat in many different ways. The game is also legitimately difficult - I&apos;m playing on the 2nd hardest setting and dying quite a bit.
<br>
<br>Writing is is very high quality, with some of the best dialogue I&apos;ve ever heard in video games, and tons of humor. Characters are interesting and feel realistic.
<br>
<br>Open world exploration is possible and you can swim, dive, jump, and climb most of the environments you see. I haven&apos;t explored that much yet, but so far it feels a lot like Skyrim with the ability to find cool loot, monsters, quests,  etc. In addition, there&apos;s tons of side-quests that are actually interesting and not something stupid like &quot;fetch me 10 goat horns&quot;.
<br>
<br>Tons of choices available in terms of dialogue, backstory (helps recreate your choices from previous Witcher games), and so on. You can really play YOUR OWN way - be an **** a &quot;hero&quot;, or something in between.
<br>
<br>Lots of attention to detail -  things like timed dialogue, smooth controls, meaningful dilaogue choices, easy to follow markers / explanations for quests and new concepts (like creating potions for the first time), small improvements like being able to automatically follow the road when mounted.
<br>
<br>The game also looks amazing and runs really well - I&apos;m getting 35-50 FPS with a gtx 660 TI GPU and a i5-4670 CPU with medium/high settings.
<br>
<br>Only reason I won&apos;t give it a 10/10 is because the game is crashing frequently for a lot of people right now, and because I haven&apos;t had the time to try everything out yet. Overall though, CDPR definitely delivered on their promises. The PC crowd has been waiting patiently for another high quality RPG, and Witcher 3 is that game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5253138">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are simply stupendous and a cut above what you&apos;re used to with open world RPGs, running at full 1080p. As for the open world, it&apos;s absolutely massive, with so much to see and do. You have the main quest, which is told with superbly production values thanks to excellent voice acting, nicely detailed faces, and good animations for the most part. Then you also have the side quests, which unlike many other RPGs where the side quests merely feel like filler, there&apos;s a lot more to them here - many of the side quests feel like self-contained stories with satisfying payoffs. In terms of the gameplay, you&apos;ll be exploring this massive world, collecting loot, leveling up, unlocking new abilities, and doing everything one would expect from a modern day RPG. Then there&apos;s the combat, which may seem different than you&apos;re used to at first, and may seem more challenging than some other RPGs since the combat seems to be a lot more animated than most RPGs, but once you master it - and you will - you will love it. I especially love how you can either roll away from enemy attacks, block them, parry them, or my favorite, sidestep them stylishly. All in all, The Witcher 3 is a game that every RPG owner should own.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5258757">Expand</a></span>

If I leave it on unlimited framerate I get between 60-80fps. This is on ultra with just hairworks completely OFF. Its a lot better if I leave the framerate limiter locked at 60, that way it stays rock solid and doesn&apos;t dip, outdoors or indoors. The game is very immersive, with great quests, characters and exploration that is rewarded. Combat is a bit of an improvement on Witcher 2, not amazing but functional and fun. Overall really happy that its met my expectations. 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5256462">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This game is amazing. Wild Hunt is the best RPG game of the year. Combat is fast and fun. Alchemy and crafting is great. Soundtracks are beautiful. In my opinion i didn&apos;t play any game like this in years. Skyrim is always the best for me but Witcher is the second best.</span>

Although some issues are present, such as the lack of a truly open world, the game has one of the best stories, music and graphics ever presented to players. The combat system has been improved greatly, and the sad, depressing and gray world of the Witcher 3 will challenge your moral stands more than once throughout the game.</span>

<br>
<br>Sunrises and Sunsets are awe-inspiring, its a visual and technical masterpiece; in any genre let alone the Open World &apos;genre&apos; - Walking into the game world of the witcher for those who havent played TW1 and TW2 Assasins of Kings, I suppose imagine walking into (if you are newer school Skyrim? the first time and multiplying that feeling of &quot;oh holy crap&quot; by one thousand due to the beauty, depth, scope, no load times to transition, and various color pallettes being used).
<br>
<br>The combat is arguably perfect - While some reviews state that it is very much an improved Witcher 2 combat system; I feel a lot more from it, in The Witcher 2 you could not one button (alt+direction) parry, and dodge; nor have the precise counter-attacks that are now present - It feels fast and fluid, and it needs to as playing in the third or the fourth difficulty (the two highest) you&apos;ll get whooped if you don&apos;t time, parry, riposte or counter etc - It&apos;s poetry in gorgeous GORE-GEOUS motion.
<br>Also the crossbow ends up being a godsend - Hilarity ensues when you turn a foes head into giblets with a critical head DEAD center from a good distance.
<br>
<br>Just prepare to lose your life or wife - or both.
<br>The Witcher 3 is all the hype and more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5253412">Expand</a></span>

The vastness on the environment and its beauty, the voice acting and general high production levels, the greatly enhanced and intuitive interface, the combat system. The game does have some quirky movements, but those are easily ignored in face of to the overall quality.</span>

Texture work is excellent, the models (especially main characters) are very detailed. And the best part is it runs with almost all but the most resource intensive settings maxed out even on mid-range hardware. Forget the system recommendations, they have all been vastly overstated, no doubt in part because of hardware manufacturers trying to pushing their latest gear down our throats. The engine scales nicely in both directions so even a PC  that could run TW on max back in the day can still run this on med-high details at 1080p with fluid frame rate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5254390">Expand</a></span>

The keyboard+mouse controls are a bit weird at first, namely having the dodge key default to ALT. Pressing alt while pressing WASD requires uncomfortable thumb gymnastics. Also, there&apos;s fortunately no mouse acceleration, as far as I can tell. I&apos;d imagine a controller&apos;s 360 degree analog movement is better for this kind of game anyways than the 8 directions of WASD.
<br>
<br>Story:
<br>It&apos;s Witcher, enough said.
<br>
<br>Graphics:
<br>The game looks very good. I avoided watching any of the trailers or pre-release footage, so I am not sure about the graphics downgrade, but on ultra it is easily one of the best looking games on PC to date. The optimization/frame rate is also very good. With a single GTX 970, I am running on ultra (except for foliage distance, which is on high since it has significant FPS impact) at 1080p and the frame rate almost never dips below 60 FPS.
<br>
<br>Audio:
<br>AMAZING voice acting, music, and sound effects. A lot of multiplatform games these days are 50 or 60 GB (Titanfall, CoD, etc.), where 90 percent of it is uncompressed audio meant to fill up the disks on the console versions. This game is 26 GB, yet has some of the best sound I&apos;ve heard in a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5255332">Expand</a></span>

Even when I went on a three hour epic quest after rope that I needed to make an armor set (seriously, rope is rarer than diamonds in this game!), I enjoyed the search and stumbled upon a lot of fun and interesting details and encounters in the world I probably wouldn&apos;t have found otherwise. The world CDProjekt Red has created is one that I cannot but praise. I find most open worlds to be uninteresting after a few hours, and oftentimes the story in such games isn&apos;t interesting enough for me to continue it, so I end up wandering aimlessly around the world until I quit and never play again. Fortunately both the world, story, quests and its inhabitants were more than enough to keep me playing for hours on end.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a fan of the previous Witcher games, I see no reason for you not to enjoy this one immensely. If you&apos;re coming in looking for another Skyrim or a fantasy GTA, you&apos;re probably going to be disappointed. The Witcher 3 is first and foremost a story-driven RPG, not a sandbox. When I looked back at the story and characters in The Witcher 2 (a game I love greatly, despite its flaws), I realised how much better TW3 did these things. I have yet to encounter a semi-important character that isn&apos;t interesting in some way or a quest outside of monster and treasure hunts that doesn&apos;t have an interesting story to tell or a twist that turns everything on its head.
<br>
<br>But do note that this is the opinion of someone who loves the previous games and mature, dark fantasy in the same vein as Game of Thrones. It&apos;s important to note that the PC performance is somewhat iffy, the graphics have been &quot;downgraded&quot; from the first trailers, the options for PC are underwhelming and when you reach the edges of the world, you are turned around (sometimes the edges are at very odd places, like the middle of a small island).. These things don&apos;t bother me enough to give it a lesser score, but could be enough to greatly annoy other people. So, as always, do take a score with a grain of salt, especially on Metacritic where people speak with 10s and 0s, and everything in between are as rare as golden dragons.
<br>
<br>Oh, and Gwent, Gwent is addictive and could have been a small release on its own. Too few people mention Gwent, because to me that little card game is a huge plus.
<br>
<br>As a story-driven, open world RPG with more than serviceable combat, and as a Witcher game, it is to me a 10/10, and probably one of my all time favorite games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=5253938">Expand</a></span>
