Strife which require a lot of thinking and planing. Maybe it has some bugs, but in my opinion this game is a very important position for every fan or RTSs. Cheers.</span>

Anyways, english voice acting is probably terrible (the czech one is, but it&apos;s the laughable kind of terrible) aand that&apos;s probably it on the negative side of things. Story is interesting, characters are as well, lots of options, the 2D graphics still looks pretty good, missions have great variability, overal gameplay is unique, challenging and fun.

While I realize its an older game I noticed the voice acting is TERRIBLE! It was so bad I actually had to turn off character voices. Most of the characters chaffed me from the start, the female characters sounded like teenage boys who had their audio tweaked. Half of the male characters remind me of Kyle Schwartz from South Park (dont know who he is, look him up!) The other half remind me of the stereotypical Duke Nukem style character that was incredibly popular in that era.
<br>
<br>On top of this, the game play feels slow and sluggish. Its not bad but it could have been done quite a bit better. Other games, which came out around the same time, had better game play despite minimal rpg elements (which is honestly, the only thing worthwhile in this game)... If they could have taken similar controls and gameplay to ground control, they would have been golden.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/original-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=4415696">Expand</a></span>

<br>Real-time strategy (RTS) game with role-playing (RPG) elements. Story is based on novel The Last Day of Creation (1981, by Wolfgang Jeschke). Game has been designed by Vladimir Chvatil (author of many well known board games).
<br>
<br>*** Mechanics ***
<br>Three different nations (USA, Russia, Arab) basically with only one (and same) unit - human. In a game you control usually from 1 to 10 human units. Player cannot create them and when they die, there is no way how to replace them. There are 4 classes in a game:
<br>1) Worker (creates, repairs and dismantle buildings, gather resources,...)
<br>2) Soldier (best fighting statistics, can crawl)
<br>3) Engineer (creates and repairs cars/tanks,...)
<br>4) Researcher (heals units, research new technology,...)
<br>These classes (or &quot;kits&quot;) are identical for all three nations. There is one additional specific class for every nation: USA has sniper, Russia has rocketman, Arab has mortarman. Every unit (human) has its name and experience levels in each of these four classes (which separately grows when used, and thus unit is becoming more powerful in it). Only one class is active at each time (you can freely change active class in appropriate building without any penalization) and a unit has special abilities only from this active class. Player can create additional mechanical units (cars and tanks) which are designed by mounting together different weapons, chassis, engines and control (needs driver; is remotely controlled by driver or is controlled by own computer and does not need human control,...). Human units can enter or exit car/tank anytime and you can even steal car/tank of your enemy.
<br>
<br>*** Overall feeling and flaws ***
<br>The fact that you have just limited supplies of manpower and each of your soldiers has a name and experience and together with story makes unique immerse RPG atmosphere.
<br>The game has simple and in the same time one of the best mechanics for controlling units (you can create queue and even loops of orders).
<br>Graphic is decent isometric 2D with relatively low resolution (even in the time when the game has been released, year 2001, the graphic was average).
<br>Another flaw is missing AI (Artificial Intelligence). Campaign is scripted (and it is done very well) but once you finished it there is no &apos;skirmish&apos; option (to play against computer opponent in multiplayer map). You can still play against human opponents.
<br>
<br>*** Summary ***
<br>It is, in my opinion, unique and extremely well prepared game and unfortunately also really underrated game. Highly recommended!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/original-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=4196427">Expand</a></span>

Their reviews are just prejudi(A)ce(EGG), and simply lack of love games. Their opinions makes me think that they have never played the game more than 5-6 hours. This game needs more work to understand it like the classic novels. Understanding &apos;Crime and Punisment&apos; novel of Dostoyevski is even more simple from understanding this game totally.
<br>The bad reviews are just because of unwillingness of the reviewers to understand this game. Reviewers of big magazines are victimising it because of their own lack of patience and laziness.
<br>And they have admitted it by saying that the game is &quot;confusing&quot; in their reviews.
<br>From its&apos;s release date in 2001 until 2006 it has been updated by the developers and after that time it is being updated by the support community, nearly all of its&apos; bugs and problems are solved. But still there are problems. The most important ones are:
<br>- No skirmish ai
<br>- A complete scenario about &apos;arabian-mercenary side&apos;
<br>- Slowness of the game which makes to lost your time sense totally.
<br>- It is addictive
<br>- Playing online is hard because of the trolling. Community needs a lesson of proprieties because they have none.
<br>But still those problems above won&apos;t make this game a total crapp piece it has only needs a little bit of artistic touch.
<br>Even at this stage i can say that it has a better scenario from Red alert 2-3 and their expantions; but it can&apos;t beat the C&amp;C3 in neither game mechanics voices and graphics nor in scenario. But uniquness of its&apos; game play mechanics makes you addict to it.
<br>Normally i would not compare it with C&amp;C series because this game has slow mechanics unlike RA or Starcraft or Warcraft series. Because every soldiers have a personality that makes you feel you are really commanding humans not some stupid clones and they are not replaceble after death. They will be gone forever. With this fact at hand comparing it with red alert looks really ridiculus.
<br>
<br>This game is much more closer to games like Supreme Commander, Men of War, Company of Heroes and even with Total War and had to be compared with them not the other way around.
<br>It&apos;s mechanics had been used by Perimeter, so calling them stupid is stupid.
<br>
<br>And there is the last; this game should be compared with Sins of a Solar Empire; because they are both boringly slow but they also has the power of eachothers weaknesses like:
<br>Sins of a Solar empire has no Scenario mod on the other hand OW has no skirmish AI.
<br>
<br>After all i said above i hope the reviewers would create a little more free time to play it, properly.
<br>note:MantrimasZ i hope we can play it together ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/original-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3966649">Expand</a></span>
