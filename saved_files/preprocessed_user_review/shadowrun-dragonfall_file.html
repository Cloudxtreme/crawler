The campaign creator is simple to use and pretty flexible, hopefully a large community forms for it so that we can see it pushed to its limit.</span>

It seems, the game offers very little novelty over the original. It&apos;s still a good game, but not a great one.
<br>
<br>The gameplay consists of a set of several runs (less than 10) in different locations, most of which are very linear and really do not require any creative thought to solve. You go through a location, click on white thingies which are either always visible, or are highlighted with ALT. For each one of these interactive points, there can be some &quot;special&quot; option, most likely decking, biology or strength. Corporate and security etiquettes got me through most of the game, haven&apos;t really seen the need for others.
<br>
<br>All the fights I&apos;ve encountered on &quot;Hard&quot; difficulty were much easier than the first game, and the AI to put it bluntly is retarded. AI does not know how to use directional cover, and wastes half (1 out of 2) AP each turn on pointless moving around. This literally halves it&apos;s effectiveness, as I can heal the most recent wound easily, and there&apos;s little need for medkits. The only really hard fight was a side mission involving ghouls.
<br>
<br>In terms of decking, there appears to be more simultaneous &quot;fight while your decker hacks&quot; encounters, but I found decking to be totally lackluster. Playing as a non-decker, all decking was done for me by an party member who was always high enough to pass all skill checks. Within the matrix, he won every single fight easily, using the same set of 4 skills. Most of the encounters in the matrix involve 3ICs guarding a node. I think the original game had more challenging and diverse decking scenarios with black ICs and more varied special ICs.
<br>
<br>Story was decent, and the amount of dialogue is more than in a typical RPG nowadays, although a lot of this dialogue was predictable and exists only to outline the set and setting. 10 minutes on the shadowrun wiki and you already know most of the things that NPCs will try to tell you about:.
<br>
<br>Overall, a good game, worth 15$, but not much more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-dragonfall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4028825">Expand</a></span>

Fights seem to be a little more difficult than in DMS (which I consider a good thing). PC skills and stats are taken into account a lot more during the course of the adventure.</span>

It&apos;s a half-hearted attempted to make you feel something but, in the end, it falls short. There is nothing here. The idea was to take you on a journey to another part of the Shadowrun world; Berlin.In reality, they simply used google translate to come up with some BS to keep you involved (and failing miserably). I felt as if the game were more a chore, than an adventure for which I had paid. I hate to berate a good company that is bringing a good genre back to life, but this effort was less than sufficient. Somewhere between expansion and DLC, by the time you complete this game you will not be appeased  as a supporter. In this era of Kickstarter (where companies can legally rip you off without recompense) you will find that they are more interested in the almighty dollar than the creation of actual art. From the character screen, to the stupid UI that is your inventory (why can&apos;t I give Glory some real cyberware? Why can&apos;t I give my team better gear?), stupid AI that is anything but challenging on a real level, to the inability to modify your party... this game is half-baked. At best, your character will shine as the boss - better at everything. Everyone in the team is a piece of crap except you. At worst, you&apos;ll be carrying your ineffectual team on your back with no ability to affect the outcome. The story is flat. The characters are flat. This is just a waste of time. I am disappoint.
<br>
<br>On the positive side, I will say that the game is pretty stable. In time where I thought I was headed for a total crash, I found that the game recovered. As my stash increased, I also noticed that the load times increased. All in all, I would recommend this game ONLY to the most hardcore of fans. If you are on the fence, look elsewhere. There&apos;s not exactly a plethora of cyberpunk games out there, but there is the hop[e that Cyberpunk will come through.
<br>
<br>P.S. Shadowrun and Cyberpunk 20XX are both shameless thieves of William Gibson&apos;s &quot;Neuromancer&quot; (even going so far as to use words such as: Matrix, Sprawl, ICE, many others, etc...). Although said book, in present age, is not so great (it took me 5 attempts to finally finish it, and I was displeased (for reasons similar to this game (flat characters, lack of realism)) )
<br>
<br>Reality Check: We need to do better than this, people. This is not a great RPG (the RPG is very simple, very limited compared to the Pen and Paper (PnP) version), this is not a great story, and this is not a fun game. I hate to say it but, since the dawning of video games, the imagination factor has taken a total back seat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-dragonfall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4052895">Expand</a></span>

I loaded the autosave which has been set in this hideout before dialog between me and the gangleader should accure, now no dialog, nothing happens and therefore I lost 1 hour of gameplay. -3 points because of those and some other obvious bugs, like a bug with Knight Errant, they arrive even though they shouldn&apos;t.

The universe of Shadowrun is very interesting to me, I mean its cyberpunk mixed with magic and there are elves, trolls, gnomes etc who wouldn&apos;t love that but the developers f****** it up the game is s***. Whoever supported Shadowrun on kickstarter got ripped of honestly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-dragonfall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4061764">Expand</a></span>

<br>If X-COM and Fire Emblem had a baby in the Matrix, this would be it. Shadowrun Dragonfall is even better than Shadowrun Returns, both of which are just a breath of fresh air in the RPG and turn-based strategy worlds.
<br>
<br>This has all the turn-based goodness of X-COM and FIre Emblem, but all the RPG mastery of Divinity Original Sin and the best of Dragon Age.
<br>
<br>The story is truly exciting. But the WRITING ITSELF IS PHENOMENAL. It is as good as the best sci-fi novel, with details and scene setting that takes your mind to details that the already superb graphics don&apos;t.
<br>
<br>I have already backed Shadowrun: Hong Kong and look forward to whatever this studio tries to do. But they have pretty much combined my two favorite genres into a perfect game. Just make sure to get the Director&apos;s Cut.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-dragonfall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4956679">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The bad: Having just finished playing the recent XCOM, the battle mechanics are very lacking. Trying to guess how the line of sight works in any given situation is awful. The controls are super clunky and on top of that you aren&apos;t even told the key binds in game, making matters a lot worse if you don&apos;t look them up. The battles picked up in how interesting they were towards the end of the game when you earn an extra action point. The problem there is that the game ends shortly afterwards! Also, there are NO new spells. It&apos;s the same old from the base game in that regard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-dragonfall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4100917">Expand</a></span>

Great writing with plenty of character development to drive the text forward.  Combat is much more varied with a decent level of challenge.  Choice does matter, especially if you want to delve deeper into the stories of your companions who actually matter in this installment.  This DLC really allows the systems to shine and the story is really well done.  Atmosphere is great and the art style is even more appealing than Dead Man&apos;s Switch.  If you are wondering if you should buy this DLC I will say DEFINITELY DO - its the only way to make the base game purchase worthwhile unless you are into generating custom content or trying the community creations.
<br>
<br>TL;DNR:  Dragon Fall DLC makes it worthwhile to own the base game and is a vast improvement over Dead Man&apos;s Switch, the base campaign.
<br>
<br>Technology/engine: 5: Nothing to get excited over.
<br>
<br>AI: 7: Serviceable and improved over the initial campaign.
<br>
<br>Graphics: 9: The art style continues to be very appropriate and engaging and Berlin as a setting is great.
<br>
<br>Sound: 6: The ambient sounds are serviceable as are the effects for combat.
<br>
<br>Soundtrack: 6:Serviceable but repetitive.  Nothing to get too excited over.
<br>
<br>Voice acting: N/A
<br>
<br>Crafting: N/A
<br>
<br>Customization: 4: Not much there - is really a minor thing and seems to be an obligatory inclusion as an afterthought.
<br>
<br>Gameplay systems: 9: This campaign makes the systems shine and delivers what should have been in the initial installment.
<br>
<br>Controls: 5:  Very, very simple point and click.
<br>
<br>Story: 10: Well written and great character development that drives the text forward and makes it appealing to find out more and see what happens next.  A vast improvement over Dead Man&apos;s Switch and a real campaign.  Choices seem meaningful and have impact.  As this game relies HEAVILY on the story to drive it forward, this is the most critical aspect.

<br>
<br>Sure graphic wise that game has not much to offer though, but quest wise this game is up with the best in the genre. Seldom mattered decisions you made in a game more than in this Shadowrun campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-dragonfall/user-reviews?user_review_id=5310010">Expand</a></span>

Probably because of the better narration while I still felt it should have been a much better game overall. The game is an upgrade of the older title probably in every way, though still very limited. It has good pace all around, some more stuff in it, few more skills. That said, most of its predecessor flaws stay the same. So it is a better version at best, not a different game. If you hated SR, you will hate Dragonfall. At 80% of the game`s story I felt exhausted and bored. For me to buy another Shadowrun Title from Harebrainded Schemes they would have to introduce something revolutionary. Because frankly most of the times I played this one, it got me thinking time and time again how the genre has fallen back in development.
<br>
<br>If IMO Shadowrun Returns was a 7, Dragonfall is a 7,5.
<br>
<br>STORY
<br>The story is based on a run that went bad. You`re one of the team that performs a basic operation at first glance, then sh_t hits the fan and everything goes wrong. One of your teammates dies, you`re caught in an ambush and you have to run. After you save your skin, you decide to get to the bottom of what happened back there and why. Telling the rest would be a spoiler. All I can say that it is well written, there`s a nice twist. The difference from the older title is that it is a bit less linear. You get to discard some of the side missions if you want. Still pretty sensless because ofcourse you will do those missions. Two of them are completely sensless and silly and add nothing to the game. The rest is ok in a way they give you more money to buy stuff. The ending to the story is pretty weak and as in the other title your choices dont`t matter that much.
<br>
<br>MUSIC
<br>Same music that is in Shadowrun Returns, with few variations. Goes well with the mood of the game, changes depending on the situation.
<br>
<br>GAMEPLAY
<br>This is where I have a problem with Dragonfall. At first you notice that now you have one main map where you can see different vendors and buy different stuff, talk about side missions. But that is about it. What you do and where you go besides that is a strict one door linear path to the story. I mean few times you can talk yourself out of trouble, although still you are going to end up in a fight.
<br>However the game is still very limited. If you ever played Fallout you will painfully experience this. The enemies do not drop any loot besides security cards. The player has a very limited inventory and cannot rearm his teammates upon mission start. You cannot prone or crouch. You cannot exchange items with your teammates. The game is missing some classes like infiltrator. The biggest problem I have with it is that when you select your class, you`re pretty much required to go its path all the way. If you pick a mage but want to carry firearms, you`re not going to be great at either magic or shooting. There are no traits or perks that would influence the gameplay. Some classes are clear favorites, so you`ll be much better off creating a street warrior and take one decker into the team than having a shaman/mage. The spells system is very scarce and when you do get to cast your strongest spell, your action points leave you open for bullying. A mage cannot even carry cyberware because it makes him lose his abilities. Why?
<br>
<br>You do not get to customise your looks, you do not get to customise your teammates at all.
<br>
<br>Maps are ok. Much more varied than in Shadowrun Returns. Still there is not much choice how you go about your task. Just go here, go there, shoot this group, proceed forward.
<br>
<br>GRAPHICS
<br>Standard Shadowrun graphics with some UI upgrades. The actor models still look silly on zooming in, weapon models are divided into four groups. Few more grenade types. Not much else to say.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-dragonfall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4475071">Expand</a></span>

Only slighty negative point in this is the comparatively dull matrix-combat.
<br>
<br>The editor however is frustrating. After working myself through the wiki and tutorial videos, planning a little campaign and gettign started...and trying again...trying again ...trying to find mistakes step-by-step and finding the whole thing unexplainably not working after dozens of backup copies that in retrospect also didn&#xB4;t work anymore...wasting around 2 weeks of valuable time I gave up. If you don&#xB4;t plan on using the editor which is fine the game is great, if you are highly interested in making your own runs...you could learn a programming language instead or...any language actually with the same amount of time involved...play Dragonfall and make a bachelors degree on the side and leave the editor to people who are working in the gaming industry anyways.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-dragonfall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4275599">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In the Dragonfall campaign you quickly become the leader of a group of mercenaries that attack and kill corporate security and occasionally gang members in an attempt to seize momentary plot devices.  In the better missions, you can choose to talk or puzzle your way past potentially hostile targets.  The setting is a future Berlin after magic and magical creatures have appeared alongside current and sometimes futuristic technology.  Most people either live in poverty or labor as slaves to large corporations with more money and power than morality or sense.
<br>
<br>The game also comes with an editor, and consumers are encouraged to make their own campaigns.  I&apos;ve never gotten into that, due to a lack of information on how to do so and a large amount of bugs in the released campaign.
<br>
<br>Your main character in the campaign has little to no back story.  Your regular mercenaries have back stories which you can explore between missions if you wish.  All the dialogue in this game is text that appears on the right hand space on your screen.  I enjoyed reading what the other mercenaries and characters had to say.
<br>
<br>The combat gameplay involves turn-based top down squad combat where the chance to hit or to be hit was often the deciding factor in my choice of action.  Bunching up invited grenades.  Spreading out made good cover harder to obtain.  It&apos;s a good system, marred by the amount of surfaces that look like they should give cover, but were never programmed to do so, and a formula to determine chance to hit that seemed to fluctuate when it shouldn&apos;t have.  I usually played on the hardest difficulty setting, but occasionally my chance to hit would climb 10 to 20% higher than it should have been.  Loading a save fixed it for a while.
<br>
<br>The &apos;RPG element&apos; involves earning karma points and money, usually from quest objectives but sometimes from other things, and spending them to improve your main character&apos;s skills and equipment.  You have very little control over your mercenaries&apos; skills and equipment, they will be at one of three or four points depending on your main character&apos;s progression through the game, and can pick up an item during a mission and use it for the rest of that mission if you so choose.
<br>
<br>I liked the music, but there are others who hate it, so your mileage may vary.  There is a soundtrack available for paying a bit more.
<br>
<br>This game has been out for a while and still has a large amount of bugs.  Their first released campaign is rather old now, not as good, and still has bugs.  I remember on one mission (in Dragonfall, not the older one) activating a pet robot from one of my mercenaries and watching as the usually controllable robot automatically used all it&apos;s movement to make a dash for the level exit instead of letting me use it to fight.  I ran into two to five bugs per mission I ran.  They usually weren&apos;t game breaking, but they were annoying.  I tried to fill out as many bug reports on their bug report google doc as I could while playing.  I hope they fix them.
<br>
<br>I never finished the game, but I got to what I think was the last mission.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-dragonfall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4161846">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>
<br>-Lacking a tutorial for new players
<br>-Uninformative UI
<br>-Game World is pretty small
<br>-Battles are &quot;tacked on&quot; or set in preset locations, cannot start combat whenever we want to
<br>-Little items to pick up; can&apos;t loot bodies, can&apos;t open boxes, crates; only a handful can be opened
<br>-Enemies are VERY accurate; can hit you even when you&apos;re behind &quot;heavy&quot; cover or if you&apos;re very far away from them
<br>-Hit chance is a bit screwed up(even when you have a 70-75% chance to hit an enemy, you STILL can miss, most of the time)
<br>-Not for the players who LACK patience (trust me, you&apos;ll reload very often)
<br>
<br>All in all, Shadowrun Dragonfall feels like a much more weaker version of Fallout and Silent Storm. Shadowrun Dragonfall has flaws, but its still a SOLID game, and fans of the genre should consider picking it up, ESPECIALLY when its about $3 on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadowrun-dragonfall/user-reviews?user_review_id=5916719">Expand</a></span>
