This is the funnest racing game I have ever played in my entire life, hours and hours and many races in a variety of places, you can choose which difficulty you want in each individual race, the more difficult, the more money you earn. I agree with most posting on here, the keyboard is an absolute NO for this game, it just doesn&apos;t feel right and it&apos;s just plain hard to drive (see Urh or JackBauer&apos;s reviews)...my solution was to buy a wireless xbox360 controller for Windows. Problem solved, and driving was like 1000 times easier. I also agree that the dialogue is a bit dumbed down, but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s a bad game, it&apos;s a video game anyway. So if you are going to buy this game, think about buying an xbox360 controller (wired or wireless, your choice) along with it so you don&apos;t have to struggle with the keyboard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1570968">Expand</a></span>

(10) Sound: The soundtrack (this is very subjective and depends on tastes) is brilliant, and, if your tastes are like mine, you&apos;ll be searching the internet for the full soundtrack in a couple of hours of gameplay. The crowd noises, engines, etc are good, each car has its distinctive sound. (9) Gameplay: I bought my XBOX 360 controller for PC specially for this game, and I don&apos;t regret it. The controls are smooth with a gamepad, and with a little practice, your car responds exactly as you&apos;d expect. About flashbacks... I&apos;m not a fan of flashbacks, it feels like you don&apos;t pay for your mistakes (in games like F1 flashbacks should be a crime), but the chances of crashing in the jungle or similar difficult stages are quite high if you aren&apos;t careful, so it&apos;s not that bad. Loading times are correct and spiced with several stats. (8) Fun and replayability: The game&apos;s main flaw. There&apos;s a shortage of stages to play in, and most of them are reverse versions of others, some races are just higher difficulty versions of previous ones, and the interesting Gate Crasher and Domination game modes almost disappear when you move to the Pro races. There are no classic, stage-based rally races, and, in the end, you&apos;ll feel like &quot;meh&quot; and probably won&apos;t complete the 100 available races. It&apos;s impossible to play with a friend in split-screen, you only have Online mode when it comes to multiplayer. To sum it up, repetitive and dumbed down.

Great graphics on the PC and the sound is very immersive as well. The driving has many options to adjust for your level of expertise which really do make a difference. The driving physics are amazing and this simply wants you to start one race after another once you get used to winning. Even losing motivates you to start the race over (which is very swift to do even in middle of race).<br>There are many varied tracks and just feel so realistic and pleasing to watch while driving.<br><br>The only gripe about this game is that there is a tight limit on what you can do with cars. Plus, many cars are not even worth purchasing in order to win races because there will be one or two you can buy that are cheaper which have better stats than a more expensive one. So it doesn&apos;t really make you feel like having a strong will to work your way up to buy the more expensive cars. Also the only things you can customize is your paintjob and some worthless props for the inside of car.<br>But you will have a great time racing for sure and definitely play this game if you enjoy racing games or simply want a fun time racing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1979658">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are excellent and I find it very delightful to drive, not only in a fast manner, but also a flashy one, just so I can watch how well I can perform tricks and how awesome they look in the replay. The controls on the keyboard are just fine. They are twitchy and fast, and that&apos;s how you want them: you control how much you steer by how quickly you tap the keys. There are a few problems, however, like the fact that there is too little rallying, and to many other events. There are also very few cars and customization is regrettably limited. Sure, you can have a hula girl in your dash and some pimp fluffy dice hangin&apos; from the mirror, but if you like to tune your performance properly you&apos;ll be disappointed. Characters and the whole mood of the game are seemingly hyperactive, but this is a racing game: just drive and listen to the music.<br>In conclusion, in terms of content the game is lacking, but when it comes down to it few things are as thrilling as drifting your way through turns or dipping into water, having your windshield all covered up in it and being unable to see until the wipers have done their job, so this game scores big time on fun.

The same maps over and over again. Driving with keyboard sucks, using a controller is weird. But both the graphics and the music is great (especially the music).</span>

The reward and career system is also very fascinating. To earn more money, you need to get better result in the race, and eventually unlock many new events. There is multi-player mode, but very few people are playing online, so single-player mode is more entertaining if you want to buy it now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3011233">Expand</a></span>

This is not a serious rally simulator in the vein of previous Colin McRae games, but it is a really enjoyable driving game. Damage has been toned down and most races significantly shortened, so it is very much marketed to the short attention span crowd. Despite this nerfing of the rally sim, it still is a tremendous amount of fun to play, so I give it a 9. It is different from earlier Colin McRae games, but just as fun, in its own way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=741964">Expand</a></span>

I turned the graphics up to full whack on DX9, and even on my relatively old / underpowered Athlon X2 2.7ghz, and 9800GT set up, I was getting a constant, solid 40fps. Graphics are astoundingly good considering how smoothly the game runs, and the sound is excellent. The cars handle very well, and although the handling does have a smack of the arcade about it, it&apos;s very very fun. The only niggle I have is the fact you have to sign into Windows live to utilise your saved games, which is a pain if you want to play on the go, and can&apos;t find a wifi spot, but it&apos;s otherwise not too much of a problem. I love this game, and it&apos;s a worthy successor to the Colin McRae name.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=742096">Expand</a></span>

Great graphics, fast game play and races are a good length if you don&apos;t have hours to play at a time. The one thing that kept me from giving this game a 10 is the &quot;first person&quot; menu system. While its slick and initially very cool, it starts getting in the way when you just want to retry and event without losing the cash/experience from a previous try... You have to go clear out of the pit area, into your trailer, re-select the event, then you&apos;re taken back to the pit area again. A &quot;Retry Event&quot; right in the pit area (but after you had been credited your points for previous race) would eliminate this minor complaint.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=743127">Expand</a></span>

The inclusion of new race styles over more traditional rally events is a nice touch, though I would rather see more emphasis on point-to-point rally than the X-games style events that they&apos;ve gone for. The online performance is great and will give this game some staying power; that&apos;s where the circuit courses will be much appreciated. The absence of car customization as you can do in Grid is a shame. Picking from a very limited set of liveries for online games is not as fun as the ability to make custom paint jobs and apply decals. However, the improved spectate mode is very welcome after the inexplicable way it was implemented in Grid. All in all, a great game with satisfying single and multi-player components both from the perspective of the driving and the eye-candy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=741342">Expand</a></span>

Also, a third positive aspect is that the Ai can say your name, if your dude would say : Hey you, get that car and come here, in dirt 2, it wouldn&apos; t say you, it would say your name, but with the AI&apos;s voice, wich is rare in games. I only see one negative aspect of the game, this game i not for begginers, its an experienced racing game, don&apos;t forget it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=742952">Expand</a></span>

After spending a great deal of time trying to tweak the numerous steering sensitivity settings, as well as car tuning options, I was unable to find a comfortable setting for either keyboard or gamepad play. It&apos;s a shame, because reportedly the game is great fun with a USB steering wheel...I just found it to take far too much work to make it feel like I had any control over my vehicle. Fighting the controls = not as fun as fighting opponents. The car handling and physics are in a weird limbo realm where they&apos;re not quite arcadey, yet not realistic, either--the slightest turn of the wheel can cause you to slide out even with all sensitivity lowered, yet you can often freely careen off other cars and walls. I really wanted to enjoy Dirt 2, as its graphics, presentation, game modes, and various details show meticulous polish by developer Codemasters...but the controls are even twitchier and floatier than previous Codemasters racing titles. What am I missing? Are these games really only meant to be played with wheels?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=742341">Expand</a></span>

You really have no control over your vehicle as it is impossible to get your car to go straight once you make your first turn. The game is beautiful, but play is frustrating. If you alreadyhave or are willing to invest in a wheel, then maybe this game is still for you.</span>

Master pilots talk like idiot teens. Gameplay is very very easy (except for some races), it is perfect for children or little teenagers. Physics are ridicoulus...cars have no weight and very often make strange movements. Damages are useless...races are too short. Graphics are very good and the game is very fluent.

However the game is found seriously wanting in key areas. It contains fewer cars and fewer courses/tracks than the first DiRT, and I found myself getting bored pretty darn quickly (so much so I can&apos;t even bring myself to see the career mode through to 100% completion). Also absent is the repair screen from multi-stage rallies - now your vehicle will be completely repaired and shiny new at the beginning of each stage, completely eliminating the challenge of having to nurse your car through rallies. One cannot help but get the impression that this was deliberately done to dumb the game down in order to broaden its appeal.<br><br>And now we move on to the metaphorical elephant in the room. I am, of course, talking of the &apos;extreme sports&apos; motif DiRT 2 has been given. Quite frankly I find it vulgar and I loathe it with a passion, and I wager that I am not the only one. Once again this is a move that appears to have been made in an attempt to capture a new audience, yet I suspect that in seeking out this new audience Codemasters may have inadvertently alienated their established fan base (including myself). This game was touted as a tribute to the late Colin McRae, personally I find it an insult.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1458251">Expand</a></span>

Its major achievements lay in the presentation, difficulty variation which can be changed per event and encourages you to play on harder difficulty, instant replay/flashback feature, DirectX 11 graphics and a good soundtrack. The game is appealing to anyone who is even slightly interested in racing games. This game has variety in both single player and multiplayer, so there is something for everyone. It&apos;s so well presented and simple to get into. The vehicle tuning is simple, and because there&apos;s no upgrading or driver assists it&apos;s fair for everyone. In multiplayer ranked matches there is no tuning and regardless of cars you&apos;ve unlocked you will always be able to compete. Driver level for both multiplayer and single player is endless, and the side objectives/challenges mean that regardless of your skill level you will always have fun and rank up. My only criticism of this game is the extremely sensitive, twitchy handling of cars, which is made worse if you don&apos;t have an Xbox 360 controller because accelerating, braking and steering are either on or off. Luckily even unsuported controllers like the Logitech Dual Action work without a problem in this game, and steering with analog sticks works properly. The game is of decent length, has good achievements (as it&apos;s on Games for Windows - LIVE) and a nice variety of events to keep things interesting. The tone of the game is much more towards the arcade-style, casual end of the driving spectrum, but having played the game a lot on Xbox 360 I can say that there is definitely scope for hardcore racing if you&apos;re doing time trials trying to set a fastest lap or something. Multiplayer is well-balanced, and you can race against ghosts if you don&apos;t like being bashed which is great and takes out the frustration of most other racing games. Overall DiRT 2 is a solid game and is even better on PC due to the gorgeous graphics which are still impressive even in 2012. The only real downside are the controls which can be awkward without a steering wheel or Xbox 360 controller. As a whole, DiRT 2 is a game which is easily recommendable to anyone who doesn&apos;t hate racing games due to its simplicity, slick presentation and accomodating difficulty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2535699">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s more based on your control over the car rather than your speed or eye for secrets.  Basically, if you race on speed, then you will find yourself dead last or totaled.  The key is to slow down on every medium turn and brake on every hard turn.  It makes for an interesting experience but will make you more frustrated than excited.  As racing games go it&apos;s more of an 8 but it definitely has drawbacks to keep players that don&apos;t play many racing games away.  Many races force you to use a certain vehicle type, sometimes these vehicles have completely different handles than other types which makes controlling it very hard.  The game is lacking a WOW factor but is solid and worth buying on sale or for hardcore racing players.  DON&apos;T BUY THIS IF YOU HATE RACING GAMES BASED ON HARD TURN CONTROLS, THIS IS NOT A STANDARD NEED 4 SPEED EXPERIENCE.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3142875">Expand</a></span>

<br>About game-play  It&apos;s very attractive in my opinion,you really feel that you take part of a rally world tour.
<br>Graphics  The graphics are very good and detailed,even though the game doesn&apos;t requires a very powerful PC.
<br>Sound  Astonishing! The songs are very well picked-up,after an intense race a rock song comes in and gives you a boost of joy,that&apos;s my experience so far.
<br>Overall  It&apos;s a very good game with top physics,sound,cars,graphic etc. The only inconvenient is that the game can be boring sometimes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3759244">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only thing I don&apos;t like for this game is some of the cars. I don&apos;t see how a Mitsubishi eclipse, a Nissan 350Z or a Ponitac Solstice can be a rally car. Also, the rally tracks could be a bit longer and more tracks of different races could be added. However, the game is excellent after all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dirt-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3878980">Expand</a></span>
