Set in a urban fantasy version of New York City, the player takes the role of one of four powerful magic users who have entered pocket dimension known as the Crucible of Fates, in order to find their destinies.
<br>
<br>Combat is extremely fast and frenetic and the difficulty level ramps up extremely quickly, in later levels it&apos;s almost impossible to avoid taking damage without judicious use of your Shadow Walk, which allows you to quickly change location, and your Glyph, which is a powerful offensive spell. The problem there is that these abilities have only limited uses per fight, and using them further will consume energy cells, which are somewhat rare. Further complicating matters is that mana, which is needed to purchase passive skill upgrades, only drops if you kill an enemy using Shadow Walk or a Glyph, though there is a passive that gives your basic attack a chance to knock mana out of enemies.
<br>
<br>You can earn permanent upgrades for each character by accomplishing certain objectives given to you during runs, this is also how you unlock new characters, and hard mode, which must be unlocked separately for each character.
<br>
<br>Uniquely, in Leap of Fate your passive skill trees are randomized in each playthrough. Veteran players advise restarting a run if you do not like your tree&apos;s layout. These passives are split into three trees: basic attack upgrades, shadow walk upgrades, and general-purpose passives. I advise grabbing the &quot;Third Eye&quot; skill where possible, it makes planning your run much easier.
<br>
<br>You begin with only Aeon, the Shadow Mage, and can unlock Big Mo the Technomancer, Mukai the Spirit Channeler and Rasimov the Rogue Occultist. Each has a different basic attack, a different starting buff for Shadow Walk, and unique glyph. Aeon has a spread shot, a simple shadow bolt glyph, and can damage enemies by Shadow Walking through them. Big Mo has a continuous-fire beam that can overheat, an aoe damage grenade, and can turn invisible when Shadow Walking, leaving a holographic decoy behind. Mukai has a close range cleaving attack, a glyph that stuns an enemy, and can fire a projectile when Shadow Walking. She also has a shield that intercepts the first hit she takes in each fight, to compensate for her alarmingly low starting health of just 3. Rasimov is perhaps the most interesting character, as he does not spend mana to purchase upgrades, but instead spends health. He has a conical damage attack that will instead fire a large projectile if he does not attack for a short time, a glyph that places an explosive trap that sucks enemies in, and can slow down time for enemies when Shadow Walking. Enemies Rasimov kills with his skills drop souls, and when he collects enough souls he receives an upgrade and a health pickup.
<br>
<br>Considering this is also a cellphone game, Leap of Fate&apos;s aesthetics are impressive. Music, visual effects, and sound are all good, but notably I thought the voice acting was of unusually good quality for a game like this. Each of the four characters has five possible endings, greatly increasing the lifespan of a game you could otherwise beat in less then an hour... if you&apos;re lucky.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leap-of-fate/user-reviews?user_review_id=6832029">Expand</a></span>

Randomly generated skill tree/loot/levels and  4 distinct playable characters make for truly unique playthroughs most of the time. Visuals are horrible and progression through the whole plot can take too much grind, but overall the game is really fun to play.</span>
