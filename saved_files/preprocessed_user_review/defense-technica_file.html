It&apos;s impressive in how many ways they miss the mark of what makes for an enjoyable tower defense game.  There&apos;s little introduction or explanation to gameplay concepts.  For example, the 4th level introduces its first weather effect, except it doesn&apos;t really tell you when this is happening, or what its effect is.  You have to go out of your way to find such simple things.
<br>You know what other amazing feature it possesses?  Enemies drop a cube of additional resources upon death, which you are required to hover your mouse over to collect.  Maps become several screens large even from the first level, so if you create a few killzones, you have to constantly cycle between them to scavenge your rewards.  It&apos;s kind of ludicrous in a terrible way, honestly.
<br>
<br>I would best describe Defense Technica as a half-hearted mash-up of Defense Grid (in look, feel, and mechanisms [you quickly acquire what is, essentially, the orbital laser exactly  towers pop out of the ground in little boxes, etc]) and Kingdom Rush (towers are limited, but gain upgrade paths).  Maybe somewhere in there is a kernal of a good idea, but it&apos;s not easily accessable, and it&apos;s hugely unpolished.
<br>
<br>Sadly, this is a purchase I regret.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/defense-technica/user-reviews?user_review_id=3668588">Expand</a></span>

<br>Visually, this game is a copy of Defense Grid, but it does look nice. Another nice feature is the ability to upgrade towers with an upgrade tree. It costs medals to upgrade towers. You earn medals by doing well on boards, so there&apos;s some incentive and reward to replay boards for higher scores.
<br>
<br>The game starts a little slow, but it gets more interesting as you go, especially as you unlock more tower upgrades and the boards get more challenging. Overall, this is a very fun tower defense game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/defense-technica/user-reviews?user_review_id=3676728">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s also weather that can change, making a few types of towers less effective, which encourages diversity in your build instead of building 1 type of tower you like.</span>

The devs are with their community, and they will release in the near-future free updates, and maybe a free expansion! There are many towers and upgrades! The only, I miss, i can&apos;t rotate the screen! A uniqe tower defense game!</span>

For the price of 13.99 euros or 13.99 US dollars this game is good to skip. To keep thing short, when price of this game drop off then you go and buy it if there is nothing else to buy.</span>

                                        <span>This game is obviously inspired by Defense Grid, but that can only be a good thing as Defense Grid was one of the best Tower Defense Games and definitely the most polished. Defense Technica builds on DG and feels like &quot;Defense Grid 1.5&quot; with some new interesting towers and a well balanced learning curve.
<br>
<br>Can&apos;t wait for Defense Grid 2 and hopefully Defense Technica 2 as well.
