Well, treat yourself to a fun little button-masher called &quot;DeathSpank&quot; or the second outing &quot;DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue&quot;. DeathSpank is a   wonderful lead character who wears a purple thong in a quirky little world where everything is subject to becoming a bad joke or pun or dead...and that s a good thing. DeathSpank bumbles his way through various quests, much to the chagrin of the local populace...They don&apos;t trust him to get the job done, and even the chickens are not safe in DeathSpank; lay waste to 100 of the little cluckers, and you will be known as &quot;Destroyer of Chickens&quot;. The game is over the top, sillly, and weird...but, simply put the gameplay ROCKS, and the first two titles are a great ride from start to finish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deathspank-thongs-of-virtue/user-reviews?user_review_id=2807761">Expand</a></span>
