It is a sad time for the FEAR franchise as this is just another poorly ported console game.  Graphics are not up to par with FEAR 2, why are we regressing?  FEAR 2 flowed so organically, and I could not stop playing until I beat it. In this installment, we the PC gamers are left with an overly difficult jerky controlled game which design seems to be based around a buggy, unwanted and unnecessary cover system which leaves you looking at the poor wall texture as you wait for your health to regenerate (which is all the damn time). FEAR 2 had health packs, and it was brilliant... you the player were in control of your fate. Why, Monolith, have you forsaken your true core audience?  A truly sad ending to a great series. I wont get to know what happens in the story, because this game is too frustrating to look at, and ultimately play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1679075">Expand</a></span>

Console ports should never make it to a PC...it is a step backwards in a game that was initially PC-based.  This should have never been written for PC&apos;s, plain and simple.  As a console game, it would be great, but as a PC game, a solid 6 is all it is worth...</span>

It ruined the story, it seems to completely ignore major plot twists and facts from previous F.E.A.R. games. And the textures are almost all extremely low-quality. Possessed enemies having low-res hands can be accepted, but multiplayer hands being 1x1 pixels? No. Just no. The FOV is sickeningly low, too. At least it can be changed in a config.<br><br>This game is just a bad F.E.A.R. game. Only buy it if you have all other F.E.A.R. games. Otherwise, skip this game and play the others first.

The slo-mo feature is very convenient, especially when you&apos;re a neophyte gamer like myself.  The downside for me was that Pointman seemed to be a very weak character, or the enemies were stronger.  Speed was down and health was problematic.  I liked the earlier games where you had control over the health. All of the enemies seemed to have an overabundance of grenades which they used liberally.  While this added to the challenge, it became very annoying to me as the game progressed.  Overall, I suggest waiting until this game goes on sale before rushing out to buy it like I did the other games in the FEAR series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1705396">Expand</a></span>

While F.E.A.R. 2 was a bit of a letdown, F.E.A.R. 3 was a major letdown.  I understand that all 3 games where very linear, but at least the first one scared you and enthralled you as to the fusion of shooter and horror.  But F.E.A.R. 3 was just dumb, it did not scare me, it was predictable, the premise idiotic, the conclusion left a sour taste in my mouth.  It felt like the studios where looking to bank on reputation, and just put a mediocre product on the market knowing that the brand would pull all the suckers in.    I was a sucker, but luckily at a discounted price from steam.  I hope and prey, somebody brings this Franchise back from the level of mediocrity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1996035">Expand</a></span>

The guns feel feel like 5 minutes was all the developers had to think and make them in-game. The characters could have been far more interesting but aren&apos;t. The game should be better than FEAR 2 but it isn&apos;t. Should you pay more than $15? Hell no.</span>

I finished that, because I wanted to have good feeling and finish all FEAR games. Otherwise it will be uninstalled after few hours of gameplay.
<br>There is missing athmosphere, scary moments, feelings, you are in some horror, story..
<br>Only graphic is better.</span>

If the previous FEAR games never existed and this game was released it might have done slightly better, but in the end I think it would still have been considered mediocre.
<br>
<br>Is it mediocre? I think so in a lot of ways. But first I want to talk about the graphics, because I&apos;m not entirely sure what to think about them. In some ways the graphics are really impressive, and the game is very cool to look at. But on close inspection a lot of things seem outdated. Examples would be looking out the windows in the suburbs levels, there is a flat picture texture behind the window, this is also used for landmarks very far away. The resolution on these textures isn&apos;t high enough that it looks good, because I think it CAN look good. If you&apos;re just passing through sure it looks fine, but I like to look at every little thing in a game and a lot of the time I end up looking at these flat backdrops and just think &quot;a game from 2011 decided to do this.&quot; Another example is the mountains in the slums area. These backdrop textures stuck out to me the most. The graphics aren&apos;t bad but they&apos;re nothing to have a party over.
<br>
<br>One thing about the graphics style I really liked in particular was the BLOOD. It is by far the single most impressive thing about FEAR 3, and I don&apos;t mean the static blood that just happens to be thrown around a level, I&apos;m talking about when you shoot a guy in the face as he&apos;s standing against a wall. The blood in this game flows down walls and slopes. It&apos;s not a perfect flow ALA real life mechanics, but it&apos;s still visually impressive and immerses you in the violence.
<br>
<br>Overall though, I wasn&apos;t blown away by much in the game other than that tiny blood detail. It was fun to play but it wasn&apos;t scary at all. Which was disappointing considering I was hoping for more scares akin to the previous games. The game has potential but it basically Command and Conquer 4&apos;d itself. It changed the original formula  TOO much (the second game changed a lot of the combat style, but the tone was still the same) and then wanted to be a multiplayer shooter in an already saturated shooter market. It was almost as if it was trying to be call of duty with the no health kits - and if you&apos;re looking to play a game like call of duty, wouldn&apos;t you buy call of duty instead of risking your money on a franchise that was supposed to be nothing like COD?
<br>
<br>I give it a 6 because a lot of the multiplayer CO-OP modes, like contractions, are genuinely fun. Single player is ok, but the writing is corny to the point where you can hardly take it seriously and the game itself isn&apos;t that scary, and let&apos;s be honest, that&apos;s what everyone was expecting from a FEAR game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=4030357">Expand</a></span>

Not as scary or engaging, and the game play has been toned down in to this horrible call of duty style cover shooter with health regen and bad A.I.. How can you justify having bad A.I. in a series that&apos;s known for pushing the envelope in that department? As a huge F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. 2 fan who&apos;s not particularly fond of Call of Duty or its imitators, this is a mediocre and ultimately forgettable FPS that just happens to have some F.E.A.R. branding slapped on it. I felt like it was a chore I forced myself through to see the continuation of the story from two games that I actually enjoyed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3856725">Expand</a></span>

We played through the co-op storyline, on normal, which took roughly 7 hours. The game wasn&apos;t too bad, we didn&apos;t play the first two, and I think that contributed to enjoying the third more. The graphics were ok, there were some low res parts that made us laugh, like when we were inside one of the houses and looked out a window, there was a very low res sky box that reminded us of DOOM. There was also the helicopter drops, every time (spoiler!) Alma would have a contraction a copter would drop out of the sky. Wish I kept count, it happened a lot. All around I give the game a 5, because it is average. It had a lot of good &quot;scary&quot; parts, and the environment really helped, but when you got into the combat arenas, and there were a lot, you could tell it&apos;s a shooter, and not so much survivor horror. Also, Point Man never said any words, ever. Maybe it was his character, due to his memories being wiped? I dunno, but the cut scenes left something to be wanted when every conversation between the brothers was one way. So, you got a buddy and wanna spend an evening shooting monsters? Get the game for 5 bucks, but don&apos;t pay anymore then that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2531831">Expand</a></span>

For example The Co-op campaign, the sweat scoring system, the Scary moments, all of these things makes the game playable........thats why i have rated this game 6...not great but not bad as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1719512">Expand</a></span>

Or at least of a F.E.A.R. game, I suppose it qualifies as a not-to-bad shooter, saved from total oblivion by the option to play as Fettel, which is actually quite fun for a while.  There might have been a great multiplayer game in there based on design alone ; but the implementation is so completely broken by incompetent programming (basically, the browser and matchmaking are totally kaput) it will already be stone-cold &apos;dead&apos; by the time you read this.<br><br>So what went so terribly wrong?  First up, gameplay.  F.E.A.R 3 is so on-rails it makes Crisis 2 look like STALKER.  Closed, claustrophobic levels that follow the same pattern of start, kill stuff over and over, hunt for the way out (the one door that you can actually open), rinse and repeat.  This is 2001 design, not 2011 design.  And it doesn&apos;t stop there.  On one early level walking exactly-where-you-are-allowed-to-go along ramps in what is supposedly a bombed-out superstore you encounter a bunch of scripted guys looking suitably identical and throwing neverending knives at you; for a minute I thought I was playing Painkiller (only nowhere near as good).   Destructable environments?  Aside from a few bits of degrading &apos;cover&apos;, you are having a laugh.  Interactive environments?  What are they.  And I can only assume anyone praising enemy &apos;AI&apos; is having a laugh.  Garbage.<br><br>Next, atmosphere.  None.  Everything from the previous games has been tossed away in favour of kiddie console rubbish that totally destroys it.  How are you supposed to have scares when every few seconds you are notified of a new &apos;achievement&apos; with suitably stupid names, or collecting another Alma doll?  I think the idea is to encourage people to play each level more than once in order to get higher scores.  If so, that&apos;s delusional on huge scale, nobody in their right mind would wish to repeat the experience except in MP.  If it worked.  Which it doesn&apos;t; did I mention that?<br><br>Next, graphics.  Poor.  Not awful, but just typical multi-platform stuff with no additional loving for the PC.  Ridiculous FOV, unless the idea is to make your 16:9 feel like a 4:3.  Frame rate limited to 30 fps - why ??  DX11 &apos;features&apos; just create a blurry mess; turn them off before you start.  A great franchise ruined.  Very, very, sad.   All gamers should avoid, at least until they fix the MP.  F.E.A.R.  fans should avoid totally if it isn&apos;t already too late; F.E.A.R 2 (let alone the first one) is pure gaming genius compared with this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1691919">Expand</a></span>

The PC version is like stepping back in time to 1997 when all FPS games were played on the keyboard, that is the amount of control you feel you have while playing with a mouse and keyboard. This crappy console port not only plays badly, it looks worse than the original, has a tacked on cover system that was not needed or wanted and just like every other FPS console game has regenerative health system which i&apos;m now sure the only point of is that it lengthens the playtime because you are stuck behind a crate for 60% of the game. Played for a few hours, uninstalled and reflected how good the original game was and what a pile of crap this was. Once again, bad or lazy development has killed this game and possibly the franchise for me.

The second one was average, having nothing really new to say, but as a a hardcore shooter, it was even better. Now we have this disaster made by Day 1 Studios, people who just ported the first F.E.A.R. on the consoles. The story is nonexistent. If F.E.A.R. 2 at least had some sort of story, Here you just run from Point A to Point B,  shooting everything on your way, two(the bridge and the market)  levels were made just to extend four hour(!) campaign as they have absolutely no other purpose. The same goes for the entire campaign. It&apos;s boring, very predictable and uninteresting. Many things just don&apos;t make any sense at all. Why Becket is so important to anyone? How  capturing him will lead someone to Alma? How do you suddenly teleport from the airport terminal to some vault? Where the hell is the U.S. Military? The game is just so full of plot holes. Graphics are horrible: low quality textures, poor lighting, old animations. As for models, well, The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher bay,released in 2004 , had more detailed models than this abomination( You can check that , if you want).Despite all this, F.E.A.R. 3 runs badly as it is unoptimized. But more importantly, guns (except for the rifle) behave badly and shootouts are boring. As for scares, well, F.E.A.R. series wasn&apos;t really scary to begin with, but the horror elements did add unique and interesting atmosphere. Here this atmosphere is gone.The game doesn&apos;t even try to scare you. Playing as Fettel is fun for some time, but then you realize, that for the most part it&apos;s the same as playing Pointman, only without slow-motion. The co-op seems to be normal, but there are other co-op shooters, much better than this and multiplayer may satisfy someone for a short time. Overall, a very boring Co-op shooter and not worthy of called F.E.A.R.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2105414">Expand</a></span>

The effectiveness of bullet time has been reduced by a large degree, making it quick to get used up and slow to charge, perhaps due to the aforementioned cover system.  There&apos;s a 2 weapon limit and some really overpowered melee abilities (there are youtube videos of people clearing levels with only melee).  Effective use of grenades is nearly impossible.  I can count the scary moments on one hand.  There&apos;s a strange RPG-esque in-game levelling up system.  etc. etc. etc...

<br>seriously, never. The franchise has been ruined to the point where the combination of action and horror elements is clearly dysfunctional. I started the game, having enjoyed the first title many, many years ago and never having played the sequel, curious to see how the title has evolved throughout the years. I was disturbed, not by the same fake ghosts that pop out each corner in FEAR 3, but by how badly of a job WB or whatever since Vivendi studios do not take part in the production of the games anymore, have done in the third installment. I remember when playing the first game, the atmosphere had this genuinely unique and creepy vibe to it. FEAR 3 dumbed it all down to a mindless CoD clone, with the cheaper jump scares than ever, but this time done so awkwardly its not scary, but more cringey.

As an avid fan of the F.E.A.R. series, I was fairly disappointed with this latest installment. Despite boasting that the game had the expertise of John Carpenter and Steve Niles used in development, it remains largely uninteresting, incredibly short, and hardly frightening for a good majority of the game. An obvious console port, F.E.A.R. 3 at its best is another generic shooter placed in a bloody box with paranormal wrapping. Much of the paranormal happenings that were commonplace in the first and second titles are no longer present, and the ones that are there are hardly anything terrifying. The single player campaign suffers the same problem as the majority of FPS title produced these days by being too short,  easily forgettable, and un-note worthy as a whole. I do like that Point Man makes a return as main character, with the psychic visage of his brother Fettel acting as a companion of sorts. The level-up based progression system implemented is enjoyable too, though I found myself many times performing differing actions for the sake of gaining experience rather than progressing through as I normally would in a FPS game, which takes away from the immersion some. The cover system, while easy to use, is largely unnecessary<br><br>I bought this game because I thought what I was buying was another F.E.A.R. title. But instead, I got a mediocre, run-of-the-mill FPS game with little in common to its namesake, dressed up and propped up by its multiplayer co-op fanfare that cheapen the feel of what I thought was going to be a great story driven horror title. Good to rent, but not to buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1683204">Expand</a></span>

<br>The original developers of fear delivered a masterpiece in horror FPS, one day studios did the port and have pushed this out. On reflection their title was apt, it does feel like this was written in a day.
<br>It uses all the current popular media and horror tropes and recycles as many ideas from the previous games (and games from other developers) it creates a straight line game with decent amount of flair.
<br>It&apos;s fun and they have mixed the game up so it doesn&apos;t get too repetitive (more on this later) that is actually pretty fun to run and gun with.
<br>So why the low score?
<br>Well it has some pretty nasty problems, the game feels like it&apos;s built around the setpieces with the story rewritten to &quot;sort of&quot; fit, it also fields like they got 70% the way though developing the game and either ran out of money and pushed it out the door or just simply gave up caring as it lurches from level to level with severe themeing changes, early on the coherence is kept by some fun cutscenes but even these are sidelined leaving the latter part of the game feeling a confusing and incoherent mess.  (such as it is)
<br>The game was clearly written for co-op play then about 80% the way though the game it &quot;introduces&quot; something that has been a core gameplay mechanic for one of the players since the beginning and this was purely to kill off an NPC who&apos;s sole existence in this game was just as an excuse to build a level around it (see narrative trauma above) Then there is a &quot;twist&quot; to the co-op that makes no sense either, the game encourages you to work together for big kills but yet has a competition element to that completely sets the ending meaning that while you are supposed to be working together you are actually competing so better off working alone and screwing the other guy over... kind of whacked for a co-op game no?? (great idea guys, which committee dreamt up having a co-op game where you encourage players NOT to work together..)
<br>
<br>OK so we have a fun but inconstant game, that looks quite nice and plays reasonably well, am I being harsh... Well personally my biggest beef with the game is just the fact that it&apos;s offensively short, by which I mean after some technical setup problems my friend and I completed the game in under 3.5 hours and we weren&apos;t even rushing! I have played DLC which is longer.
<br>Also the last level makes no sense what so ever...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1921994">Expand</a></span>

Any encounter with a mech suit indefinitely resulted in several reloads. You died extremely easily and quickly even on the easiest difficulty setting. Not to mention the unnecessarily large amount of cultists thrown at you all at once. I also constantly ran out of ammo and found myself spending more time looking for another weapon from cover than actually shooting. The enemies were annoyingly precise and apparently have skulls made of titanium as head shots were performed without results. The pace was extremely slow and the screen effects didn&apos;t in any shape or form make the atmosphere unsettling, they simply made it difficult to see. The cover system...don&apos;t even get me started. Where did this crappy idea come from? Most of the time you find yourself behind cover with a hovering electric grenade behind you killing you without indication. Also, why was the mystery of Point Man&apos;s appearance blown right at the beginning? I&apos;m about 4 hours in only signed up with Metacritic to warn both fans of the Fear franchise and of FPS games that this will most likely piss you off the whole way through. I&apos;m with many of the other reviewers on this one....I simply can&apos;t continue playing this terrible game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2551590">Expand</a></span>

The first FEAR was great, the second really good but this is just the embodiment of the brainless consolised decilne FPS&apos;s underwent the last few years. There is nothing left from the last games, only weak graphics an sound, overabused cover mechanics, retarded AI (its like shooting ducks from cover, they also don&apos;t react while being shot, just run for cover) and cheap horror gimmics.

Apart from the odd few creepy moments this feels like a generic console shooter like Call of Duty. I spent the first few levels doing nothing but crouching behind strategically placed barricades whilst being shot at by relentless waves of soldiers. I moved on a few yards and did the same thing again...and again. It felt like one of those dumb amusement arcade shoot-em-ups and not the worthy sequel to the creepy, immersive and sometimes shocking games I have played previously.<br>Just to underline the fact that this is a game aimed firmly at console CoD players you are frequently notified by an irritating pop-up message that you have attained some &quot;achievements&quot;. This may appeal to some people but I couldn&apos;t care less if I&apos;ve shot ten people in a row or hidden behind a barricade for 60 seconds. The achievement system does nothing but pull you out of the game and remind you that it&apos;s just a duck shoot.<br>The game&apos;s single player campaign is therefore sadly very disappointing. The two player co-op mode and the multiplayer scenarios are apparently very good (I haven&apos;t played them) and I suspect the game designers had this much more in mind than an immersive single player experience.<br>The graphics are also below par, giving the game a fuzzy and unfocused appearance and the level design, while quite intricate and detailed, is extremely linear - so much so that in some places there are even black arrows on the walls of buildings showing you which way to go in case you&apos;re too dumb to work it out for yourself.<br>So there we have it: another dumbed down console port for trigger happy teenagers. Maybe I&apos;m getting too old now but I prefer something with a little bit more depth, variety and strategy and not just a frantic button-mashing experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1682353">Expand</a></span>

The earlier F.E.A.R.&apos;s may have added some glaringly non-scary mechanics in favor of the shooting, but at least they added a splashing of truly creepy moments. The 3rd installment doesn&apos;t manage even that. But if you toss out the horror label, you&apos;re left with a ambitious shooter with some interesting horror trappings, some re-playability, interesting tactics, a dash of Silent Hill-esque metaphorical monsters, and that rare sort of secondary multiplayer component that tries to break the mold and do something new. F.E.A.R. 3 is like opening up a  candy bar and getting Bacon: You may feel let down because you wanted candy, but if you get past that, it&apos;s still damn tasty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2441994">Expand</a></span>

If you liked fear at all, stay the hell away from this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1686540">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>At their best, the first two FEAR games were masterpieces of atmospheric tension ratcheted up through stunning graphics, brutal-but-fluid combat, and immersive level design. At its best, FEAR 3 is a jumbled ball of textbook action and horror cliches slathered in super-reflective blood textures and washed-out lighting, hinting at some &quot;scary&quot; story about something or other as it stumbles from one flat, murky combat sequence to the next. This game feels like it was designed by people who had been very briefly told about, but never allowed to play, the first two games, and plays like the various people designing the story, combat mechanics, art, level design, achievements system (so annoying), and &quot;scare sequences&quot; never actually met or even spoke. I guess someone thought they had a really profitable shooter clone on their hands they could churn out for big bucks if they slapped the name FEAR on there. I feel like a chump for having helped prove them right -- and for assuming that the makers of a FEAR game would have wanted to appeal to the people who bought and loved the first two games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1681130">Expand</a></span>

With the exception of the FOV (which needs to be better for the PC version) and some low res textures, FEAR 3 still looks great maxed-out, and even more impressively, is a seriously fun game. It&apos;s a mix between the best of the FEAR series (though a little lower on the visuals scale), and though not quite as &quot;dark&quot; and horrifying in atmosphere as the first in the series, it&apos;s definitely atmospheric. FEAR 3 brings together action with atmosphere, incredible lighting (and I don&apos;t just mean effects, I mean coloration and mood), an excellent (and extremely fun and intuitive) movement and cover system, excellent sound and ambient effects, excellent gun play in both feel and sound, and astounding A.I. that really plays extremely smart. They&apos;ll take cover in a very natural manner, while moving around the environment, flanking in various ways from various positions, call out to one another as to exactly where you are, and use their weapons efficiently. FEAR 3 is not just &quot;run and gun&quot;, in the sense that, you will need everything at your disposal in order to survive. You&apos;re not loaded with tons of ammo and will run out at times, needing to take cover, use melee and grab a fallen enemy&apos;s weapon to resupply. The pacing is great, though there are no quick saves, which isn&apos;t a huge deal, as while the game offers a challenge, it&apos;s reasonable if you&apos;re smart and quick. I was so engrossed in the game, I played it straight through to the end in one sitting, at if you don&apos;t rush (in most parts you cant anyway) it&apos;s just over five hours, maybe close to six. Though a little short, the option to play through again as Fettle is brilliant, and even more fun than going through as the main protagonist. There is something incredibly addictive about using Fettle&apos;s powers, and it&apos;s an absolute blast, offering a lot more variety to the gameplay due to his powers. I thoroughly enjoyed the first playthrough a lot, but only thirty minutes in while playing as Fettle, and I&apos;m having twice the fun already. While A.I. modeling could be a bit better, it&apos;s not bad, and there&apos;s still dismemberment depending on where the enemy takes damage, to which they react (grabbing their should at a blown-off arm, limping with a blasted leg) and the gore is prominent in the game. While it might not have quite the visuals of the rest of the series, it&apos;s thoroughly enjoyable and, with Fettle&apos;s powers and the co-op/multiplayer (which I haven&apos;t even gotten to yet), is far more creative and a blast to play. I only wish is were a bit longer and the FOV was adjustable, but maxed-out at 1920x1200 it runs beautifully and looks far better than the console footage and screenshots would have you believe. If you&apos;re looking for a truly fun shooter with fun mechanics, I&apos;d definitely recommend grabbing FEAR 3. The only technical issues I&apos;ve had were one random lock-up/crash, and twice, the game windowed itself and it was a little annoying trying to get it un-windowed, but that&apos;s it for technical issues.

That was in 2004 and FEAR offered a really unique experience for its time. Then FEAR 2 came out 5 years later and had pretty much the same mechanics, but it was just...not nearly as scary and had a bland plot. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I loved FEAR 2. It was full of awesome action and I never get tired of wiping out an entire room of cloned super-soldiers in slow motion. Oh, and don&apos;t forget the awesome melee combat. I was afraid they removed it in FEAR 3 until I leveled up for the first time and unlocked the slide kick. It felt good to know that Monolith hadn&apos;t abandoned one of the best things about the series.<br><br>Anyway, FEAR 3 is like FEAR 2, except it&apos;s...even less scary and the story is even less interesting. However, I didn&apos;t buy the game expecting it to scare me whilst keeping me enthralled in its story, but I certainly hoped it would. FEAR 3&apos;s multiplayer features are definitely the highlight of the game. The contraction scenario is definitely my favorite.<br><br>In shot, if you buy this game expecting it to match the charm of the first game in every way, you will definitely be disappointed. But if you&apos;re in to cooperative and other awesome multiplayer game modes, topped with the core features that make every FEAR game unique from other shooters, then you will like this game.<br><br><br>Some other tidbits I should mention are performance. The game runs great on my PC with max settings, but I have anti-aliasing off, otherwise it&apos;s a slide show. My specs are as follows:<br><br>Nvidia GTS 250 512mb<br><br>Intel Core2Duo E6400 2.13 ghz CPU<br><br>3GB RAM<br><br>Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit<br><br><br>If you can run FEAR 2, then you can run this game just as easily, if not better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1680812">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If I had to say anything negative, it would be the need to unlock Fettel on each level instead of having him playable from the get go, as he is the far more enjoyable character to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1699744">Expand</a></span>

All in all its a good time if you like the series.  Point Man is still the badass silent type.  It&apos;s weighed down by bad parts though...... You gain XP during each interval for doing mundane stuff, you get very large very annoying pop up achievements during gun play that show the XP you get.....  You only get two weapons at a time, the pistol (Which is actually a well done weapon) takes a rifle slot.... The cover system is a joke and is clearly made for consoles, its obvious because you get the popups with key needed to activate cover or other interactions (annoying, keep that in console games.)... Theres a good shooter in this title, the weapons are well done (unlike the SMG from HL2...), however this game suffers from console influence.  The prone and lean left/right that made FEAR1 a good shooter is replaced by a console style cover system.  Also the awesome radio operator from FEAR1 is gone...  6/10, this game is kept above water by the face its shooting is good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1685843">Expand</a></span>

Multi player seems to be the best part of the game and most developed, especially if you play through the campaign in 5 hours. Graphics are okay but not up to par and very unoptimized, sound is good, UI is okay, and weapons are balanced. The single player is repetitive with each chapter having you fight off against Aramcham soldiers and a few replicas (except for the last chapter). Only play this game if you want to know how the FEAR series will end, or find it in discounts and rental.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1712323">Expand</a></span>

What we&apos;ve loved more from F.E.A.R. is gone, and now we play a Crysis clone game that aims to the general shooter industry instead of the well-known horror fans that throughout the years have supported the series. I&apos;m not saying the game is bad, it&apos;s just simply good, and that&apos;s very sad is a series in with excellence is the common factor.</span>

FEAR 3 really didn&apos;t bring any of that. Upon first loading the game, I discovered that my monitor&apos;s native resolution (1280X1024, hardly exotic) wasn&apos;t supported natively, meaning I had to play the game at a blurry 1024X768. The firefights had become much simpler, concentrating on throwing waves and waves off foes at the player who seem to spend more time swearing than actually fighting. The weapons system has been downgraded to the standard two slots, and health now regenerates...this was where I realized what was going on. The entire game has been changed to make it more reminiscent of Call of Duty/Battlefield, and has discarded its own unique properties to instead ape those of the giant franchises. There is still FEAR&apos;s signature Slo-Mo power, but since the enemies don&apos;t fight tactically anymore, it&apos;s rarely necessary. Bizarrely, an arcade-style points system was included, complete with a flashy rewards placard that pops up in the lower left of the screen. This is a real immersion breaker, which is awful--horror games rely on immersion like few other genres. Nothing makes a scary situation boring than having a dialogue box pop up, rewarding you for spending 100 seconds behind cover. All in all, it just feels like Monolith has scrapped their neat franchise in favor of making a generic shooter.  Oddly, the game is pretty good in this regard.  The cover system is simple and intuitive, and the best I&apos;ve seen in a first-person game (I especially like that it always stays first-person, instead of jumping to the third like many do).  While the aforementioned arcade popups break the horror element, they are conducive to adrenaline-fueled heavy firefights.  While the enemies are dumber, they are also more numerous and so some &quot;pop-and-stop&quot; cover-based shooting is required.  None of it is deep, but it is pretty fun.  Overall, I would say don&apos;t go into this expecting a horror shooter, and you can still have a good time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2495245">Expand</a></span>

I played them all in order and FEAR 3 is not as bad as people on metacritic make it out to be.  In fact, it&apos;s somewhat comparable to FEAR 2 in terms of gameplay with the twist that it incentivizes replayability in allowing players to control Fettel.  The story mode is similar in length to FEAR 1 and 2 and is more similar to FEAR 2 in terms of gameplay.  The player will fight hordes of Armacham goons and mechs and bland supernatural enemies that do nothing but lunge at you.  As you play through each level as Point Man or Fettel, you earn huge score bonuses by completing challenges a la Call of Duty.  Each level is scored and your final score tallied after the last boss fight.  Depending on who has the higher score, Point Man or Fettel, one of multiple endings will be unlocked.  This encourages players to replay the game as Fettel, attempt to top their previous high score as Point Man, and view the game&apos;s alternate ending.  I find this a very creative approach to unlocking multiple endings and preferable to pressing a magic button during the last few minutes of play.  Playing as Point Man, players must use slomo, cover, and a slim but solid variety of weapons to get through the game.  Playing as Fettel, players can shoot psychic energy from their hands, possess enemy soldiers and slaughter their friends, and use telekinesis to throw objects.  Despite the games linear level design, I was impressed by how well the layouts supported both drastically different styles of play.  The gameplay, while fun, does nothing to innovate and brings absolutely nothing new to the series.  The game is full of obnoxious scripted moments, blocked off areas players might be eager to explore, and tons of &quot;Hey, player!  Look at this and then we&apos;ll let you progress!&quot; scenes.  The game is also WAY too easy, even on the hardest difficulty.  Your health and slomo bar simply regenerates way too fast.  Removing health packs was a terrible design choice for FEAR.  The enemy AI, as in the previous games, is more than competent, but your slomo lasts forever and your health regenerates super fast, you have no fear of death.  The game is not scary at all either.  It&apos;s full of cheap jump scares.  There is never any genuine tension because the enemies are neither difficult to kill nor deadly.  I would really recommend FEAR if you want closure to the FEAR story or are looking for a great co-op game.  I wouldn&apos;t recommend this at all for multiplayer.  I was unable to find a multiplayer match of any type running.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2567121">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. There is no fear, no sound, no graphics, no thrill, so why the series expanded. They only degraded the game.
<br>2. The only thing left in game is killing the soldiers, so I got it, it is a shooter game. Ohh no no no no, there is no save option, so you will have to survive any stupid battle till save comes, else you are useless. All the time you use slow-time and fast-time. Guns, very poor. The graphics are so uneasy, u cant judge its a bush or a soldier, all the time you try to figure out this only.
<br>3. You dont know where to go, you search the whole place 1000 times, the suddenly a door gets opened, soldiers come and u die. So it was for next time, now you keep in mind they will come and u have to survive coz, there is no save option.
<br>4. There is no information about any weapon, no zoom quality, what i am supposed to do with which one.
<br>Fear 2 was lot more then this one</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=6817031">Expand</a></span>

The AI is much better than the previous game (it seamed like you could just get head shots for days in the previous because they&apos;d never hide right.) Playing as Fettel? Pretty awesome and makes the campaign replayable another time so despite having a... I guess 4-5 hour campaign you can double that or at least another 3 hours. I&apos;ve yet to play the multiplayer, but that seems to be everyones favorite part! I can&apos;t help but give this game a 10 if you love F.E.A.R.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1678756">Expand</a></span>

I remember playing Front Mission: Evolution and raging every time the game would force me to play in a specific play-style. F.E.A.R 3, or F.3.A.R to annoy the grammatically correct snobs, is one of the most enjoyable FPS I have played since the beginning of the year, or since HALO: Reach for that matter. I am a big fan of single-player FPS that can draw me in whether because of the story, level-design, set pieces, and the little tidbits that do not involve a forced turret section. And man did F3 not disappoint.<br><br>For starters, I don&apos;t believe that a game where your character is equipped to fight WW3, can be scary. To be truly scary, your character need to feel weak in the face of danger. From F.E.A.R to F.E.A.R 3, I don&apos;t think there was any real danger to your character. For people who paid attention to the story, ALMA never tried to hurt the pointman, because he was her son. So, it&apos;s interesting to see this time around that Alma is not the real threat, but a much more dangerous foe.<br><br>The story aside, the game is a basic cube shooter. Go from one room to the next, fight off wave of enemies, using your slo-mo or uber reflexes to fend them off, navigate a grostesque setting that uses same old tricks to instill fear, though, failing at it the majority of the times. The enemies we face are Armacham&apos;s grunts who really are just cannon fodder for the pointman to get rid of in a super soldier&apos;s fashion. They get shot in the head, maimed, blown to pieces and what have you. There&apos;s nothing special about their AI, but the experience does feel great, from how your weapons handle themselves to the extra tidbits as in, hohoho, ironsight!. But the challenge gets a bumped up when you face off the Ghost soldiers, and the Commanders who have received a few bonuses to make you feel like its a boss fight. And I loved every moment of it.<br><br>As I mentioned, I hate turret sections. Usually used to pad some length into most video games, I felt that F.E.A.R&apos;s take on this little extra is much more interesting. Hop into a mech, which can be used during only 3 instances in the entire game, one being optional and providing a bigger challenge on foot, but worthwhile on co-op to increase the length and for sight seeing purposes. The Mech sections in F3 was much more entertaining than the ones in the previous FEAR, and I definitely hope to see DLCs with more mech action. Next, the multiplayer. I used to enjoy a decent amount of MP playtime, but when a game with an amazing SP section has a MP that was added just because everyone is doing the same, it just doesn&apos;t feel that great. We have CoD for the TDM/DM frenzies, and CoD has mastered that part beautiful no matter how the haters feel about it. F3&apos;s take on the MP, is definitely the main reason to hold on to the game. Get 3 more friends, and fight off wave of enemies, and mechs in F3&apos;s take on horde mode. Next, you have soul king, where the PvP takes place. Each player starts off as a voracious soul who wants to possess and consume as many hapless clone&apos;s souls as possible. But that&apos;s only the start, you can fight each other&apos;s off, and murder the ghost of the other players to steal their skulls. Believe me when I say, this mode takes more skill than any DM/TDM focused game.<br><br>Finally, in terms of performance, the game performed wonderfully on my machine. No mouse lag, no random FPS drop. Considering that most games these days are ported, I couldn&apos;t say with certitude how it will handle on your rig.<br><br>To conclude, I omited to talk about Fettel&apos;s role. Once you beat a mission, you get to replay it as Fettel. And Fettel plays exactly like the Soul Hunter in the MP mode, Soul King. Definitely another layer of FUN in the game.<br><br>So, if you like Single-player FPS, and want extras that cater to your lonewolf&apos;s antics, this game is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1680864">Expand</a></span>

I also love first person shooters the most, and FEAR3 is an improvenent to previous versions I believe. The FPS experience got an improvement and the AI is less predictable. The one thing I didnt see an improvement on was the graphics, the scary scenes, and the XPS computer logos on the screens. Graphics remain the same, if not worst, I play it at 1080p,using an nvidia gtx460 at medium settings on DX11 and doesnt look better that the one from 6 year ago. Also the scary scenes are not as suspenseful or nerve wracking as the first one. And last, where are the XPS computer logos ??? I miss them so much, specially since I am playing on a pc. We want the logo of the sponsoring computer company back, even if its not Dell, please. Putting that aside, this is the greatest game ever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2094030">Expand</a></span>

It doesn&apos;t really use any new techniques to scare the player either which is partially why i would say its not too scary. Graphics have certainly improved compared to FEAR 2, the fog/mist and lighting effects in this game are nothing but SUPERB! I do not understand the few people who claim it has bad graphics, sure it occasionally has a low resolution texture here and there...but they aren&apos;t too common. I run this game comfortably at 60fps with vsync on and everything max, although it dips rarely. (i5-750, 4gb ram ATI HD6970) Multiplayer is certainly entertaining in FEAR 3, with 4 different game modes and co-op campaign, there&apos;s more to do after you finish single player which is certainly an improvement over FEAR 2. It clearly is a console port, and mouse controls although work fine...just seem and feel a bit weird (i ended up using a 360 controller for it) A new cover system is introduced which works fairly well, which i often made use of during my time playing. FEAR 3 tells and explains the story better than its predecessors as well, through cgi cinematic&apos;s, memory playback style technique in-game, and lines the characters say. I have to say AGAIN i love the fog/mist/lighting effects in this game, it is used extremely well which creates a very FEARful atmosphere :) The graphics in this simply surpass FEAR 2 easily, and i have no clue as to why there are people claiming FEAR 2&apos;s graphics are better maybe they have crap PC&apos;s? Maybe they haven&apos;t been through all the video settings? Who knows.......Basically if you enjoy a good shooter, a few scares , and multiplayer/co op then this is a game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1686808">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t like the cover system too much (probably because I hated that concept in 007 Goldeneye for Wii) and the regeneration of health was a bit too easy. Perhaps I will try this on the hardest setting next. The story was fun and there were some scary moments. I have to say overall that it was worth playing the game and the multiplayer is enjoyable. I am indifferent about the purchase but have been about many game simply because of the price tag vs. the actual value I&apos;m getting. i.e. How long is game play, innovation, controls, etc. I think it should have come with a slightly lower price tag but it seems the industry just keeps charging the same for all the new games coming out, only having to either drop the price or have them resold as used games (which doesn&apos;t apply to the PC version of this title). I recommend this title, but if you can find it used for the console or borrow a copy from a friend before you decide what port to buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1757524">Expand</a></span>

As previous F.E.A.R games, this one is everything but scary (Calling any of them scary is stupid). It&apos;s a nice action shooter with minimal RPG elements that is entertaining. I wouldn&apos;t say it brought anything new compared to previous games, but it&apos;s still worth playing.</span>

While F.E.A.R. 2 was a solid FPS it was also old with ageing mechanics that couldn&apos;t held up against the best in the genre. The latest game became modernish with updated gameplay mechanics. On one hand it was a good decision (it had to be done), on other side it isn&apos;t unique enough to separate itself from the competition.
<br>
<br>F.3.A.R starts off 8 months after the second game. Point Man is our protagonist once again and he has to team up with his long gone brother, Fettel to get out of a prison and find his squad mate, Jin, who is in danger. Paranormal activities are a big part of this game too. Only this time around Alma isn&apos;t the antagonist, but something called the Creep. The story of the game won&apos;t leave any deep marks in you. It&apos;s flat and uninteresting. It&apos;s hard to take the story seriously when it doesn&apos;t prove its worthiness. Your personal goal will be reaching checkpoints after checkpoints to beat campaign. And it will be done after just around 6 hours. It&apos;s a shame really because with a more intriguing story this game could have made a mark.
<br>
<br>Luckily F.E.A.R. 3 isn&apos;t short on content. Not at all. After completing the campaign you can kill your time with various game modes. Many of them are essentially a modified version of the original campaign, but the changes made in those modes are not only worth a try but also great fun. The campaign is made of 8 intervals, each of them takes around 30-45 minutes to complete. After completing an interval you can replay it as Point Man or Fetter with all its unique psychic abilities. He has the ability to posses common enemies. You&apos;ll appreciate the change of pace.
<br>
<br>Also, you can hop in a co-op campaign with your friend. One controls Fettel the other Point Man. It isn&apos;t a novelty at all, but great to see the developer putting in the game options like this. When you exploit everything the single player modes can offer there is a multiplayer option in the game. Sadly the multiplayer of the third game was never as popular as the first game&apos;s MP. If you want to try this option most likely you have to play with your own friends as very few gamers are left playing F.3.A.R. over the internet.
<br>
<br>Moving to different territories, the looks of the game are passable. It&apos;s isn&apos;t a beautiful, nor a bad looking game. To its defense they put more emphasis on minor details, so this time a book on a table will actually look like one instead of a bunch of blurred pixels. The gameplay has been completely refreshed. The previous game in the franchise was getting old and set back by wrong decisions during the development. Not this game though. It feels like a modern shooter where you bullets do matter. When you shoot a soldier in this feet he grabs it or tumbles and the gunfight is much more vivid and powerful. Day 1 made the right decisions to cut the useless features and refresh the remaining ones. It&apos;s a great shooter, but beyond that it offers nothing more. Nothing that could differentiate this game from the others.
<br>
<br>Fear in F.E.A.R. 3 is almost non existent. There are moments here and there when you&apos;ll look around suspiciously, but that&apos;s about it. The franchise has switched genres over the years. From psychological horror it became a solid action oriented shooter. We can&apos;t say it was a bad decision, but we can say that there isn&apos;t many horror games in the market while there&apos;s a legion of action shooters to choose from; good, bad or worse. It&apos;s a pity that in this era a franchise has to get more action oriented to survive, and sometimes even that might not be enough. Again, F.E.A.R. 3 is a great shooter and it definitely benefited from the changes made around it, but the industry and the gamers might not.

What it lakes in a scare factor is makes up in its disturbed storyline, since its mainly focused on the &quot;brothers&quot; and their past, what they went through ect. I feel that it was pretty disturbing at times. Visually the game looks good, and it will play on most modern day computers so you do not need a fancy graphics card, which isn&apos;t a bad thing. Day 1 Studios has made a good installment into the Fear series, I do think if Monolith developed it, they would have spent more time, and would have done a better job. As for game play Fear 3&apos;s strongest feature would be the co-op mode. Which of course you can play with your friends, one thing I didn&apos;t care for much would have to be the little Achievement boxes -so to speak- popping up every five seconds to let you know you did something unimportant. Last thing I&apos;m going to address is the health system, I&apos;m sure most of you are aware that it is regenerating health system, and I&apos;m also sure some or most of you dislike it. Well I think it works for this game, it was meant for co-op so regenerating health makes sense to me, I&apos;m not necessary a fan of it, I prefer carrying around bulky med-kits all around. None the less, Fear 3 is a good game, with Minor flaws any fans of the series will most likely overlook. 8 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=2113224">Expand</a></span>

Also some funky key assignment features. For a game that does not look that cutting edge  and has some low res textures the game still feels it could have been optimized better for PC. Hopefully a patch can fix this. The FPS seems a little to erratic and yes I have a beast of a PC. FOV seems a little consolish to me. I&apos;ve had a game for two days and have not seen but one game online yet .Hopefully more people will pick it up and play the online portion. I like the CO OP aspect of the game and I think that is a nice addition. Over all, the game is still a lot of fun to play, still creepy and AI is still top notch especially on harder    difficulties. A decent shooter that everyone can enjoy but original FEAR fans might find some grips with it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=1678469">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>F.E.A.R. 3 Feels a little to much like a arcade run and gun at times which bothers me but overall i love F.E.A.R. story,scripting cinematics.

Fear 3 has a bit of everything and it blends together SO well. Using Paxton Fettle is fantastic, the machanics of it just feels so right and this game is honestly one of the best CO-OP games I&apos;ve played in a while. A must have but maybe not for it&apos;s full price.</span>

Graphics are great and gameplay exciting.
<br>The co-op isn&apos;t so good in my opinion though. The 2nd user plays as Fettel who is a ghost... who gets killed by getting shot at..
<br>Playing as Fettel doesn&apos;t really work as his character doesn&apos;t make sense. If you want this as a single player then it&apos;s great but the co-op isn&apos;t as fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fear-3/user-reviews?user_review_id=3297805">Expand</a></span>
