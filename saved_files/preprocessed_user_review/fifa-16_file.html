The control system is very unresponsive and quite buggy especially the passing which often will go the exact opposite direction to which u aim. More often than not games are decided for or against by an AI blunder or blatant glitch which leads people to believe the game is scripted when these glitches constantly go in the opponents favour . The game looks good the physics system is pretty advanced if buggy but the gameplay is awful .I wish the developers put there time into perfecting the gameplay and then worrying looks or whatever feature this year that they are going to sell the game upon . I also feel that the UT is just a way of stealing kids pocket money and is blatantly unethical but hey when have corporations ever been known for they&apos;re ethics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-16/user-reviews?user_review_id=5629153">Expand</a></span>

This game can be summed up as &quot;one step forwards, three steps back&quot;. The FIFA series isn&apos;t stagnant, but all it does is roll back and forwards in it&apos;s own filth. Things that were bad before are still bad, some things that were OK before are not bad. Stick with FIFA 15.</span>

<br>
<br>Besides this, the difference in difficulties is even bigger than last year, in professional you can easily win 95% of games playing casually, but in world class it does no matter what team you are playing against, they all feel the same, they play the same way, and in every game they can score amazing goals! And I&apos;m talking about the portuguese league, with 3 start teams.. if you want to win in this mode you better be playing everyday, several games per day..
<br>
<br>If you want to play offline, it&apos;s just annoying and not worth the 30&#x20AC; I paid for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-16/user-reviews?user_review_id=5884116">Expand</a></span>

<br>- No lobbies.
<br>- You can&apos;t skip the opponent&apos;s celebs/replays;
<br>- No learning curve. You can hold the controller with your feet and still win games.
<br>- Cheaters (especially in FUT, playing this pay to win mode is a total nonsense with those guys). Ranking is thus useless.
<br>- Laggers.
<br>- 80% of the people playing this game at least are casuals running it on toasters/crappy laptops using wi-fi. As soon as the FPS go down ingame or during the cutscenes (locked at 30fps by the way), it gets unplayable online. There&apos;s the mutual quit option available in order to avoid those guys, but they never accept it so they get away with 3 points everytime. Cutscene = overheating laptop/toaster = lag. It only gets worse until the game is finished.
<br>- People play the same in div. 1 as in div. 6, only with worse toasters/more lag.
<br>- Almost every player plays the same in this game, using Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern. It seems that the goal of this game is to cross the whole pitch as fast as you can, with the least passes possible using pacy players like CR7, Bale, Messi, Neymar, Ribery, Robben in order to score the same pathetic goal all game long (except for button mashed headers on corners) and switching to autopilot in defense with the AI doing all the job thanks to the parking the bus tactics.
<br>- You can have 70% ball possession and 18 shots vs 2 and winning is not guaranteed, thanks to the crappy netcode. Some people call this scripting/handicap.
<br>- You see donkeys with 60% passing accuracy winning games because scoring goals has been made easy for casual kids so that they don&apos;t cry.
<br>- You buy a game on launch and 3 months later it has nothing to do with what you bought thanks to patches killing the experience every time a bit further.
<br>- When the game becomes cheap during some Origin sales, poor people get it and it gets even more unplayable online thanks to their bad hardware.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>If you care about online playability and winning games when you deserve it, don&apos;t buy this game. If you love frustrating, unfair things and playing against retarded people that would sell their souls for 3 points, you&apos;re gonna love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-16/user-reviews?user_review_id=6284339">Expand</a></span>

<br>On legendary you can be in the lead like 4-0 at 80 minutes and still end up losing the game without making a single mistake. Your players will just lose composure and there&apos;s nothing you can do about it. Not to mention your opponent can score at will anyway, from the most retarded chances and build-up plays, while you can have 20 beautiful clear cut chances without a single goal. Say you&apos;re 1-0 down though, well it isn&apos;t the same the other way around, starting like at 75 minutes you&apos;re lucky to get 2 chances on the ball, which your players will just mess up anyway.

The passing in game is one of the worst examples in any FIFA game, You cannot make accurate short passes. When passing wide on the wings backwards or laying it back invariably even the &quot;best players in the world&quot; have the touch of a 2 year old and knock it off the pitch. The movement on the ball makes zero sense, you get muscles by tiny players even when trying to shield. Online play is simply horrendous and unplayable 9 times out of 10. Lag cripples the game with every other match and its simply just a case of fishing to play against someone with a half decent internet connection.

<br>Positive:

<br>+The gameplay is slower, in my opinion that&apos;s a good thing.
<br>+Cool celebrations
<br>
<br>Negatives:
<br>- As to release, there are some bugs that I believe will be fixed:
<br>* I can see the power of the shot/pass of my opponent
<br>* the names of the player displayed having the ball sometimes are incorrect
<br>- The movement of the players still feels unnatural and clumsy
<br>- Goalkeepers are still very bad (!). Especially on one on one situation, they don&apos;t slide towards the ball (the same problem was in Fifa 15)
<br>
<br>If you never played fifa, than its 6/10, slightly above average, but if you are like me, playing fifa each year (I started with fifa 01) than its 4/10 - Fifa 15 with players updated to their current teams.

Is it a cooincidence that a lot of the people voting 10 seem to be new accounts who signed up just to review Fifa 16... Seen that happen many a time before on EA games that have been flops. What&apos;s also interesting is how all the critics rate this game so highly and not 1 negative review, yet the majority of gamers know this is a complete shambles. I regret not buying the PS4 version over the PC, then I could trade this trash in and at least get some money back.

<br>How a company this big can release such a big title with such big problems is a big, big fail. Did I say big? Oh yeah, I give this a big 0.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-16/user-reviews?user_review_id=5518885">Expand</a></span>

People with bad reviews are the die hard players, the good ones are from people who played 10 hours and than bought a shooter, or are little kids. Let me explain.
<br>
<br>The game engine dictates if you will win or not.....Yes, sounds strange right? First there are random passes, See 2 guys free, it sometimes passes to a defender not in the screen. Than you have the the passes are not consistent. Sometimes they will be passed in front of the player sometimes behind the player, sometimes to nobody. And I&apos;m a great passer, prefer to play without assistant, but online it is impossible to win in the higher leagues. Fouls can be very random. Shooting, sometimes it is hard, sometimes i pressed the button longer and am in the same position, but is a weak shot.  Another thing ALL BUGGS FROM FIFA 13,14,15 ARE STILL IN THE GAME. Didn&apos;t improve a thing. Basically they changed the player stats, made them look a bit nicer, added a new passing feature that is far from being finished, made strength more important than speed (a 90 speed player can be outrun by a 45 speed defender?????) and they had a new game.
<br>
<br>Online you ask?? Same problems, plus a lot more! People still abondon the match and you will not get the points. But there is something new. The engine has a huge error somewhere that disconnects you during a game (average 1 in 5 games sometimes more). EA knows this, but they don&apos;t fix it. Like always......
<br>
<br>Conclusion, everything they promised to fix, is left alone. Everything they actually try to fix is done in a way that made even worse than it was. The game isn&apos;t more real, the game is badly written. This is one of the few games in this age where when you loose while doing everything perfect.... They get that one point for the graphics. Although still a bit outdated for 2015???? Probably saving it for FIFA 17,18,19, because how are they gonna sell the game otherwise.
<br>
<br>PS: if you are a football/soccer fan you will not like this game. Every basic move (passing, shooting, controlling, etc.) is messed up. Safe yourself money, time and disappointment and buy a different game. Play beautifull??? it is more play awkward.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-16/user-reviews?user_review_id=5530069">Expand</a></span>

<br>Just to be clear - the gameplay is decent and I&apos;m glad they haven&apos;t made pace the only important stat like the last 2 years.
<br>
<br>BUGS:
<br>
<br>- Game crashes when you&apos;ve made certain new signings (across all platforms).  Means you cant make it past Jan in the first season much of the time.
<br>
<br>- It constantly rains in England, like every game
<br>
<br>- Many glaring bugs have not been fixed from last year including youth signing, inability to switch custom tactics during a match, ridiculously high board demands and many many more.
<br>
<br>Basically Career mode has been half arsed, and less tested.  The most frustrating thing is I bought it again thinking they might actually do what they say this time.  Wont be buying it next year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-16/user-reviews?user_review_id=5516558">Expand</a></span>

Over the year EA has always opted to take fun elements out of the game and replace them with &quot;realism&quot;. Starting with the first-touch system this dipped to new lows though and leaves this game now completely unplayable. Every fun game element like long distance goals and beautiful balls through holes in the enemy&apos;s defence have been made completely nonfunctional and suddenly every bronze keeper can pull off the most ridiculous diving saves.
<br>
<br>The resulting game is one of short passes and a boring, slow gameplay that rewards possession game and not risk-taking. Every goal is a sweaty affair of rebounds and 10-yarders as every game seems more and more tedious.
<br>
<br>Quite frankly, EA and FIFA have once again tricked their fanbase in an overpriced piece of software that brings no innovation and a sever worsening in gameplay just for player database updates.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-16/user-reviews?user_review_id=5614700">Expand</a></span>

<br>Draft mode - well it really good idea, feels great when you are building the team. But once you start playing some FUTBOL you immediately get frustrated. It&apos;s slow, sluggish and boring.
<br>I though it&apos;s because the SCRIPT (EA admit the game uses software that favors one of the opponents when he/she sucks) was not on my side.
<br>Coll - let&apos;s try Career Mode with Bayern then - I really find it a little more fun then Ultimate team.
<br>It was even worse. I started playing at World class, but I won my first games with 4-5 goals each.
<br>Legendary was really frustrating, it&apos;s like your Robben (90+ pace) is slower than an old lady going to a Sunday church and PER MERTESAKER (under 40) has a jet engine in his ass and decimates the poor Dutch.
<br>Then I decided to do something I haven&apos;t done in years - check PES 16.
<br>It was fluid, fast, unpredictable and FUN compared to the FIFA. I switched back again to FIFA game and it felt as dynamic and fluid as chess.
<br>I got my money back from Origin (24hour return rule) and bought PES.
<br>If you don&apos;t believe me - get the PES demo from Steam - it&apos;s free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-16/user-reviews?user_review_id=5508222">Expand</a></span>

Soccer is another thing, I really hope that some new soccer games will be made by other companies (PES is even worse, the pc versions overall). They could improve the game with patches but they are already waiting for selling Fifa 17 which many sheep will buy as always.</span>

But here&apos;s what I don&apos;t like about this version (spoiler: there is nothing I LIKE about this version, that wasn&apos;t in any other version):
<br>
<br>First and foremost, Online interactions.
<br>I mean, the concept is great, and it has potential to be super fun. Creating your own dream team, then trying it out against other players&apos; dream teams? What could go wrong? Well.... Everything. But in this case, it&apos;s about how the game decides to disconnect you randomly during the match. I will be honest: I am writing this review while raging at random disconnection during FUT Draft. And before you ask - no, my internet connection wasn&apos;t down. No other service complained about getting disconnected.
<br>
<br>Issue number 2: Passing.
<br>The passing system is so broken in this version. I know that in some cases, they did it to optimize the gameplay, because in previous versions people were able to pull off insane actions with one proper pass, that was impossible to intercept/block/whatever. But right now, the amount of successful passes is insanely low. In many situations, my players, instead of just passing to someone relatively close to them, decided to choose a random direction of pass. I have checked my controller, and it&apos;s working. It also wasn&apos;t happening in previous versions. So at the time of me writing this, I had around 65% successful passes in FUT. That&apos;s insanely low (around 1 pass out of 3 was intercepted).
<br>
<br>Third problem: Switching between players.
<br>I have no idea how they changed it. But in previous versions, this system was somewhat good. It seemed to just know what player would be the best for the switch, even if not using RS, but just LB. In this version, LB and RS don&apos;t work the way you&apos;d think they do. It seems like it selects a player randomly, and not the player closest to the ball. I have lost many matches because of that.
<br>
<br>My rant could go on, but at this point no one is probably reading :P
<br>So yeah, I know it&apos;s kinda late, but... If you haven&apos;t bought FIFA16 yet, keep it that way!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-16/user-reviews?user_review_id=6291203">Expand</a></span>

<br>Also, and this is the worst, online games do not run smooth, they stutter constantly and a lot. Totally ruining the experience.

<br>When that disconnect happens, you lose.  You lose your entry fee for Fut Draft (which is expensive).  You lose your player&apos;s contracts.  You lose any coins you would have earned.  You lose your tournament.  You just lose.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s the most frustrating because it&apos;s otherwise a compelling game.  It&apos;s just terrible to have an epic last minute victory for a big prize on a tough difficulty level, and then have it taken away due to poor implementation on the EA server side.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s frustrating enough that I created this account just to let you know, you should definitely steer clear of this game.  It&apos;s not worth it.  Customer service is impossible with EA, and you&apos;re just buying heartbreak.

<br>The game also in some aspects suddenly feels really easy;
<br>
<br>For the first 3 games, every shot I took ended up in the back of the net and defending (especially blocking shots) also felt really easy. Just line up with the attacker and hold LT. Before, pacey players with good dribbling would tear it around me and finish the strike. Now I just jockey them, block the shot or push them off the ball. It&apos;s easy.
<br>I can&apos;t use pace anymore for through balls either, as the defenders are stronger than my strikers, but also just as quick. I just get bullied off the ball all the time. So sloooow passing build-ups and early crosses in to 3 at the front, seems like the only tactic for me now.
<br>Also the attackers lack so much pace even my through balls and wide balls go astray because the players can&apos;t keep up with the pace of a fizzy ball. It sucks.
<br>All my goals now look like that 42 pass goal at St. Mary&#x2019;s Stadium the weekend before last (United v southampton).
<br>
<br>The only positive new feature is the player training. That&apos;s it.  Well, except for the fact they replaced the academy May update with training, which is annoying too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-16/user-reviews?user_review_id=5515494">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is absolutely brilliant.The graphics is ridicilously detailed the faces of some player is like watching the real one, the clothes are animated when you pull you opponent attacker it stretches etc get dirty so on .
<br>
<br>I am playing the game on slow settings and the pace is very realistic like if I would watch a real match. The other thing what I have found fantastic that different players have animations and movement what feels very different. For example I am playing carreer mode with Arsenal and Welbeck and Giroud althouh they have similar body structure the both feel and move very uniquely and smaller players like Sanchez again an other category,
<br>
<br>The weather system also not just a graphical overlay it actually affects the ball pysics and how the players move on the field beside the &quot;eyecandy&quot;.
<br>
<br>I could say so many positive things I have experienced about this game like its features in the career mode(pre season transfers, training, news,etc) after I have just finished my first season with Arsenal.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t like to waste my time on writing reviews but this game deserve a much better score and more positive reviews. (I don&apos;t know maybe I am not nitpicking on the small changes because I haven&apos;t played fifa 13,14,15, and my opinion based like it was a fresh title ...who knows)
<br>
<br>Also there are some low score reviews with complains I have never experinced, Like I have seen one claming that the game is buggy mess with bugs like you can&apos;t finish a season at carreer mode . So how could I? And I haven&apos;t experieced any bug in my carreer play in 30 hour of gameplay.
<br>
<br>My review is not based on what improved from last years but I am sure that anyone who like footbal and don&apos;t have the last year version of FIFA will be satisfied with this game just as much as I do.
<br>
<br>I have not tried online so I can&apos;t comment on that but the single player part is a 10/10.
<br>
<br>Just a bit of my story
<br>
<br>I have been considering to buy either this or PES but I tried the demos and although I felt that both of these have good gameplay and I felt that PES&apos;s character movement animations are a bit smoother but the FIFA has a lot better atmosphere with its commentary and audio that make it a lot better experience for me not to mention its licenses. Playing the Barclay Premier League is a joy with all its perfecly detailed stadium with its great audio athmosphere.
<br>
<br>I suggest you to try the free demos and decide yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-16/user-reviews?user_review_id=5524847">Expand</a></span>

This is by far the best FIFA released.</span>

<br>Positioning is the key for this game. FIFA 16 is a game that, you have to play with ball in the midfield. If you are a risk taker in a serious amount, get ready to lose lots of matches.
<br>
<br>You have to be very patient and make the right call. Losing the ball in 2nd area mostly result conceding a goal.
<br>
<br>You cannot take the ball through midfield to the forward, just because your player is fast. You need to hide the ball watch the (mostly the second) defenders and do your trick.
<br>
<br>The thing that I like is the passing. Players have to turn their faces in order to make a smooth pass. Crossing is not easy like the old games if you have a defender next to you, it is better to pass it back or a fancy trick to feint the defender.
<br>
<br>Knowing every single button on your joystick gives you a huge advantage. You cannot go into penalty area easily just because you know using the right stick. It is better to read in game button commands. Just do not cry if you do not want to.
<br>
<br>I almost forgot, running at the first half with full speed will cause you to play with zero stamina at the end of 20 minutes. This feature helped me a lot against only runner players. I score mostly after the minute of 75. Just put your team on defensive stance, focus on defending like a boss and watch your opponent tear at the end of the game.
<br>
<br>Game has some negative sides which can be seen on other games. However, you cannot exploit lots of things and it is a good game in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-16/user-reviews?user_review_id=5521940">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The most noticable changes are:
<br>1. Gameplay is now more middle pitch oriented than in FIFA 15.  That is good thing but there are still a lot of gameplay problems (stupid players switching, etc...) that are even more noticable than in FIFA 15.
<br>2. And thats all :-D Yes there are new features but theyre few and tiny so they do not have much impact.
<br>
<br>I do not recomend you to buy FIFA only when your last footbal game is 2 or more years old. Do not buy footbal games every year. You will be dissapointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-16/user-reviews?user_review_id=5838481">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ Best football game on the market
<br>
<br>- Gfx only slightly improved over fifa 15.
<br>- Moneymaking machine called Ultimate Team, I got lucky on a few packs.. but I can imagine it being frustrating not getting anything.
<br>- Sometimes the game feels scripted. I have a pretty insane team and when I come up against a 60 something chemistry rated team with silvers I miss every shot and pass. Whilst the other team never misses. And no I&apos;m not a bad player, have been playing fifa in higher divisions for years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fifa-16/user-reviews?user_review_id=5844954">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game has the worst AI. They don&apos;t miss passes, keepers are perfect, and there are only 2-3 patterns of attack for AI. When a player has a ball AI is pretty much useless and its is to dribble (on any difficulty)

<br>Anyway the game in global is the worst football released to date.</span>
