<br>It looks fine for the most part, if a little unpolished in one or two places - particularly with the most notable being the non-synced lip movement with the characters when they are supposedly speaking.
<br>Without a mic this game can be very unforgiving, whereas it&apos;s much easier if you&apos;re able to speak commands because it&apos;ll take much less time to chat than to pick out commands from a list you have no idea how it&apos;s going to come up on the screen.
<br>It&apos;s ok, but I wouldn&apos;t write home about it, even if Wheaton is one of the voice actors in it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/there-came-an-echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=5041940">Expand</a></span>

From the first simple commands you give your cryptographer turned soldier, you feel a massive sense of accomplishment and power. You are the on in control. You analyze the situations, give orders on the fly, and watch as your team expertly carves a path through enemy soldiers. There are some parts of the story that feel cliche, and the voice controls aren&apos;t always responsive, but the accuracy I have seen from my time playing it far outweighs any minor hiccups, and is leagues above other games that implement similar features. If you have a decent microphone and $15, There Came an Echo is a must buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/there-came-an-echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=5048377">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As for the game part, the game is only a few hours long and the combat is rather shallow with each of your 4 units having identical base stats and being able to equip two of four weapons (in addition to a weak pistol weapon) also the missions are heavily scripted affairs that leave little room for trying to be creative with the game&apos;s limited mechanics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/there-came-an-echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=5054686">Expand</a></span>

If you have any accent you&apos;re **** If your mic is bad you&apos;re **** etc. Watched Total Biscuit&apos;s WTF on this game and boy this guy is lucky. Almost 100% recognition of his commands! I have trouble to zoom in and out, and moving my squad to Alpha 2 or Foxtrot 1 is a feat that I haven&apos;t achieved in several hours, despite a lot of trying and listening to its correct pronunciation. Hell, I have trouble to recognize Pause, Back or Options (menu navigation also accepts voice input). Freaking Back! How much can I **** up a word as simple as that?! I mean, of course I have accent, and my mic is some 15 bucks **** but just how much can you mess up words like Back or Apply? I have zero trouble conversing with english-speakers or using Google Voice even with that same mic. I wonder how could they do VR that bad when there are many excellent solutions on the market already.
<br>Couldn&apos;t even navigate the training room, didn&apos;t touch the campaign. For me this game has zero playability. Perhaps I&apos;ll give it a try again when they add my native language support (I&apos;m already awed knowing how bad its support usually is).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/there-came-an-echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=5058956">Expand</a></span>
