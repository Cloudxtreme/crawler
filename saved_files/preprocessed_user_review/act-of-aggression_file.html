By far the biggest fun suck is the economy - there are too many resource types, resource nodes are spread thinly and far apart, and they&apos;re vulnerable and very difficult to defend. Heavy armour - the most fun aspect of any RTS - is too expensive to mass and too easily killed (as well as being too difficult to repair). Ultimately, you&apos;re left feeling like you just never have enough money to do anything fun. I already have that  IRL, I don&apos;t need my games to remind me of it.
<br>
<br>Thanks to the far-flung resource nodes, there is a massive reliance on rush tactics and small-group action involving loads of micromanagement. If micro isn&apos;t your thing, and especially if you prefer to play at a slower pace and turtle a bit, then this game is most definitely not for you.
<br>
<br>The net result of all of this is that you spend so much time worrying about resources that the game feels more like some kind of badly done economic strategy game than an actual strategy game involving actual, memorable tank/other battles, which is what most of us will want, but won&apos;t get.
<br>
<br>Another criticism is that the jets are far too slow, and by slow I mean some of them are slower than an APC. I mean, come on.
<br>
<br>If you still insist on buying this, wait until it&apos;s like 75% off on Steam a year or two from now and get it then. I guarantee that the multiplayer community won&apos;t stick around long, so you won&apos;t be missing out on much anyway.
<br>
<br>Eugen, if you read this, I have some quick and easy suggestions that&apos;ll put the fun right back into this:
<br>1. Reduce resource load from three types, to one. Having to collect and manage three separate resources adds zero gameplay value, in fact it&apos;s just frustrating and a major point of irritation. I&apos;d rather focus on building tanks than worrying about finding and defending resource nodes.
<br>2. Make the passive resource generating buildings cheaper to build (both in actual cost and in power requirements), or just increase their income rate substantially.
<br>3. Reduce costs of most of the units in the game.
<br>
<br>Do those three and bam, you&apos;re back to doing it like the &quot;golden age RTS&quot; you claimed this was.
<br>
<br>TL;DR: I came to AoA looking for an RTS full of memorable tank battles. I left disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/act-of-aggression/user-reviews?user_review_id=5504892">Expand</a></span>

It feels like a budget campaign, but they&apos;re not charging a budget price for the game...
<br>
<br>Also, there are a lot of gameplay problems and bugs. Unit pathfinding and responsiveness is a mess. You click 5 soldiers to go around a building, 2 of them will go one way, 2 more will go the other way, and 1 of them will get stuck and sort of twitch around for a bit. You have 2 tanks side by side and you order them to attack different targets, they start attacking, then if you select them again and order them to change and focus the same target they just...ignore you forever. I right click 50 times and they don&apos;t focus or reposition if they are out of range, they just ignore you and keep attacking separate targets. You select a group of long range snipers to kill garrisoned soldiers, some of them do it while others keep running until they reach melee range and get slaughtered. Completely inexcusable. You wanna micro your wounded units to the back of your army mid-fight? Yeah, good luck with that. And the devs have the nerve to add bonus objectives to not lose any troops on some missions, when units do whatever they feel like. Awesome.
<br>
<br>Also, there are typos EVERYWHERE. In tooltips, in menus, everywhere. The first thing you see when you log in the game is the message &quot;Welcome in Act of Aggression!&quot;. Lovely. Then you start the campaign and the game tells you to press A and click to attack-move. It&apos;s a lie. A is camera scroll left. Q is attack move. Wrong button prompts on the tutorial. Seriously?
<br>
<br>I could go on. The game might have potential, but right now it&apos;s a hot mess, and its problems are very serious. Anyone who has played an RTS with bad pathfinding knows that patching never fixes it. If it&apos;s screwed on release, the game&apos;s doomed, period. The game is definitely, DEFINITELY not worth the premium price tag, but I&apos;d even hesitate to recommend it for 50% off. Just because there are very few alternatives doesn&apos;t mean that we should be satisfied with rubbish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/act-of-aggression/user-reviews?user_review_id=5457433">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately after about 3 to 4 skirmish games trying to figure out what was what, I just got frustrated with the UI and crazy upgrade system.
<br>
<br>Graphically its good, game play wise it could be good.  But really there are a couple of issues which  ruin this game.
<br>
<br>The UI is horrible.
<br>- Resource stats and power stats are confusing at best
<br>- Upgrades are tucked away in menus and submenus with little to no explanation of their purpose.
<br>- You have to click the main base then click through multiple menus to build things!
<br>-  There seems to be a million buttons / options but no explanations!
<br>
<br>Resource management.
<br>- Ok so three resources, you need to build three types of refinery.  Then you need to build warehouses which, the collectors need to drop the resources off at.  Often you will get a log jam occurring here and your economy grinds to a halt.
<br>
<br>- Warehouses fill up super quickly, meaning you don&#x2019;t collect any more resources they just disappear.  This requires you to keep build more and more of these buildings.
<br>
<br>- if the refinery runs dry, all collectors will stop and do nothing.
<br>
<br>- You seem to be required to spend an in-ordinate amount of time managing problems with resource collection and managing the economy rather than focusing on anything else.
<br>
<br>Vehicles
<br>- lots of Vehicles a plus maybe?  But no explanation of what they do or what they are best suited for.
<br>so its kind of like,  just spam a bit of everything and hope for the best.
<br>
<br>- Lots of vehicle upgrades, again confusing.
<br>
<br>- Some upgrades need purchasing then applying to units individually
<br>
<br>- When you have a group of vehicles, Its difficult to distinguish vehicles from one another. (they look similar)
<br>
<br>This is NOT Command and Conquer, its kind of trying to be a hybrid of Command and Conquer and World in Conflict.   There seems to be steep learning curve and very dry combat,  there&#x2019;s no fun or crazy units.
<br>
<br>The beauty of Command and Conquer was it was easy to pick-up quickly and have a real blast.   This is confusing and frustrating with too many options and sub options.  If you have time to invest in trying to figure this game out. Then maybe it is great, If you just want to jump in and have a blast, stick with CnC or Starcraft.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/act-of-aggression/user-reviews?user_review_id=5468422">Expand</a></span>

So I was really thrilled when I Heard that Eugen would create a spiritual successor to Generals, but this was nowhere near what I expected.
<br>Graphics is nice but feels disconnected from the action (Wargame gameplay feels more involved). Music and sound is almost worthless. Effects and voices are really low-grade. This could however be easily overlooked, but the thing is, the game isn&apos;t involving. You&apos;re heavily constrained with Resources and the resource-system is the worst I&apos;ve ever seen in any RTS game. Build a refinery, 5 minutes later, you&apos;ll have to sell the refinery to build a new one a few meters away from the previous site because the resource-pools happen to be spread all over the Place... This is a stupid and tedious system. They&apos;ve also opted for the COH-type of progression where you&apos;ll have to unlock move powerful units and Buildings by upgrading to higher defcon levels. This might work great in COH, but I can&apos;t say the same for this game. And don&apos;t even get me started on the Aircrafts... They use the exact same mechanism as in the Wargames-series. Which is, you&apos;ll have to call in air support. While this worked great in the wargame-series games. It&apos;s just stupid in a small-scale RTS. And the fact that your airplanes will fly as fast as any guy can run, it&apos;s just a sad sight.
<br>
<br>Sadly, I can&apos;t recommend this game to anyone. If you want a cool large scale action RTS, play any of the Wargame-series games or World In Conflic. But if you want a &quot;real&quot; RTS, then the old C&amp;C Generals (with the hundreds of different mods) is a much better gaming experience than this game. If you just want something new, then I suggest you wait until this is at 75% sale on Steam.
<br>
<br>As a standalone game in a World where C&amp;C didn&apos;t exist nor the Wargame-series. Then I would have given this game a 6 or 7. But since the mentioned game series DO exist and the developer here played the &quot;Spiritual successor to Generals&quot;-card it deserves no more than a 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/act-of-aggression/user-reviews?user_review_id=5478144">Expand</a></span>

There was so much detail in the units, in their animations. Also the story (at least of the original) was great and the movie- sequences had that shlock-charme to them. This one however...the actors who speak the units sound demotivated and dull, the animations are actually worse than in the original (just check out the infantry and helicopters- they look like robots and toys respectively) and the story is nonexistant.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is also weird. Every unit dies in seconds, even very expensive, upgraded ones. Looking for resources is tedious and complely useless- the system of the predecessor worked perfectly, why change it? And everything feels just...wrong. Like someone took all the love and care out of this game.
<br>
<br>Maybe you will have some fun with it in Multiplayer, I don&apos;t know, but if you own the original Act of War, play that instead- it&apos;s better in every way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/act-of-aggression/user-reviews?user_review_id=5507304">Expand</a></span>

<br>Act of aggression is one of those games that a lot of people say its a C&amp;C generals and Act of War sequel, in reality the game is different in almost every way, trying to compare it to Generals or Act of War itself will only bring you disappointment and bad nostalgia.
<br>
<br>In fact if your reading this review i think you should be considering this game as its own RTS with its own playstyle and gameplay.
<br>
<br>Team games: So being a new RTS i think Act of Aggression has a lot to offer for its price point, if your looking for a semi casual game, it offers a lot for people that enjoy 2vs2, 4v4 and 8 people free for all. These large team games offer a lot because the games scale almost reaches the size of a medium sized supreme commander game, with tons of units on the field, lots of buildings and tech paths to choose from.
<br>
<br>Single Player: When looking at single player sadly it shows an average RTS campaign that provides a decent enough challenge if you want to get all the hidden achievements. It also feels a bit short and its no campaign like those presented in Act of War or Generals, but there&#x2019;s potential to get better with future expansions.
<br>
<br>Complexity: One of its strongest but weakest point is its complexity, this game can be a nightmare to learn for new players, but after learning it provides a lot of different strategies and ways to play. Its a hard to learn hard to master game.
<br>
<br>Competitive 1vs1: I love competitive 1vs1 RTS its what i enjoy the most out of games currently, so being a new game i picked it up fast reaching the top 5 having over 500 hours of ingame time. Sadly the ladder system does not provide good incentive to play, its merged with the 2vs2 ladder making it pointless to play 1vs1 at all currently. Still you would expect the 2vs2 ladder to be active but sadly it isnt.
<br>
<br>Tournaments: One of the saving grace&#xB4;s for me when playing this game, is the tournaments the community is organizing because its providing a lot of cool strategies and interesting moments, it makes you want to get better at the game.
<br>
<br>So in the end i really think this game has a lot of potential, you can see the developers are taking steps to improve it constantly, however it feels they are still fixing and adding features that were supposed to be at launch. Comparing this RTS with others it feels the developers do know what their doing as with every patch the game gets better.
<br>
<br>So get this game if you have the patience to wait for patches as it&#x2019;s one of the best RTS out there that isn&#x2019;t SC2. It has depth, complexity, fun factor but a terrible learning curve, some balance issues, terrible ladder system and average campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/act-of-aggression/user-reviews?user_review_id=5581000">Expand</a></span>

<br>A nice SP campaign plus alot of options in the MP with ranking ladders add enough stuff to let you have fun with this great RTS for months!

You have 3 resources to acquire, resources run out so quickly, units and upgrades are very expensive, units die extremely quickly despite their expense. There are mechanics for resource generation but again they take a long time to build to due expenses, one of the mechanics relys on collecting prisoners which only your infantry can do, this just makes the resource management experience even more tedious. Why the hell they decided to make resource management so time consuming and unnecessarily complex is beyond me. Have 1 resource. Have it be mine-able and have buildings that can generate it... boom, problem solved!
<br>
<br>You cant build anywhere (fair enough) but the build radius is often quite small and makes building your base very annoying, also the radius depends on the building... yeah some buildings you can build quite a distance from your HQ, others have to be literally right next to it.
<br>
<br>RTS games like this are in a difficult position... they arent small scale enough to do effective micro in and indeed there are very few mechanics here that support micro in the way that say company of heros does. But this game isnt large scale enough to support huge armies and massive battles like supreme commander, I mean the engine and map size certainly support this but the current resource management and unit costs certainly dont. Act of aggression sits awkwardly between these two types of RTS....
<br>
<br>Right now this game is just a chore to play, this is coming from someone who played every C&amp;C up until C&amp;C3, supcom, company of heros, starcraft, wargame series and even act of war. There is a good game in act of aggression somewhere but its just not there yet... If you like RTS keep an eye on it and see if they make it more playable, maybe get it on a sale, right now its not worth it. Oh and the single player is pretty awful, I wouldn&apos;t get it at all if that&apos;s all you&apos;re interested in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/act-of-aggression/user-reviews?user_review_id=5471995">Expand</a></span>

Eugene, I have to say after playing this game for over 70 hours (mostly multiplayer and around 80% winrate, purely for information so you know im not a casual gamer sitting here whining about units being unbalanced because I don&apos;t know how to play), It&apos;s a really &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; game, I&apos;m madly dissapointed. The game is so unbalanced and the units are so unresponsive. The mechanics of an RTS that makes it good is that theres always a good unit vs another unit, while in this game you have units like the terminator, that only costs aluminium, that can be upgraded to fight and asskick EVERYTHING and in the game. Its so easy to just mass out as much random units as you can, and it almost always works, its just so mind numbing compared to other games when you actually have to think about what units that counters the enemies units. Also, what the **** did you think when you made the fennek? Yeah, lets make a unit that is really cheap, can outrun everything, make it really overpowered against buildings and give it stealth... holy s*** seriously? Even if you have stealth detection, if you&apos;re not inside your base with a huge army with stealth detect at all times, your base will go down so fast against fennek and also the metal storm, that you can just forget about the game if you are more than 50 meters from your HQ at any given time. And yes, the enemy will always find a way around you, and if you are supposed to have enough units and stealth detect to actually counter him, you wont be able to do anything other than turle the whole game. This is especially true in bigger MP games when you play 2on2 or more players together on bigger maps. The fast patches after launch also indicates something positive, but also negative about you releasing the game too early, and not being a finished product. I just wanted this game to be the next good oldshool&apos;ish RTS, but It&apos;s not, It&apos;s actually a really bad game, objectively I would say, because it really really is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/act-of-aggression/user-reviews?user_review_id=5500395">Expand</a></span>

<br>The missions are pretty horrible and the kind of hard that isn&apos;t fun.
<br>Basically it appears like they played the mission exactly one way and adapted the wave of enemies for this style. Then they were like: it&apos;s beatable.
<br>
<br>I just can&apos;t find a good way to play this game. It&apos;s always the same: you&apos;re low on resources, the enemy keeps sending wave after wave, get frustrated.
<br>While such missions are common and they should be in an RTS game, pretty much all of them are like this. And it just gets more ridiculous the further you go down the game.
<br>
<br>In the last mission you&apos;re low on resources, the enemy constantly sends long-range waves of enemies, stealth airplanes, and in between an endless stream of tanks.
<br>Once you think you have your defenses set up good enough, I present to you: the Koalitsija, a long-range heavy tank that carpet bombs your base which you can&apos;t get rid of fast enough because your Artillery doesn&apos;t do **** to it... because it&apos;s heavily tanked of course.
<br>
<br>Ruse was hard the first time I played it, you learn it, you can beat it easily, even on the hardest level.
<br>Wargame is a lot harder but challenging and fun.
<br>Act of Aggression feels unpolished and unnecessarily bloated in terms of unit/building/resource variety.
<br>
<br>Bottom line - it&apos;s the kind of hard that isn&apos;t challenging, just hard for the sake of frustrating players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/act-of-aggression/user-reviews?user_review_id=5467107">Expand</a></span>
