<br>
<br>Other than that they&apos;ve added depth to the career mode with a more robust and complex upgrade system and the addition of classic car invitational races during the season to change things up.
<br>
<br>The cars are more enjoyable to drive, probably due to the actual changes to the cars in F1 this year and the graphical upgrades are nice whilst the game remains one of the best optimised cross platform games out there on PC.
<br>
<br>TL;DR: An upgrade in every way on last year but in need of some balancing and AI patching to be truly great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/f1-2017/user-reviews?user_review_id=7490353">Expand</a></span>

The game does have flaws but the good most definitely makes up for the bad. I would suggest this game and here is why.
<br>
<br>Good:
<br>
<br>1: AI does not follow a strict path like they did in previous F1 games (By what I have heard)
<br>2: AI will fight for their position and will not just give it up, sometimes they will fight for it so much that they end up braking to late and running off the road.
<br>3: Graphics are great (Much better than 2016&apos;s version even though its 1 year difference)
<br>4: Lots of choices in F1 (Formula 1) cars from classic to modern.
<br>5: Good career that acts as if you are a real F1 driver and not just a randomly created storyline.
<br>6: Real F1 rules from Engine Swaping penalties as in if you got 4 engines you want to make those 4 last the whole season and same with gearbox.
<br>7: Realistic damage mechanics somethings and F1 2016 and before has never had.
<br>8: Engine damage.
<br>9: Gearbox Damage.
<br>10: AI difficulty adjustment from 0 Very Easy -&gt; 110 Ultimate.
<br>11: Easy to learn.
<br>12: Each F1 team has different expectations as in if you pick Mercedes AMD you will be expected to do a lot and if you pick Mclaren or Sauber you are not expected much at all.
<br>13: Each F1 team has a different spec car Mercedes AMG being the best car out there and Mclaren and Sauber being tue worst.
<br>14: Can get contract terminated if you underperform.
<br>15: Start out as a second driver and can work your way up to primary driver.
<br>16: Can switch teams after each season.
<br>17: Need to do practices for points for the R&amp;D Tree to upgrade your car.
<br>18: Has R&amp;D Tree to upgrade your car.
<br>19: Have to qualify to figure out what spot on the grid you start out in (Grid being position at start of race).
<br>20: If you crash and your wheel comes off you will have to retire from session and you get auto placed to last or if you take out someone and he looses wheel first you will then be placed one spot or more above the person or persons you crashed.
<br>21: Has choice of 2 lap to 100 percent race (2 lap being 2 laps a race 100 percent being 60-90 laps a race and then there is a 25 percent which is like 10-12 and 50 percent which is like 19-30)
<br>22: Can turn off or on damage.
<br>23: Can turn assists on or off.
<br>24: Can turn racing line on or off (Race line being a line that turns red or green Red being Brake Green being Gas).
<br>25: Can save mid race and or simulate the race.
<br>
<br>Bads:
<br>
<br>1: AI can get to agressive and crash you into a wall.
<br>2: Need to learn how AI plays/how they fight for their spot.
<br>3: Best played with a race wheel but can be played with a game pad.
<br>4: Has bugs but is being worked on so thats a plus
<br>5: Online has major issues (But not really a online game anyway in my honest opinion)
<br>
<br>With that being said I do suggest the game and would say you should buy it and get anyone interested in the game or any racing sims to buy the game. The game like I said does have its flaws but the game for sure is better than it is bad. The online issues are being worked on but I dont play online with the game so I cant say much on that, the game is for sure best in career mode. (only played 2-3 online games)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/f1-2017/user-reviews?user_review_id=7523741">Expand</a></span>

Well this game doesn&apos;t allow you to skip the qualifiers, practices or anything if you just want to race through career mode. Lost interest in the first race practice sessions as the game was trying to force me to practice every setup available on the first track. No thanks.</span>
