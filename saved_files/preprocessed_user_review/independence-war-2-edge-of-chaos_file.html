It&apos;s a shame that the sequal was cancelled.</span>

I-war is definitely a gem and an achievement of the past. Even now, rarely will we find such game quality. I am playing I-war EoC as I make this personal review. The sheer open endedness and the options are what keeps me playing it. Plus with the latest technology in graphics allows me to play this game with a much fresher look. The story is also something that hooked me from the start. With Newtonian physics involved, this game has quite an special appeal to it. I&apos;ve yet to play a game that equals it or surpasses I-war EoC. I hope there will be a future I-war 3 in the making with similar elements to make it a niche of some sort much that of Star Wars trilogy set. I give I-war EoC a solid 10 because a game of such quality should not go unnoticed. An amazing game for an old timer.

Freespace and the X-Wing/TIE-Fighter franchises are great fun, but they are airplane sims &quot;IN SPaAaAaACE!!!&quot;. IW:II uses a Newtonian physics engine (plus FTL and other hand-wavy technolgies) that allows for unconventional maneuvers. I use WASD to strafe/accelerate and Ctrl/Space to thrust down/up. The joystick controls roll/pitch/yaw. This control setup allows flight in any direction relative to your POV and your enemies. Unlike other franchises, I-War II places you at the helm of a large destroyer rather than a dogfighter. While the original I-War was a sim in the spirit of Star Trek: Bridge Commander (requiring the player to micromanage bridge crew), IW:II allows for a more traditional piloting perspective. This is facilitated by a prototype &quot;command section,&quot; a single seat vehicle that plugs into large warship chassis to serve as a cockpit and stand-alone evacuation vehicle. IW:II was an early attempt at a sandbox game, but its attempts at open-world gaming are mixed. There are too few side-quests, but there are many opportunities to play space pirate. Players require raw materials to trade and build with. These are gained by poaching interstellar trade routes, disabling ships, fighting off escorts, and calling in your pirate crew to pick up the loot. While repetitive, there are many trade routes to hit and they provide are variety of convoy types to raid. (Valuable items are highly guarded by military capital ships, requiring skill and luck to obtain.) The shortcomings of the sandbox are offset by the fun, space operatic story. It&apos;s a tale of murder and revenge, greedy corporations versus the little guys. It has all been done before, but it works well combined with the fresh gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/independence-war-2-edge-of-chaos/user-reviews?user_review_id=740569">Expand</a></span>

The graphics were goods when it came out, and aged quite well, simples but efficient. Music is good and fits very well the atmosphere, sounds meets what we ask them. Don&apos;t expect to play this game without a joystick, but with one the controls are amazing. All the interface works awesome : straight to the core. Physics, dynamics of combat, random attacks and piracy make the world very lively. All you could ask could be random events, and some are quite brought by storyline. There&apos;s some addons out there, some very little but which will improve the game a lot (like location finder, you&apos;ll understand if you play the game), and some extends the game playtime a lot, like freeform. I&apos;m still looking for a space-sim game to be that good since then. A must have for any fan of the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/independence-war-2-edge-of-chaos/user-reviews?user_review_id=2642965">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story was great, and far beyond the amount of effort that goes into storylines nowadays. Pirating cargo, and bringing it back to base to use for manufacturing... this game was way ahead of it&apos;s time.

<br>It will go down in history to anyone who has played it as a landmark in PC gaming. Unfortunately, due to it&apos;s early release, the younger generation gamers missed out. So you&apos;ll probably find a greater number of positive reviews for COD.
