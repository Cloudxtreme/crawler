It is not worth the money. The gunplay is poor, as are the sounds, it crashes, have game stopping bugs. It might only be &#xC2;&#xA3;6 but dont waste your money on this!</span>

<br>
<br>First of all, most of the people with some reason know this website is not a reliable source at all..
<br>Secondly, if you care to open a new tab and check the rest of the other people&apos;s user reviews, you will see a bunch of 0&apos;s saying &quot;I can&apos;t play this&quot; and blablabla. They probably have the same effort of a sloth. I ran the game. Found many bugs, but it ran.
<br>Thirdly, this game CHANGED. It didn&apos;t change like &quot;wooow it&apos;s a brand new world now&quot; but the name changed from &quot;Beatdown&quot; to &quot;Dino Horde&quot;, but the page kept the same bad score from the older version.
<br>I bought the game without any discount and you should know that I don&apos;t regret doing so. In my personal opinion, it was a lucky shot! Keep on reading.
<br>
<br>There are many things you must know before considering buying this game. Many of them may sound scary or repelling for players, but I will try to put the most balance possible. Here we go:
<br>
<br>1- YES! THE GAME HAS A LOT OF BUGS! Buut it had more than now! Bugs are not immortal creatures that will ruin your game forever, so they should be a temporary blocking gameplay factor, not permanent. If you play the game normally you won&apos;t notice a lot of problems, except...
<br>2- ANIMATION ISSUES! YES! The game has some animations that look very bad, but at least they are not problems that directly interfere with gameplay. Just like bugs, animations can be solved over time.
<br>3- SOUNDS! Yea, the weapon sounds are odd but even the developers agree that they must improve the noises and the animations. They are normally trying to improve the game by listening to the players, so I guess that if you have no patience to wait for the game to grow mature, which may take months or even more, you shouldn&apos;t buy it. Back to the sound topic, I hated to hear a 6 bullet &quot;magnum&quot; pistol fire like a silenced pistol. T-Rex and Spinosaurus screaming is over the tone of the volume. No matter how low your sounds are, when those dudes scream, they do it really loud.
<br>4- Did I tell you that the current developing team has TWO people? Oh, and about the DLC, the staff is mentioning that these ones are FREE DLC. They do already have a store where you can buy armor colors and hats, and honestly, I intend to buy a few!
<br>
<br>Overall pros:
<br>- DINOSAURS! Come on, who doesn&apos;t like to fight against those?! If you are here because of the word &quot;Dino&quot; then this is a reason to like it. The staff also asks the players opinion on dinosaurs to add.
<br>- 3 Main classes: A gunner dude, a support dude, an a stealth dude. Cool enough.
<br>- Modes to play: You can play the famous horde &quot;Survival&quot; mode, or some other PvP modes. There is even a mode where you can control a T-REX to defend your eggs from players trying to steal them.
<br>- VEHICLES! And the promise to bring more! If you don&apos;t experience lag, you won&apos;t have much problems controlling them. They add some nice experience to the game.
<br>- Ingame upgrade system: You can either buy special abilities to yourself in Survival mode or buy some from a lot of guns.
<br>
<br>Overall cons:
<br>- I personally didn&apos;t lke the voices. They don&apos;t seem to be there, speaking. Neither the sound effects, but they want to change most of these, so..
<br>- Unfinished gameplay: There are still issues about controlling your character in general, but it is playable. Just make sure you understand how each class outstand.
<br>- Many flawed animations: Specially when it comes to holding guns while moving in 1st person running, or inside a car and view of teammates or 3rd person when having recoils while shooting. The hands go &quot;into&quot; the wrists. Again, these tend to disappear over time.
<br>- AI: Most of the dinos do basically the same, which is chase who shoots them the most. Still, even on Medium the game may be hard to beat if team is not very used to the tactics, which exist!
<br>
<br>Overall, I think it came out too fresh from the oven. The game is definitely not polished. If this were a game sold in a DVD shelf at a retail store. I would give it a 3 and tell you not to buy it. BUT THAT&apos;S NOT THE CASE! This game is improving over time! This MUST be considered! The game IS fun, if you join nearly any game near your geographic zone you will meet a mostly friendly community and will pass some time killing dinos, dying, getting angry and laughing!
<br>
<br>The main Reason I see it as an 8 is because of its potential. Right now, I guess it deserves 4 or 6.. 5.5? Among so many issues when you get to a game, you normally spend a few hours enjoying it if you ignore things that may &quot;bother&quot; the eyes.
<br>
<br>Given that, right now I think it&apos;s not worth the price, but at a 25% discount or more you could give it a go. If you are too unsure, don&apos;t buy it. But if you do, you might turn yourself into one of the players that defend this game&apos;s potential, like me!
<br>By the way I have about 40 hours of play on Steam, I guess 20 from last week. Too bad Raptr is not keeping track of Dino Horde, but it did with Beatdown.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=3205911">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This game is buggy that&apos;s true but its also a hell of a lot of fun. Is it dumb? Yes. Is it poorly optimized? yes. but the devs have patched a lot that made this game unplayable. Honestly I think the game is about a 7.5 out of ten but i went higher because of the amount of OLD reviews that dont accurately show the game as is. It&apos;s Also free to try this week on Steam, so why not give it a try?</span>

                                        <span>Found this game super fun in a group. Had minor bugs but no real big issues. Always room for improvement but a lot of games are like that. It&apos;s been a blast so far. Definitely get it on discount for laughs. You get mechas, tanks and can play as the dinosaurs including a kamikaze style dinosaur. No complaints from my end.</span>

With the newest Update a lot has changed and it needs a review from all the bad voters.... it took a while but the devs made the afford to finish there product (not like many other bigger studios out there) Worth gaming.

I first played this game after seeing that it had a free couple of days on Steam, and I decided to check it out after remembering that one of my favorite Youtube gameplayers, Criken, had played it. After starting the game up and joining a glitched match, I decided to solo it, and it is honestly some of the most fun I&apos;ve had in a video game in a long time. Sure, the graphics aren&apos;t great. Sure, the gameplay is kinda funky at times. Sure, the guns and weapons in general don&apos;t look or feel like Battlefield. But all in all, I think this is actually a good game. Most of the bugs that people are talking about down there are before some patch updates and fixes, and I truthfully believe they should give the game a second chance. Keep in mind, this isn&apos;t supposed to be a 5-star legendary title from a major company, it&apos;s just an indie game that is struggling in a market of overly-scrupulous consumers, and I am giving it the chance as such. This isn&apos;t going to be a game I play thinking I will receive some major storyline or super realistic gameplay, but it is something I will play when everything else pisses me off and  I want to have fun. That&apos;s the keyword here, FUN. The game isn&apos;t revolutionary in terms of anything, but neither is Call of Duty or Battlefield anymore. In my personal opinion, Battlefield 3 also gets a 7 for being boring and unoriginal. &quot;But Hisoka, Battlefield is the best thing ever!&quot; Not anymore it&apos;s not. But this isn&apos;t about Battlefield, it&apos;s about Orion: Dino Horde. And I like Orion: Dino Horde. The last thing, which in my opinion is a plus, is the fact that all the DLC packs that add a bunch of content to the game, are free. Completely free. So, support this game and it will continue to get even better, rather than gripe about something and make no moves to change it, you slugs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=3438741">Expand</a></span>

The makers have acknowledged that the current product, which is the only thing we have to judge right now, is a severely buggy game that should be in beta at best. This is nowhere near a &apos;10&apos; which a few people here seem to think. That is, by definition, putting this game in its current state up there with the greatest games of all time and just flat out silly especially when half of the current &apos;10&apos; reviews note that the game has potential or can be fun if they fix the issues. I&apos;m sorry, but if a game deserves a 10 on any review then there is simply nothing else they need to improve on because the game is perfect. Dino Beatdown is not that game, at least not now. I&apos;d wait for a sale or at the very least wait to see if the developers stick to their word and fix the issues here before buying. Trust me, there are A LOT of issues that need fixing. Best of luck to Spiral Games on both Dino Beatdown and their future projects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=2330807">Expand</a></span>

I feel bad for the developers: it&apos;s a solid horde-slaughterer with fun co-op. It&apos;s easy to pick up, play, and stop whenever you feel like it.  A lack of dinosaur variety, annoying vehicle control, and a few other minor mistakes keep this game from a high score, however.</span>

These types of score abuse the system and are unrealistic. Very few games actually deserve a 0. That said, if it crashes badly on your system, then it does. And I can see it getting a bad score, but I have had ZERO crashes or bugs. I say give it a try when its on sale.

The visuals are fine, the gameplay is, surprisingly, good. i saw the 35 and was expecting much less than what i got. there isnt that much to it, but it has a few game modes and a leveling tree that gives quite a bit of replayability, all the while the developer seems to be continuously adding content and improving the stability of the game all the time. i personally have experienced no glitches or crashes of any kind, nor has any of the people i have played with. if you got it for 0.99 cents or free from a friend, you win! but honestly its worth normal price for some fun dino-killing action with friends.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=4003339">Expand</a></span>

I finally got a refund after 6 emails to support. I gave them a chance to fix this title, and if you look into the development team you will find out why the game is so bad, and always will be. David Prassel is a thief, and basically not only did the project leader steal $20,000 of kickstarter funds and then fire most of the development team, the developers also seem to have stolen assets from several other projects. Former employees and many reporters are backing this up. Stay away, far, far away.

The devs say that a &quot;last minute addition to the game&quot; caused the bugs that are present, but it is hard to believe that could result in the massive amount of fail in this game. The framerate chugs (and I have a higher-end pc), the environments are redundant (you can easily see the pattern in the environments by using your jetpack to get to a high place), the graphics are below average, the enemy AI is extremely retarded (They are rarely able to find their way into a building if you&apos;re hiding in one). Fortunately for you, you probably won&apos;t have to experience these bugs because more than likely you will not even be able to start up the game or join a server. I have yet to be able to play with my friends because I either mysteriously lose connection, or the server (which is populated by just 1 or 2 of my friends) says that it&apos;s full with invisible men that don&apos;t really exist. Sure it may be a cheap game but the devs have so far failed to meet their promises of goods in return for my money. It&apos;s like I went to Subway and paid the 8 dollars for a meal and they just gave me bread crumbs in return. What do you expect me to do with this? The devs even went so far as to pretty much commit fraudulant advertising for their game. They say you can blow up everything with their destructible environments. No. The only thing you can destroy the in the game are the vehicles, yourself, and dinos. It&apos;s class based, but there are only 3 classes so don&apos;t get excited. It&apos;s suppose to be fast-paced. No. You can hide in the buildings and it will take forever for the dinos to find you. You can kill tons of dinosaurs! No. Sure, there are waves with tons of dinos in them, but there are only three different types (raptors, trex, pterodactyl). They say the dino AI is dynamic. If you consider them running into walls and getting stuck in corners trying to find their way into the building, then sure, it&apos;s dynamic. They say you can go anywhere in huge, endless environments. No. The environments are pretty large, but they sure as hell aren&apos;t endless. On the steam forums, the developers lock threads where players offer criticisms for the game. They say they are offering ingame incentives because of how badly the game has launched. Uhhh, the large majority of us can&apos;t even play the game so how the hell is that going to help us? Bottom line is that if you buy this &quot;game&quot;, you will regret it. Save yourself the time and cash and stay far, far away from this title and anything else that happens to come from this piece of trash developer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=2336038">Expand</a></span>

Multiplayer servers constantly appear full when they are in fact empty, thus preventing you from ever playing a game with your friends, and dinosaurs clip through walls and run around aimlessly fueled by the immense stupidity their &quot;dynamic&quot; ai affords them. I&apos;m not even going to bother touching on the horrendous quality, lackluster graphics, lack of enemy variety, or gameplay bugs, because I don&apos;t need to. I&apos;m also pretty sure Steam didn&apos;t have anything to do with those...  Buyers beware, this game is an utter piece of festering garbage. I don&apos;t even want my money back. If there was some way I could just return this game to steam and have it removed from my library I would. 0 out of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=2338948">Expand</a></span>

if you are thinking of buying it just wait for a sale to get it.

<br>finally im giving it a 10 not because its a 10, but to offset the trolls and griefers, many that do not even own or play the game, who give it a 0-1. and while its not a 10, its not a 0!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=3120098">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you like trying to survive nearly endless hordes of enemies with various abilities then this is exactly what the game is. One of the best features is the unlock system. Playing as a class grants you unique bonuses that help you get started more smoothly in the early rounds (Free starting weapons and items, stat bonuses). To really enjoy the game I personally feel it has to be played multiplayer, and I&apos;ve found that public groups are surprisingly helpful most of the time. Another important thing to note is that starting out on Hard difficulty without any of the special unlocks is largely suicidal. If you can manage to find a public game and get some experience on any of the lower difficulties then tackling the hardest difficulties becomes a fantastic goal with a customized starting kit and good teammates.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-Drop-in co-operative multiplayer
<br>-Multiple classes
<br>-Customized loadouts (when unlocked)
<br>-Many upgrade paths once in game
<br>-Vehicles! Tanks, Mechs, and VTOLs if you&apos;re lucky enough to survive long enough to find them
<br>-Lots of achievements. You can actually unlock vanity items with enough of them!
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Occasional crashes (Alt-Tabbing and changing Options while in game 23/08/13)
<br>-Discouraging higher difficulties without teammates or unlocks
<br>-Lack of servers
<br>-Somewhat monotonous level design</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=3442555">Expand</a></span>

Being an Indie Studio and cheap game is not an excuse for release such a poor product.</span>

You spend most of the game camping in a building or in a vehicle. If your character sneezes and farts at the same time they die. The character classes only determine your starting ability and gear, there&apos;s nothing else they do (no discounts on gear or vehicles). There&apos;s bugs too (alot). It will be a while (not sure when or if ever) before this game will be known as a minor success or a cheap flop, at the rate people are giving up on this game it might never become the game the developers envisioned it would be. The only positive thing about it thus far is the fact that it&apos;s only $9 on steam right now (regular price is $10).

I haven&apos;t encountered a few bugs, and none of them were game breaking. It&apos;s just stuff like dinosaurs having weird movement or you spinning uncontrollably after you die (which I find funny and I definitely do not think that it degrades the game quality in any way).
<br>The game devs have been putting a lot of effort into this and I think that the scores are misleading. If you can put aside the weird bugs and if you don&apos;t care that much about hardcore graphics than you should enjoy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=3985335">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For $4, a game where you have the same abilities as a HALO Spartan(property of 343) in the gameplay of Team Fortress 2 is a good deal
<br>
<br>My only complaint is that the physics can be weird when a dinosaur hits you, and I wouldn&apos;t pay $11 for it, grabbing it during a steam sale is a good option.

For $3.74 that&apos;s a steal, considering you can sell cards and probably get that much in your wallet, also the game itself has 6 card drops. Solid 8 out of 10, I&apos;m excited to see what this game has next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=3446515">Expand</a></span>

Anyone who is a fan of FPS-style games and want to throw some serious lead down-field, this game is for you. There isn&apos;t any real storyline that I can tell, beyond the basics of being on a planet with dinosaurs and having advanced tech, which I think is another reason Metacrap is giving such a bad score. This game is amazing, and caters to a very specific group of players.
<br>
<br>Anyone can play it, but unless you love survival and wholesale slaughter, this will not be enjoyable for you. The controls are familiar, the graphics are not the best available, but for a small Dev team on a limited budget, there is not a thing wrong with them. You have to know going in when you pay $15 bucks for a game, it isn&apos;t going to look or feel like Halo or COD.
<br>
<br>This game throws in a new curve, adding vehicles to the mix, which sets it apart from other games of the &quot;Kill&apos;em all&quot; genre. I&apos;ve only played a little solo as of this posting, but in a day or two I&apos;ll be teaming up with 2-3 others, and I see hours of fun trying class combinations, testing all the weapons, and the fantastic augment system is better than a talent tree.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve also seen a lot of reviews that are over a year old stating the poor quality of this game, however that is simply not true. Updates and bug-fixes have been an ongoing process, and as of this posting, the game plays flawlessly. All in all, I hope to see more from this developer in the future. My standard rule of gaming is &quot;An hour of play for every dollar spent, minimum.&quot; This game qualifies easily, as long as you have a friend or two to bring along for the ride. Can it get repetitive at times? Certainly, its a wave-based survival game, there isn&apos;t much to it. But honestly, it&apos;s no different than the horde of FPS multi-player games flooding the market right now. COD and Halo got boring fast, because the game never really changes. Only the players do. The entire point of a game like this is to see how badass you can be, and to rub your friend&apos;s face in it. In a friendly competitive way, of course.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=3981276">Expand</a></span>

<br>And if you really don&apos;t want to move through grass which is as high as you
<br>to be attacked by dinos and kill them with your gun or just - as assault at least -
<br>use your jet pack to fly to the next little hill and use the scope to kill some,
<br>if you REALLY don&apos;t want to do that.. then you are a lost case.
<br>It is so much fun.

<br>The graphics are not top notch but really nice enough so you enjoy to look, if you have the time.

I didn&apos;t really find any bugs or anything unfavorable about this game. Maybe time will tell, but after playing about five hours, I do intend to go back and have some more fun with this little indie game that is currently available at a really good price.
<br>
<br>I would also add - This game, according to the website changelog, is being constantly updated with new features and small bug fixes. You don&apos;t see this very often in this industry and its something that I think is especially positive coming from such a small low budget indie studio.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=3991693">Expand</a></span>

I got it during the 93% off sale, this weekend, and I found ab-so-lute-ly nothing wrong with this game. I have found next to zero glitches, and the only glitch I HAVE found was being slammed into a rock by a T-Rex, and depositing me and my 2 buddies INSIDE the rock. This was easily fixed by using the Teleporter (Item that can be selected by &apos;5&apos;) and teleporting back to base, only delaying us for 2 minutes, max.
<br>
<br>When I started the game, and started off in a Survival match, solo, I found literally nothing wrong. I grabbed a shotgun, and ran over to protect the generator. First wave? No flying dinosaurs, no bad physics. In fact, I could say that this is one of the better-detailed games. I have yet to find a game like this one with graphics and models as good as this one.
<br>
<br>Now I do have to agree that there are a few flaws and quirks. For example, I have to agree that it does seem a bit Halo-ish in the vehicle department. The Gladiator Buggy, the VTOL and the tank all share some kind of aspect to the Halo vehicles. While I have to say they are similar, it may be nothing more than inspiration. While the Gladiator Buggy is very similar to the Warthog, it&apos;s different in several ways too. The Warthog was longer, and narrower, with an anti-air heavy MG in the back, while the Gladiator has a windowless driver/passenger area, with a more squarish shape, and an energy chaingun. If you were to put the vehicles in basic shapes, and make the Warthog more compressed, and the Gladiator narrower, then yes, they bare a large resemblance.
<br>
<br>However, I have seen review after review hating on Orion: Dino Horde where the entire theme is: IT SUCKS. If this is true, then why is it that I got on, and found that the developers&apos; descriptions were nothing but true. It had great gameplay, great graphics, great models, great game mechanics, etc.
<br>
<br>So if it sucks for you, then I don&apos;t know what&apos;s wrong with your computer, because I don&apos;t have the best computer, and it&apos;s running fine for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=3999711">Expand</a></span>

It takes place in vast landscapes, where the player must activate the power generator of one out of four bases and fight the incoming dinos. The game was first released in a rather horrendous state, making it impossible or very difficult to join or make servers, the game would crash often and such. While these issues have (for me) largely been ironed out with the first patch, the game is still full of glitches. Sound breaks down after map switch and the first person gun models don&apos;t properly react when you fire (leaving you with a feeling of killing raptors with a potato gun). While these are issues I&apos;m sure will be solved by the developers, the game also suffers from some problems in the design. For one, the assault class seems to be the only to have an easy way of getting out of the way of the larger dinosaurs with the jet pack. The medic especially seems to be in trouble when faced with an angry t-rex, leaving them with the rather boring option of staying in-doors popping out every once in a while to pump a clipload of lead in the big lizard. The dinosaurs can&apos;t climb, so the right thing to do is get on top of something and shoot the hordes of dinos who are running around below like it&apos;s a free crack handout in a bad neighborhood. It is kind of boring that the smartest thing you can do as an &quot;assault&quot; is to just camp on top of something. When you die you&apos;ll have to wait until the other players either kill enough dinosaurs or they die themselves and you lose the game. This might be a very long time since the last player can just take a vehicle and go any old direction. We seem to lose a lot of players who die early after a spawn, because they don&apos;t want to sit around for 15 minutes waiting to re-spawn. The game now has an option for buying a new life after dying, but if you can&apos;t afford it you&apos;ll still have to wait. There are only three types of dinosaurs in the game - T-Rex, Raptor and Rahm. While the rahm (a flying dino that&apos;ll pick you up and fly away with you) is an interesting touch, the design hasn&apos;t been followed through here either: only the assault class has a way of surviving when dropped by a rahm. The recon and the medic will just spatter on the ground below. Killing these three types of dinos quickly become boring, and the game could really do with some more kinds. The game has a selection of vehicles, but alas, here the design is again lacking. The flying type of vehicle is a game winner - the dinos can hardly hurt you and you get to spend the rest of the game bombing defenseless lizards on the ground (and the terrain is game-from-1999-ugly when seen from above). The vehicle direction controls are mouse based, with is fine for the flying vehicle, but just feels clunky and incomplete for the ground based ones. The game is in a much better state than when it first came out (now it is playable), but that also means that all the design flaws come out. It&apos;s fun to exploit some dumb dinos who can&apos;t get to you, but it will grow old very soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=2332683">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>And because of all the false negativity around here, I am going to have to rate it 10, but otherwise I would of rated it 8 or 7.</span>

The menus hardly worked, joining/creating multiplayer or solo games was impossible many times, and the few times i did manage to get in the game it felt clunky and horribly unbalanced. The Devs are saying a god patch is coming today that will make everything &quot;better&quot; so hopefully they have managed to fix the majority of the bugs. However until more DLC comes out there just isnt enough to this game to keep me really interested only 3 dino types 1 of which can insta kill at long to close range using projectiles and melee, 3 classes of which 2 are suicidal choices unless you camp buildings or vehicles, 3 maps, and no real persistence to the game since you lose all items/upgrades at the end of each match and there is no ranking system. At this point the only thing that would make this game really fun is 5 player co-op but with MP completely broken for most people right now that&apos;s not really an option. Hopefully in a month or 2 once the game is properly patched and some DLC has been released the game will be more enjoyable. I just hope that the launch and lack of content doesn&apos;t drive away the community. UPDATE: Patch 1 made the server browser and hosting/joining games at least possible for a good number of people. However crashes and bugs are still pretty bad. The patch even brought about a lot of new bugs since once again spiral was in a rush and did not test the patch thoroughly in an attempt to save time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=2330596">Expand</a></span>

What little bit of the gameplay I&apos;ve managed to get a chance to experience has been lackluster, but the game is the most bug-ridden piece of software released since Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing, and Windows ME. Even after the patch, servers are full with phantom players who don&apos;t actually exist, the server list doesn&apos;t populate, the list goes on. I won&apos;t bother listing them all, because to do so would take more time than I&apos;m willing to spend on this abortion of a game. Honestly, there must be retribution and penance for releasing such a great sin into the world. I will not buy a game from this studio until I see the lead developer apologize profusely while weeping for forgiveness, while eating shards of broken glass as a sign of good faith. This game is UNSPEAKABLY bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=2338951">Expand</a></span>

<br>there is a lot i could say but i can only tell you that five months post-release they finally turned this game into a beta and removed all of the original content and replaced it two extremely small maps and a whole lot of lip service and they made the game-play so much harder it&apos;s sure to make even the finest of gamers rage-quit. and two months after that, it&apos;s still in the same condition. after taking away all the game&apos;s content, spiral studios has produced nothing but images of stuff they say they will include but they have yet to actually produce anything new in the game. Dave Prassel, the ceo of spiral studios, is admittedly using this game only to fund his main project and any content that this game receives in the future will only be the leftovers from his main project. dino beatdown is nothing but a testing ground for orion prelude and Prassel does not give a **** about this game.
<br>DO NOT WASTE TEN DOLLARS ON THIS GAME and if someone gives it to you as a gift, you need to promptly de-friend that person. yes, it&apos;s that bad...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=2704464">Expand</a></span>

The problems with this game are many however.  It is nearly unplayable much of the time due to glitches. I know many dinos had small brains, but the AI is still ridiculously simple.  The graphics are clearly second rate, and the game suffers from some of the most extreme clipping issues I have ever seen. Voice communication is completely broken, and sound in general, works correctly only in spurts.    If they were to fix just the bugs, glitches, clipping and audio/voice issues, I would rate this game at 7-8. Spruce up the AI and animations, expand the types of dinos, allow for weapon/upgrade persistence on a server by server basis, make the classes actually mean something, and I would likely give it a 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=2509636">Expand</a></span>

I will probably put more hours into this game than I typically do with AAA games. It has the chemistry for replayability.
<br>
<br>Summary: Orion: Dino Horde essentially resembles Killing Floor by Tripwire Interactive, but with dinosaurs (plus sci-fi spin). Its a fun play and will get better as time goes on. Spiral Games has a lot of potential as a developer and with their first released game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=3449540">Expand</a></span>

I havent met any of these so said &quot;real bugs&quot; in the game. I can connect the game lobbys when i want, the game has crashed only 2 times for me, the dinosaurs are not phasing trough the walls, VTOLS and other vehicles work like they should. The complaining about the sounds aint true, atleast i dont have them, weapons sound just like they should( except the Revolver, but it might have intergrated silencer like WW2 STEN had). Buy this game for real, you can enjoy it, or hate it doesnt make my life different.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=3981275">Expand</a></span>

So I can&apos;t say anything about the previous game. I don&apos;t understand the people who give this awesome game a zero...? no one deserves that !!
<br>
<br>I want to tell you about a few things I really like about this game.
<br>- You have allot of different game modes, fighting against each other  (free for all, king of the hill, gun game, but also in team-play like team elimination), survival (playing with 4 other players) with 6 level with difficulty. There are playable vehicles with nice guns and a lot of other funny game modes (slaughter, rampage, 1v1 dual).
<br>- There are a lot of different maps with their own world dino, that makes it more dynamic!
<br>- In the game you get credits by killing dinos, reviving team-mates, restoring the generator or capturing the different objectives. With these credits you can buy many different upgrades, and you can buy a lot of different guns.
<br>-You can also choose between 3 different characters, every round there is the possibility to change between them. They have their own tech-tree and specialty. It makes the game very dynamic and hold you interested.
<br>- We had a few free updates, with more maps, better graphics, bug fixes and more! like the spook-tacular event with a new boss fight, Halloween style, awesome!! There will be more free updates with new content, I am very excited about that.
<br>- The game has a very extensive statistics about almost everything you achieve during the game, it&apos;s very nice for number/stats geeks like myself :P.
<br>- You can customize your characters with different hats, armor, capes and funny taunts. You can win a lot of them during special occasion or by getting more achievements.
<br>
<br>There are more things to discover! So check the game and enjoy the dino era!
<br>
<br>There are a few minor bugs, but its a indie game and the developers are ready and willing to optimize the game, so everyone can enjoy it.
<br>
<br>I really hope that metacritic will revise the score it gave the previous game Dino Beatdown, and give our fellow gamers a real score and the developers the respect they deserve. I am very proud of the developer on that what they made so far.
<br>
<br>Your sincerely, Dragittarius</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=3742540">Expand</a></span>

Since then, the game has had a huge influx of new content on a regular basis that has improved not only the graphics and performance, but the overall gameplay experience. Orion: Dino Horde, in it&apos;s current form, is one of the best co-operative games to play with your friends around. I strongly recommend you try this game at the next f2p session that is offered. And for those that previously bought the game, try out the new version, it&apos;s way better then what you were expecting the game to be like when you first saw it back in 2012. This game deserves a second chance from both users and game reviewers alike.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=3745030">Expand</a></span>

The game is indie now and has a HUGE fan-base.

<br>So after buying this game for an irrisory US$1 and playing some hours of it, I made an account on metacritic just to defend this game from the injustice that is the low score it gets.
<br>This game is an awesome underdog. I&apos;ve played some survival games before, and I&apos;ll tell you the real deal: dinos, lightsabers, lots of mechs and rambo-mode munition plus a dozen game modes are way better than repetitive maps and stupid zombies.
<br>This game is worth your time and money if you get it on promotion. Just try it on one of the f2p weekends and you shall see how stylish this jewel is.
<br>And if you check out, the game at this moment is more constantly updated than a lot of paid buggy AAA titles.
<br>
<br>9/10 for a low-budget. Kill ancient reptiles with futuristic weapons and be happy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=3984162">Expand</a></span>

My friends and I picked it up since we&apos;d heard how funny it was, both because of it being buggy and just the general game play, which is pretty unique. I can definitely say with the little we&apos;ve played so far that the game is definitely worth picking up on a sale like this. It&apos;s unique, fun, silly, still buggy, but playable (better than DayZ at least), and a good LAN game. It reminds me a lot of the old Starship Troopers game COOP mode which we would LAN. That game was also unpolished but offered hours of laughs and good times if you can get over its buggy nature and just enjoy it. The same goes for Dino Horde. Ignore the past negative reviews, the latest release is playable and fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=3985186">Expand</a></span>

Find some friends and a good group for survival and it&apos;s a blast. I haven&apos;t run into any bugs since I&apos;ve been playing. Give the game a chance I&apos;ve been loving it and will most likely buy it.</span>

The graphic looks very nice, but animations and effects (like blood, explosions etc.) are very bad. It is definitely not a game for graphic-freaks, but it makes a lot of fun. Its a nice game for a easygoing round of team-fps, but nothing more.</span>

You&#x2019;ll have three different character classes to choose from as you venture into the prehistoric eras where Tzion reigned supreme. The first class, the Assault class, can take the heavens and descend with lighting like speed upon the lesser creatures below. The second class, support, is heavily clad in sophisticated armor and can bring aid to his fellow righteous crusaders. The third class, recon, is designed with stealth and sabotage in mind and can sneak past the large and powerful noses of your enemies. There are several game types, each pitting you against the lesser creatures or fellow players. The bulk of the mission requires you to use the good doctor&#x2019;s technology to reclaim the past so that you may thrive in the future. In order to complete your task of re-writing history and saving your people you must keep a generator alive long enough for it to completely erase the DNA of the lesser creatures. Of course your enemy is sly and mischievous like a rat, and will almost immediately sense your presence. Therefore you will need to band together with your fellow crusaders to fend off the swarms of the lesser creatures. Each wave of your enemy will be even craftier than the last, and you must be vigilant to avoid their treachery. If you can avoid their taint for long enough, your forces then march across their territory in a glorious fashion and claim one of their cities for your own. Once you have accomplished this task you will receive armored and air support to rain down your masterful orchestra of purification. The devilish creatures won&#x2019;t rest easy though and soon they will send their most powerful mixed breeds against you. If you hold true to the glorious empire, and to your stalwart brothers beside you, then you will emerge victorious and will have cleansed the future of the unclean. Along the way you will be able to steal money from the fallen vermin to upgrade the supplies of our righteous army. Thanks to the good doctor&#x2019;s extensive experimentation a wide array of weapons and augments will become available to you as you prove your worth as protectors of the progeny. Overall, Orion: Dino Horde is a great game that highlights a pivotal point in human history in which the brave few stood against the impure many and saved civilization as we know it. In addition to the primary game mode, you can also engage in versus matches to ensure you are properly prepared for the great pushes to the east and west. I strongly recommend playing this game, your legacy may depend on it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=4089648">Expand</a></span>

The game looks like pre-alpha state and has so many bugs that it is almost unplayable. If you paid for it I truly feel for you, and if you are one of those who are thinking of buying this, please keep your money it is not worth it. The idea itself is good, but the way they made it happen isn&apos;t.</span>

Sure that one little rock isn&apos;t a good texture, but if you look at the gameplay it&apos;s pretty fun. I think you guys are a little sensitive when it comes to games..</span>

There is good variety in the game modes, the devs are constantly updating and it&apos;s oare much because you&apos;re being bombarded by Rham&apos;s or escaping the jaws of a waiting T-Rex. Excellent team game, has some pacing issues and ymmv with the game modes. All over an excellent purchase and highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orion-dino-horde/user-reviews?user_review_id=4283552">Expand</a></span>

This game is unique and better than most 60.00$ games I have bought and have been disappointed in and let down. This is only my opinion, judge however you feel about it.</span>
