That COH TOV was a short comming to its predessesors in the views of many fellow gamers who have played all three. Though I cannot comment on this aspect, as a first time player I found the game to be enjoyable and easy to pick up and learn tactics. Though the game includes suppressive fire and units become unable to attack well under such direct assult, I would have like to see untis flee in cowerdence. That the user would be unable to controll such units under any circumstance. The idea of bringing in reinforcements to supply units with refreshed man power should not have to just be done for the replacement of casualties, but also battle fatigue. Though this realism may be to complex for those who wish to just play a game like AoE. As my first game for COH, I was very pleased over all and enjoy the time spent playing online.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/company-of-heroes-tales-of-valor/user-reviews?user_review_id=424202">Expand</a></span>

Its almost like I have to spam certain units to win in every situation. Anyway all in all balancing and multyplayer aside its worth your singleplayer money.</span>

Personally, I liked Tales of Valor the most, because of the gameplay. The graphics are also pretty noteworthy. The single player campagin could have been more exciting, but multiplayer can be a lot of fun when playing with friends. I&apos;m an avid Command and Conquer fan, so I enjoyed this, however I find that a major drawback of this game is how long it takes. In C&amp;C, it&apos;s fairly easy to acquire an army, a well fortified base, and a good defense. In Company of Heroes, it&apos;s difficult to get a defense and an attack force ready quickly. This is because there are 3 different types of &quot;monetary value&quot; you need to purchase units, buildings, and upgrades. Of course, this IS much more realistic, however if you have little time to play and would like to get a game in before you head to bed or work, you won&apos;t be able to finish. I&apos;d recommend this to anyone who likes RTS games, IF it&apos;s on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/company-of-heroes-tales-of-valor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1919973">Expand</a></span>

While the missions are interesting and fun, they are very short--you might get three hours total out of all of them. Maybe. Thankfully I got this on sale on Steam, but I would have been upset had I paid the full $20.</span>

Directfire is pretty much useless. As a fan of COH this is a disappointing addition. New units is good but not for the price of this expansion, at this price it should have been a lot more much like opposing fronts was. Worth $15, paid $50 - can I have a refund!</span>

Why they decided we need a very poor DotA clone in CoH is probably best left unknown.

This game is honestly not even worth the &#xA3;2.49 they&apos;re currently asking for it on steam.

<br>It has one or two interesting ideas but not much more than that,should have read the review before buying..</span>

However, the campaign is ridiculously short (4 hours tops) and the hero units are way too strong. This is the only downside to the expansion: you will be dissapointed if you expect the same level of storytelling and long campaigns that were the trademark of previous COH campaigns. On the plus side, the AI is ridiculously strong now, and expert computers make for a very good practice when there&apos;s nobody else online. They are aggressive, have good capping orders, and the cpu is vicious and relentless. The new units are a mixed bag, and they are fairly balanced, letting players try out different types of playstyle. For example, the M17 is a glass cannon that trades the armor and mine-laying abilities of the M8 for a more powerful rapid-firing cannon and very weak armor. It is a worthy addition to your collection.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/company-of-heroes-tales-of-valor/user-reviews?user_review_id=423339">Expand</a></span>

We don&apos;t all want to play online - and even if you do want to dabble it needed a patch to do so.. More disappointment from the PC games industry.</span>

If you play skirmish vs AI, stay away (the AI is probably still broken, haven&apos;t bothered trying).

The only redeeming feature of the purchase so far is the difficult first mission in the last &apos;campaign&apos; (as yet unfinished). The other missions (played 6 so far) are very easy and very short.</span>

Some people are saying its easy, but i don&apos;t think they figured out that you can turn it up to hard or expert, because then its a pain (in a good way). The real gem in this game are the new multiplayer modes. They are simply awesome. Though they stray from the normal RTS type gameplay they still fit in to the game and add amlot of variation. The new units are basically the same as the ones they replace (for the most part). So no biggie there but its nice that they did something for the normal pvp game. A little expensive for what you get but if you don&apos;t have The original CoH or Opposing Fronts or neither, then this is a great way to unlock all the factions and get the new multiplayer modes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/company-of-heroes-tales-of-valor/user-reviews?user_review_id=423359">Expand</a></span>

Relic are the masters in the RTS genre. Hopefully we&apos;ll have another full campaign in the CoH saga soon, I&quot;d really like a go with the Russians on the eastern front. Keep em comin.</span>

Just got done with the German campaign and though it was short I can remember every second of it like I lived it. Highly recommend getting this title, especially if you loved DOW, it feels just like it only with military units from the world war era.
