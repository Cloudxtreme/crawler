<br>
<br>Unfortunately, like many other puzzle/strategy games this has very little replay value. I was unable to find anyone else on the web to try a PvP match with, but I&apos;m not sure this is the type of game I would want to play against other players. Still, I think $15 is a reasonable price for 6 hours of entertainment from an indie game.

As a strategy game is does keep you thinking on what is your next move, but eventually the games too repetitive. However, true to its design, the game keeps its steam punk-ish style and the story is engaging enough to keep you playing for awhile. Multiplayer, however, is slightly broken as few players play it and this makes the game lack replay-ability value.
<br>In conclusion, for its relatively low cost of $15+  it may be worth supporting this indie game, but I wouldn&apos;t really recommend it unless you are fine playing strategy-intensive turn based games.Using comics to tell the story is relatively a bonus as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ironclad-tactics/user-reviews?user_review_id=3592359">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Before each map, you select a deck of cards that you can freely put together from your card collection. As you progress through the game you gain more and more cards to chose from, enabling you to put together more innovative combination.
<br>
<br>Each card played will influence the happening on the game board. You might put a new ironclad in play, give it better inventory or move it a lane down. Different maps have different objectives, and you will have to find the right deck to defeat each challenge.
<br>
<br>The story is cute and humorous, but personally I would have liked to see a darker take on robots in the American Civil War. The game offers the full campaign in co-op mode, which worked smoothly and unproblematic when I played it. There are cool, rewarding boss fights which will require you to think outside the box and the missions never get repetitive.
<br>
<br>The replay value is limited, since you&apos;d be facing the same challenges, probably solving them with the same decks. There are some challenges (which unlock cards) that require you to do things for instance with certain types of decks though, but once that is done, there&apos;s no real need to play the map again.
<br>
<br>All in all a fun game, with an inspired rule set and a story and setting you don&apos;t see too often.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ironclad-tactics/user-reviews?user_review_id=4345568">Expand</a></span>
