<br>3. Sector AI is braindead, it uses slaves who get malus to producing science to produce science and option to enforce AI to respect tile resources doesnt work.
<br>
<br>4. War AI is insane sending single trooper transports to capture you capital for years, losing every time.
<br>
<br>5. Events are bugged and just dont work as intended frequently.

Because the game is good. But it is also an unpolished product. You could even call it unfinished. Bare bones that still need a lot more on their frame. The situation is similar to Crusader Kings II and Europa Universalis IV - both of those games are 2-4 years old and only just recently CK2 has become what I think Paradox wanted it to be from the begining. EU4 is the same, only I don&apos;t think they published all the DLCs quite yet.
<br>
<br>Stellaris might be another great game in PI portfolio, but not before there&apos;s a ton of updates and expansion packs. Right now there is a lot to work on - the diplomacy sucks (my biggest mistake was to start the game as a peaceful race of scientists, and not because the other races conquered me, but because after a while I couldn&apos;t expand more without resorting to violence, which was prohibited by my people), the military part is limited to say the least (you can build your own ships, but why bother when you have the auto-upgrade option that gives you good results), and there is no real goal to achieve, other that &quot;conquer the whole galaxy, unless you&apos;re a peaceful race in which case you can&apos;t&quot;.
<br>
<br>I will wait for the game to develop further because as of now it&apos;s just a below average product that will make you &quot;WOW!&quot; for several sitting, after which you will quickly notice that deep down it offers very little. At least for now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6537440">Expand</a></span>

<br>2. graphics are quite good when they are working correctly.
<br>3. overall game design is good with a few caveats.
<br>4. you can design your own ships, sort of.
<br>
<br>The bad points:
<br>1. As with most 4X games, this one really suffers from a poor AI. I won&apos;t go in to details, it would be a very long list.
<br>2. I just started the game and my combat fleet has 4 ships, my neighbor i just met has thousands of ships.
<br>3. Ship design: it would seem like you can custom design your own ships but here are your choices: (depending on the platform) you can put 1 large weapon, 2 medium weapons, or 4 small weapons. Quite often it won&apos;t let you build the design you want without pressing the &apos;auto-complete&apos; button which changes your ship design.
<br>4. Combat: you have no control over your ships once they engage. You put all long range weapons on your ships, guess what ?, you are going to point blank range for fighting.
<br>5. Game killing mid game slow down: has nothing at all to do with how good your system is according to the developers, even on their beast machines they get ridiculous slow down. Rather than build a new platform that uses multi-threading and optimization, they used an older gaming platform that assumes you are only using a single core with limited ram. By turn 200 you are experiencing a massive performance slow down of the game, by turn 300 (if you can actually make it there) the game is unplayable, a single click on anything in game may take 30 or more seconds before it responds, if at all. Making it to end game is all but impossible. So you play for a bit, then start a new game. Frustrating.
<br>
<br>So in short:
<br>1. you can design you own race, poorly.
<br>2. you can design you own ships, poorly.
<br>3. you can engage in combat, poorly.
<br>4. you can play the game to a point, then you have to start a new game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6473701">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Managment is very basic
<br>- Exploration gets really annoying the bigger the universe you are in is
<br>- Politics are very often one-sided
<br>- It gets very crowded at times
<br>- Research is more or less random (you get 3 to 4 choices what you can research next, but it is not an open research tree)
<br>
<br>All in all it is fun. But it does not really anything complete new. It is fun for people liking these type of games but nothing for hardcore 4X lovers, even if this is not really 4X.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6540357">Expand</a></span>

<br>And indeed at first glance the game design looks excelent, but in the end it doesn&apos;t work.
<br>Lets start with the good part. I love the soundtracks. The exploration at first is a nice touch. The interface, aesthetics is nicely done.
<br>But the gameplay, I don&apos;t, get it, I don&apos;t feel it.
<br>For example. The game limits u to have direct control only over a few planets, to alleviate the micromanagement and yet I don&apos;t recall any other 4x games that I wasted so many time in planet management and the worst part is that its tedious and boring.
<br>How so, u would ask? Every system like planet management, ship design, battle system, diplomacy is extremely streamlined. I could leave a lot of things in the hands of the AI,( and u would think with such simple rules should handle it nice, but nope, its broken it a lots of places)  but than u would ask what should I do? And when u go down and try to fine tune some planets, stations, mines, designs, etc its sooo tedious and boring.
<br>When I played DistantWorlds my only complain, despite it had excellent automatization tools, it was still not enough. But here aiming to the same level of grandeur u have one level of automation but NO TOOLS.
<br>So in this game u have 2 choices. U could do a lot of things but its extremely simple and tedious because of the lack of tools or u do almost nothing.
<br>And also the state of the game its not really finished. There a bugs (like different bonuses don&apos;t work), half late game and start to get a lot of 1-2s freezes in battles. But this are patch-able.
<br>I know paradox model of development and in the future will add a lot of nuances through out expansions but I fear those will not resolve my main issue with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6494042">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s a good ride but it gets ugly and really buggy the more you play, it has the quality of HoI 3 and CK II when they came out it&apos;s a decent foundation but it&apos;s somewhat bland and lacks features compared to previous games like Imperium Galactica 2, Galactic Civ 2, Space Empires IV or SW Rebellion.
<br>
<br>You could compared Stellaris to Stardrive I in terms of polish except it plays somewhat better on huge battles as both these two games choose to set up battles on the same map instead of having an instance like IG 2, Rebellion and Total Wars games do. But you will still get huge frame drops and slow downs when you get into big battles.
<br>
<br>The Good
<br>- Researching is fresh &amp; interesting, techs take in account the way you play, if you build robots you are more likely to get tech related to A.I. and robots etc.. but it&apos;s still a bit arcade and unrealistic, it could  take some queues from sword of the stars.
<br>- Nice foundation for a game.
<br>- A simplified pop system from Victoria game.
<br>- Potential storylines and interesting quests and events - I came across and interesting quest with  backstory which was definitely the high point up of the game for me.
<br>
<br>The Bad
<br>- Music is repetitive
<br>- Tutorial is really bad still surprising to this paradox hasn&apos;t made a real attempt at a good tutorial, for example you never know what advantages a federation brings, tutorial quests can be very hard to unlock like building a station to study primitive species.
<br>Also if you deactivate and active the tutorial quests on the same game it gets reset to the first mission loosing all the progress you had made.
<br>- Gameplay Information is hard to get to(Example there is no quick way to only show strategic resources on the map/primitive empires or unexplored systems.
<br>- There are no tactics when you are on combat, you can&apos;t set you ships to stay far or get really close, not even run from enemy ships they always charge head on.
<br>- UI is not the prettiest and it&apos;s simplified this means there is more information hidden and takes more clicks to get to, you also never know if there features hidden away or not implemented.
<br>- Some quests get broken easily, some have no information, some don&apos;t trigger.
<br>- Collecting debris easily become unrewarding and an annoyance, for me this a complete miss it should give resources and a chance at acquiring unresearch technologies plus it should have an option to autocollect debris and not always have an associated research requirement on the situation log.
<br>- There are not enough resource sinks in mid and late game you will eventually just cap and don&apos;t have anything that requires massive value of resources like building a huge monument etc..
<br>- No logistics if you compared to stardrive where you produce food and resources and you can ship this with transports to planets that need them, here food is a local planet resource and there are no trade routes between your planets or other empires.
<br>- No espionage mechanic.
<br>- Late game events/crisis are buggy and stop working mid way, example a trigger for a quest gets trigger by A.I. players and you can&apos;t never trigger it again or a big menace stops building attack fleets and conquering after you beat it&apos;s 3 large fleets.
<br>
<br>The Ugly
<br>- Friendly &quot;A.I&quot; just does this, follows your larger fleet nothing more... So consider the scenario of fighting a huge battle in enemy territory and if you happen to create a new fleet slightly larger across the entire galaxy to reinforce the depleted one prepare to have the entire A.I. to disengage and leave you alone fighting so they can group with your larger fleet.
<br>This also is a reason for poor performance instead of having A.I. spread on multiple fronts of a war they are all one the same place which reduces performance.
<br>- A.I. never seems to accept border access even if just for civilians this means most quests get broken or post-pone for late game which in turn makes the rewards unrewarding and contribute to a more bland and unfulfilling experience.
<br>
<br>In the end I enjoy much more Stardrive (early access) than Stellaris (at release) and for now you are much better off buying Stardrive if you haven&apos;t yet, it has more depth and is way more innovative. Just wait 1 to 2 years for an expansion or a DLCs that adds more depth &amp; content to the game.
<br>Unfortunately Paradox is starting to get a reputation for releasing okay games that don&apos;t really innovate or even measure to their past titles that only get good after one to two years with expansions and with dozens of DLCs.
<br>
<br>This game only shows how technical superior and advance IG 2 was for it&apos;s time a game that had real 3D building like sim city, ground battles, space battles, planetary defenses, espionage, trading, research and design, quests and dynamic quests, built-in working tutorial, 3 storyline for each of the 3 races, cutscenes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6425928">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The early game&#x2019;s event chains and micromanagement of science ships and planet upgrades works really well. There isn&#x2019;t too much to focus on and exploring the space around you is really fun and engaging. In my second game I was disappointed to find out that many of the space monsters would be the same from game to game, which decreases that sense of an unknown galaxy that captured me in my first playthrough, but the other parts of the early game are very strong.
<br>
<br>When you get to the mid game, though, it really doesn&#x2019;t live up to the expectations of a GSG in space. The factions you encounter are fairly interchangeable and have little character, and the fact that so many of them have no desire to go to war leads to a somewhat boring game. Fallen Empires provide some interesting variety, but mainly ignore you unless provoked. There is no threatening France or Ottomans from EUIV to force you to seek strong allies, and conquering new systems only to give them away to a sector just feels like conquest for conquest&#x2019;s sake. In EUIV I feel like I&#x2019;m bettering my nation&#x2019;s position against threats, but the threats seem to be mainly lacking until late game.
<br>
<br>The late game crises that can happen do help to spice things up, but that only matters if you play to there. I only played to the end game a few times because I kept wanting to restart to play more of the early game again. I was very excited for a space game, but the setting on top of the characterless factions makes it difficult to keep track of who is who and where things are. I have to reorient myself every time I load a game to remind myself which space animal is which. There are also no familiar cities or landmarks to anchor yourself, only randomly named systems that mean nothing. I&#x2019;m not taking East Prussia from the Teutons or reuniting the Italian peninsula to create a new Rome, I&#x2019;m taking some system whose name I won&#x2019;t remember from some random space animal with a ridiculous and hard to remember name. I don&#x2019;t know if there is a fix to this or not, but I doubt I&#x2019;ll be playing much more Stellaris until expansions start coming out, especially considering all the other excellent games releasing this year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6477054">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Was hoping for bigger variety of fleet designs, space objects and entities, and for the battles to be more spectacular, and more of a blast when it comes to ships maneuvering, and different weapons.
<br>
<br>Event chains bug at times, reload fixes it. Army can get stuck at time so you can&apos;t use or disband them, yet you pay for them. Resources bug, so you have them, yet you don&#x2019;t and can&apos;t use them. AI has massive problems with management and auto-management is broken.
<br>
<br>War tactics dumbs down to: pick a weaker enemy, stack your fleet in one stack, destroy enemy stack and conquer undefended planets. There is no real defence for planets that could stand a chance against any invasion. One reasonable way to defend systems is to build a ridiculous amount of expensive defence platforms. No point in destroying everything as space stations are transferable when you takeover enemy system, upon winning a war.
<br>
<br>Planetary assault is down to the numbers and no limit on assaulting force size with limit on defending force size, makes it so much easier (quicker than in EU and CK). Fleet is not bound by the invasion and troop transport doesn&apos;t need any escort, and you chose if you want to provide orbital support. Like in other Paradox games there is no choices in battles. I&apos;d love to see some mini games with space battles and invasion, so that you can actually make a difference. Doesn&apos;t have to be big you know. Sort of a &#x201C;Heroes of Might and Magic&#x201D;. It doesn&#x2019;t have to be Total War straight away. Just dumbed down the Paradox way, would be enough. Something that would give the stronger attacker a slim chance to loose and defender a chance to win. Paradox games always lack in that department and it makes them completely lack epic heroism. CK has the power play, EU has simple diplomacy and Stellaris has even less than EU. I&#x2019;m sure it would make their games much deeper and enjoyable.
<br>
<br>With no tactical combat, there is nothing you can do for the computer to be better. Other than just let him behave like a$$ to the human, and let him cheat. That&apos;s exactly what higher difficulty is about.
<br>
<br>Research is as dull, at the beginning you get the feeling that there is a variety and they actually done something about it. But quickly you realize it&apos;s simple and dumbed down to few unique projects, and the rest is a lvl 1 to 3, or lvl 1 to infinity research.
<br>
<br>Each race feels the same, as there is no tech variety. Would love to see separate tech tree paths, which progress through in roleplaying fashion (complete missions to progress research, force you to invade empires and stuff). In the end it would make some technologies inaccessible, if you researched their equivalents and completely different tech tree paths would be nice.
<br>
<br>Variety of space stations is minimal, Frontier, Mining, Research, Terraforming, Observation, Military, Spaceport, Wormhole Generators. Other than for military platforms there is no way of upgrading them, which is well.... boring. There isn&apos;t a lot of defence stations and ships variations, I want to see massive gun stations that obliterate destroyers with one shot and stuff, death stars, MASSIVE SPACE STRUCTURES, ARTIFICIAL PLANETS AND CANNON SHIPS!
<br>
<br>Game screams for more weapon types:  antimatter, gravity, plasma, ultrasound, microwave, dark matter and beam line of weapons. Planet destroyers, mobile space stations, force fields, stealth technology&#x2026;. still because everything is dumbed down to one simple number, it doesn&apos;t really matter which weapons you use, as long as you keep a healthy ratio.
<br>
<br>Please add Stellar Council made up from all races, and some influence power play among races. With no galactic policies system or some sanctions and forced missions from most influential council members, there isn&#x2019;t much to do. As well nothing that would drive you to conquer.
<br>
<br>It needs spy agents to steal tech and sabotage, merchants to improve earnings trade resource outside official channels, ambassadors to improve relations organise coups and takeovers, missionaries (to spread your culture ideology, make ideology like religion).
<br>
<br>Survey missions feel repeatable after one playtrough and they disappear in later game, after trading starcharts. Research ships become useless, other than survey the crap left after space battle that speeds up your research projects.
<br>
<br>Game gets really boring real quick, as there isn&apos;t much to do in the end game, other than paint map. So it is nothing more but a graphic makeover of EU with little bit of CK in space, and it doesn&#x2019;t work well. EU was boring real quick, as it was a simple map painter and CK was fun for the power play but, same as EU it lacked in tactics department.
<br>
<br>For now, I can say for sure that it&#x2019;s an unfinished (lack of content), not entirely polished (bugs), otherwise a cool game. Yet another clone of same mechanics, so gets old real quick. I think it was well intended by Paradox DLC MILKINGCO</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6420624">Expand</a></span>

<br>Logistics is appalling. Ships do not need supply, so war can be waged in any part of map with same efficiency. Additionally there is no combat penalty for huge fleets so final effect is creation doom stacks that can strike anywhere without restriction.
<br>
<br>Only limiting factor is Naval Capacity and it does not affect the way wars are conducted.
<br>
<br>In its current state combat is worse than in Civ4. I guess i will revert to EU4 once novelty wears off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6400588">Expand</a></span>

One thing i don&apos;t really like is your policies being limited by your starting species traits as i find it rather annoying that you cannot change your play style as dynamically however still one of the best Grand strategies i have played in a long time.</span>

The game is great to start with, everything is interesting and shiny but it quickly devolves from there in to a land of inefficient empire management, poor ergonomics for their UI design and missing/broken mid to late game content.
<br>
<br>I seriously get the feeling that the devs were told to put all their effort in to the early game, get the game out sooner, and then fill in the gaps later. Just put enough interesting content in to the start in order to get positive early reviews. Then when they&apos;re 20-40 hours in, and realise how shallow/needlessly clunky to operate it is, we&apos;ll already have their positive reviews and they won&apos;t go back and change.
<br>
<br>I hope that the game gets a lot of patching and a lot of content added, not just DLC, but actual feature completion. Lots of bugs, lots of half thought out mechanics and pointless busy work.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s a great foundation and I think it could go on to be a classic, but it&apos;s an alpha/beta build at best. No one has done any significant end-to-end testing on this besides the players it seems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6399159">Expand</a></span>

Then the mid game - a constant &quot;Now what&quot; in terms of lack of things to do, not even the info pop ups to read, AI does nothing unless they have the ability to steamroll you and you seriously piss them off. The politics are as simple as a total war game despite seeming complex. Creating sectors take what little there is to do out of the game. The universe should get more interesting at this point, it does in civilization.. but instead its just lonely guessing until you get random bad events in the end game to make things harder.
<br>Battles are crap, the ship designer is pointless, I think a simple update to the ai would fix alot of the mid game issues but right now... eh its too boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6392083">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is off to a great start, the early-game is fantastic and it gives me great pleasure to explore the universe and its anomalies. Once I reach mid-game, the game grinds to a painful halt. Many of the features and functions of this game are undeveloped and sometimes not very well thought through. Depending on your mode of FTL transport, you may be fighting an enemy you cannot reach even though they can reach you. It&apos;s hard to win such a war, isn&apos;t it?
<br>
<br>Stellaris is lacking in areas such as trade and economy. Knowing Paradox, this is something they will work with in a future DLC. All in all, this is a good game with greater potential waiting to be unlocked.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6382641">Expand</a></span>

<br>2. Card based research: You have min 3 choices in 3 area of research.
<br>
<br>Can be improved by implementing:
<br>1. Auto explore like other space games.
<br>2. Disable popup of contact event (as there is no choice to be made).
<br>3. Add major event that cripple whole empire/area.
<br>
<br>Overall good initial release, hopefully dlc will make thing more interesting. Distant Worlds Universe is still the best ...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6402535">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Edit: after 45 hours...
<br>Mid-game it gets boring, I don&apos;t like the victory goals, only conquest and expansions.
<br>You have a max amount of planets you can directly control, the rest you&apos;ll have to put in sectors that take them out of development and empire resource management. boo...
<br>
<br>End-game is... not done well IMO. You get confronted with some crisis, which basically makes you have to destroy everything. So, no real choice but to fight. In my case, loved my AI/robot pops which dun.. dun.. dun... go rogue. Why must advanced AI always have to go rogue, such an human trait, which base on my peaceful, bird people doesn&apos;t seem right.
<br>
<br>The game has potential, but for now it&apos;s gets a 6. Early game is a 9 btw</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6361743">Expand</a></span>

It looks amazing and takes some novel twists on the 4X genre. When compared to Galactic Civilization and Masters of Orion it certainly measures up. In some ways I prefer it, although that might be because it feels more fresh.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>-Good micro management and delegation system. Clusters of systems can be turned into sectors and handed over to governors, letting you stay in direct control of a small core the entire game. Balancing many sectors isn&apos;t always easy though, but it&apos;s a nice way to get around the specter of too much micro management.
<br>
<br>- Great research system and special events. Leaders (Governors, scientists, admirals and generals) have lifespans, which makes things interesting and keeps them that way. A leader can get both positive and negative traits, so once in a while someone will die and it&apos;ll almost be a relief.
<br>
<br>- Very good colonization system. You can either tech up so you can colonize worlds your species isn&apos;t comfortable with. or you can simply conquer a world with a species living on it, integrate it into your empire and then use that species to colonize worlds you can&apos;t use, but which they can.
<br>
<br>- Detailed government, social and spiritual simulator. Planets can riot, go on strike or even revolt; populations can migrate, usually between your planets. Building a happiness generating building on one planet makes the people there happy, obviously, but also tends to entice people on other planets without this building to migrate there. It&apos;s all deliciously complicated, but since nothing too catastrophic usually happens you can take most of this in your stride.
<br>
<br>Excellent economic sim. There is pressure from the start between getting enough minerals for building mining bases and stuff on your planets, and the energy you need to run all of it. There is also influence, which is a tricky resource with few sources. But you need it for all sorts of things, like hiring leaders, building certain buildings and suppressing revolts, so running out of it can be almost as crippling as running out of energy.
<br>
<br>- Good visuals and sound.
<br>
<br>- Scientifically speaking an awesome take on space travel. Each species has one of three modes of transport: warp jumps, hyperspace and worm holes. Warp space is slow but you&apos;re free to go in any direction within the jump radius; hyperspace is faster but restricts you to following the rigid network of hyperspace lanes while worm holes are instant once the portal has been made and have the best range. But once you get to your destination you can only jump back to where you came from.. This makes for interesting sci-fi fodder as warp drive dependent fleets try to follow worm hole users. Free tip: don&apos;t do what I just said. It doesn&apos;t work.
<br>
<br>- Good species and traits variations.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>Although the species are nice and varied they do tend to look a bit samey, and most of the buildings are identical. This is one area where GalCiv definitely has an edge I think. The races there feel a lot more different than they do in Stellaris.
<br>
<br>- The governor AI is very passive (Or quite possibly useless.). It takes them forever to upgrade planet capitals, if they do at all. I&apos;m still not sure. But this needs to be done ASAP, so why there&apos;s even a delay is anyone&apos;s guess. This could have done with a bit more programming and a few more parameters to guide AI behavior. If there was a box saying &quot;upgrade planet capitals as soon as possible&quot; I would definitely have checked it.
<br>In fact, AI in general is questionable. For example, when you bombard a planet and the enemy empire has existing orbital bases around other planets after you have beaten their fleet, they will trickle in one ship at a time from all of them. This is obviously useless but it also very annoying. Every time a single defenseless ship arrives to the siege you have to lift the siege, fire a volley and then click the planet again to resume bombardment. I hate it when AIs are this dumb.
<br>
<br>- Small one, but although the music is very good it does tend to wear a bit thin after a few hundred loops. The game could do with one more musical theme as developed as the one it has right now. About twice as much music as it currently has seems about right.
<br>
<br>- Wrong kind of tutorial for my taste. It uses the pop-up approach, which I always turn off to avoid annoyance. I much prefer optional information I can look up when I need it. Also, the existing and very irritating tutorial manages to drop the ball something terrible when it comes to setting up and managing sectors. This you&apos;ll basically have to do by the seat of your pants, and it will fail many times before you figure things out. The game is not going to help you.
<br>
<br>- Simplistic space battles.
<br>
<br>Wonderful game altogether though. The only significant weakness is the AI, which is possibly the least impressive AI I have seen in a Paradox game since EU Rome. It&apos;s not so bad that it ruins one&apos;s enjoyment of the game though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6401932">Expand</a></span>

Loved the idea of no-turn strategy game, but needs a lot of improvements. I found it rather tedious to repeat the same quests every time I started the game. I dunno, EU and CK much better :S</span>

The game is also championed by a vastly improved user interface when compared with other Paradox games and has a far more inviting learning curve without losing the challenge or depth that the other games by this highly regarded developer offer.
<br>
<br>Paradox are widely known for their catalogue of strategy games over the years which are of a very high quality but are also remarkably complex to an extent; some newcomers and even veterans of the genre felt alienated, confused and simply overwhelmed. Stellaris however, has a fully fledged tutorial integrated into the main campaign which not only guides you through the general mechanics along with each feature in a constructive manner; it explains aspects clearly and this is further supported by a far more user friendly interface. The screen is less cluttered when compared with the likes of Europa Universalis IV and all the information is clear, condensed and well presented.
<br>
<br>The game takes place in space which is an almost Call of Duty style departure from the typical Paradox titles of classic eras and a real world setting. The premise is also slightly different as you create your colony from scratch or by selecting some preset examples instead of guiding an already established country. Your goal in the galaxy is to explore, build, research, expand, conquer and even exterminate all other races you come across - basically exactly what you&apos;d expect from a 4X title. You can play this game however you wish and at your own pace - you may opt to be a fanatic militarist or simply want to discover as much of the universe as possible whilst befriending and benefitting from other races you meet along the way. It is a massively detailed and highly engrossing experience in which the developers have made the transition from reality to sci-fi in a very credible fashion.
<br>
<br>Stellaris runs superbly too and is bolstered by truly fantastic atmosphere enhancing audio that complements your game throughout. The visuals are very good too and the galaxy map whilst despite looking rather basic, is easy to grasp and understand which is another massive plus. Overall; Stellaris is another superb Paradox title that is riddled with depth and a long term challenge but is also presented and executed in a far more appealling and enjoyable way than some previous titles by the studio. This game will have a bright future and is sure to provide many hours of entertainment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6380508">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It is amazing this game isn&apos;t more popular than it is... And some of these bad reviews are so wrong, and I mean flat out untrue, that I either question whether they have actually played the game, or if the first two large updates were just that drastic (never played it when it came out a few months ago).
<br>
<br>On my second play-through, still having a blast, worth every penny IMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6624292">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros
<br>-The quest storylines are engaging
<br>-Randomized races and rare techs offer replayability
<br>-Mod friendly, allowing for customization to the way you want to play.
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-Middle game is clearly not complete,  with Paradox admitting as much.
<br>-Game doesn&apos;t properly explain some features and late game options that require early game planning, leading to a somewhat long learning curve (don&apos;t mix the venerable racial trait with military despotism, for example).
<br>-Still some bugs that can completely derail your game many hours in.
<br>
<br>Judgement
<br>This game is about 90% finished, and it&apos;s still the best 4x game in more than a decade.  Paradox has acknowledged the problems and stated how they plan to fix them.  When they do, this game will easily be a 10/10 to 4x fans.  If you are the type of person who can lose entire weekends to a single game of Civ, this is the space 4x you have been waiting for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6408271">Expand</a></span>

<br>Easier to get into than other Paradox games like Europa Universalis or Crusader Kings, one of its better features is an awesome eXploration phase, neglicted ofently in 4X games. You&apos;ll find lot of events, stories, surprises... which will make really enjoyable the first steps of your empire-building. Technology and research (the genetics developments are very welcome), politics (not just elections but managing a diverse and potencially conflicted empire because of divisive issues according to the different ethics of your population), diplomacy (including federations &#xE0; la Star Trek)... and war, with several options for both your fleet and land forces.
<br>
<br>Best thing in Stellaris is that is a very powerful frame to keep building the game the way their developers have done (and are doing several years after their release) with Europa Universalis 4 or Crusader Kings 2. Stellaris is a must for all space games lovers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6451477">Expand</a></span>

<br>it will take you a VERY long time to play all the way through as all their games do.  if you know their other games you should be aware that it isn&apos;t about combat it&apos;s about exploring development and diplomacy - it&apos;s very pretty but combat is a a game/dice rolling in the background not total war type micro .

Basically we are talking about a game won by beating everyone and all the fancy modifiers, ship designer etc. are just there for novelty. Gameplay is a chore after the second game since its less about strategy thanks to random techs and more about baby sitting science ships and pops.</span>

Paradox-style solutions to common &quot;problems&quot; in 4x games are generally OK-ish in the scope of games like Crusader Kings and EU, but fail miserably in Stellaris.
<br>
<br>Without going into to much details, for example in this game the decision of going wide or tall does not exist, because going wide does not in any way influence development rate of your starting colonies. To prevent blobing they add a silly research penalty and mandatory cap on planets you can directly control before making them into sectors (basically vassals with a twist). Instead of designing a game system where the player actually has a strategic choice between going tall or wide going wide is the only real option, so they penalize it with a steep reseach penalty and a roadblock. Does it work? No, because no matter how much you trail in tech you are going to catch up soon and your economy will be much stronger.
<br>
<br>Warscore, Paradox staple system to prevent big empires to just steamroll acros the universe. Basically a limit of how much planets you can take in a single war trough a pece deal. Silly thing is how it scales, not with your economy or military power dictating how much you can assimilate, but with size of enemy empire. The bigger it is the more you can take... Does it work? No, because in this game doomstacking is a necessity, no supply lines,non-existant fleet range, so in short infinite power projection. You win one war there is no way enemy can recover in 10 years. Instead of designing a game where defensive wars are actually easier and cheaper, with limited power projection and effective ways for smaller empires to defend its just bigger doomstack wins it all. Warscore system is just a boring way do delay the inevitable.
<br>
<br>Also in this game you can play a xenophobe race than purges (basically genocide) all aliens. So I conquer all their planets, land armies, destroy all their military and what? I must peace out and get 3-4 of their planets to get and option to kill them all and repopulate the planet? Why cant I do that during the war?
<br>
<br>Now on top of these two Paradox - staple solution that will never get changed and are more than enough reason to skip this one, add piss-poor UI (it looks nice at least, and its good to have something nice to look at when you pause the game to click ~200 times every 10 minutes), pathetic AI, unfinished mechanics, game breaking bugs, broken combat system etc. They will probably fix these, and demand ~100e in DLC content for stuff that should be in game from day one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6472946">Expand</a></span>

TLDR - I love it, buy it, it&apos;s not perfect, but it&apos;s very very good, and well worth the price!
<br>
<br>I&apos;m still very much in the exploration phase of the game, founding new colonies, meeting other empires and exploring with my science ships. I&apos;ve been running the game at normal speed with the odd pause to catch up, and there is never a time when nothing is going on and I feel bored.
<br>
<br>I know there have been some complaints about the research system. Basically you get to pick from a small number (never less than 3) projects to research. These projects are weighted by what you have just unlocked and your progress in the game. So there is a loose tech tree of sorts, but you aren&apos;t limited by a set tech tree like say, Civ V, where you know what is coming and quickly build an optimal path that will be repeated with every play though. With the Stellaris system there is no obvious path to follow and it more realistically follows real discoveries, where scientist look for funding to work on a project. More importantly it keeps the game fresh and very repayable.
<br>
<br>As to the depth, another complaint. I keep finding whole new game systems I haven&apos;t really encountered yet. Planetary armies and air forces, multi-species empires, the list goes on. For espionage, I imagine that is something that will come with DLC.
<br>
<br>Oh, the Paradox DLC model. Sure they really crank out the DLC for their games, but they match that with a low entry price. $39 in a market where many games cost #60. Even if you don&apos;t buy the DLC it always comes with a free patch with many new systems, expanding the game at no additional cost.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been a big Paradox fan since CK2 and this is a great additional to the grand strategy family.

<br>On the other hand, AI really needs to be improved, also diplomatic depth is not as deep as I hoped. In few months it will be one of the best games Paradox has ever produced, just give them time to polish it.</span>

<br>
<br>It is, for me, after about 5 hours of gameplay, by far the best Grand Strategy game in space. Much better than the empty Endless Space, ridiculously overwhelming but simple Galactic Civilizations. Much better since for the first time it&apos;s another gameplay than simply: expand, spawn troops, expand, meet neighbor, crush him. Expand, spawn troops, crush and so forth.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, it is by far inferior than Hearts of Iron or Crusader Kings. It is way more superficial. Maybe you need to have 50hours gameplay before you start feeling the small subtleties, but after 5 hours, you seem to have understood most of your challenges which is unique in Paradox games. After 100h+ in Hearts of Iron or CK2, you still discover new things. Not the case here.
<br>
<br>However, I&apos;m certain that Paradox will keep on updating the game providing much more features (real politics, Ministers, political parties, social unrest). For me, they just need to add a flexible social and political environment (parties providing pros and cons) coming from things happening in the universe: i.e.: you are peaceful, technological and xenophile Empire (party). But you are weak: pirates roam your galaxies, neighbors too strong, you are loosing a war: people will start voting a Warmonger party providing bonuses in production, military technologies etc. but provide opposite effects to Social techs, diplomacy, trade...
<br>
<br>On the other side, you have battled for centuries. People is happy. After long time, they are fed up with war: another party may win the election, providing other bonuses. Or the economy is turning sour (starvations, lack of funds...) a more socialist party with less individualist bonuses but high collectivist bonuses. Or you have several species in your Galaxy, if you don&apos;t invest in Education people will turn xenophobe and a party with genocidal views may win the elections.
<br>
<br>Or maybe laws: a belligerent party wins the election. Parliament votes a low for forces Military Service against education. If you refuse, unrest could increase and Democracy overthrown by Militaristic Despotic regime.
<br>
<br>Also adding ministers, like Hearts of Iron. Ministers depending on the winning party, providing bonuses here and there.
<br>
<br>Well things like that...
<br>
<br>THAT IS COMPLETELY FEASABLE and would make this game the best game ever... And I&apos;m sure Paradox will do that.
<br>
<br>Yet, it is not case. And after 5 hours of gameplay I understand I will need at least extra 95 hours before finishing the game. I am NOWHERE yet and everything still needs shape. And that makes me want to play game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6376529">Expand</a></span>

<br>4X games have been following Stellar Crusade and MoO&apos;s pattern for years... a few showed game changing advances.. GC2.. SE3.. but then these were followed by prettier versions of the same game.  Stellaris brings major changes.. Spending the time researching each world and star near home while you develop a colony ship is really interesting.  Then there is the first time you Gene Mod your race to better fit the planet you have dumped them on.. its just astonishing when you realize what you can do.  The funny stories research generates.. the decision to change your laws to allow robot (slaves).
<br>But still not perfect.  I expect 2 or 3 major dlc releases this year and a better game after each one.
<br>My only problem is i am not now inclined to play MoO4 which i have on steam.. and which deserves playing in itself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6407250">Expand</a></span>

I am a fan of the Europa Universalis and Crusader Kings and have been playing Stellaris now for about 40 hours. I find it an amazing game. It has a lot of the core mechanics I love from EU4, leaders gaining experience, a rich multi-currency system for advancing, and good diplomatic options but in a setting that isnt an already-colonized Europe -- 1000 planets and the chance to expand.
<br>
<br>Starship Design isn&apos;t the most intricate but I believe that the decisions I am given truly matter in Combat. I prefer that over customization that doesn&apos;t make a difference. I also very much appreciate the established ancient civilizations that start out overwhelmingly more powerful than my fledgling Interstellar Republic. I dont remember a game that has done as well as Stellaris in introducing multiple movement techniques (warp versus wormholes) and making them all work together.
<br>
<br>The tutorial and tools tips ran well and I can count on only one hand the major rules that werent clear from the beginning to an experienced strategy gamer. You need to understand some of the nuances of generating sectors and the importance of Influence Currency but once you get that the rest is pretty straightforward.
<br>
<br>In short, a pretty amazing game so far and I know the Paradox user and developer community will nurture the game and help it to continue to flourish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6408179">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you love EU4 and love space games,</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This game should be called &quot;Galaxy Universalis I&quot;. It&apos;s a much more appropriate title given that Paradox have merely dressed up EU4 as a space game. All the mechanics of the base EU4 game are present in Stellaris. I write BASE GAME because, like in EU4 where your allies won&apos;t be helpful unless you get the DLC for that, same goes for Stellaris.
<br>
<br>If you love EU4 and love space games, you&apos;ll like this. If you don&apos;t know EU4, then I&apos;ll describe what I mean in more detail for you... This is a &quot;Grand&quot; strategy game, which means there is little to no micromanagement. It&apos;s all very macro.
<br>
<br>For example, you can manage UP TO 5 planets directly, and the rest have to go to sectors, which are AI-managed. But then again &quot;managing&quot; is a strong word, it&apos;s more like &quot;overseeing&quot;. You can tell the sector AI to focus on minerals, military, science, or energy production, and set a tax rate of 0%, 25%, 50% or 75%. That&apos;s it, your job is done. Well, you can assign a governor to a sector, for some bonuses. You can design ships, but only in a very limited way. The automatic, self-updating ship designs are mostly sufficient. And so on.
<br>
<br>But for all that &quot;macro-ness&quot;, the game is sorely lacking in utility. For example, in a war, you want assault troops. But you have to raise them from each world, tell each of them where to go, and so on. Oh, and once the war is over, you have to do the process in reverse. There are no rally points or any &quot;Land all assault armies on nearest owned planet&quot; button. So you have to spend your time click-clicking like mad to get these guys back on the ground.
<br>
<br>Oh, and don&apos;t even get me started on the fleets... Sure, you can split a fleet in two, or merge two fleets. You can even transfer individual ships to a new fleet... INDIVIDUALLY. That is, you have to slowly and painfully scroll through your fleet&apos;s ship list, which can be hundreds long and is NOT SORTED, and select the individual ship you want to move. Good luck having fun when you are doing that 50 times.
<br>
<br>I am confident most of these things will be fixed through patches and DLC. But therein lies the problem: EU4 already has &quot;The Art of War&quot;. They already have the code. Except it&apos;s not in this game. It will be, mark my words, sold as a DLC for this game as well, while it really should be a core mechanic of the game. Plus it wouldn&apos;t even be new content, as it would require only a slight tweak on the EU4 code.
<br>
<br>I am very afraid that Paradox is pulling an Activision on us: release game after game with the same core mechanics and sell you tons of DLC for each. If so, I am very displeased.
<br>
<br>Score: 10
<br>Graphics and sound are great. Performance is OK. Game doesn&apos;t crash. However:
<br>-1 for bugs
<br>-1 for core mechanics being absent
<br>-1 for no innovation
<br>-1 for being a space-age clone of EU4

True it may have streamlined much mechanics and receives criticism for that but that&apos;s what mods are for - which are embraced by the devs, Paradox who have a long standing tradition of post release support and community but I think have taken it to another level on this one.  One negative is the lack of options as far as system and gui settings, which hopefully and assuredly will be addressed in a patch by the company which is not an EA or Actiblizzard and actually care about the customers.  So in that regard and also in terms of gameplay and a surprisingly bugfree release (how often do we get to say that with AAA releases these days?) I give the game a perfect score.

<br>This is no trivial game that you can master, finish and discard in a couple dozen hours.
<br>I imagine this is a game I will continue playing for months, if not years, especially as new content is released. Stellaris is a STRATEGY game, and makes no bones about it, as there is barely even a nod towards tactical elements.
<br>
<br>The one thing I love about Stellaris above most other games in this genre .... there are actual STAR SYSTEMS, not just planets floating in space or arbitrary placeholders. Ships which warp or jump into a system have to traverse the system or wait for their jump drives to cool down before they can jump again. As an immersive factor, this WORKS for me.
<br>
<br>The nature of the game is TOTALLY suited to modding and customisation. I can imagine people designing the entire star wars galaxy or star trek galaxy or empire of man or warhammer 40k universe or starcraft universe in this. I literally cannot wait to see what modders will do in terms of race design, 3d models, static galaxy designs, story driven gameplay, event chains, etc.
<br>
<br>Stellaris has given a massive POKE IN THE EYE to those who think 4x games cannot encompass multiple stardrive types and should be simplified to managing hyperlane bottlenecks.
<br>
<br>You will love it if
<br>- you like sandbox games
<br>- you want control of customisation
<br>- you want to set your own goals, and drive your own agenda
<br>- you love science fiction stories, as the anomalies and events in the game are like a story unfolding, absolutely amazing.
<br>
<br>You will hate it if
<br>- you are a twitch gamer wanting a rail-shooter in space
<br>- you want the game to drive the agenda for you
<br>- you just wanna kill things and couldn&apos;t be bothered to read.
<br>
<br>Being a sandbox, i imagine it will suit the multiplayer environment much better than the single player environment, but it is still an awesome single player experience.
<br>
<br>There are a few things missing, but they detract very little from the game experience.
<br>- there are only randomly generated games, no campaign modes
<br>- there are no freighters, passenger ships, trade routes, etc.
<br>- the game is pseudo 3d, and effectively plays out on a flat galaxy map
<br>- no tactical combat mode, but its well done, with combat seamlessly playing outin real time on the strategic map.
<br>- current diplomacy is not that complex, no espionage, sabotage, etc. But the sheer number of species and diversity adds its own complexity.
<br>- being a sandbox, there is currently no campaign, but I am sure the modding community will solve this.
<br>- while there are leaders (governals, admirals, scientists, etc) with traits, experience and skills, they are randomly generated, not a result of a complex relationship engine as in CK2. Not a big deal to me, but I imagine some would have hoped for this. I can imagne a system like rome total war with governing families leading factions might have worked.
<br>
<br>Many of the tricks the designers missed in the realease version, I imagine can be added in future content, or through modding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6383374">Expand</a></span>

It is gripping and addicting, and even AI shortfalls and some bugs do not detract from the overall experience sufficiently to dock more than 1 point from my review. It is also incredibly easy to mod yourself if you wish to get a slightly different gameplay experience out of it: For example, I wanted a longer eXplore phase before the borders were set and we became medieval Europe in space. Well, easy enough, make galaxy larger than the max 1,000 stars the game comes with and don&apos;t use too many alien races. Suddenly space is big and wondrous. Want the opposite? Increase the max number of empires on a mid-sized map and everyone suddenly needs to rush to grab the little precious land that exists.
<br>
<br>And as a bonus, it looks beautiful without being hard on your video card. A 750Ti runs it more than fine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6499027">Expand</a></span>

Currently on my native 4k rez screen, all the UI font is microscopic, and work arounds listed on site, in workshop do NOT fix the problems. Playing at different resolutions than native causes my graphics to glitch in another known and as yet unfixed bug, and I cannot be resetting my native screen rez to play just one game.
<br>
<br>In terms of gameplay, it starts out like a great 4x game, but then quickly devolves to spreadsheet gaming, with small incremental +2%-type upgrades to weapons, few ship build options, and zero tactical combat. Having a large empire managed by many AI governors and all your battles managed by horrible AI combat doesn&apos;t make for a fun mid-to-endgame, and the emptiness of the diplomacy and lack of engagement with scripted storylines that repeat themselves every game make for a game that quickly loses its&apos; shine.
<br>
<br>Wait a year for mods and fixes, and a 50% sale, IMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6428903">Expand</a></span>

It really gives you a feeling of running an interstellar empire with gameplay that includes managing the ethos and expectations of your subjects, administrative sectors and more.

<br>
<br>The game is incredibly well presented. Everything is gorgeous and the music is fantastic.
<br>
<br>The user interface is a dream to use with mouse over information, right click menus, queuing up orders, and various screens.
<br>
<br>There is strategy in your fleet design and choosing the right technologies to gain an edge over your opponents is important. Then you watch the battle play out. It looks fantastic.
<br>
<br>The technology system is fantastic with random choices each time you finish a tech. There is a lot of depth to the technology system and hard choices to make sometimes on what to research.
<br>
<br>The ability to customise your race and empire in this game is the best I&apos;ve ever seen. Stellaris is a game where you can really create any kind of space faring empire that you can imagine, from the noble houses and Emperor of Dune to the space faring states of other sci fi settings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6383368">Expand</a></span>

<br>the empire creation is detailed and the game look fun until you hit a brick wall (will explain).
<br>after colonizing all planets that you can (5+2 with perk) the game comes to a stand still. exploration has no point what so ever... battles are fun at first but boring after 2-3 fights. this game has a huge potential but it looks to me that they just missed it. also good to note that even with high end pc the game will lag after few hours of game play.
<br>
<br>really hope that they release a patch that address this issues and more. giving it a solid 6 until improvements.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6389744">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It pretends to be real time, but the turns are just short. Don&apos;t worry, they grow longer the more you play. Much longer. In fact, after a couple decades in game a turn that took a fraction of a second at the start now takes a fraction of a minute. Pause doesn&apos;t actually stop the action, it&apos;s just a temporary off switch for the automatic next turn thing, and can also take a while to kick in. You will find yourself tapping space twice, unsure if it worked.
<br>
<br>Many little features are missing, like clearing last order on the queue. It&apos;s painfully annoying to wait several real time seconds for the orders to be acknowledged in the first place. I cannot imagine what kind of hardware would that game need to work fluidly, or at least make the battles seem less like trying to play StarCraft with someone from antipodes on V.90 while your dog pirates mp3s on the same line. In fact, I vividly remember it was better 18 years ago. In actual real time, and the AI was smarter.
<br>
<br>Speaking of which, evasive behavior is totally broken and it&apos;s better to just disable it most of the time. Top tier ship AI adds bonuses to stats but is stupider than lower tier algorithm and will kill your support battleships and you can&apos;t do anything about it. Micromanaging fleets to attack neutral targets is useless, as either it ends up annoying you or straight up doesn&apos;t work, especially on &quot;alien vessels&quot;. Chains of events are buggy in similar ways. Some are impossible to start, some impossible to end. Some undo after finishing, leaving you with confused, passive objects sitting there, clogging up your systems. And you can&apos;t even shoot them.
<br>
<br>Sector management is overcomplicated (for something designed to reduce micromanagement) and the AI governing it is insanely inefficient. It doesn&apos;t take control of starports from you, but there is no interface for managing starports left. Increasing micromanagement... Personally, I develop the planets individually and when they&apos;re half cooked I add them to one, single sector. It has the minimal potential to break your special resources. But it still can, you have to keep watch on the automation system. Ironically.
<br>
<br>War is based on making an OK fleet (enough to take on space amoebas) and aggressively flying around the enemy territory until they give up and cede a planet, apparently. They won&apos;t take your planets, because despite the presence of a battle predictor thingy, it doesn&apos;t work for the AI players.
<br>
<br>So maybe ship designer? Well, it has some nifty ideas, but the number of available components seems small and boring. Automatic designer makes your ships weak and expensive. Especially the military stations end up silly. Never build the auto designs. You can even save them to a custom class and then build it, but doing it from the auto design will force you to disband ships. It feels there should be an option of refitting a ship to a different class. Essentially, one of the most enjoyable thing to do in MoO or GalCiv, in Stellaris became a chore.
<br>
<br>There seem to be no special ships, weapons or buildings. Maybe I didn&apos;t play long enough, but as I mentioned the game becomes unplayable due to slowdown pretty quickly. There are no wonders in this game. It&apos;s not very imaginative at all. This is barely sci-fi.
<br>
<br>Diplomacy feels messy, unclear and restrictive, as most other empires will always find a reason to refuse literally any attempts at trade. Except if they got allied with someone who miraculously isn&apos;t a jerk, then you can weasel your way in to get the silly crystals you wanted. But beware, from now on you&apos;ll get an endless, impossible to disable barrage of federation votes.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, Stellaris is great if you have a terminator rig from outer space, don&apos;t care about roleplaying a story, broken quests, factions or AI, and either abuse or can be bothered to use the demented sector mechanic. Exploring you do only for amoeba strike ships, expanding makes the game sluggish, exploiting is made annyoing through bad economic AI, and extermination is something you won&apos;t look at because it stutters and you can barely see anything anyway. This is not a real 4X game. Just play Master of Orion 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6417398">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But after that several hours, you will notice this game is missing too many things. Yeah i mean it. It&apos;s incomplete.
<br>
<br>For example, slaves never start revolt even if they are extremely unhappy. And Arc Emitter does not deal AOE damage(It says it has chance to do that). I think the devs meant to make it to do something special but it&apos;s not in it yet. There are so many suspicious things but i can not remember.
<br>
<br>Also there&apos;s no unique government types, factions and weapons. They are all the same but it has different valuables that make numerical differences. I guess the devs never tried games like Endless Legend or many other strategy games.
<br>
<br>Some might say &apos;it&apos;s just released, give it a time.&apos;, &apos;it worth 20 hours gameplay. so i am happy with that&apos; and etc. F*ck that logic. whoever think like that I presume they are slaves of greedy game devs. Since when it&apos;s okay to release incomplete games?

Like any Paradox title, give it time to fully flesh out with more content that will come later down the road.  Or check out the built in mod support that the game comes with.  Early game plays a little slow, but that is so you can get the feel of it.  Later game becomes the strategy game folks are craving.</span>

<br>
<br>One of the coolest things I came across was when I colonized a planet and found out that it was inhabited by Titans - enormous creatures a la Hercules and Greek mythology. I was stupid enough to think that everything would go well. In a short while the planet was taken over by the Titans , and wave on wave of expeditionary forces were not able to take it back. A sad end there then, but the discovery was no less spectacular for that reason.
<br>
<br>Not only can you discover ancient mysteries or clues that will take you on all sorts of adventures, but you are lucky during exploring then you can come across intelligent creatures who are trying to evolve into an ordinary fractions. One of the most unforgettable I have done was to make an observation post of such a planet, that enabled me to pay attention to what these creatures where doing. Before I knew it I had kidnapped &quot; copies &quot; of this alien race . To my great surprise , this led to the nations on the planet gathered against me . It all ended in me , through advanced technology, infiltrated government on the planet , helped them with technological advances so that they became a full-fledged faction , and then I made &#x200B;&#x200B;them to my vassal . That is long term strategy like nothing else! However if you just want war action and controlling ships in combat this game is nothing for you. I can&apos;t wait to play this in multiplayer against some friends:)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6383400">Expand</a></span>

It is challenging, often you will have to decide on where to spend your resources while. It will challenge you, and the game doesn&apos;t baby you either. A great strategy game, you will lose hours in it.</span>

<br>
<br>last time i played, there were titanic beast on of my planets... we decieded to watch them but after 5 minutes, some idiot scientist from the main team enraged them. result? instead of getting possibly best army in the entire game under my flag, or learning their biology to modificate my assault army, they crushed and invaded whole planet. they destroyed everything on the planet and afterwards, no matter how hard i try i couldnt take planets control back. see.. before that event, i was marching towards entire galaxy and there were none to stop me. this randomness.. is fun.. but its not for everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6413865">Expand</a></span>

Ancak &#xF6;nceli&#x11F;iniz bu t&#xFC;rlerin ara&#x15F;t&#x131;rmas&#x131;n&#x131; yapmak olmal&#x131;. Aksi h&#xE2;lde o durumdan elde edece&#x11F;iniz bilgi ve avantajdan mahrum kal&#x131;yorsunuz. Beni en &#xE7;ok etkileyen, sunduklar&#x131; atmosfer oldu. A&#xE7;&#x131;k&#xE7;as&#x131; b&#xF6;yle bir atmkosfere entegre ettikleri m&#xFC;zikler &#xE7;ok iyi uyum sa&#x11F;lam&#x131;&#x15F;.
<br>
<br>Oyunu oynarken ger&#xE7;ekten kendinizi orada hissediyormu&#x15F;sunuz gibi. E&#x11F;er uzay ile ilgili d&#xFC;&#x15F;&#xFC;nceleriniz aras&#x131;nda biraz korku ve &#x15F;&#xFC;phe varsa, ba&#x15F;lang&#x131;&#xE7;ta oyunun derin atmosferinin size hissettirdiklerinin fark&#x131;na var&#x131;yorsunuz. Grand strategy kavram&#x131;na uyan, geli&#x15F;tirilmi&#x15F; bir diplomasi sistemi var. EU4 ile benzerlikleri olsa da, ondan ayr&#x131;lan y&#xF6;nleri elbette ki oyunun atmosferine uygun olarak yer al&#x131;yor. Bir ba&#x15F;ka farkl&#x131; &#xF6;&#x11F;e ise ship designer &#xF6;zelli&#x11F;i olmu&#x15F;. Oyuna &#xF6;zg&#xFC; &#xE7;e&#x15F;itli teknolojileri kullanarak, hem de mevcut teknolojinin el verdi&#x11F;i s&#xFC;rece ship designer&apos;da uzay ara&#xE7;lar&#x131;n&#x131;z&#x131;n &#xF6;zelliklerini geli&#x15F;tirebiliyorsunuz. Ba&#x15F;lang&#x131;&#xE7;ta oyunu &#xF6;&#x11F;renirken zorlanabilirsiniz. Paradox&apos;un grand strategy t&#xFC;r&#xFC;ndeki oyunlar&#x131; i&#xE7;in bundan ka&#xE7;&#x131;&#x15F; yok. Zaten oyunu g&#xFC;zel yapan da o de&#x11F;il mi?
<br>
<br>Bu kadar derin mekaniklere sahip olmas&#x131; oyunun &#xE7;ekicili&#x11F;ini art&#x131;r&#x131;yor diye d&#xFC;&#x15F;&#xFC;n&#xFC;yorum. Stellaris&apos;in sahip oldu&#x11F;u ve di&#x11F;erlerinden ayr&#x131; olan &#xF6;zelliklerini &#xF6;&#x11F;renirken, ayd&#x131;nlanaca&#x11F;&#x131;n&#x131;zdan &#x15F;&#xFC;phem yok. &#x15E;ahsen bana &#xF6;yle oldu. Ve bu durumda ger&#xE7;ekten mutlu oldum. Son olarak, e&#x11F;er EU4&apos;&#xFC; severek oynuyorsan&#x131;z Stellaris&apos;i de sevece&#x11F;inizden benim &#x15F;&#xFC;phem yok. Bunun &#xFC;zerine bir de uzay teknolojileri, sci-fi merak&#x131;n&#x131;z varsa, oyunu oynaman&#x131;z&#x131; tavsiye ediyorum. Sizi bekleyen onlarca uygarl&#x131;k, ke&#x15F;fedilmesi gereken y&#xFC;zlerce gezegen var.

<br>
<br>Stellaris is that game that couldn&apos;t capture the psudo 4X crown from Galactic Civilization,  mostly due to the fact even nearly a year later - the game is still horribly buggy with many issues, some even gamebreaking not to mention, very obvious cheating AI issues and terrible mid/endgame experience, the biggest problems is related to how Influence and RNG research ruin the game.
<br>
<br>The way influence is handled is one of the biggest crutches in the game, it prevents you from spreading out rapid because it uses up valuable influence, but at the same time - when you don&apos;t need to spread out, you&apos;ll always have it maxed out...but when you actually &apos;need&apos; it, you can never get enough of it,  this is one of the gameplay issues that affects the game and personally I think the system doesn&apos;t work very well.
<br>
<br>Another bad....no HORRIBLE system in the ridiculous RNG system for researching tech, it is quite possible to get royally screwed by a some poor card draws literally possible preventing you access to bigger ships,  the entire tech system should be scrapped and redone with a proper tech tree, this is just lazy and bad...half the time, the best method for research is by waging war and scanning the wreckage left behind...heck, ironically sometimes you can scan your own wreck for tech boosts..
<br>
<br>It&apos;s kinder sad because what Stellaris attempts to do is over an almost mixture of Command and Conquer mixed with Master of Orion style gameplay, whilst its all highly strategic and obviously has the 4X emphasis,  the game falls flat on it&apos;s face as soon as the bugs appear.    This could have something special if more time had been spent on development before releasing in a very obvious &quot;Alpha&quot; state,  I wish steam would honestly stop with the &apos;early access&apos; because you end up with potentially great games that takes years before they can live up to the potential.
<br>
<br>Another note; players who love 4x // empire building strategy games be careful with this title as it can become quite frustrating, especially early when your trying to get a foothold and you discover your sandwiched between several aggressive species who...magically will almost always hate you and force you to scramble, often turning the game into a no-win situation for the player forcing a restart.
<br>
<br>Summary;  Stellaris has (had) potential but being almost nearly a year after launch and many issues still remain,  and highly doubt they will be fixed anytime soon.  I&apos;m going to assume this title will remain a &apos;cult&apos; classic, meaning if you really enjoy space empire building games and are willing to put up with many hours to learn the complex structure of the game, and willing to put up with glitches and even gamebreaking bugs, then I&apos;m sure you would enjoy Stellaris,  for the rest - I&apos;d be cautious.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=7222557">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Just played Stellaris and I have to say, very very disappointing. The game has tons of mechanics but so less usability that you&apos;ll hate it. I adore games with complex mechanics but this one absolutely messed up the execution. This game is way too bureaucratic. The graphics are lacklustre and soundtrack is bad, but those are just addendum. There is little strategy involved and almost no innovation.</span>

Race each other do not differ, except for the exterior, with a completely formulaic behavior, their attitude towards to you is divided into - positive and negative... which in principle, does not matter. I got the strong impression, after wandering through the styryl desert space Stellaris that from the game carefully cut 90% of content to the publication of a couple of dozen DLC.I don&apos;t mind DLC that make the game do something new, but in this case, decided not to bother and just cut all that is possible.
<br>On the background of the above mentioned games, this product looks not very convincing and lowers the bar set by the developer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6413914">Expand</a></span>

Late game bad performance even on high end PC, retarded AI and stupid combat system. The good thing is game support mods and chances are it&apos;s gonna become a fully grown title in 1-2 years with the support of mod creators.</span>

The most important thing you should know about this game is that it is incomplete.  There are huge gaps in gameplay.  In it&apos;s current state, the game deserves around a 5 or 6.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s start with the pros:
<br>
<br>- Decent UI.  In the early game, it&apos;s easy to respond to in-game events and inactive units by clicking the icons that pop up.
<br>
<br>- Good enough game skeleton that maybe with a year of dlc it will become an 8.
<br>
<br>- Big multiplayer games are something new and fun for the genre.
<br>
<br>Negatives -
<br>
<br>- Exploration/research quests are too powerful relative to how you manage your empire.  Makes the game more of an RPG than a 4x game.
<br>
<br>- Expansion is boring.  You have to build frontier outposts rather than colonies because of the resourcing early game only you can&apos;t tell what territory the outpost will cover so you end up getting like 2 systems covered by your outpost when you thought you would get 4..  When you finally colonize a planet, you don&apos;t have a lot of meaningful strategic options: it&apos;s just more power plants or mineral plants.  You need enough food too but its not hard to get the minimum amount.  Other strategic resources are hidden until you research the relative tech so you can&apos;t plan and make meaningful strategic choices.
<br>
<br>- Research is too RNG.  You have 3 types of techs and 3 options for each tech that change every game.  This is to stop min-maxers according to the designers, but why stop min maxing?  That&apos;s part of the reason play the game.  Just adds more RNG to the game and makes your decisions less meaningful.  In other 4x games, it&apos;s fun to pile all the research into attack or into more research or into industry and make your empire specialized.
<br>
<br>- Combat is on-rails.  You just build enough ships so that your number is bigger than theirs.  There is some technological rock, paper, scissors but it&apos;s not that well-fleshed out.  Feels like abuse when you do it to the AI since they don&apos;t adapt well.
<br>
<br>- Leaders is another RNG element.  Your leaders die and get replaced.  So instead of working towards leaders that lend themselves to your strategy, they level up with random traits and then die.  Not a fun mechanic at all.  I don&apos;t want realism in a 4x game, I want fun and for my decisions to be more meaningful.
<br>
<br>- Influence is an irritating and stupid mechanic.  Your empire generates only low single digits of influence and it is used to recruit leaders and build critical infrastructure like outposts.  It is also used for edicts which give small planet-wide or empire-wide bonuses.  Because generation is so low, it is basically a way to make all empires limited in their ability to grow early leaving a feeling of sameness between all empires.
<br>
<br>- AI is bad.  All 4x games do have bad AI but Stellaris doubles down on it because you HAVE to use sector governors (basically friendly AI) when you have more than 5 planets.  This will never be a feature to me.  I want to control my planets and eke out what small edges I can.  Hopefully they improve AI especially sector AI.  There are many bugs atm.  This may be a forever negative to the game.  I despise the AI in every 4x game I play.  They do too many stupid things.
<br>
<br>TLDR version: There&apos;s a lot of layers to the game but many aspects aren&apos;t quite fleshed out yet.  Also the overall design of the game makes it feel like your decisions really don&apos;t matter which is damning for a 4x game.  RNG is too prevalent for my liking.  It can be a good game eventually with some tweaks, but it&apos;s not a good game right now and doesn&apos;t deserve the high scores it&apos;s been getting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6425348">Expand</a></span>

Let me explain, in EVERY other game, you can bomb a planet dead, or invade and take over - not here.  You invade, and &apos;hold&apos; the planet, and if you go enough of these, you reach a diplomatic goal and they give you a planet.

I hated the idea andthe fact it is forced on me and unavoidable. Hope they will make a patch to let players choose not to use sectors. till then, it is unplayable for me and i uninstalled it</span>

<br>Also the lack of waging war the way I want too puts me off from giving this a good score. It might be a good game for others, but that was a nay for me.</span>

<br>
<br>The good points:
<br>
<br>* Very addictive concept
<br>
<br>* The science ships remind me of Star Control 2 and could have been a separate game.
<br>
<br>The bad points:
<br>
<br>* Badly optimized: I get stuttering on my new cutting edge computer, and this is months after release. In a way it feels like I am playing on a WPF interface.
<br>
<br>* Cheating AI: When I wanted to fight my first battle, the computer had more resources than it could have had with the available infrastructure.
<br>
<br>* The science ships: Science ships requires constant babysitting. Sometimes it encounters a hostile fleet. Instead of flying around it, it just stops. It is not uncommon for me to have science ships sitting idle.
<br>
<br>* The game pace: I am not sure if I should play Stellaris &quot;offline&quot; by setting up science ship exploration/research/build queues, and then come back later, or whether I should look after it all the time. When I look after it all the time, entire months go by where nothing happens and it is a waste of my time. If I leave it running in the background while doing other things (ex. go outside for exercise) I will come back to find that a bunch of stuff happened that needs my attention.
<br>
<br>* Game stagnation: It is possible to loose a game in Stellaris, but the computer will never tell you that you lost. This could happen through a combination of things, for example there are 4 empires left on the map. They are all in alliances. There is no way to further grow your empire. You can build ships and do research indefinitely and never win.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stellaris/user-reviews?user_review_id=6900474">Expand</a></span>
