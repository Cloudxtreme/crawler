It&apos;s not just about making hard choices, but watching humanity come loose. With beautiful imagery and heart wrenching conflicts, Telltale has knocked the ball out of the park. They have reminded us that apocalypse isn&apos;t about the physical breakdown of society, but witnessing the delicate threads which hold human beings together come apart. The people, including Clementine have nothing left to hide behind, as they try to survive by any means possible, however dear the cost. In a sense, they have turned into zombies, mindless and selfish, without the actual death and disease. The plague which riddles their hearts is what makes them the real zombies, The Walking Dead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-5---no-going-back/user-reviews?user_review_id=4434053">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I was a big fan of the first season of this series and instantly fell in love. Although the second season wasn&apos;t as good as the first it doesn&apos;t disappoint with the finale. There are different endings that ultimately change the story leaving you an emotional mess in the end.</span>

<br>I got the ending in which you don&apos;t kill kenny, and honestly it&apos;s just as, if not even sadder than season&apos;s 1 ending, it&apos;s beautifuly executed on it&apos;s simplicity and musical aspect.
<br>The fact that Kenny gives his life up just so that you can stay safe at the city with AJ makes it a lot sadder, it&apos;s definitely the BEST walking dead episode I&apos;ve EVER played.

It of course gets emotional too, I just can&apos;t say enough about this game, can&apos;t wait for a season 3.</span>

It&apos;s the most heartbreaking ending I&apos;ve every played. It&apos;s almost as sad as Lee&apos;s death... Just play it and you&apos;ll know. This game was amazing in every way and I hope telltale keeps doing things like this. :&apos;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-5---no-going-back/user-reviews?user_review_id=4434153">Expand</a></span>

So many choiches that i wanted to dodge still i had to do them. The episode made me cry two times: first at the dream sequence with Lee, and at the one of possible endings where Clem and Kenny get to Wellington and we separate at the big metal doors in tears. With five possible endings i&apos;m 100% sure that i will replay them all at my other save slots. I wish now that he made all the episodes but you can&apos;t change much now. Anyways fantastic f*cking good job Breckon. I hope he will be back for the 3rd season for more hearthwrenching moments and decisions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-5---no-going-back/user-reviews?user_review_id=4434248">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The real problem is that, as i understood, there is no great ending.
<br>When I leave with Jane , killing Kenny was very tough, but my mission was to put him to rest. I understood all his crazyness was not his fault and tolerate him to 100%. But after all he went through... I couldnt just go with that... I wanted him to rest. Thats why I think the Ending where he leaves you in Wellington is just unfair, I just understand that  he lost everything and got nowhere to go and has nothing to fight for. Which in sum-up is same as suicide, so i couldnt leave him. But that is not right for baby to stay with them in that dangerous world. After thinking for about 30 min , I just thought that there is no great ending, no matter what you do, it is not going to end like in fairytale, which is unfair , even after they all went through.... it is just not fair...I AM JUST STUCK , I DONT KNOW WHAT TO EVEN THINK, YOU WON TELLTALE.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-5---no-going-back/user-reviews?user_review_id=4440452">Expand</a></span>

As a final note, it would be nice to have at least one character who can accept the state of the world; by the end I was sick of characters bemoaning Clementine&apos;s lost innocence...seriously.

Only in this game have I made a hard choice, and thought about it all day afterwards in work. The episode is slightly slow at the start, but pays off HUGELY at the end, so stick with it and be prepared for heart ache.</span>

<br>Part 5 of the second season has become wonderful. After part 3 was better again weak and part 4 has created a beautiful end here.
<br>The decisions are much more difficult here and the feelings of Clementine are very put to the test here.
<br>In the end I had to rush off tears easy. Very hard finish.</span>

It was a better ending than the one that we went with jane, and it made me cry again. And I hope the 5 endings make important changes for the next season which I can&apos;t wait to play it. I think The walking dead season two was as good as season 1 and it was really better than wolf among us. The only think wrong with this episode and the whole season was gameplay whcih wasn&apos;t a lot. But since everything else was amazing that doesn&apos;t even matter. I liked that there was more talking than the action.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-5---no-going-back/user-reviews?user_review_id=4435804">Expand</a></span>

I think i would probably be hating this game if i had killed Kenny but i did not and that lead to very heartwarming ending for me.</span>

<br>
<br>Good but not as good as the first season including 400 days. Characters don&apos;t really felt as strong and developed. The conclusion leaves plenty of room for a sequel. Story is somewhere in the middle. As for choices, you can&apos;t exactly expect them having too much impact on further progress considering you are playing as a child.</span>

Otherwise has a cheap, cell shaded look from the last millenium. It has everything you don&apos;t want in a pc game: QTEs (to hell with them), check point system (for lazy devs) and episodes (never bought an episodic game before the last part came out and never will...). Besides it is not even a game! It has almost zero interactivity.
<br>And I still gave a 9 for it... WTF? I&apos;m out of my mind or retarded or something? No, I&apos;m okay :) It&apos;s the story and the characters make you want more. The characters come to live like in a GOOD book, you start to care for them and fear for them and you forget the looks, the **** QTE system and you just sometimes think of the parents of the devs, when you have to replay 10 mins after a crash, because there is no savegame, but checkpoints.

                                        <span>This last episode was the best of them all. It arguably had as many feels as the first season&apos;s episode 5, minus Lee&apos;s death of course. Telltale has outdone themselves with this one and I&apos;m already excited for Season 3. If this episode was the last of Clementine&apos;s adventures, it was a damn great end to them.</span>

<br>Perfect blend of a movie and a game, where you live through the adventure with the characters.
<br>Your choices alter the story in way you wouldn&apos;t even expect. You feel attached to the protagonist and other characters, really caring about what happens to them.
<br>The writing is extremely well done for the most part, I was finding myself thinking &quot;Now I really would like my character to be able to do X&quot; and almost always this wish was granted a few seconds later, like it was some kind of magic not just a game I was playing. This is of course thanks to very clever writing of Telltale team.
<br>
<br>Does it live up to the great first part ? Well, it mostly does. Some characters were less developed and sometimes (episode 5 car night scene for example) the writting seems to drop a notch.
<br>However the choices really felt like they mattered more than in season 1 which is why this is also getting a perfect 10/10.
<br>
<br>Highly recommended to everyone, not just zombie lovers !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-5---no-going-back/user-reviews?user_review_id=4512211">Expand</a></span>

I give a high score because I just like the story. That being said things can definitely be improved on as a whole.... for example, they need to have more of these types of decisions earlier in the game. Yes it is tough from a game making perspective but if you have an option like that in, say, episode 3, just bring in back in episode 5. There should be a few different ARCS to the story and not just different ENDS. The arcs can lead to essentially the same types of ending. In any case season 2 was great, but not as good as season 1. I say that (despite a better review from me than I gave season 1) because the characters in season 1 were better. Too many new ones that left/died too quick in season 2 I couldn&apos;t become attached. The story ending in season 2 was MUCH better but AS A WHOLE season 1 was just slightly better than season 2. Ultimately though I still do think the game play still leaves a lot to be desired. Just give a little more game play and not so much rail type stuff. Also season 2 was a lot shorter than season 1. But all in all a good, fun, enjoyable experience. I kinda want to play it again just to have a slightly different story. Oh and I recommend reading the guy&apos;s review who gave it a &quot;1/10&quot;. Man is that funny. Some people don&apos;t play the game correctly (note, don&apos;t have 20 different save files just to see every possible choice. Most don&apos;t matter all that much but taken as a whole the choices do play out a little different!).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-5---no-going-back/user-reviews?user_review_id=4440969">Expand</a></span>

The difficult choices along the way can make things very difficult, but the involvement of the actual player is what makes telltale stand-out from the crowd. Definitely another one to add to the collection.</span>

On the one hand it lets you despair and on the other hand you hope it will be better. Just amazing how you can feel with the guys in this game. In my opinion it shows you the multifaceted humanity better than everything else. But i think something is missing in the possible endings you can get, because of that &quot;only&quot; 9/10. There could be more options, more opportunities, more effects of the decisions you choose and also more people coming back from season 1. But the last one is only my personal wish,</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-5---no-going-back/user-reviews?user_review_id=4459959">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This has nothing to do with the episode content - hands down this is the most brutal, engaging and interesting episode telltale have ever produced (perhaps on par with the finale of the Wolf Among Us). The reason this doesn&apos;t get a 10 however is for 2 reasons:
<br>
<br>- Due to the 7/10 support cast, the emotional edge is blunted at times when it could potentially be &apos;feels-rollercoaster&apos;.
<br>
<br>- 2 of the 5 possible endings are absolutely awful.
<br>
<br>At the same time, 1 of the possible endings is absolutely depression inducing, you&apos;ll be crying into your cereal for weeks (hint: Believe in kenny till the very end). This doesn&apos;t excuse the other 3 however, which just feel so lacklustre, almost like gaining a bronze medal at the end of a game. It feels incomplete, and whether this is telltale&apos;s way of saying &apos;go back and do it again the right way&apos; I&apos;m not sure (obviously isn&apos;t).
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a shame really, as the storyline throughout this season has been absolutely stunning, and followed a completely different arc to that of the first season giving the two games distinct feels. It&apos;s just the supporting cast are made to feel expendable, not necessary tools for your survival. As such, their eventual demises can almost be cast aside after the intial &apos;Christ Jim, he&apos;s dead&apos; moment. As the game explores Clementine&apos;s development into a &apos;hardened&apos; individual, this makes perfect sense however it just detracts from the overall feel of the game.
<br>
<br>Apart from that, stunning. Just isn&apos;t a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-5---no-going-back/user-reviews?user_review_id=4463092">Expand</a></span>

Only good parts were the campfire, the dream with Lee, and Wellington with Kenny. The rest of the episode was a complete screw up. First off it felt like I wasn&apos;t really playing a game, I felt like all Clem was doing was walking and talking...it was hardly &quot;in action&quot; - there was a tiny amount of walkers and just little we could do. I felt like I was acting out a story (and not just any old story but a really bad one, too) rather than playing a game. Awful.
<br>
<br>I was looking forward to episode 5, I thought that the whole game since episode 1 season 2 was building characters and the story line up to reach a fine ending, and that it&apos;d have a good finale but this is not what I expected at all. Episode 5 has demonstrated that your choices do not matter at all; other episodes in this season (and maybe a couple episodes in season 1) have too but No Going Back was just...SOMETHING ELSE. Arvo shoots you no matter what, he comes after the group whether you choose to seal or not, Mike and Bonnie ditch you for Arvo no matter what, Luke gets shot in the leg no matter what you say, Jane lies about Alvie no matter what, Luke dies no matter what (and for a stupid reason too in a stupid way)...etc. The only real difference you is what ending you choose, and you have to wait until the end of the episode to finally make a choice that matters (or does it/will it?).
<br>
<br>Episode 5 was bad story writing. I felt a similar way about episode 4 but I&apos;ll leave it at that. Episode 5 has definitely been the worst episode so far. Just...there was a lot of wasted characters throughout the whole season and some of them died and no one batted an eye apart from 1 or 2 of the group members (ahem Carlos, Nick, Sarah) and even if they did notice it was only for 2 seconds. I have a lot to say about each episode but so far my ratings have been 8/10 for episode 1, 7/10 for episode 2, 7/10 for episode 3, 5/10 for episode 4 and around 3 or 4/10 for episode 5.
<br>
<br>What happened? I was expecting a lot with season 2 after playing season 1 (which was honestly amazing to say the least). Now I know not to get too excited for an episode/season to come out, which is why I&apos;m not really excited about season 3 coming out...will it be good like season 1, will it be better, or will it be bad like season 2? Best way is not to get my hopes too high.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-5---no-going-back/user-reviews?user_review_id=4861975">Expand</a></span>

In the story, things are going great and smooth (at least story-wise), but in the later parts, where the group just betrayed and killed off each other just to wrap things up is somehow dissatisfying for me. But nonetheless, Telltale still didn&apos;t fail to amuse me with their work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-season-two-episode-5---no-going-back/user-reviews?user_review_id=5867042">Expand</a></span>
