Gameplay wise, Resident Evil 5 is a little less creepy than Resident Evil 4, but, in my opinion, a little more fast paced. The new save system and inventory system takes some time to get used to, but otherwise, all&apos;s great with this game. The extras add a nice punch, and the smooth graphics deserve a thumbs up.

For the first time I can remember, this is a co-op that plays like a co-op rather than a single player with 2 players rather than 1. The restriction on items and ammo makes the game a lot more immersive and makes you have to include your partner in every decision. If you play it through on single player you will find the AI lacks as the game progresses. your partner will run into danger all to eagerly and sometimes they will just lag behind offering very little in the way of help. If you play this game through with a sentient being however, your playing experience goes through the roof. All of a sudden you find yourself screaming at your partner to get that shotgun ammo to you ASAP and then you can heal fully. You spend some time after a large battle regrouping, swapping inventory items and creating as much space in there for your upcoming adventure. The play style lends itself very much towards enjoyable, fluid, intuitive gameplay. There are not a lot of times when you ask yourself how the hell do you do &apos;X&apos;. The whole package is let down ever so slightly by the ending which is scripted too much and in actual fact leads to a frustrating time rather then suspense. IS: Neat, enjoyable, more-ish, long, co-opy IS NOT: Perfect, a bad port, too long, scary.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=739197">Expand</a></span>

The controls still aren&apos;t quite good. 2. If you&apos;ve played RE4, the deja-vu level is almost excruciating. If you can manage to get yourself past it, you&apos;ll find a very enjoyable experience.</span>

Luckily Resident Evil 5 has turned out exceptionally well and may be the best game Capcom has brought to the PC. There are several new additions to RE5, but the formula that makes up most of the gameplay is mostly the same as RE4. The biggest and most obvious addition is the fact that the entire game is played with a partner. The AI used in the single-player is acceptable, but could have been much, much better, so you will want to be playing with a friend online. The controls are awkward, but that is almost exclusively due the game&apos;s design, rather than poor PC optimization. The only major keyboard control issue I had was having to press F+V for quick-time events; this combination is painfully awkward and gave me many, many enraging deaths. The graphics in RE5 are fantastic, with the exception of some very low polygon environments (such as the caves). The voice acting is mostly good (though Wesker&apos;s voice and dialogue come close to nails on a chalkboard), and the guns sound reasonably powerful. The story in RE5 is captivating, and offers long-time fans some nice conclusions. The best part of this game is the weapons; there are several types and kinds, and they are all very upgradable. This, combined with extra difficulties, bonuses, and Mercenaries mode, gives the game substantial replay value. The main factor in whether you will enjoy this game or not is if you like the core gameplay. If you didn&apos;t like RE4, then there is no reason to play RE5 unless you are dying to get a new co-op game. The two dozen or so hours I have put into this game have been mostly of pure joy, though I can&apos;t say the same will go for everyone. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=84892">Expand</a></span>

Its pros are the pretty good graphics, just enough to be satisfying (DX 10 looks nicer) but not so great that it lags. Playing Co-op with friens is very fun, i like the idea of having limited ammo as it adds onto the idea of ammo conservation and teamwork. However, the AI that plays with you is pretty dumb, wasting your ammo and all that. I&apos;m guessing the controls during the cutscenes is to force you to pay attention so the creators made sure they didn&apos;t waste their time with videos people just skip right through. Also, for those of you who are frustrated with switching weapons/items....did you know that the top left box in your inventory is assigned the key 1 and you can assign up to 9 keys (the number keys at the top of the keybord) to access your items in order? The only thing that was frustrating to me is how you can&apos;t strafe :( but all games have their unique combat style. All in all I&apos;m giving the PC version a 9 :D</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=740570">Expand</a></span>

Sheva is pretty, stupid, and useless. She stands in front of you when you&apos;re taking aim at a boss enemy. She doesn&apos;t use certain weapons, so she just stands there when she runs out of ammo for the weapons that she DOES use. She has trouble taking down more advanced enemies, like Lickers, by herself. She&apos;s there to push buttons and pull levers. Capcom should have just gotten rid of the two-person door locks and saved everyone the headache of working with this beautiful retard. RE5 also suffers from technical glitches. Many ATI users cannot view cutscenes; they can only hear them. Others complain of frame rate drops. At launch, there was no Crossfire profile for ATI users. Game developers wonder why people pirate games... Also, Capcom is strangely in love with 90s style game mechanics. The item system is not much different from the one in the original RE. Evidently Capcom is too stupid to figure out how to allow players to drop items on the floor. Capcom revamped the RE series into an action game with survival horror mixed in, yet the action so bad. Enemies lunge at you from different directions, often very quickly, but you have to stand still to be able to fire at anybody. Again, nothing has changed from the original RE, which came out when I was in junior high. If Capcom wanted to make RE more action-packed, it should have started with the most fundamental of actions: doing stuff while walking or running. Despite its glaring flaws, RE5 is a fun game. The &quot;zombies&quot; are nothing more than Africans with weird eyes and voices, but they&apos;re varied enough to keep fights interesting enough. Boss fights are exciting affairs that usually require you to use the environment (or a conveniently placed weapon) to your advantage. Although RE5 is full of great moments, it fails to be a great game because of its glaring technical and design flaws. Rent it or borrow it from your friend, Mr. Mininova. You&apos;ll probably never play it more than once.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=738350">Expand</a></span>

However, after an hour or so of play, I find the controls and aiming mechanism to be extremely efficient versus a gamepad. The porting over to the PC is outstanding: the graphics are crisp and smooth, the controls are well-balanced, and the in-game inventory system is very intuitive (click-and-drag combining!). If you only have time for a quick play session, you&apos;ll be popping zombies&apos; heads off within 30 seconds of clicking the game&apos;s icon. The cooperative experience makes this game, I&apos;m sure. In fact, only about 2 of the 35 hours I&apos;ve put into this game were played by myself. The storyline is OK, but well-paced. The first run-through you may be looking at 6-8 hours, but the real time gets spent finding all the goodies (BSAA emblems/treasures), completing achievements, or running through as fast as you can (</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=1396465">Expand</a></span>

The plot itself is poor, but the gameplay is rather fun, excluding quicktime events and the ABSOLUTELY TRASHY LAST LEVEL. No kidding, the ending was terrible; incoherent plot-wise, filled with button-mashing and cheap instant kills, and it feels like a shoddy action movie.<br><br>Other than that, the game is fun. There are some cool boss fights (other than the final one), the level design provides a decent amount of variety, and the game generally plays well. But the game has quite a bit of replayability as well; with weapons galore to purchase, perfect, and pwn-with, as well as The Mercenaries minigame, loot to find, and a variety of worthless doodads to collect (if you care). I got about 54 hours of playtime out of the game before it started feeling stale (and I never got into The Mercenaries, either).<br><br>Quicktime events and a terrible ending detract from this otherwise strong and highly replayable game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=1465420">Expand</a></span>

I played the original Resident Evil on my play station back when I was a kid and it scared the hell out of me. This game however is not scary in the slightest but honestly I don&apos;t mind, I like that capcom aren&apos;t just remaking and rehashing the same thing over and over they made a fun co-op action game which if not for the Resident Evil label would probably be an instant classic. Having tried this game on an Xbox 360 controller plugged into my PC and with the mouse and keyboard I find that mouse and keyboard are far superior. Having played a lot of first person shooters the accuracy and control of a mouse is far superior to anything a controller can offer. My final point is that I played this game with a friend over the internet while chatting on mumble so I never had to deal with bots, as such I can&apos;t comment on how bad the bots are but playing the game with somebody else and cracking jokes at the Africans and terrible convoluted plot greatly enhanced the experience. The resident evil series is as classic a series as Mario or Zelda and this is just another great addition to it. Only real complaint I have is that the game is dreadfully short, I bought it while it was on special over steam for just ten dollars but had I bought it for the full thirty dollar price I would have been dissapoint at the eight hours it took to complete this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=1468785">Expand</a></span>

RES5 allows a movie experience with moments that get the heart going in suspense and fear.  I dare you to play in the dark!<br><br>When you finish a game and have those special moments to talk about with your team mate it makes the game a little more special.  Make sure you have a chat system like Ventrilo during the game to get the most out of it (and to hear your friend freak out).<br><br>Its not perfect, but not many games are.  Im not a fan of the interactive movie moments but at least they&apos;re very, very short.  Also, its a little easy so I recommend the harder setting if you&apos;re willing.  Also, single player isnt nearly as good as multiplayer.<br><br>Over all, an excellent game to play with a friend at least once through.  You may not play again but the first time is something you both should remember with a smile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=1483169">Expand</a></span>

There were a few problems but we got them hammered out and the game is nearly flawless. If you have ever played the 360 version and liked it and want to get the PC version, you should have no problem feeling right at home with this version. We had a problem with our windows firewall blocking us from connecting to windows live (I didn&apos;t even have mine on) but we went in and added windows live and resident evil 5 to programs to not block and it worked fine. Some fiddling around with controls and inventory hot keys and the game felt pretty natural.<br><br>The technical stuff and playability is just fine. Story and everything else is more of an opinion, I have no problem with this game, its fun to play with a friend and make strategies and try to survive and help each other out. In terms of scariness, its more like &quot;jesus christ the guy with a chainsaw is right next to me! HELP!!!!!&quot; not &quot;Man its really dark and gloomy and what the hell is that noise?&quot;. In other words, atmosphere is not really the scary part of this game, like most horror games, its more just being on edge cause your ammo is dwindling, zombies are closing in on all directions, and a really big zombies is lumbering towards and he just wont die!!!<br><br>You can get this game for a minimum of about 30 dollars at this point so you&apos;ll get your value out of it just playing it once, and the game has decent replayability and other game modes. If you have a friend to play the game with its definately worth it. Even if you don&apos;t, you can always team up with some random online.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=1602289">Expand</a></span>

Capcom tried a different direction with this game that drew alot of new players to the series but at the same time disapointed those who loved the previous titles . In all honesty the game wasn&apos;t that scary, sure there was some creepy scenes here and there but for the most part it didn&apos;t make me go &quot;holy sh*t!&quot; like some of the previous games. The graphics are nice too and at first the controls and gameplay can be a bit awkward but its easy to get used to. Overall this game is an excellent buy if you just want to sitback and enjoy the experience with a friend.

Some people say &quot;nah, just normal pistol, farm enough cash upgrade that stuff and you can rush the campaign in 1 hour&quot;. But no, you can even play with your first weapon, without upgrading, till the end (if you manage to stay alive that long), aim for the head, wait for the enemy to tumble and bash the **** out of him. The managing of the ammo might be a problem for some people, but thats why you have a big-ass knife and your fu**in fists/legs.<br>The Coop mode is awesome as hell, combo moves, healing each other and all that stuff, some will say, &quot;Hey, we got that in L4D and all the other Coop games too&quot; but the way they managed to implement all this kind of actions is just i dont know if there is even a word to describe it with, its just awesome.<br>The Storyline is fine too, i like it,thats all i need to say.<br>The controls on PC are fantastic, i dont know what you guys think about RE4 but the control were horrible without a controller for your PC.<br>Sure i had some uncooperative asshats while playing online, but you can end it evrytime, yea and maybe, maybe it had its issues sometimes, but hey which game doesnt had its issues.<br>Well, who knows whats wrong with those people who say they had problems with the controls, or its just killing and all this regular stuff maybe they just saw videos and never really tried to play it.<br><br>But all in all, its awesome, you can play it all night long and yea its worth the money, really.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=1652348">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is great (100 times better then RE6)
<br>Yes I agree it&apos;s not scary as the previous series but it&apos;s realy enjoyable game.

<br>RE5 is a great game spoiled by atrocious controls. I mean the worst ever. These are the main problems: You can&#x2019;t move while reloading, aiming, or shooting; instead you become rooted to the spot and therefore hopelessly vulnerable to attack. When aiming the sight is often (although, oddly, not always) wrenched away from the point already centred so you have to find your target again. And you can&#x2019;t jump or crouch unless prompted. What the hell is that all about? Also the AI is pretty poor. Sheva gets in the way more often than not. The UI looks like something out of the 90s and is clunky to say the least. And you can&#x2019;t access the inventory during gameplay (although I understand the reasoning behind this it is frustrating at times). So what is there to like? Well it looks amazing. The graphics are among the best I&#x2019;ve ever seen, with particularly impressive character models and animations. And, controls aside, the gameplay is enjoyable, with a good selection of environments, some pretty tough bosses, and a range of simple but enjoyable puzzles to solve. Ammo is often scarce so you have to be more thoughtful about your approach to the combat than in many games. Overall it&#x2019;s a top-flight game marred only but it&#x2019;s poorly designed controls and interface. Sadly these are so bad I can only give it 3 out of 5, which is a real shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=3171746">Expand</a></span>

Skip ahead almost twelve years to the release of Resident Evil 5 and take a look at where the series has gone. Over time, Resident Evil has lost its horror feel and replaced it with an action-adventure element that makes it feel more like Uncharted rather than RE. Let&apos;s take a look at the game itself. Gameplay is lame, a watered down RE4 style at best, controls feel too ackward and messy to be playable, and the graphics look like they belong in a game from 2007. However, the biggest problems I had wtih Resident Evil 5 is its atmosphere and how the game is &quot;played.&quot; In past Resident Evil titles, everything was creepy and was set at night or in a disturbing setting, but not in 5, oh no. The game is for the most part sunny and ~*alive!*~ It doesn&apos;t feel at all like Resident Evil AT ALL. At least 4 kept the distrubing and creepy feel, even if it had a cheesy Hollywood style ending. The worst thing about this game is that the game is far too simple for an RE game and makes no effort even to try to be like the previous titles. There are no zombies, you can barely carry any ammo, there is no merchant or place where you can keep your supplies, and instead of being a &quot;full&quot; game, there are levels instead, which are obviously made for casuals who only want to get achievements or trophies. All in all, the game isn&apos;t worth $20 or even $10 for that matter. I&apos;d recommend staying as far away from this one as possible. Only get this if you haven&apos;t ever played the Resident Evil series. If you have and haven&apos;t yet played anything after Code Veronica, I&apos;d recommend 4 over this hulking pile of piss-poor casuality any day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=742299">Expand</a></span>

This isn&apos;t about mowing down your enemies with machines guns. It&apos;s about conserving ammo and carefully taking out enemies. If you could move and shoot this would just be Gears of War with zombies (not necessarily a bad thing though, it just wouldn&apos;t be a Resident Evil game). The graphics are very nice and the story is about on par with RE4. At first Sheva annoyed me but once the game went on the co-op system worked pretty well. It&apos;s not that big of an improvement over RE4 but worth playing if you like the Resident Evil games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=1656347">Expand</a></span>

I gave it an 8 because the story and characters were well developed, for a video game, and because Sheva is the hottest video game character ever developed. Plus the character models, and animation were done very well. The controls are sluggish, but they make up for that by making the monsters some what sluggish. The epic monster, boss battles are really nice. Plush the monsters look really good. Would have given it a 10, but it was not that scary or difficult. Plus the last boss battle was week compared to the other boss battles in the game. Shouldnt the last boss be the hardest and coolest boss?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=741442">Expand</a></span>

But man was i wrong! This game has the graphics, the playability, the storyline, and every level is different and entertaining, and the release on PC has made me buy it again,as i originally owned it on Xbox 360. Great job Capcom i may even swap my ATI 4890 to play it in 3D.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=85220">Expand</a></span>

Now that this is out of the way lets talk more about the &quot;game&quot;. Resident Evil games have always been about atmosphere, &quot;feeling&quot; and the characters always had a &quot;mortality&quot; even if they were badasses. Not so in RE5. The whole concept is changed with a cliche terrorists types story with the US army and crap like that which noone really cares about. The controls are the same as the old Residents but this time the enemies and creatures of the game are updated to work with another type of control scheme and not the proper normal Resident Evil one that 4 worked so well with. Tedious, set pieces abound, no atmosphere, no &quot;haunting&quot; story like the previous games, there is just nothing to say that this game is a Resident Evil game. If you happen to be a fan of the series do yourself a favor and avoid this piece of crap. If you are new to the series then there are better action games out there than RE5. Simple as this. If RE5 was my first Resident Evil game ever i would rate it a 6 for the badly implemented mechanics. As a RE games however it fails miserably and it falls way short of the one RE game it tries to stand taller from and thats number 4. For a true Resident Evil fan the game ends at number 4. Sad but very much true.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=741428">Expand</a></span>

Well hes using steroids now, you will often confuse him with Vin Diesel instead of the good old cop Chris, at first you will think hes coming from a CoD squad. I feel the obligation to write this review, if you played the old RE&apos;s don&apos;t waste your money with RE5, you not gonna like it. Overall a poor game, poor console port. Can&apos;t talk about multiplayer, haven&apos;t played it yet but I don&apos;t think it can do much better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=2786522">Expand</a></span>

Different mouse sensitivities depending on if you are running or walking causes dizziness. The ability to buy guns and not ammo just represents a bad design decision. Interactive cut scenes just cause death while you try to relax in between levels. An obvious console port that is painful to play with a keyboard &amp; mouse; yet the inaccuracy of a game controller for first person shooting frustrates matters even more. The best feature of this game is the co-op mode combined with decent graphics, but frequent disconnects will keep you looking for something else to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=1625531">Expand</a></span>

But what kills the fun in this game is that you feel like you have glue on your shoes. Controls are so bad for being a 3rd person shooter that you cant even imagine. Probably something you can get used to but i dont want to learn a whole new way of playing a computer game when i spend alot of money on them.</span>

Maybe it feels better using a joy stick but keyboard and mouse is definitely not the way to go.<br>Secondly, the AI character, Sheva being the name, sucks!!! A pain in the ass. I was cursing her all throughout the game. The most stupid AI bot I have ever seen. She steals ammo, she talks a lot, she blocks your shot and always shoots the enemy through you. Dealing with her was frustrating. Always need to call her to make sure she&apos;s around and is not making a mess. Third the puzzles. Unlike previous Res Evils, esp. 1 &amp; 2 the puzzles are super easy and a joke. The game is full of meaningless, boring, and very long puzzles and repetitive fight scenes and enemies.<br>Finally, the difficulty level is imba! It took me ages to beat the game under normal difficulty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=1793812">Expand</a></span>

I have to say I&apos;m incredibly disappointed. The most obvious flaw, as others have pointed out, is the control system. I cannot understate just how annoying it is to have to stop, aim, shoot. turn, stop, aim, shoot, turn e.t.c every time you&apos;re in the middle of fighting off the vast number of enemies that get hurled at you. There is absolutely no fluidity to the game play and it feels incredibly awkward. Capcom should have learnt by now that there are better ways of creating tension than having an awful, broken control system (see Silent Hill). Its just plain bad game design on their part, and is inexcusable considering they had finally arrived at such a good system in Resi 4. Although the co-op element did turn out to work surprisingly well, I can&apos;t help but feel that the series has fallen into a lame action-adventure style, which completely undermines the horror aspect of the earlier games and is obviously aimed at a more casual gamer audience. Although the story line and acting have never been the strong point of this series I can&apos;t say I really engaged with the story at all whilst playing. This was mainly due to the disjointedness of the game, which has been inexplicably cut into very short sections. Resident Evil shouldn&apos;t ever have stages, it just breaks any of the tension and the game would have been better served by the old save game rooms which acted as a respite, but didn&apos;t take you to a pointless menu system with a score for each completed section, I don&apos;t want to be graded in the middle of a game, least of all a supposed &apos;horror&apos; game. I would also find it very difficult to find any part of this game which I was actually scared by, and it quickly evolved into a run, shoot, heal affair which was about as boring as I can imagine a game to be. Do not go near this game if you&apos;re a fan of the series, or survival horror, or even action adventure. To be honest, just don&apos;t go near it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=1399770">Expand</a></span>

The only thing that makes this game difficult is the fact that you are playing a crippled doufus who can&apos;t get out of his own way.  You are surrounded by zombie/infected and the best you can do is wait for the game to decide that you can take a punch, often times you can&apos;t take the shot because you had just turned or tried to hobble away.  I made it as far as the furnace room where torch the squid/blob/worm thing.  It was so stupidly easy to figure out how to destroy the monster, sadly it took me 10 minutes to get the timing &quot;just right&quot;.  AWFUL AWFUL GAME...stay away.  Deleting this PoS and sad I wasted $15 on it.  The only redeeming quality is I didn&apos;t pay full price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=1400384">Expand</a></span>

Why do i have to stop a few seconds to take items? Why do i have to open doors slowly when there are hordes of enemies behind me. Why moving is so slow? Why the cringe worthy immature characters? Why the horrible camera? Why your partner die more than you because she is way too stupid and barely kill anything.

I&apos;m sick and tired of interactive movies that are called &quot;games&quot;, I&apos;m sick and tired to push buttons that appear on the screen or see the &quot;you were owned&quot; screen and have to play again. Just give me **** movie instead, that I can actually enjoy without being pissed at the AI or lack of ammo or gimmickly appearing binds to click faster than my reaction times sometimes (GOD!) or 100 other problems. This is awful, get this crap out of PC platform and back to consoles where it belongs, along with all the rest of way-too-overpriced below-terrible-story interactive movie-pseudo-games few-hours worth of questionable entertainment involving console-clunky interface and not-even-good-graphics. Thank you. PS +1 for hilariously-ridiculous polish localization, even if that was not intended. Would be likely +3 but sadly, no voice-overs! PPS.

But now.... the 5th came out.... it is really stupid because this is too repetitive for me... I didnt get this game but I played it at my cousins house and my cousin said that he wants a refund... and it does not worth $60 at ALL.</span>

When play on PS1 you feel the frightening atmosphere... kill the zombies to survive and escape... but now you kill to arrive on the &quot;bad guy boss&quot; and save the day... I have liked the game at all... but this is no more what you want if you goal is a good survival horror.</span>

I was waiting for this game to play it on PC but after playing it 3 years after its release all I can say is that it&apos;s very dissapointing. Let&apos;s start with Games For Windows Live, one of the most retarded programs ever invented, considering that adding a game to it it&apos;s hard, using the chat is even worst and inviting a person to play the game is even worst. Maybe I should stop buying games that use GFWL, or wait 50 years till Microsoft can improve it (it will never happen thou). The game is interesting, but after one of game time, all I can say about it that the control scheme is the worst possible scheme ever used by a game (all console ports use the same retarded control scheme anyway, nothing new here). The controls are hard to use, and changing the controls well it&apos;s even worst than using them as they are. After I managed to chance some keys, I focused on playing to see what this game has to offer. The story is interesting but after chapter 3 it becomes irrelevant, as you still can&apos;d find what the viruses do or even bother to look for them. All the gameplay is only about killing zombies, there&apos;s no reseach,  investigation or even the simplest idea of looking for why this is happening in Africa. Among the most interesting moments is the 1st boss and the chapter with ruins. To be honest all I liked in the game is the girl companion, the 1st boss and the level with ruins. Except that I didn&apos;t like anything else in the game, the story is boring, all you do is kill zombies and bosses and gather ammo and weapons. But what saved the game from my point of view was the level with the ruins where I thought that I was Indiana Jones looking for the crystal skull. The weapons are very good, there&apos;s a lot of them, you start with the weaker versions, improve them then get the stronger ones. The weapons are very good implemented in the game and the upgrades to matter a lot considering you can use a long barrel pistol fully upgraded even on the veteran difficuty setting and it&apos;s very effective at close ranged. One major problem is the inventory that&apos;s very small (9 slots, I figured the PC version could get at least 12-15 but I was wrong again). Some zombies drop treasures which you can sell so killing most or all the zombies is quite good for the player, looting all the wood boxes is also good, but the small inventory makes it harder to keep many things on your character. You can buy and use two vests, the melee vest and the bulletproof vest. Both take spaces in the inventory so the main concern of the player is to finish the game and unlock at least one weapon with infinite ammo to use it on the two other difficulties settings.<br><br>To put it simple: The Good parts: - the 1st boss and the ruins chapter (awesome in design and atmosphere)<br>- the weapons, very good modeled, the upgrade system is interesting and works very good.<br>- the female companion has some nice suits, unlock them as as soon as possible. Also she is an interesting character to follow throught the chapters.<br>- the graphics are good, even very good but it can&apos;t save the gaming experience. It helps but it&apos;s not the main concern for me.<br>- the infinite ammo option is very good as it saves you inventory space after you unlock a weapon with it. Also it helps the player to play in the harder difficulty settings.<br><br>The BAD parts now:<br>- Games For Windows Live... please remove it from any past or future games. It&apos;s retarded and useless. Don&apos;t use any, we can manage with the game alone, or don&apos;t force us to use it. Don&apos;t force us to use GFWL or Steam, any game can manage without the both of them. But please don&apos;t use GFWL... Please just don&apos;t use it.<br>- the control scheme... for the point of a PC player... that scheme is retarded and very very hard to use. Also during the timed events... well it&apos;s hard ot use so I think most of my character&apos;s deaths happened all during the times events, mostly because of the control scheme.<br>- the story... it&apos;s boring after the 3rd chapter, and considering that I am a BSAA agent in the game... well I don&apos;t do anything that even remotely has anything to do with my job at BSAA. I don&apos;t look for viruses, I neveer take samples or research or even bother to see what the viruses do. I only kill zombies, nothing more.<br>- the inventory has too few slots, 9 slot are very few for a normal PC player. Maybe change that in the future, 12 would be awesome.<br>- the gameplay is very repetitive, - the zombies&apos;s AI is very retarded (stupid).  - there&apos;s no fear in the game... nor in the gameplay experience. No fear whatsoever.<br>- no DLC also, even if it&apos;s not that important. These are my thoughts about the Resident Evil V game, I&apos;ve finished it yesterday, on all difficuty levels and to be honest I was very dissapointed even thou I still liked some parts of it. I hope you&apos;ll enjoy my review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=2458553">Expand</a></span>

There is no flow and it&apos;s as if the main character has been doused in tree sap that solidifies more and more as the game goes on.</span>

I couldn&apos;t stand the derpy AI partner (I understand it&apos;s meant to be co-op, but sometimes even a derpy AI bot can be more useful than a lagging troll or what have you) and the boss fights were mainly tedium. The story was watered down, the enemies were bullet sponges unless you always get headshots, and since I played with mouse/keyboard on PC Capcom added a heavier &quot;breathing&quot; effect on the crosshair, making for extremely irritating ammo waste on little scrublings that should only need 1-3 bullets at most. There are really too many things to mention that bother me about this game&apos;s formula, like how you can buy weapons but not ammo, and you can literally quit in the middle of a mission and save your &quot;equipment status....&quot; What is that? Capcom, do you really want me to have to backtrack to previous chapters just to farm ammo for the next big boss, or to farm gold for that upgrade because you aren&apos;t doing quite enough damage to proceed? That&apos;s not survival-horror, that&apos;s not even action-adventure... It&apos;s like Re5: World of Warcraft Edition. Couple of pros: good graphics, decent action, cool-looking bosses. Otherwise, this is just an on-rails yawnfest with plenty to complain about. I&apos;ll go back to playing Re1, 2, 3, and 4... The rest have been terrible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=4385143">Expand</a></span>

I guess this is acceptable on the console but really takes away on the PC, the player environment is nice to look at but hardly interactive on a dynamic level . 75% of the player world is static and only operates on a specific script cut scene type of system , this was acceptable 10 years ago but is really dated by today&apos;s game-play standards, overall the game lacks any intensity and is devoid of any real horror style game play , very few innovative ways of killing enemy or advancing past puzzles pretty much it&apos;s just pick up ammo and blast enemies . excpet the controls make it very frustrating to cycle through your weapons and equipment while in combat and the co-op mode without in game voice chat is very difficult to coordinate what each player is doing. the game is a very average PC game with a few moments of promise but ultimately just average.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=85713">Expand</a></span>

The controls and interface for this game are so terrible I had to throw in the towel. I will assure you, I&apos;m not a beginner to FPS&apos;s on the PC by any means, yet I had nothing but difficulty with the controls and item interface. Another thing I found it odd is that my tricked out system, which ran the game at 60ish fps on full settings, seemed to produce &quot;lag&quot; when you turn your character from left to right. Then there is the constant lack of supplies (ammo, health etc). Which I guess should have expected this from the last resident evil I purchased. I can&apos;t comment the PS3 or 360 version, maybe they work. I find it somewhat funny that the enemies come at you in slow motion because if they attacked any faster you wouldn&apos;t be able to aim at them fast enough. I&apos;ve played a lot of different PC games this year and this one ranks right up there with other terrible games like &apos;East India Company&apos;. If you are a fan of poorly ported console games or you have played the previous ResEvil games on PC then I&apos;m sure you will have no complaints. If you just want to shoot zombies, go buy Left for Dead. Honestly when I read all the official scores for this game on Metacritic I&apos;m left a little bewildered.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=85330">Expand</a></span>

Some of the spur-of-the-moment &quot;press  to dodge&quot; parts of the game were well done, while others were pointless. The story feels a little rushed and bland, but still holds up. The dialogue is very generic. The inventory system is kinda stupid, because items can stack/not stack in an unrealistic manner in a vain attempt to keep game balance. The AI is lacking, be it friend or foe AI, so make sure to only play this game with another player, and not with the stupid friendly AI.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=2811855">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Resident Evil 5 just feels right with a friend. Upgrading your weapons is fun, collectibles are fun, the swapping items between your partner is extremely useful, and all the co-op features are just a blast. I highly recommend playing this game on the hardest settings, the extra challenge with a friend makes it very intense and fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=4942245">Expand</a></span>

First, I love Resident Evil, and second, at the time I didn&apos;t have any next-gen consoles (and my PC was top of the line).  In some ways I feel lucky, as having later played it on the XBox 360, I found the PC version is a lot better looking, runs a bit smoother, and has some of the shortest load times I&apos;ve ever seen.  Truly, this is still one of the most, if not the most, impressive bits of game programming I&apos;ve come across, if nothing else.
<br>
<br>Moving forward, Resident Evil 5 is a game with its fair share of pros and cons.  Overall I would say that, even with impressive technology aside, the positives outweigh the negatives, but there are a number of things that simply must be mentioned.
<br>
<br>To start off, if you don&apos;t have a gamepad (which I do not), the gameplay is merely adequate.  I was able to finish the game eventually, but the controls are not very comfortable.  While it&apos;s easy to bash on something like Call of Duty, that series works simply because the controls are very easy to manage, and easy to get comfortable with.  Resident Evil 5s keyboard layout, while functional, does make things considerably more awkward than needed.  For example, sometimes you will get in an enemy stranglehold, or you will enter a QuickTimeEvent that requires you to repeatedly hit a few keyboard keys - this often forces you to stop for a few seconds and look down at the keyboard.  With some later QuickTimeEvent sequences towards the end, these two seconds is enough to fail, resulting in sequences that will require numerous go-throughs simply to complete it successfully.
<br>
<br>The gameplay awkwardness is mostly felt by the combat gameplay in general, however.  For the most part, running and gunning is easy enough; the movement controls are simple and the mouse allows for great aiming.  However, whereas you could perhaps hit the Run key while pressing the backwards-walk key allowed you to quick-spin in RE&apos;s 3&amp;4, this game requires you to hit the C key.  Since it&apos;s awkwardly placed below the rest of the movement keys that you&apos;re using, you&apos;ll find yourself either hitting a few wrong keys first, or simply using the slow-turn mouse to perform a 180.  Since this game often involves enemies in groups of a dozen or so, or some enemies that can kill in one hit, this can become rather frustrating.  Fortunately, however, like Resident Evil 4, the game is very good at letting you pick up from only a moment before you die, so repeating entire sections of levels is rarely necessary.
<br>
<br>And lastly, while I will admit that the bosses are well created, they are far more annoying than fun, especially with the awkward controls.
<br>
<br>Outside of the controls, the shortcomings are a bit more pronounced, and depending on the way you see them, either more or less forgiveable.  For example, you are only able to play 1 level of Mercenaries unless you get an A ranking on the level you have access to; this is almost impossible, so I have only been able to experience one Merc level, despite the game offering several.  Also, the extras aren&apos;t overly great either, although I will give them some points for originality, such as full-res character models that you can manipulate in 3D space, and the offer of various visual filters on replay.
<br>
<br>As for the story, it&apos;s a mixed bag.  It seems to pick-up from the end of Degeneration, the first CG film, as it deals with things such as the &apos;Tricell&apos; corporation, but these elements are no clearer now than they are/were when first introduced.  At the end, other than killing lots of infected monsters (thus making the world a safer place), I have no idea if the central villains responsible were defeated, or would simply shrug and move on.  Were the main villains featured here the main villains of this huge conspiracy, or just pawns?  I can gladly accept the answer being either, but I would like it to be clear.
<br>
<br>I will say, however, that the story does contain a lot of closure.  Numerous ongoing threads are finally resolved (even if not overly satisfyingly), some of the files you find contain some emotional impact, and the cutscenes are, let&apos;s face it, very well directed.
<br>
<br>As for the good sides of the game, it&apos;s simply that the game itself is fully functional.  It looks great, sounds good, is reasonably well written, and the voice acting is excellent.  It&apos;s sometimes quite hard, but I found myself not cussing overly much as it&apos;s also quite forgiving, and it allows you to go back to power-up.  It lasts about 8 hours but they&apos;re fast and generally enjoyable.  My only real complaint about the runtime is that, unlike the Console versions, the two Add-On packs do not, and will not exist.
<br>
<br>All said and done, Resident Evil 5 an enjoyable and technically impressive PC title.  It is quirky and not horror, but look past those and you should enjoy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=2674055">Expand</a></span>

The controls are made for a game pad and not key board and mouse. This game wants to be really fun but the controls are really clunky. The windows live sign in was a joke. The saving in this game is a nightmare. This is a $10 game at this point and nothing more.</span>

You have to right click to get crosshair and hold it, otherwise you can not fire. When you do, you can not move, except mouse rotate. When reloading you can&apos;t move. Pull out the machete, and movement is just the same as trying to shoot; you can&apos;t move. OK you may think, &apos;be quick&apos;, but you can&apos;t because all the controls are hard work. Try turning round to make up ground, so you may aim and fire again. You&apos;ll be fighting and twisting the mouse around. You&apos;ll be trying hard with the keyboard to get movement, and you &apos;&apos;&apos;will&apos;&apos;&apos; be screaming, &quot;Move&quot;! (Sometimes the controls seem to turn you 180&apos; straight back round into your opponent, when fleeing.) Later on when you have weapon upgrades, for a while it feels easier because some kills are easier.
<br>
<br>It looks and feels exactly like the &apos;Gears of War&apos; engine, but with broken control. (Imagine this mixed up with a slower Left 4 Dead, and Far Cry 2; zombie type creatures, set in Africa.) Ammo has to be collected in the the same way as Gears, after you&apos;ve wrangled the controls to get to it. After a few hours play, you will have made weapon upgrades and they make a difference, and you start to feel vaguely confident.
<br>
<br>Although I have liked the game at times, because the story is &apos;riveting&apos;, impending I will trade it in. There are for sure rewarding moments. Sometimes a few shots between player and NPC puts baddies down. A newly found weapon will take down previously difficult enemies. There are mounted turret sections. It has many of the makings of a good game. It would be a thrilling gory zombie film, but it&apos;s almost diabolical as a game.
<br>
<br>I would recommend other games preferable to RE5. With my Metacritic score of 5/10 it&apos;s borderline I&apos;d even suggest giving it a go. If you do however be ready for a difficult start. It&apos;s not a learning curve, it&apos;s just traumatic control. There are other games I readily like much more. I recently bought Serious Sam 3 and loved it so much I was sad knowing it would have to end. The Metacritic &apos;users&apos; score was 9.2 for SS3 last time I looked.
<br>
<br>After three hours I was thinking I might not play RE5 any more, and just sell it. I took a step back break, then gave it another go, and at a reasonable pace played most of it. However bugs and faults affected the game, all too numerous to mention. (E.g selling two items in the same transaction but only being paid for one.)
<br>
<br>It&apos;s all compounded by checkpoints instead of game saves. After playing most of it I have given up I think, and don&apos;t want top play anymore. It&apos;s too distressful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-5/user-reviews?user_review_id=3183033">Expand</a></span>
