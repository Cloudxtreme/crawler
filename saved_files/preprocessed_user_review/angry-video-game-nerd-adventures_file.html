I&apos;ve been watching AVGN for a long time now, and this game is very suiting. But don&apos;t pay too much; to won&apos;t be worth your investment. Catch this game on sale if you can. This is the short answer. If you want to know more read on.
<br>
<br>The good:
<br>
<br>The controls are good, though definitely use a controller. A keyboard has felt clumsy for me and the developers definitely had using a playstation or xbox controller in mind.
<br>
<br>The story is VERY AVGN. It&apos;s a bit of fun and makes it worth playing for a while. If you&apos;ve watched AVGN a lot, you&apos;ll see a lot of references to his videos throughout the game. The humor is funny for a little while, but it gets a bit tiresome.
<br>
<br>The music is great. Every stage has different theme and it&apos;s some of the best 8-bit music out there. The sound effects make it sound like your zapper or sound waves are really inflicting quite a bit of damage on the enemies you hit. These are great compliments to the game.
<br>
<br>The difficulty is quite hard, but once you get used to the controls, you&apos;ll be blaming yourself rather than the game for deaths. The first few stages aren&apos;t terribly difficult in comparison with the later stages (they&apos;ll give you a run for your money though), but the later ones aren&apos;t nearly so easy. More on that later.
<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t had any major gripes with the types of enemies.
<br>
<br>The eh:
<br>
<br>The stages get very repetitive and by the end, you don&apos;t feel like you&apos;re really playing a different stage with completely new enemies. Most of the enemies are reskins from other levels. For example, the fireballs, the happy faces, the flying ghosts, the squids are all the same, just different shapes. These are the most common enemies, and you can&apos;t even kill them. Furthermore, there aren&apos;t enough enemies for the diversity of weapons. So many times have I wanted to slaughter a band of enemies with my light saber but rarely do any come. And the ones that do come are so difficult to hit, it&apos;s easier to just avoid them than to risk getting hurt by one.
<br>
<br>The extra characters are cool, but they&apos;re usually impractical to use. The guitar guy has a better weapon, but he can&apos;t aim it and he can&apos;t jump as high as the Nerd. It&apos;s too bad there aren&apos;t quite that many enemies that can be killed. Mike jumps higher than the nerd, but he&apos;s a bit clumsier and his weapon isn&apos;t nearly as good as either of the others (kind of like Luigi in the recent 3D Marios). The  man gets a special second jump, but even with both jumps he still can&apos;t jump higher than the Nerd. His weapon sucks, don&apos;t use it. There aren&apos;t really any points in the game where you realize you HAVE to use another character. It&apos;s a shame because this could have been a real good opportunity for a bit of a puzzle design.
<br>
<br>Powerups are in the game, but they&apos;re too scant to be useful. Plus sometimes they don&apos;t even do anything good anyway! The glitch gremlin will stop all enemy movement, but what good does it do if you have standstill ghosts everywhere and there&apos;s no way to jump over them all? It&apos;s impossible to freeze them at the perfect time.
<br>
<br>The later stages are just tedious. Multiple obstacles face you in every direction and the game isn&apos;t even fair for most of them. For example, the haunted stage involves moving platforms that you have to keep up with. But if you haven&apos;t played that part of the stage before, you&apos;re bound to fall off because of the unpredictable motions of the platform. I understand a couple deaths to this, but the coupling of the platforms, enemies, and those wretched death blocks make the game outright frustrating.
<br>
<br>In fact, my biggest gripe has got to be the death blocks. The death blocks are everywhere and they don&apos;t add to the game experience. If you touch them, you&apos;ll die instantaenously; it doesn&apos;t matter how many beers you have left. With so many in the game, you will come to realize that there&apos;s no reason to avoid the other flying enemies since your main obstacle are those death blocks. The death blocks are strategically placed in stupid locations designed to make you die and start all over again. They just seem like cheap deaths. With so many death blocks around, it&apos;s nearly impossible to beat the game on normal difficulty, let alone hard.
<br>
<br>The humor feels much much darker than the Nerd is in his videos. Maybe it&apos;s the open-mouthed shock-face that James instills in his character every time something goes horribly wrong that the game developers didn&apos;t manage to recreate in-game. The nerd starts dissing the game too early and never stops.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a fan of the Nerd, get this game under one condition: don&apos;t buy this game for more than $7! The game gets a couple things perfectly right but then forgets or gets too lazy to change it up. If the developers didn&apos;t want to spend the extra time to program new and intuitive enemies, better levels, and more exciting uses of your teammates, you shouldn&apos;t pay the extra money to buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/angry-video-game-nerd-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=3885648">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is challenging and for me, its really hard, but I knew it was going to be hard, so I will accept this.
<br>
<br>With full controller compadability, achievements and the Nerd, it is worth buying, but wait, is there any bad sides to this game? Yes, its not worth replaying.

But one thing is for certain, I&apos;d rather play this game than have a buffalo take a diarrhea dump in my ear. And I&apos;d rather play this game over having to eat the rotten butt-hole of a road-killed skunk and then down it with a beer. Does this game make me the angriest gamer you&apos;ve ever heard? Well no. Am I an angry Steam nerd? No! Because this is just a great platformer created for the sole purpose of pissing off James Rolfe, better known as the &apos;Angry Video Game Nerd&apos;. And if you happen to be a big fan of the nerd, like myself, then this game is a must play.
<br>
<br>Taking everything the nerd has complained about over the years, one fan decided to take all of his negativity and transform it into an entertaining and often frustrating platformer. Insulting you with a barrage of disparaging remarks each time you die, I found myself getting just as angry at this game as the nerd does to the games in his videos, which surprisingly made the experience even more enjoyable to me on some sadistic level. Other than that though, there really aren&apos;t any negative things for me to say about this game. It&apos;s addicting, the controls work perfectly with a controller, the music is great, there&apos;s plenty of levels and bosses, it&apos;s funny, it&apos;s entertaining, it&apos;s great. Definitely worth the price and I don&apos;t say that often.

<br>STORY: The plot of AVGN Adventures goes like this: One day the Nerd and his friends were playing a ***** game, when suddenly the TV sucks them in, the nerd tries to escape, but he gets grabbed by the sack and he enters Game Land to complete 9 levels and find out who the **** is responsible for this.
<br>
<br>PRESENTATION: AVGN Adventures, like many other games, looks like an old retro-NES-SNES-game and by that i mean that the game has a mixture between 8 and 16 bits type graphics and sound (all tho you could argue with 32 bits for the sound, but that&apos;s besides the point). The sprites and backgrounds are well done and detailed, the framerate is consistent (at around 60fps) and the music &#xA1;is kick-***!, everything in this game looks colorful, eye catching and different from one and other.
<br>
<br>GAMEPLAY: AVGN Adventures plays like a 2D platforming shooter from the NES era with a very high difficulty. You platform around and shoot the enemies with the NES Zapper to progress and you can get upgrades or sub-weapons to add to your arsenal.
<br>
<br>The game has 4 Characters to play with and each of them has some especial attribute, tho you do have to find the other characters. First there&apos;s &quot;The Nerd&quot;, which is my personal favorite, he&apos;s the most balanced character of them all with a decent run speed, a decent jump high and he does decent damage, BUT! he is the only character who can use the upgrades and sub-weapons + he can stand in place and shoot in 8 directions, he is personally my character of choice most of the time. Then there&apos;s the &quot;The Guitar Guy&quot;, he might seem like an awful character at first since he cannot use any sub-weapon or upgrade, he can only fire straight forward and he&apos;s jump is very...meh, BUT! he is the fastest of the bunch and his proyectiles can go through walls, proyectiles and barriers and believe me that doesn&apos;t sound like much, but he is very useful later on, especially on the final boss. Next there&apos;s &quot;************ Mike&quot;, he has decent run speed and his weapon has a little range, BUT! he can use that weapon to destroy certain walls and he can jump the highest. And then theres &quot;********-Man&quot;, he is the slowest of the bunch and he&apos;s jump is TERRIBLE, BUT he&apos;s the strongest and he can do a &quot;not-so-helpful-double-jump&quot;, personally i never used him, and i feel he&apos;s the worst of all the characters. You find these hidden characters (excluding the Nerd) by using the abilities that each of them have.
<br>
<br>Now while the game does have all of those characters, they are actually not required to beat the game. YEAH every level was designed in a way so you can complete all of them with just the Nerd, but while this is true, certain parts of the levels will be a **** ton easier if you have a buddy along with you, so keep that in mind. Speaking of the levels, the level design, for the most part, is pretty good...that&apos;s all i can say about it. This is certainly good level design, but i feel like sometimes got lazy when designing some parts of the levels. Each level has some sort of gimmick in them, but aside from that each level plays pretty much the same way. One of the things that this game loves to throw you is death blocks (pretty self-explanatory), there&apos;s like a bizillion of them throughout the game and the placement can be very brutal at times. The levels have some very fun set pieces and creative enemies (tho some of them are just re-skins of other enemies).

<br>Overall the level design for the most part is really good, but there are some parts that are designed to anger you AND OMG they succeed. The game is hard, in a Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden, Zelda II, Megaman type of way. Now don&apos;t worry it&apos;s not as hard as any of those, but some of them can make say the phrases that the nerd says every time you die. But quite frankly only 2 of the 9 levels legitimately angered me and by the 2-3-4-6-8 playthrough of the level...it wasn&apos;t that bad and i felt like most of my deaths were fair and even if you feel like you are having a hard time, the game has different difficulty levels. I recommend normal mode for your first playthrough, it gives you 30 lives and 3 beers (which are this game life bar) and even in the highest difficulty, there are a lot of checkpoints throughout each stage.
<br>
<br>At the end of every level there&apos;s a Boss which will require a different strategy to defeat and you will have to memorize the patterns in order to beat them, tho some of them are very easy.
<br>
<br>The game has a lot of references to the Angry Video Game Videos and any AVGN fan (like me) will feel right at home with the over abundance of references, jokes and even cameos from other youtubers and enemies of the Nerd.
<br>
<br>So overall with great graphics, music, bosses, characters, controls, decent level design, references and much more, Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures gets and 8/10. Definitely worth your money...and i can&apos;t wait for the sequel!!!.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/angry-video-game-nerd-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=6197079">Expand</a></span>

Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is a game released on September 20th, 2013 published by Screwattack LLC. With a graphic style that is bright and vivid along with a Headphone Blastin&apos; soundtrack along with a difficulty level which will make you want to keep playing AVGNA makes you angry at yourself rather than the game...
<br>
<br>For the graphic side of things there is definitely a enormous amount of polish going into the graphics is obvious and great. The best part is that all of the bells and whistles of the game look great and makes the 1920X1200 resolution Requirement seem necessary. The Colour Pallet is what makes the game Pop out of the screen. Angry Video Game Adventures is a big piece of eye candy that I just want to keep chewing
<br>
<br>For the sound design of AVGNA the music is some sick 8-bit beats with bits of the Angry Video Game Nerd theme thrown in there. Not only that but the sound effects sound awesome. There is nothing not to enjoy on the sound design side of this game
<br>
<br>But how&apos;s the game play? It plays pretty damn well. With great control of &quot;The Nerd&quot; and funny humor that  will make you laugh most of the time, AVGNA is definitely a joy to play. Not only that but there are cameos everywhere and an Easter egg list longer that imaginable. The game will be difficult even for seasoned gamers.  And the asking price is slightly too high. But none of the less Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures is one fun game.
<br>
<br>I give this game an 8 out of 10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/angry-video-game-nerd-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=3591035">Expand</a></span>

As a game itself....it&apos;s merely ok. I found myself rather liking the retro graphics and the music was actually rather good. The controls however are iffy at times, and given how precise the game demands you to be, it can sometimes be more frustrating then it&apos;s worth. The levels are also hit or miss. All are visually unique from one another, and while about half of them I would say were well done and extremely fun to play, the other half quickly became a chore and sucked all the fun from the game(case in point, whoever designed the BOO! level should have their hands chopped off in public, it is the laziest, most uninspired and boring level layout I have ever seen, the entire thing was the same long annoying gimmick for the entire trek). However it was never aneurysm inducing enough to make me stop playing(though I did have to knock the difficulty down a peg), and upon completing it I found myself smiling, it was a Nerd experience, for worse, and thankfully, for the better aswell.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/angry-video-game-nerd-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=3779845">Expand</a></span>

It was fun, but my main issue with the game is the price tag.

For 15 dollars or cheaper you can get great games such as DuckTales Remastered or Vulgar the Viking, which are polished masterpieces with more effort put into them. AVGN is a fun game, just nothing that will even come close to your favorite NES games. There&apos;s a lack of ambition in it, it doesn&apos;t even try to achieve greatness in the ways that NES game developers did. When they went out to make a game, they tried to create a whole atmosphere. Maybe AVGNA doesn&apos;t take itself seriously enough.

It&apos;s frustrating, but is feels so satisfying to get through each level knowing that you did it with your own skills. And thankfully, there is a high amount of replay value, because there are new difficulties to unlock after completing the game. So far I haven&apos;t beaten the game (I chose to start on the &quot;Old School&quot; difficulty, which is the most difficult beginning difficulty (not an unlocked difficulty)), but I notice that I always come back to it. It&apos;s one of the games where you play until you get gameover, get pissed off and quit, and then a couple hours later you go back at it. The reason why I gave this a 9 instead of a 10 is because the game is quite short. There are only like 8 or 9 levels split up similar to Megaman, so if you were good enough you could beat the game in around 2 hours. But if you are looking for something that you can play that is both quick, difficult, and rewarding to play, then this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/angry-video-game-nerd-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=3586677">Expand</a></span>

The game features several playable characters who all have different abilities that make them more useful in different situations so collecting each character is rewarding.  As you might expect the game is full of challenge and difficultly but features several difficulty levels as not to discourage less skilled players.  All in all a solid homage to a great time and a great man.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/angry-video-game-nerd-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=3590907">Expand</a></span>

<br>Fortunately, there are lots of checkpoints and the player starts with high amount of lifes. Also there are lots of secrets for a good replayablity  value too. Old school NES style graphics are nice, and the music is also very good. It runs fluidly, and the controls are also right even playing it with a keyboard.
<br>
<br>Only drawback is the difficulty, it&apos;s almost &quot;NES hard&quot;, and mainly it&apos;s pricetag. Other then that, it&apos;s a highly recommended, well crafted platform game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/angry-video-game-nerd-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=3607210">Expand</a></span>

To start off, the fact that there are &quot;no cheap deaths&quot;, that is false. There are plenty of cheap deaths. Some may say that patterns aren&apos;t cheap deaths. Personally, they are some of the cheapest you can get. Lets not forget that this is one of many games that bare the horrid disease that is &quot;Megaman-idis&quot;. Meaning that there are plenty of moments in the game where you do because you had no idea that a certain instant death moment would happen (this shows its worst colors in Boo! Haunted House.). This game shows that it is living off of fan boys as early as the first moments. This is the kind of game that doesn&apos;t treat death like its nothing. One of the best thing about other retro throwbacks, like Super Meat Boy or Rayman Legends, is that they treat death like water on a ducks back. Or in this case, a ducks sweaty balls. Those games just throw you back to the beginning or check point in their levels. While in this game, when you die, you sit on this screen with a small selection of xblkid I MEAN AVGN phrases. These screens take up a solid 10+ seconds of time while you could be playing the game. Speaking of deaths, why are the checkpoints so spread out? Few checkpoints are one of the worst ways  to stretch out game time. Also, this game doesn&apos;t get the proper music style that has graced other retro-style games. Instead it gets the ear-rape-age that is repetitive and memorable songs that literally make me want to rip my ears off the more I have to listen to them. My biggest problem with this game is that it claims to be &quot;inspired by classic titles such as castlevania and mega-man.&quot; Well if this is the case then tell me why is this game so unfair with deaths? I died plenty of times because of a lack of knowing the level. And this game isn&apos;t rewarding in the slightest. When I beat 1 of 9 pathetic levels, I should have felt like I accomplished something. I shouldn&apos;t have felt like I just ran a marathon and lost. When I beat a hard level in a hard game, I felt satisfied. I felt like I actually accomplished something. Also, patterns in particular are one major problem with this game. You have to memorize when to jump. You have to memorize the bosses attack pattern. You have to memorize this you have to memorize that. Why is this? I don&apos;t mean to go back to Super Meat Boy, but in that game, in the boss for rapture, I found a couple of different ways I could go about beating him. I could either try the hard way or exploit a glitch. In this game with the final boss, I found a pattern that could only be broken by a missed jump. And about jumping. How about those controls huh? 3 words. Stiff. As. Hell. I don&apos;t need to say anymore then that. And let me not forget to mention how insultingly short this game is. 2 hours. 2 hours? 2 HOURS?! FOR 15 DOLLARS? I&apos;ve had 3 dollar games last me for more then 12 hours, and there is no reason to replay this game. In games like dust, super meat boy(lolthisagain) and fez, I found plenty of repeatablity. Weather it was extra levels, a+ing a level I had already beaten to unlock the dark world variation, or just overall exploration, those games had more to come back to. This game has nothing. Cameos? So what. Its not like they unlock anything. Other than achievements. Speaking of that, there are achievements for dying a set amount of times. As if 10 minute loading screens are too short. The main disappointment is just the cost:quality ratio. I&apos;ve played longer, better looking, better sounding, and better controlling games than this. Don&apos;t waste your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/angry-video-game-nerd-adventures/user-reviews?user_review_id=3846900">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Anyways, about the game, if you love side-scrolling games and have been playing them for a while, this may a good game for you to pick up. If you&apos;re new to the side-scrolling genre, this game may be a little difficult for you as it is relentlessly hard. You have the choice to pick between 8 worlds, so if one level is giving you too much trouble, you can move on to the next one.
<br>
<br>My major complaints about the game are minor, but they need to be mentioned. The number one complaint with the game is the jumping mechanic. Almost every single side-scrolling game I have ever played allows you to move a little farther after you let go of the jump button. With AVGN Adventures, the character stops immediately after you let go of the jump button. If you&apos;re used to Super Mario Bros., this will really throw you off and give you a hard time.
<br>
<br>Another complaint with the game is the death screen you have to see every time you die. They are funny to read for the first 5-10 minutes, but get old real quick. You can&apos;t even skip past them, you have to wait 10 seconds for each one to pass. I find myself repeatedly pressing the A button to skip past it, even though I know it does nothing.
