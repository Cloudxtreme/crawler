Dishonored 2 should have been subjected to that kind of treatment. The game is well-optimised. Aside from this (which is still the most important part for a PC game), graphics look really stunning (especially in 4K) every so often, gameplay cunningly evolves and attires itself with pleasant additions that make the overall experience globally well better than before. The map size is honest (twice as big as WD1&apos;s), content literally pours, the city&apos;s atmosphere is riveting and the storyline, despite being quite formulaic, lets itself get enjoyed thanks to a clever writing as well as charming characters.
<br>
<br>Keep going Ubisoft. 9/10 well-deserved.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6840683">Expand</a></span>

<br>I will admit: I was mildly terrified. Putting aside the fact that the original Watch Dogs was disappointing on the cosmic scale, the documents included with the review code made it sound&#x2026; more than a little demanding. There were mentions of 10-series GeForce cards, and a 20-page PDF detailing all the Nvidia whatsits included within. After Dishonored 2 turned out to be a game that limped rather than ran, I&#x2019;m not going to lie: I spent 20 minutes of the download time weighing up the value of some very expensive video cards.
<br>
<br>Fortunately, Watch Dogs 2 runs incredibly well. Not quite flawlessly unless I drop the graphics more than I really want to, but well enough that I don&#x2019;t actually have any complaints.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6834187">Expand</a></span>

I really loved exploring the SF locations and interacting with npcs (listening to conversations, stealing money). I loved all the side quests and photo locations. My only problem was the puzzles, while they&apos;re not super hard, I would like the option to skip them when I replay, sometimes I just wasn&apos;t in the mood for them. But I did feel great when i figured out a difficult one. I love the melee take downs (how that pool ball on a rope is non lethal I have no idea) and the options you have when contemplating your approach. Also I love that being spotted is not an auto fail, you can fight your way out if you can manage to isolate each guard. The drones are great for those hard to reach places that seem impossible in early game. The skill tree feels confusing but there are some great things to invest in. I really liked the character of Marcus and the hackers, especially when compared to some other ubisoft game characters (like those unrelatable douchbags from farcry 3). This game is super refreshing, I look forward to playing another (never played WD1). Only problem was I had one mission that kept crashing near the end so i never got around to finishing but I did get over 50 hours of playtime and will probably just start over again because I really love this game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6972960">Expand</a></span>

Drones!
Batman like Tech view makes things so much easier to track
No research point or other goody are too difficult to reach and are neatly labelled in map.

<br>Great Music and sound.
<br>Hack city, hack cars on street, send cops or mob after any target... list goes on and on.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Crashes sometimes.
<br>Not properly optimized.
<br>Explosive devices are too powerful and infinite. Once you get 5 explosive (refilling infinitely) and ability to drop them by drones you have basically won the game.
<br>
<br>Really great game with a great campaign. Go for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6982922">Expand</a></span>

The main thing that was interesting to play. With this Watch Dogs 2 to copes great!
<br>The story plot, he&apos;s playing in the background. The game has good characters and most importantly - interesting mission. The plot is simple, but the story missions are very good. In theory they are monotonous - strike to and crack something. But in practice, missions are interesting and varied. I went mostly stealth, almost without entering the building jumper here an indispensable thing. Side missions are not sad, but very exciting. Somewhere contribute in the leaked trailer for Ubisoft, and then decide to give money to the people or to make donations, watching a funny emotion.
<br>In the game, as for me, minus 3: 1) Cars. They are better than in the first part, but still mediocre. They are very sharp, and large trucks almost uncontrollable. 2) Shooting. I almost didn&apos;t shoot and when he shot is suffering. The hero is very frail, of course it&apos;s good, because he&apos;s just a guy without armor, but a quick death is assured. 3) Artificial intelligence. When you&apos;re going stealth and you notice one guard, then you notice EVERYTHING and quickly pulled together for you. Come help, and they just absolutely know where you are. This is so frustrating.
<br>I&apos;m at the cons for the most part didn&apos;t pay attention and enjoy this great game. This time optimization is great! Really one could expect, excellent optimization from Ubisoft. Finally, in the game there are no towers. And in General almost not felt that this is a game from Ubisoft. It is, of course, not better than Gta 5, but the feelings somewhere. And of course Watch Dogs 2 is much better Mafia 3. The graphics are good, not amazing , I play on medium settings. But the characters, objects felt some kind of plastic.
<br>Good plot, interesting story and side missions. A great optimization, well-researched city, nice graphics, interesting and varied gameplay focused on hacking . Watch Dogs 2 - a great game about hackers, not about murderers. It has flaws, but still I advise you to play, you will not regret. Walkthrough for 23 hours and I want more stories in this world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7074336">Expand</a></span>

One of the best step forward in game series. First Watch Dogs was soooo bad and contained tons of bugs and broken mechanics, just a bad copy of GTA with 1-dimensional character.
<br>The new game is like the fresh breath! Awesome city, good graphics (with mediocre optimisation tho), LOTS of funny missions, some funny dialogs, great driving (mostly) and  shooting experience, great sounds. But: no story, no &quot;gta-style&quot; scenes, poor OST.  But the great improvements are characters: they&apos;re funny, they&apos;re hipsters, and the most important, that they aren&apos;t obnoxious and easy to listening their bla-bla-bla. Interface is also good, some puzzles are pretty challenging. Gameplay lets you to make a lot of funny ways to complete missions.
<br>I hope one day, Assassin&apos;s creed will be improved that way...

<br>Where as Watch Dogs 2 is more interesting and holds my attention for longer with the challenge of getting things done stealthy instead of running in there guns blazing, which if you want you can do the whole guns blazing shooting every npc that moves.
<br>
<br>I am holding off playing it online till My buddy gets it so we can play together, So i wont comment on that just yet but from what I have read and seen on twitch it looks as good as the single player if not even better.
<br>
<br>I do wonder if UBI shot themselves in the foot with the console release coming before the PC as there was a problem with the online play on the consoles that needed a patch but by time Sony and Microsoft did the security checks on the patch it was released after the game came out and I feel this may have damaged the games reviews online. If they had released the PC version first there would have been no delay in the patch and all would of gone unnoticed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6979605">Expand</a></span>

I like that this game punishes you for going in guns blazing. The characters are well written and well developed but never really seem to change over the course of the game. The side missions are a nice distraction but not much else just classic Ubisoft stuff. The main story is where the game falters. Watch Dogs 1 had a better story overall in my opinion and the story to Watch Dogs 2 never really has any high or lows, it just stays in the middle. I honestly think that the story is there to compliment the open world and all the activities that are there to do. If you are a fan of stealth or open world games this is a good game just to relax and enjoy rather than get really serious about.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7085494">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There are a lot of puzzle elements to many of the missions and the skills tree allows you to upgrade various different skills.  These skills allow you to complete missions in different ways.  For example, you can choose to upgrade social engineering skills, which will eventually allow you to use a gang attack on your enemies.  You would just need to get close enough to an enemy to assign a gang hit on him.  If gang attacks isn&apos;t your cup of tea, you can put an APB on one of your enemies and then watch a police officer rush to the scene and arrest him.
<br>
<br>You can also upgrade your remote control car and drone, upgrade your vehicle hacking skills, markmanship...etc.
<br>
<br>Overall, this is a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7094714">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game looks great and is well-optimized, though compared to the piss-poor technical state most AAA games now are released in, that&apos;s not saying too much.
<br>The stealth and hacking gameplay is much improved from the first one. There is a bit too much reliance on the buggy and copter, and their inclusion has had a negative effect on level design, but it allows for more freedom to pick your playstyle, at least on most missions.
<br>Some of said missions are quite fun too. Along the main story Ubisoft eschewed the usual mission tropes like the race, the forced stealth, the timed mission etc and allowed you to approach them more indrectly, something that greatly helps immersion and keeps you from the &quot;going through the motions&quot; feeling you ofetn get with gta-clones.
<br>Unfortunately, the difficulty of said missions is all over the place. Some are so easy to one-shot they don&apos;t even feel like a challenge, while some had me resetting from checkpoint upward of 20 times. Neither is inherently bad, but the inconsistency is jarring. The most common reason for the spikes is an over-abundance of guards, making sneaking almost impossible.
<br>This is a problem because the combat in general and the gunplay particularly is absolute trash. All weapons from pistols to sniper rifles feel grossly underpowered. There is no feedback from enemies when hit, and when you meet heavy guards toward the end of the game, they can tank 7-8 headshots from a shotgun at close range before going down, not even stopping their own gunfire meanwhile.
<br>The writing in the first game was bad because of its dour tone clashing with the content. But at least you could imagine Aiden Pierce as someone capable of killing his way through an army to get to where he wanted. Marcus is protrayed as always upbeat, wise-carcking, meme-spouting good guy looking out for the people, so when he goes on a rampage, everything just feels off.
<br>The other characters go grossly underdeveloped and thus descend into caricatures. Not a single time could I even imagine how they grew up, what they had gone through or who they even were. Out of the central cast you only learn any background about 2 of the characters, one of which is introduced later in the game and the other is killed off.
<br>The series still has a way to go to be good. As it is, Watch Dogs 2 improves on the first game in some ways, but takes some steps back in others. The series needs to find a narrower gameplay focus or get lost in the mediocrity it is in now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6944970">Expand</a></span>

<br>Improved graphics and optimization on PC, great characters and narratives.
<br>tho game basics are still little kinky and hard but I love this and you guys may like this!
<br>and even multiplayer gotten powerful and not boring!
<br>
<br>* I run this very smoothly on Ultra and FHD, GTX 1070, DDR4 16G, I7 6700K@4.4.</span>

<br>WD2&apos;s story is boring. Both Watch Dogs 1 and 2 have a boring map, stupid A.I. and bad background Musics.
<br>In conclusion, Watch Dogs series is not a must-play open world game title.</span>

I personally gave it two chances to play, but just didn&apos;t have much fun with it. The story was depressive and also a bit boring with a forgettable protagonist, plus the gameplay was lacking as well. Chicago also wasn&apos;t exciting enough  and the graphics downgrade was obvious from the start. With Watch Dogs 2, Ubisoft wanted to make sure they made all those things right, and glad to say that they not only did that but also gave us one of the very best games of 2016. The main character, Marcus Holloway, is a young, colorful hero who is not only a master hacker, but also great in parkour, fighting, driving and shooting. San Francisco is the new setting of the game, and it serves as one of the best open world maps in any game I ever played. The city is just full of life and seems like every NPC in it walking the streets has a purpose. People are working out, walking dogs, doing martial arts at the park, they do yoga, they greet each other on the streets, they sit around under a tree chatting, they talk on the phone, get into car crashes, play guitar, go shopping and the list just goes on and on. There is never a boring scene anywhere, and I often just spend time walking around doing parkour, and exploring all the sights and sounds.
<br>Without spoiling much of the story, I can also say that this time around taking down the &quot;Big Brother&quot; is a lot of fun with many interesting characters you meet on the way. Marcus joins the hacker group DeadSec pretty early on and from then his main purpose is to win his war against the government.
<br>There are also many activities to do in San Fran, my favorite being taking down gangs and stealing their money stash. Your dollars you can spend on buying cars, weapons, new equipment for hacking like drones, food, clothes and there is also an upgrade system. There are side missions as well like freeing other captured players and thanks to multiplayer there are plenty of co-op and PvP matches.
<br>I could write about this game for hours, but I rather go back and play it now. All in all, it is an amazing sandbox experience with great action, smooth driving, cool parkour and an excellent story. Must play for everyone who likes the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6953636">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a really good and well written game (, and surprisingly polished too). The PC port is nigh perfect, maybe only the AA is a little underwhelming. Compared to some really poor PC ports like Deus EX: MD WD2 looks like something from another planet. The city looks alive, the people and situations are over the top but believable. In short, WD2 is a great game and in my opinion it is well worth the full price.

<br>
<br>Watch Dogs 2 perfectly hits the gameplay that I&apos;d want from a hacking game! Coming from a programmer, the puzzles presented by this game in both missions and free roam feel similarly challenging to the puzzles I deal with in day-to-day work. You aren&apos;t writing literal lines of code in this game, but when you&apos;re writing code, you&apos;re not necessarily thinking about the code you&apos;re writing so much as the problems you&apos;re trying to solve. And Watch Dogs 2 channels that same spirit in a great way.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s hard to say exactly why, but Watch Dogs 2 nails gameplay much better than the original Watch Dogs game did. It could be the more colorful environment, the more responsive NPC&apos;s, the new abilities between RC and drone... there&apos;s a lot more to unpack in this second Watch Dogs game! The game doesn&apos;t feel repetitive as the first one did. Even if there are missions and activities that are repetitive, they don&apos;t bother me because they&apos;re actually fun! Things that are repeatedly fun are never a bad thing.
<br>
<br>Smaller notes:
<br>
<br>- Better music, and the radio stations are a great addition. That said, they could use more entertaining host chatter (see GTA&apos;s radio for better quality there).
<br>
<br>- The driving feels too clunky for lower end cars, but just right with higher end cars. - not saying lower end cars should perform as well as higher end cars, but that lower end cars can be slower and worse at turning without feeling completely unenjoyable the way they do now.
<br>
<br>- The dialogue is still horrible. Watch Dogs 2 is a game that involves very mature themes, but has the tone of a PBS kids show trying to be cool. Watch Dogs needs both better writers and better voice actors. Character performance in this game is very poor. That said, the gameplay is great! And that&apos;s what we&apos;re all here for.
<br>
<br>- A surprising addition to the game is NPC interaction! You can now greet, insult, flirt, and more with the NPC&apos;s. It feels like a basic version of the kind of interaction you might get in a Sims game. However, the interaction quickly loses its glimmer after the first two or three interactions with the same NPC. With it being a surprise feature, I can&apos;t complain. It&apos;s nice to have! And now I realize how much more interaction with NPC&apos;s I&apos;d like from open world games. The few seconds when you&apos;re waiting to see how an NPC will response really make the world feel alive. And then when things become predictable, that life is drained completely. This is a place where Watch Dogs could really outshine both GTA, which has equally bad NPC interaction, and The Sims, which doesn&apos;t really feel like an open world at all.
<br>
<br>Alright, I&apos;ve said enough. If you&apos;re interested in this game, go ahead and buy it! Don&apos;t buy it for the story though. Buy it just because it&apos;s really fun to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6848397">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Unlike Mafia 3, the side quests and optional extras are actually enjoyable and most of the time they don&apos;t feel repetitive! I was not a huge fan of Ubisoft with their recent releases but i have to say they have gone up in my expectations with WatchDogs 2.
<br>
<br>A huge immersive world. Very few glitches (except for the multiplayer part when you complete a steal a vehicle mission both of you have to get in and out of the car twice for the mission to complete and receive reward but currently not everyone knows this so they just leave and you lose the points which is annoying) and it&apos;s great they picked a real city for this version because right now i am loving the mission in Alcatraz.
<br>
<br>I was a big fan of Watchdogs 1 until it actually released and turned out to be a tired old repeat of what Ubisoft do but i was very surprised at how much they listened to the negativity they received.
<br>
<br>Buy Watchdogs 2. You will not regret it.
<br>
<br>Think of it as a graphically upgraded GTA V with lots of technology and cool gadgets :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6873420">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game caters to varied playstyles too, I love what both the RC Car and Drone brings to the game.
<br>
<br>After around 18ish hours oof play, I can honestly recommend this game to anyone who want a GTA style game with a geek/hacker vibe to it.</span>

San Francisco is just an amazing for a hacker like Marcus to wreck havoc especially during bounty hunter missions. Ubisoft has clearly made their statement well.</span>

The online experience has been blended seamlessly with the single player, which is a real blast when you&apos;re exploring and another player pops up. It makes the world seem even more teeming with life.
<br>It has a really non-linear approach to carrying out missions, letting you choose how stealthy you want to be and not punishing you either way.

Watch dogs 1 was not really what i waited for, but watch dogs 2 was very complete, with a beautifull map and amazing graphics. The hacking could have been better and more usefull in free roaming, but this game still amazing !</span>

I wasnt expecting much from Ubisoft, their games are usually pretty looking, but very boring after a while, but this isnt the case. Watch Dogs 2 is imho hot candidate for a game of the year! Buy it.</span>

<br>An engrossing open-world adventure in an excellently modelled environment which doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously. Performs and looks great on PC. Design, textures, and music are all very well done. Multiplayer elements are creatively integrated and optional (I recommend leaving the default settings allowing PVP invasions).</span>

<br>I believe many reviewers did not play it: that&apos;s why they said that plot and characters are dull and intended for a young public. This is only apparently true, but it becomes false as you keep progressing with the story.
<br>Let&apos;s put it this way: Ubisoft is really unique as a major software house, as it tried to create games with powerful and delicate social, civil and cultural themes. Assassin&apos;s Creed games managed to do so, with highs and low of course, but they introduced important concepts: freedom of thought, rights of minorities, anti-systemic philosophy etc, all within a dense cultural and artistic setting.
<br>Yes, you may say that such messages are not always well rendered in Ubisoft games, but at least they tried.
<br>Watch Dogs 2 is a game like that: it has something to say. It is not perfectly formulated, but the fact it does is enough for raising it over most existing games.
<br>WD2 is packed with civil, educational and powerful social messages, all in a lightweight and funny fashion, by means of a group of teenagers that are quite well characterized and devoted to important cultural battles.
<br>Also, it is technically fantastic, the gameplay is interesting and fun enough, and the story is decent though not so well paced or narrated.
<br>It basically has the same flaws of all Ubisoft late games: a lack of inspiration in the script, due to the intent of making the game likable to the masses at all costs.
<br>This is your main mistake, Ubisoft: you have to DARE again, you have to go back to the time when you created an amazing game set in Middle-east and whose protagonist was an arab. You don&apos;t have to be afraid of the masses, as they do NOT know what they want. Ubisoft, you must become again the maker of games with powerful meanings and messages.
<br>And Watch Dogs 2 is a step to the right direction.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6918968">Expand</a></span>

<br>Google Translation:
<br>&quot;Watch Dogs 2 I went for a few days and I&apos;m quite happy with this game. This game has an excellent plot. She was not made for a blunt shooting as it was in the GTA, it is tuned for the story and the passage of stealth, even though the AI &#x200B;&#x200B;is lame.
<br>
<br>The game has a fairly good number of jokes that will dilute the boredom. Also there is a full Russian localization for which many thanks.
<br>
<br>In terms of optimization: in a review, I see too many complaints about the optimization will say this: if my hardware (AMD Phenom II X4 945, GTX 750 2gb, 8gb RAM) game on medium settings works without any lag. So those who proposes to dig deeper in their software, there is clearly a problem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6942493">Expand</a></span>

The textures on Mafia 3 compared to this is like playing this on a playstation 2 and Mafia 3 on a Sinclair Spectrum 48k.
<br>
<br>The graphics on Watchdogs 2 are really quite good for an open world game. I run an i5-2500k at 4.2ghz with 16GB RAM. a GTX970 at stock and a ASUS ROG G-sync monitor, so you can see. my rig is 5 years old with just a graphics card update.  My CPU is far from ideal yet this runs and plays without my CPU hitting 100% much. I have this at a mix of ultra and high with MSAA off in favour of the other performance enhancing AA. I am getting between 40-60 FPS with almost zero stuttering (I used to be a member of the 60FPS brigade until I got my g-sync monitor.  Now, so long as it isn&apos;t a shooter, I can easily live with 40-50FPS - the difference is non existent.
<br>
<br>At first glance it looks like there is hardly anything to do because there are almost zero icons on the city map. This soon changes after the first half hour or so. I haven&apos;t played more than 4 hours yet and my score may change but I couldn&apos;t give it a 10 at this stage. One thing I am certain though is that unlike some other successful open world titles, the first few operations missions I did were not a walk in the park, even on normal difficulty I had issues trying to complete the mission at the studios using stealth alone. Ended up having to shoot my way out.
<br>
<br>If you are on the fence thinking this is going to be a poor to average game like the first Watch Dogs, then be assured - it isn&apos;t. If you are like me and couldn&apos;t care less about the u-play DRM then you&apos;re in for a treat. If you won&apos;t buy because of u-play, well - its your loss. I don&apos;t see much of a difference between having to use u-play instead of steam</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6847785">Expand</a></span>

<br>Wasn&apos;t thinking of buying this Watch Dogs, because how cheated I felt with the first one, but I don&apos;t regret buying it! With the recent big titles of Ubisoft being well optimised and often that they are releasing good/mediocre games, my faith for Ubisoft is starting to restore.
<br>
<br>The PC version of Watch Dogs 2 is fairly optimised, with some settings taking too much of an fps hit in my opinion. What I mean by that is, I can&apos;t, for example, play this game stable (60 fps) if I turn on 2x MSAA, Nvidia&apos;s own settings or turning up extra details. However, the game looks good even if I turn those settings down/off.
<br>
<br>Both the side missions and main missions are fun if a bit repetitive. The hacking aspect of the game is, of course, a part of the missions, but I can often choose how I want to complete it: either by killing everyone, doing it stealthy or hacking. It feels enough different for me to keep going. Sidequests are often times fun and goofy, which makes the repetitive hacking feel a lot more rewarding and therefore more fun. The one thing that really didn&apos;t feel that much fun was the collecting part since it often made me go up a really high roof and then climb all the way down again.
<br>
<br>Sometimes I feel like the story of the game try to take itself seriously, and sometimes like it isn&apos;t. That kind of work in the sense that the hacking group is created by young hipster people. Basically, it is a decent story, with some weird parts and characters. The one thing that kind of disturbed me is that the group works to help the people living in San Fransisco, but I can still go around killing innocent guards and people during missions. It would have been nice with some kind of moral mechanic in the game so that I got less or lost followers.
<br>
<br>My favourite thing  is the amount of customization you can do to the character. It would have been nice having that amount to the cars and weapons as well, but you always want more I guess. I have never seen a game with soo many clothes options.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a good game and I highly recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6870889">Expand</a></span>

You can be expect lots of collectibles, side activities. However, this is a Ubisoft open-world game which means, the world feels dead, the missions are repetitive and boring the graphics aren&apos;t the best, and there is nothing that could be called emergent gameplay. None of the simplified mechanics actually work together to create amazing moments. The controls are pretty clunky, so get used to having to reload a lot because you jumped out of cover instead of switched, or because you hacked the wrong person. The guns are bad, the cars are boring to drive, and there is little interaction with civilians. That being said it&apos;s not terrible. They try with the humor although it feels a bit heavy handed. Satirizing silicon valley and San Francisco through clever of popular stereotypes is one thing(think GTA V), but simply ripping off real life is another(Tom Cruise-esqe character, Scientology standing). Watch dogs feels like dated game design, and not the best game design at that. Not the best, nor the worst game ever. If you like Assassins Creed, Far Cry, the Crew, the first Watch Dogs then there is a chance you will like this. If, however, you find yourself always comparing games to  GTA V, the Witcher 3, or  MGS V you will be disappointed. Its sad to see such a major studio only making one game with different skins. Last thing, how in the world did Ubisoft manage to make car chases the most tedious thing ever? I am literally bored out of my mind as I wait for the chase to be over.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6851775">Expand</a></span>

The same thing happened with another</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">It&apos;s a good game, but perhaps should&apos;ve been an expansion to the original Watch Dogs.
<br>
<br>The original Watch Dogs was one of those games published by Ubisoft close to the beginning of the PS4/XBone generation that caused a great deal of negative feedback from consumers. People didn&apos;t like it because it was very glitchy and had many technical issues.
<br>
<br>The same thing happened with another of Ubisoft&apos;s titles, Assassin&apos;s Creed: Unity. What is speculated is that the feedback for Unity was so poor the next game in that series, Assassin&apos;s Creed: Syndicate, got worse sales as a result - though it could also be attributed to people getting sick of having so many titles in that series as well. Unfortunately, it&apos;s clear as day that Watch Dogs 2 received poor reception due to the original game&apos;s poor initial release.
<br>
<br>Watch Dogs 2&apos;s release doesn&apos;t have the glaring issues that the original game had. It&apos;s a fun game, but like many other of Ubisoft&apos;s open-world titles, has a bit of a &quot;collectathon&quot; feel with the many kinds of optional side content you can do. The game has its own set of main characters and does indeed continue the plot laid out in the original Watch Dogs.
<br>
<br>I can see that Ubisoft wanted this game to have a more relaxed feel. But, I feel that compromises the plot. The original game actually did have a very lengthy narrative - probably of a similar length to Grand Theft Auto 5. I remember, just from the storyline alone, you could spend 20-30 hours alone.
<br>
<br>The storyline of the original Watch Dogs, to me at least, felt epic with you taking down several company leaders and even getting backstabbed by a few of your friends - I was genuinely surprised by the time I reached the game&apos;s ending. The expansion pack, Bad Blood, even wrapped up the story of one of the antagonists who had escaped the plot of the original game.
<br>
<br>This game is a bit shorter that the original, but it doesn&apos;t have that same feeling of ambitiousness. This game likes to joke around a lot, almost needlessly. Think of it like Borderlands, but not quite to that extreme. Actually, the change between Watch Dogs and Watch Dogs 2 is exactly like the change between Saints Row 2 and Saints Row 3 - the plot having a much less serious tone and the gameplay introducing many simplifications.
<br>
<br>The gameplay has been simplified greatly and the number of hacking puzzles where you have to rotate hacking nodes has been significantly reduced. There are many &quot;apps&quot; you can use on your character&apos;s phone that make the game much more easy and less repetitive. For example, you can call cars to your location and you can also fast travel to shops on the map. These are good things to me because they are a new standard for open-world games of this gaming generation and make the game a great deal more convenient.
<br>
<br>I feel that this title didn&apos;t do enough to differentiate itself from the original. It somewhat feels like Far Cry: Primal - you know, a game that might&apos;ve done better if it was an expansion, rather than a standalone new title in a series. Like the many other titles that Ubisoft has published within the last few generations, this game uses similar UI and gameplay features like its other open-world games, and if you&apos;re anything like me you&apos;re probably starting to see the trend and get a bit tired of it.
<br>
<br>Though there were changes in gameplay elements, a lot of the game just feels like the original and even after a few hours, I found myself getting bored from playing this, even though the original came out over two years ago.
<br>
<br>The original was the first of its kind with all of its hacking and puzzle elements, and you&apos;d see people sharing funny images of the data your character can see about the random pedestrians in the game. But this game really doesn&apos;t bring anything new to the table, and you hardly hear people talking about it or sharing videos like the original game. People, though a bit disappointed, were still very intrigued by the game&apos;s unique hacking system and its first implementation in an open-world style game.
<br>
<br>This title certainly does have a new and interesting plot, but that can really only take a game so far. It was quite risky for Ubisoft to produce a sequel to the original game, and unfortunately it seems that the sales didn&apos;t meet their expectations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6854706">Expand</a></span>

You don&apos;t need to use anything other than the stun gun and the gadgets to beat it, there are guns in it but actually not using them makes the game more fun and the story and characters make more sense that way. Performance-wise, you will need to tinker with the options a bit to get it to run smoothly, because some of them completely murder the framerate. On my 4790k/16g ram/gtx 1080 I had to turn down Extra Details to 30%, Nvidia specific shadows off and not go full ham on the AA to get it to stay above 60 on 1080p (everything else on Ultra, including the Ultra texture pack).
<br>
<br>The online interactions are fun but unfortunately a bit buggy, for example I was solving some kind of circuitry puzzle, another player joined my game and I was no longer able to interact with the puzzle. I had to boot him by exiting the game and reloading, and then the puzzle worked again. A few moments later I joined a co-op mission and the other player was afk, so we both just stood there, while the game would not let me abandon the mission, because you need the other player&apos;s permission (??) to do that, so once again I had to exit to the main menu and reload the game.
<br>
<br>A few frustrating moments aside, it&apos;s a fun game, which has already been discounted quite heavily, so it&apos;s definitely worth a buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6906162">Expand</a></span>

<br>don&apos;t try to escape by hiding inside a large bush or behind some stuff like you could do in GTA 5 - even if nobody saw you going there, they just know where you are, run to your position and shoot you, even if there is 0% line of sight,
<br>
<br>When you send the police to arrest someone, they usually just end up walking against a wall on their way back to the police car,
<br>
<br>and so much more on.
<br>
<br>Yes the game has fun parts when it comes to the hacking or spying on others, and the story and characters are a little bit more likable then in your usual &quot;We totally know that young people think is cool!&quot;-Ubisoft game.
<br>
<br>But you just can&apos;t enjoy this, because you will constantly be frustrated by Ubisoft either having no clue about good game design, programming and quality management, or simply not caring about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6967317">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Different Story and Place

<br>
<br>You get praised for completing a mission killing civilians that has nothing to do with the mission just as if you do it without touching anyone, and the group was supposed to be some teenage hackers trying to change things on the city.... it just doesn&apos;t make sense for me.
<br>
<br>If you are going to keep it that way and give the two options at least, i think this is a step forward from the original, but I&apos;m not sure if it turns the game better than the prequel or not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6885660">Expand</a></span>

<br>Are you some kind retarded Ubisoft? I guess you are because you have not had one good game in years.

<br>
<br>If you approach this game with distance and open arms for it&apos;s parody of &quot;group of hackers&quot; theme and won&apos;t take it seriously, you will have lots of fun.
<br>
<br>The best things in my opinion are references to pop culture, games and movies, and every crew member that seem like cool geek and not some grey guy with depression like in first Watch Dogs.
<br>
<br>The technical side of the game is also pretty good, as far as I am concerned I have not encountered any bugs (except not working multiplayer that was a major problem shortly after release of the game).
<br>
<br>It may not be a competition for GTA series, but it&apos;s definitely worth checking out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6902394">Expand</a></span>

<br>**** Optimization for PC
<br>-Similar NPC&apos;s Faces it kills Immersion
<br>-They made it resemble GTAV :
<br>-Similar hack locations it feels boring with time
<br>
<br>** I like it, but it has horrible optimization it drops to 41~48fps while driving a car with Titan X Pascal SLI on 4K?! As usual from Ubisoft they continue to provide the worst optimization.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6873511">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Hell, I was surprisingly enchanted by the game. In a myriad of game titles that was released as a garbage port in PC, Watch_Dogs 2 improvement was pretty apparent. PC only features, multiple graphical settings, and a constant 60+ FPS even on the highest setting. Ubisoft has clearly learned from their mistake on the first title and has given the treatment and care their PC crowd wanted.
<br>
<br>The game itself was alright. Marcus Holloway is a completely different opposite than Aiden Pierce in character, story, and the way they approach their problems. In a way, these fits nicely as WD2 was a cheerier version of WD. When Aiden was dealing with grief and loss, Marcus and his colorful crew was just trying to fight the big brothers. Cliche sure? doesn&apos;t make it any less interesting.
<br>
<br>Not to mention Ubisoft finally managed to gather together a crew you get attached with. I mean sure, all of them are to the extreme spectrum of comical, but you couldn&apos;t help to think if that was indeed how the younger generation in San Francisco reacts. In fact, they managed to make the dialogues interesting that I couldn&apos;t help and laugh with their interactions.
<br>
<br>One last thing to touch is the gameplay. There are improvements and there are a step backwards. For once, Marcus&apos;s hack power is less powerful and sophisticated than Aiden. Most  of the time, you have to accomplish your mission via stealth as Marcus could not as much punishment as Aiden could. This fits the them as while Aiden was a highly trained Fixer, Marcus was simply a 22 years old kid with an above average athletic ability. Furthermore, while Aiden&apos;s hack power bend the Chicago CTOS to his will, Marcus&apos; power lies more in his ability to create distraction and move between walls with his new NetHack power. They both have their own strength and weaknesses, but I do think Aiden is a better hacker in gameplay especially during car chase and escape.
<br>
<br>Speaking of car chase, I feel like driving is worst in the second one as I found it harder to escape from chase like I did with Aiden. Maybe that also due to the fact that Aiden was highly trained.
<br>
<br>I enjoyed the game, but you might wanna wait till a sale unless you really really loved the first Watch_Dogs. It&apos;s a great game. Was it a perfect game? far from it. Did I had fun with it? Absolutely.
<br>
<br>That&apos;ll do Ubisoft, that&apos;ll do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6871790">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Wow, this game really surprised me. The first one was mediocre and underdelivered. The second one redeems the series with humor, graphics, and gameplay. It was a super fun game from start to finish for about 30 hours. I would definitely recommend it over Assassin&apos;s Creed or Far Cry. And if you can push it to ultra (like on a 1080ti), oh my does it look gorgeous.</span>

                                        <span>Excellent game, superb PC port. It&apos;s so great to play a game that KNOWS WHAT IT WANTS TO BE! If you liked the Kingsman movie, you&apos;ll love this. It&apos;s a bit over-the-top, but not Saint&apos;s Row levels. It truly is an ode to geekdom and internet culture. Absolutely sublime game. Story DLC expensive, but adds a lot and is IMO well worth it. Ridiculous, but amazing.</span>

There is none. The physics are mediocre, and sometimes wall climbing is bugged. The characters in the story interact in interesting ways...until they don&apos;t. They just stop, like there was no time to end their story. Even the main quest ends abruptly, i was expecting a couple more quests before the final one.
<br>This is a step in the right direction, but when the direct competitor is GTA5 and the bar was set so, so high almost 3 years ago, you can&apos;t sell a game that compares more to GTA4 and expect people not to notice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7178153">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story overall while better than the original is horribly uneven. You have the choice of peacefully resolving issues with stealth but you can also be a one man killing machine. Wiping out hundreds of people and bombing buildings. Regardless of which way you play there&apos;s no reaction by the protagonist or the rest of the team. They still crack jokes and consider themselves the righteous good guys even after you&apos;ve just murdered a bunch of security guards on a college campus.
<br>
<br>The single player experience gets dull and repetitive after a while.

<br>- many ways to accomplish the missions
<br>- the bank van attacks offer epic moments when chased by police
<br>- San Francisco and the Silicon Valley are entertaining places
<br>- the jumper and the quadricopter are great ideas
<br>- many hacking possibilities
<br>- living city, NPCs
<br>- many activites : sailing...
<br>- the best graphics : high resolution textures awesome in 4K, many details, inspired city tags, long-range visibility,  awesome weather (rain, fog), enjoyable tourist places to visit, It is really a pleasure to walk around
<br>- well-optimized : it is the first game to use the CPU cores efficiently : my 5960X overlcoked at 4500 Mhz is used at 60 % and at 80 % in a few places. SLI works great too.
<br>- mulitplayer included in the solo story
<br>- many hours : about 90 hours for every single mission and a few multi ones.
<br>
<br>Cons :
<br>- no manual saves
<br>- bad crouching movement : you can be crouched only by using the cover movement. If you no longer want to use the cover movement technique, you are no longer crouching.
<br>
<br>The best open-world game, better than Watch Dogs 1, GTA IV and V.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/watch-dogs-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7335397">Expand</a></span>
