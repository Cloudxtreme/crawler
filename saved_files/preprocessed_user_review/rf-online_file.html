Can&apos;t say i&apos;m surprised that a korean mmo is a grind-fest. If you want to grind play RO it is a much better game, Zero real quests, no story to be seen. The game feels the same as it did in beta, nothing was changed. The chat filter is horrible, the chat system all together is horrible. The kill/quest system is bad also, it only awards the kill to the person who got the final blow, so in your party you have to kill the same mobs exponentially compared to the number of people in your group. Of course we can&apos;t forget the potions! This game is a potion spam fest, you literally have to AKF mine all night to be able to afford the potions for the next day of leveling or grinding PTs. Last but not least is the killstealing, (just like any other korean mmo) is highly irritating. People can snipe your quest mobs off by a well timed hit and steal the entire mob you spent 100k on potions to kill. There is one final thing, thats the lack of skills. As a ranger you have 1 attack skill till 30.. Yes 1! 2 buff skills and thats it for 30 levels. Talk about boring. I recommend you not play this game unless you are an avid grinder, go pick up EQ1/2 or Guildwars they are both better games. Not to mention this game is $15 a month! $15 for this game should be a crime!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rf-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=385743">Expand</a></span>

I like the Sci-Fi/fantasy mix (cf the run-of-the-mill medieval/trolls and orcs type fantasy). The user interface gets a bit of getting used to (and understanding) at first but grows on you. Yes it&apos;s a bit of a grind, but then it&apos;s better than getting to a high level quickly and then sitting around thinking &quot;what do I do now&quot;. The chip wars are a neat idea, and the control for the mine, mining, quests, and battle dungeons (as well as levelling up) mean there is always something to do. The different races give a good twist to things with the Bellato &quot;Mechs&quot; (MAUs), and the different weapons and skills (and trying to level up whilst avoiding gimping your character) a more complex and involved challenge than other MMOs. Many other MMOs tend to be more one player playing individually amongst thousands, and you can do this, or group up in a guild or even as a race to get a different perspective and type of game. Its not an &quot;instant gratification&quot; MMO, and maybe more of a sophisticated/acquired taste than WoW but that&apos;s no bad thing for those who want something different. Just because it&apos;s not WoW doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rf-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=386116">Expand</a></span>

And as usual, Korean games got bad coding (client side) and a lot of grapic glitches. No kind of physics, even the jump is animated 100%. I bought it and thats the most stupid thing i have ever done. Go out and buy Auto Assault or World of Warcraft, RF just isn&apos;t play able.</span>

<br>If you require any of the play styles i stated above and love PVP or RVR whatever you want to call it. going into pvp/RVR with a unconfortable keyboard setup is pretty much a a waste of time... you end game would be to go to RVR land just to die!!!!!!!

<br>stay away from this game.

While the skill caps are class/level based, you choose the skills you want to train. There are no healing/support classes, each class has a set of buffs (some usable on others) and potions for healing. Upgrade options - you can upgrade every weapon or piece of armor with a variety of abilibities. PvP - The pvp portion of the game is the center of attention. This why you will keep playing. The chip wars occur every 8 hours, and inbetween there is a lot of oppertunity to fight eachother. Cons: Repetitive gamplay - you only have a small number of skills that level up as you use them. Depending on your personality type this can get boring. Quests - They are instant receive, instant reward kill tasks. Very little depth/ World - It&apos;s not very large, a lot of reused monster models, few dungeons. Overall - It&apos;s enjoyable if you don&apos;t mind hack and slash style gameplay. It not a deep game, but there is something staisfying about designing the type of character you want. There are a lot of options with the class and cross class skills, choosing which skills to develop and seeing how it works in PvP. If you don&apos;t mind the grinding, and like to war with other players you&apos;ll enjoy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rf-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=385857">Expand</a></span>

It isn&apos;t a game for the faint hearted and will require alot of personal time to progress through it. It&apos;s not for WOW fans and is very raw but the core gameplay is extremely fun and engaging.</span>

The game plays identically to free alternatives such as Kal Online and FlyFF as well as other alternatives like Rose Online. There is a complete lack of pathfinding, poor localization (the game asked me to install the Chinese text pack to play properly), and there isn&apos;t even a competent word wrap. The world is tiny and cramped with a multitude of players fighting over the same spawning grounds. The art style is boring (ie. same as all the other Korean MMORPGs) and the character models have nil in the variety department. Monster, character, and place names are as if someone pounded on the keyboard and added vowels where needed. There is a complete lack of physics and the quests are monotonous &quot;kill X number of Y monster&quot;. RF Online is a true step backwards in the MMORPG genre. Ultima Online has more technical competence and variety, and it is 10 years old.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rf-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=387202">Expand</a></span>

Like i say back then its your choice but first dont take my word for granted just play games to check them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rf-online/user-reviews?user_review_id=394146">Expand</a></span>
