<br>The progression system is fair and interesting and while I&apos;m not a big fan of permadeath games (roguelike), I don&apos;t find it annoying in Sublevel Zero. After my ship blows up it still feels like progress as I learn from my mistakes and unlock new gear, and take on a different play style in the next play-through.

<br>Highly recommended for those that gamed in the early 90s</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sublevel-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=5815242">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The ships however are not different enough - the ammo system is rather annoying ... cause i had the feeling that you simply ran out of ammo sooner or later (for some reason the auto-replenish never seems to work sufficiently for me)
<br>
<br>The stage design is procedurally generated (or rather - it is randomized at the level start out of rather large set pieces). The cores/reactors are rather lame (yes, i am not a fan of that feature - but it is better than Descents &quot;run for the exit in limited time, which i hated&quot;)
<br>
<br>UI and controls are crisp and precise - hit detection however is a bit wonky - as the gunship seems to eat a lot more bullets than expected. Especially the map and orientation is well done (a feature often messed up in similar games) - but then .. the dungeons are not really too complex (no where NEAR as complex as Descent)
<br>
<br>The game does not offer a native 4:3 resolution - the closest thing it offers is windowed mode - or stretched fullscreen. (a big minus for that - cause even if the game - according to the devs - is meant to be played widescreen... which i understand ... they should at least offer a letterbox)
<br>
<br>All in all the game is average - well worth the money, but it does not quite revitalize the 6 direction genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sublevel-zero/user-reviews?user_review_id=5547153">Expand</a></span>
