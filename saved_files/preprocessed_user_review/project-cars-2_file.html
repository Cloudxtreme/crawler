<br>
<br>Excellent game.
<br>The only one issue that I encounter now is a bug when it just doesn&apos;t count laps :) It was once, and got fixed by a return back to lobby and enter session again. It was once after about 12 hours of gameplay.
<br>
<br>Also a little issue with AI, it&apos;s still non-aggressive and too safe from time to time. If you just brake in the middle of the corner in rallycross, for example, there is no chance they will find a way to overtake you. In circuits, though the situation is way better.
<br>But for Rallycross, Codemasters AI is way better in overtaking, and in finding an alternative apex to pass you using not only default line but a crossing one. So in Rallycross, AI is quite weak comparing to Dirt Rally/ Dirt 2/3.
<br>
<br>What about handling? It feels way better than in pCars 1, FFB defaults are good (I have Logitech G29) settings options are good too. UI/UX improved a lot, explanations for every single setting in car setup menu is very helpful, knowing very little I can do some neat changes which help me a bit. But engineer hints are quite meh. Better they create a simplify setup like in Dirt Rally, and keep advanced for hardcore guys :)
<br>
<br>Simulation is perfect. It&apos;s the best simulation so far for so many surfaces and cars etc. Driving in Rain and trying to avoid pools of water because of weak grip and aquaplaning on them is an amazing experience. You really see it, and you really feel it when you drive through it.
<br>
<br>Career mode improved a lot, better UI/UX still few useless features such as e-mails, etc. :) Number of events, cars, achievements, etc. is compelling. You can have a break from your current tournament to have some fun with other activities with old classics etc. at any time.
<br>
<br>Finally, you can change your setup in the menu while you are in the race :D Sounds funny, but it was impossible in pCars 1 :)
<br>
<br>And at the end of the day. Graphics and sounds are delightful, optimisation is somewhat good and will be better in the future for sure like it was with pCars 1.
<br>
<br>Impact physics is WAY better than it was before. No longer glitches and flying around the track for tiny touches etc.
<br>
<br>Online mode with licenses etc. must be a SUPERB feature, didn&apos;t try it yet. But pretty sure it&apos;s good.
<br>
<br>Highly recommend to all fans of the Autosimulators. It&apos;s a must-have!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7562814">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Let me start by saying I&apos;m a big fan of racing games - especially simcades. My favourites include Forza Motorsport and Project Gotham Racing, but also DiRT Rally. I&apos;ve always played these games with a controller, but I decided to take the plunge into more serious simulation territory, so I got a Logitech G920 and when I played Project Cars 2 at a gaming convention with a controller, despite having all assists on and automatic, it felt really good. So now having bought the game and tried it with a wheel, I don&apos;t feel I need to play any longer than a couple of hours to give my impressions on this game.
<br>
<br>First of all, let&apos;s talk graphics. Even on a modest GTX 1060 6GB OC&apos;d, I&apos;m managing a very consistent 65 FPS at 1440p on High detail with Ultra textures. I was skeptical of how well this would run, especially compared to Forza Motorsport and whilst it doesn&apos;t look as good as Forza in any department (at least for the same performance target), it&apos;s still not too shabby.
<br>
<br>Next, I&apos;d like to emphasize how complete this game feels; which I believe is perhaps the game&apos;s greatest strength. The options menus have nothing missing. There is an audio slider (0-100) for everything, every button is rebindable, every aspect of just about anything is customisable. You can even customise your HUD, making it as minimal or detailed as possible and even change the position of all the elements. The game&apos;s difficulty can also be fine-tuned. Unlike most games which offer the usual &quot;On/Off&quot; for things like ABS and traction control, this game has an &quot;authentic&quot; setting, which matches whatever the car has in real life. The AI difficulty can be adjusted literally on a 120-point scale, and there&apos;s even a 100-point scale for their level of aggression. Even better, all these settings can be adjusted almost any time, and you aren&apos;t punished for making the game too easy; nor are you forced to commit to a particular difficulty.
<br>
<br>As for the knitty-gritty details of controls, Project Cars 2 has almost everything you need, but unlike other games it doesn&apos;t force any complexity on you. The slider for adjusting deadzones and sensitivity are well-documented and fairly intuitive. Aside from the notoriously stiff brakes on my G920 setup, I didn&apos;t need to adjust much aside from reducing the deadzones from the default. Regarding force-feedback, this is what I spent a lot of time trying to get right. Iny my opinion, the defaults are far from ideal. The problem is that surface detail is too exaggerated and the effect of self-aligning torque is too strong. Whilst there&apos;s no option for self-aligning torque, I eventually got used to it. After all, Project Cars 2 is aiming for a simulation experience and so it takes time to learn the game and adapt, especially if you&apos;re new to using a wheel and/or sim racing. The cars can be tuned to a mesmerising level of detail; onj par if not more than the  Forza games and original DiRT. Thankfully however, the game offers an engineer which can help you decide what needs tweaking depending on your driving needs if you don&apos;t know anything about how a car works.
<br>
<br>Finally, I&apos;d like to round off with the value proposition. Project Cars 2 may not have the 700+ cars of Forza Motorsport 7 or the best graphics or any customisation of cars - either performance-wise or aesthetics. But as a long-time Forza fan, I decided to buy this game because it offers twice as many tracks. Furthermore, the cars on offer are cars that you&apos;d actually want to drive and are made for the track. Whilst Forza is a better all-rounder, Project Cars 2 is clearly a game made by a team who are passionate about delivering a great driving experience, and to me that matters more in the long run than customising cars. The passion and effort that&apos;s gone into this game is clearly apparent. To me, this game is to track racing games what DiRT Rally is to rally games.
<br>
<br>I really liked Slightly Mad Studios&apos; previous games - particularly Ferrari Racing Legends and Need for Speed SHIFT / SHIFT 2; not only for their amazing driving feel but also for that signature helmet cam, which I&apos;m glad has made it into this game. The amount of content and variety is nothing less than what you&apos;d expect from a great racing game. The driving is unlike any other game I&apos;ve ever played. Never have I had to think so much when the track is wet, never have I had to be careful with going full throttle in a straight line. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because I&apos;m playing with a wheel or it&apos;s the game&apos;s physics, but it&apos;s definitely an intense and immersive driving experience - especially as there&apos;s no rewind feature.
<br>
<br>Overall, despite feeling somewhat uneasy about getting this over Forza Motorsport 7 at first, I feel that the work that&apos;s gone into it and the vision of the developers to deliver the ultimate driving experience makes it a must-have if you&apos;re passionate about racing game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7553704">Expand</a></span>

PC2 has the best physics of any racing sim I&apos;ve ever played. Additionally, the career mode is full of stuff to do, the cars look and sound great, and the track list is one of the best I&apos;ve ever seen.</span>

<br>
<br>I started this game with high hopes, I enjoyed project cars 1. However, i just cannot get over how bad the control set up is for controllers, you have to have some sort of driver assists on if you want to get round a track in once piece. Turn everything off and you WILL constantly spin out on vehicles for the slightest twitch on the accelerator coming out of the corner.
<br>
<br>With traction control off, abs low and stability control on you will probably make it round the track in one piece, but it feels awful and unrealistic to drive. I&apos;ve read many of the glowing reviews elsewhere and the theme seems to be these people have a driving wheels and VR, i&apos;m sorry but you shouldn&apos;t have to spend &#xA3;150+ on peripheries just to get an enjoyable experience.
<br>
<br>Also, i&apos;m sick of all these nuts claiming people complaining about handling to &quot;git gud&quot;. I&apos;m sorry just because a game is hard doesn&apos;t make it good, a driving sim is meant to emulate real life, not make it absurdly difficult and cause you to spin out a track car on perfect weather condition with the slightest twitch on the accelerator.  Check out the console reviews for this game to see what other people think of the controller set up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7577781">Expand</a></span>

<br>Side note:
<br>Forgive the negative reviews from some &apos;racing enthusiasts&apos;  they&apos;ve had their dreams of being Ricky Bobby shattered after attempting to push beyond their abilities in PCARS2 and getting their ass handed to them backwards.  They have decided to return where they can comfortably drift in their socks.

<br>
<br>You&apos;ve got multiple disciplines like Rallycross, Formula, GT, Karts, Le Mans, Nascar, with authentic rules, pit stop strategy, tuning setups, time progression, and weather change. Realistic damage and mechanical failures, realistic tire wear and fuel use. Detailed cars and tracks, awesome sound effects, deep tuning and extensive career.
<br>
<br>First, it&apos;s got great amount of tracks (Although I miss Suzuka and Tsukuba). Every track has night and day cycle and weather effects (Not like &quot;one track has night racing and the other has rain&quot;). LiveTrack 3.0 is just awesome, tracks look so different in the morning, day and night, and in different weather. Time scale can be set to real-time or accelerated and weather effects can mirror real weather at current time. Tracks look more dynamic and alive compared to Forza or GT. When you select track you even got presets for different kind of motorsports (GT, Formula, etc) which helps with authenticity. And of course you got rules, flags and pit stops. And the game gives you a LOT of freedom, you can use summer tires on the ice track, or drive the Nordschleife in winter, or rallycross in Lamborghini Huracan.
<br>
<br>AI - it needs some work. Currently it is very jerky. AI cars steer rapidly left and right, and they frequently bump into you.
<br>
<br>Physics model is WAY better than the first Project CARS, but still a bit behind Assetto Corsa. It is good, way better than, say, Forza, but there is still room for improvement. It is perfectly playable right now, but you can still spot not so realistic behavior.
<br>
<br>Sound is great, you can hear tire rolling sounds, wind and wipers on the screen, sand bouncing off wheel arches, gravel and water, and some cars (like Jaguar F-Type SVR) have BEAUTIFUL exhaust notes. Sound is nuanced and immersive. For example tire squeal sound depends on type of tire, angle and speed of slide. But some cars just have the wrong engine sound. For example, Toyota GT86 sounds like it has a V8 with straight pipes.
<br>
<br>Car roster is large, but it consists mainly of race cars, formula cars or race tuned road cars. It&apos;s lacking some iconic road cars like Mazda RX-7, Toyota Supra, etc. It is my main complaint right now, but maybe they&apos;ll add more cars in a future DLC.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s all I have to complain about, otherwise Slightly Mad Studios got it right in every aspect. I didn&apos;t think it can be possible to get adult sim like this, without any compromises, without all the simcade inclination. I used to be a Forza guy, but this is my new favorite. GT and Forza have some catching up to do.
<br>
<br>Project CARS 2 has come a long way since first NFS Shift and I loved the dedication and attention to details that SMS had put into their games, but I just couldn&apos;t bear the physics. So now has come the time to enjoy all of the work over the years, as the physics model is just right this time.

<br>Even with it&apos;s current flaws it gets a 9 from me. If the AI get really good I&apos;d give it a 9.5+ but the decimals isn&apos;t possible here. So I stick with my 9.

<br>
<br>There is alot of potential here but it just missed the mark on too many levels.  I hear praise about the physics but take one of these cars out on the track and you will find even basic physics quite different.  The selection of vehicles and lack of customization hurts more than anything and when tuning a vehicle it doesn&apos;t always behave as it should.
<br>
<br>The visuals are good but glitchy at times and not very well optimized unless you are on the 10 series of Nvidia hardware or the Vega series from AMD but based on their visual quality previous generations of gpus should be fine...just look at the console version.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m also quite offended that Ian Bell the head of SMS literally bought off websites for good coverage.  Don&apos;t believe me?  Go to PRC.net and look through the articles.  Ian Bell pays off anyone he can so unless it&apos;s a big site like Eurogamer then chances are the review isn&apos;t exactly honest.  He does the same with YouTubers and then we have the people who work at SMS that run out to various forums and sites like this to post positive coverage.
<br>
<br>That doesn&apos;t count against my score but it should.
<br>
<br>Skip this and wait for something better... trust me it won&apos;t be hard to find.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7554570">Expand</a></span>

While I appreciate the realism in the game, I just wanna take this 69 Camaro on the track and go HAM!!!!

I&apos;m not going to say this game is bad cuz it isn&apos;t I&apos;m just not used to all this extra s***. I definitely recommend it for people who like simulations but I think I&apos;m going to stick to more of an arcade style like Need for Speed or Forza or even Gran Turismo coming out next month.

I tried to map gear controls to the correct pad settings, non stop errors to say key is already binded. Even after changing the binded key the error persists. Proceed to try out a quick race with auto gears, driving a McLaren supercar. It feels like driving a boat into a harbour. All the talk about the realism of this game, I just don&apos;t see it. It plays so slow, no excitement from acceleration, just doesn&apos;t engage even in POV camera. Codemasters have clearly set the bar for how driving games should play. Dirt Rally is still the most realistic driving sim available. Definitely avoid this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7554276">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you want to be able to just jump in a car and blindly select a track and win a race, best stick to forza or need for speed or something; this game is best when you spend the 30 mins practice race learning the track and perfecting every turn and brake point, and the 15 or 20 min qualifier refining your lap times, then you are set up and in the groove and the 10 min final races are a true pleasure.
<br>
<br>This is a true racing sim, it takes patience and practice to nail each car and track, but when you do, and you are just perfectly apexing each corner and watching the competition fall further and further behind, it is exhilarating and fun and extremely satisfying.
<br>
<br>A good pc and steering wheel helps too obviously.
<br>Also has run flawlessly so far on my pc and looks amazing at 4k.
<br>If you like real racing, get it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7550736">Expand</a></span>

I new that what they were trying to do is translate a comprehensive and scientifically accurate (or close thereto) representation of real world racing. You could feel that in the remote and the way the car handled, it wasnt just a difficulty level that made it hard to drive.
<br>
<br>So I started paying attention to action and reaction and to my surprise I started understanding the car more, the track, the conditions, the weather, and how it all translates differently to every car on every track. I realised that This game will be one of learning.
<br>
<br>I dubbed this the &quot;Dark Souls&quot; of racing and wanted to learn more and master every car. I realised that a remote simply wasn&apos;t encompassing the full experience, and if so, would there be more if I were to buy a racing wheel? So I bought one and MAN did this game come alive. On a Decent mid ranged wheel (Logitec G9200) I started playing around with gameplay settings, Force feedback and weather conditions and now I am properly hooked.
<br>
<br>Props to Slightly Mad. They did their best to translate the physics to a remote and I think people arent realising what I did and are finding it difficult. This is a game of learining and mastering and time spent in practice and experimentation will reward you with skill. THIS is what makes it the most authentic racer. The experience. Not the physics, not the true-to life representations of the tracks and the cars, not the multiplayer and not the awesome campaign. But the experince. One of real world difficulty and learning to drive a supercar to its maximum threshold. Mastering a corner, a track you&apos;re having problems with. Realising why different cars react different ways. It is a real world EXPERIENCE that is the best part of this game. Also props to the racing engineer system. IF you dont understand tuning then this is a great way to tune and learn at the same time. Super easy.
<br>
<br>There are a lot of issues though....
<br>
<br>There are issues with the Logitech G920 Driving force and G29 with FFB profiles and wheel locks.
<br>
<br>The AI. Sometimes they just smack in to the back of you if you&apos;re too slow off the launch. or if you approach the first corner.
<br>
<br>There are track issues with FFB and grip on some of the loose surface tracks. Mercedes A45 AMG on Dirtfish Blizzard I&apos;m looking at you.
<br>
<br>Sometimes the game crashes at silly moments.
<br>
<br>Online play system is good, License points and ranks support respectful play, although VERY few people actually care and still messaround, love tap you out the way, rear end you on the first corner.  There should be bans for a certain amount of kicks Honestly.
<br>
<br>All this aside. This is possibly the most I&apos;ve ever been into a racer. Yes the studio deserves your money. The game, and you, deserve patience in learning the game. Once you have that and you learn, you will respect this game and what Slightly Mad has done.
<br>
<br>I am a long time racing fan. I&apos;ve played numerous F1, GRID, NFS (Shift), GT and Forza titles, This is the pinnacle of the racing genre for this decade. I&apos;ll be impressed to see an improvement made on this. The issues I&apos;ve mentioned above are simply balancing issues. And this will of course be patched with time. One thing I am slightly angry at. Is the fact that the Season pass does not cover you for all DLC. The Japanese car pack still needs to be paid for. What is the reason for the Pass then? This nickel and diming is something that EA does. Slightly Mad, You made the Shift series. But dont keep EA&apos;s business ethic please.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7641939">Expand</a></span>

This game is an absolute DREAM with a proper FFB wheel. Absolutely stunning. The AI needs a bit of work, but it&apos;s very tune-able and you can dial it in to your liking. I want to give this game an 8.5 but I&apos;ll give it a 9 to offset the haters. And speaking of haters...all of you...go buy even a cheap FFB wheel like a $200 Thrustmaster TMX and try this game out...then come back here and tell me it isn&apos;t fun.
