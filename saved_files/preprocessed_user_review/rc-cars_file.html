By jumping, you can avoid a lot of the little obstacles that would otherwise make some tracks frustratingly difficult. It&apos;s also nice to have turbos at your disposal rather than built onto the track. You will have to practice single races before entering a cup competition because you have to know where the checkpoints are to be able to keep up in the race. If you ever have to &quot;reset&quot; back to a checkpoint, you&apos;re pretty much out of the race. Graphics are quite nice. What&apos;s there is enough to make it seem real and to keep you entertained for some time. You get a cheap thrill out of ramming people in the feet just to hear their reactions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rc-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=374652">Expand</a></span>
