It&apos;s also pretty close to Wasteland 2 though you only control 1 character. If you liked Fallout 2, Wasteland 2, Divinity Original Sin, XCom games or Jagged Alliance 2 then you will likely enjoy this game, too. Actually, this game is better than Fallout 2. Gee, did I say that? Yes, I did.
<br>
<br>The good:
<br>- a huge world to explore with a great atmosphere
<br>- some excellent dialog with witty social satire later in the game
<br>- all of the loot can be used in crafting
<br>- psionic abilities offer an additional way to play thru the game (e.g. with Force Field you can create cover against ranged attackers for a turn or two, or you can even block enemies with it and escape the level)
<br>- the color of the cursor shows if opening a door or a container will anger NPCs around it (if they see you opening/hacking/lockpicking it)
<br>- already checked containers have &quot;empty&quot; word added to their tooltip
<br>
<br>The so-so:
<br>- NPCs only barter for a limited set of items (like, &quot;i&apos;ll only buy from you 3 leathers, 3 medical components, 3 weapons and nothing else&quot;). If you are a completionist (compulsively greedy looter) like myself, you&apos;ll carry all the junk around and re-check the same NPCs over and over because the list of things they want to buy randomly updates. Soon you will be swimming in money, but there isn&apos;t much to buy. Btw that guy in Core City... ROFL
<br>- the 2D art may seem a bit amateurish at start. I&apos;d even say they may need to redraw most of the character portraits with more detail to match the rest of the graphics in the game, like environment in Junkyard and Core City. Some portraits are re-used across characters (docs in Rail Crossing and Core City, and a nurse in SGS) - important characters should have had a unique portrait and everyone else maybe no portrait at all
<br>
<br>The bad (more like suggestions for the next update):
<br>- no map of zones (see below)
<br>- a bug in Force Field spell: I understand that the field should expire (disappear) after the AI has done its turn and before you do your turn - but sometimes it expires in the middle of enemy turn
<br>- in cramped locations it may be not easy to spot enemies behind walls -&gt; have to press Tab for the tooltips too often. It might be a good option to toggle display of tooltips with Tab, not just showing them while Tab is pressed
<br>- the cave walls all look like thin 1-cell thick wall, even if it&apos;s an outer wall. This might not look like a big problem, but in fact it really gives the caves this &quot;auto-generated&quot; low-budget feel, especially because there are so many cave zones in the game. Maybe the wall tiles which aren&apos;t between corridors but are between a corridor and solid rock shouldn&apos;t show any thickness and instead just show black for solid rock. Also, the walls which aren&apos;t visible to the player (looking north or west) should be shown as black space. Currently caves look more like tubes hanging in black empty space
<br>- the GUI doesn&apos;t scale for bigger monitors. The GUI elements are all pixel-crisp but look very small on 1920x1080. Also the fonts are somewhat hard to read - simple Arial or Verdana would work better
<br>
<br>About the map:
<br>Fans have already made such a map of zones on the game&apos;s wiki, but 1) it&apos;s awkward to alt+tab to those maps while playing the game, 2) some maps are not accurate which adds to the confusion, 3) seeing all those zones you haven&apos;t yet seen in the game breaks the exploration feeling during the first playthru
<br>
<br>Such a map could be shown only when you use a special &quot;Navigator&quot; item which also could be crafted and consumed batteries (per look at the map). Ideally the navigator should be able to calculate and show a path from the zone where you currently are to any other explored zone where you want to go, if a connection thru explored zones exists (should show rocks to be cleared, too).
<br>
<br>Less patient players can be turned off as soon as they get lost in the endless caves and sub-metro zones. It would be more logical if the zones would fit into a grid, like in JA2 - this would also make the map much easier to draw and present - as the current fans&apos; map in the wiki stretches and bends lines to fit it all in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/underrail/user-reviews?user_review_id=5898386">Expand</a></span>

Beautiful variety of combat options, quest resolutions, exploration, and a story that unfolds with a nice balance of exposition and in-game situations.

The oddity XP system is such a simple innovation, I wonder why it hasn&apos;t been done before. The crafting is diverse, fun, but simple. And each quest has multiple areas through. This is a fantastic game. Buy it and support a fantastic small developer.</span>

It does however have some pretty frustrating features or oversights that are typical of old-school games, such as massively time-consuming inventory management / trading, difficulty spikes, no map and often vague quest notes, etc. etc.. Part of what makes the game appealing is trying to find ways to overcome these obstacles, but not everyone will be up for that.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re worried about the graphics, don&apos;t be: they are good enough to never be distracting. I particularly like the character sprites which are well animated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/underrail/user-reviews?user_review_id=5920431">Expand</a></span>

I put it away for now, &apos;coz after 40h I had enough. Strongest part is definitely the story which unfolds slowly and become more, and more twisted. Side quests are not bad, but mostly kind of &quot;go somewhere&quot;, &quot;get something&quot; and &quot;kill something&quot; etc. Not much of variety here. Not many memorable NPCs either, except the few guys from the very beginning. This can make you feel isolated, uninterested in &quot;listen&quot; to their conversations or helping them coz you simply don&apos;t care. I didn&apos;t feel i can make any impact on the world. Maybe ending will reward me in this aspect, but it is not only about the endings list right? What else. Lack of world map. This is a big no-no for me. Its doesnt make game hardcore, its just problematic. Journal entries could be more specified. After a few days break when you come back to game you may find yourself completely out of track. Another thing is there is too many (claustrophobic) areas for exploration with no story behind it. Makes you wonder is it really necessary for me to be here? (and again, no map doesnt help) And did i say about unbalanced difficulty? Game can be very unfair. At level 25 i still have no chance to beat some group of enemies. They deal crazy amount of damage, stun you, poison you, put you in flames. So i sneak and i&apos;m glad i&apos;ve invested in stealth, otherwise i don&apos;t think i could finish some parts of the game at all. So yeah, aside of story, which is very, very interesting and addictive, and few decent side quests, it was very rough and emptyish experience. Great character creations and build possibilities though (but crafting seems to be usles).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/underrail/user-reviews?user_review_id=5979939">Expand</a></span>

That has some truth in it, but with some caveats. Underrail takes the post-apocalyptic atmosphere and perks of FO1 and FO2 (in Underrail they are called &#x201C;feats&#x201D;), improve the combat and exploration tenfold, but cut most of the skill checks and reactivity.
<br>The weakest aspects in the game are the writing and the quests, which represent the usual variety of kill things or delivering something to a NPC. However, even if the writing of Underrail is not stellar, at least it has a lot of personality and it&#x2019;s very immersive. I love the causal way in which NPCs talk about creatures, like rathounds and hoppers, or the different cities and stations, etc. This, accompanied with a direct presentation, makes everything in the game look like a real world.
<br>The strongest aspects of the game are the combat, the exploration and the atmosphere. The variety of builds and feats are fantastic. The crafting in this game is rivaled only by the crafting of Arcanum. There are tons of quests to do, and the tunnels and caves feel endless. The cities are great too.
<br>Overall, the game is falloutish in some aspects, but it&#x2019;s a very different game on its own and has a lot of personality. Which is good, especially if we consider how many attempts to imitate classics resulted in grotesque caricatures of great games. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Underrail is, by any reasonable standard, a new classic to be added on the pantheon of great cRPGs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/underrail/user-reviews?user_review_id=5894784">Expand</a></span>

Years, in fact - I initially purchased into the Underrail early access back in 2013.  Despite the unfinished build at that time, Underrail&apos;s brilliance was evident and brought joy to this jaded RPG lover&apos;s soul seldom found outside of those first teenage forays into the worlds of Fallout and Arcanum.
<br>
<br>You create a single character to explore Underrail&apos;s immersive underground world full of danger, competing factions and mystery.  The character generation clearly borrows from the earlier Fallout titles, using 7 ability scores, skill points and feats, the later of which are heavily gated behind ability and skill requirements.  The system feels familiar and deep enough for RPG veterans to immediately begin theorycrafting and planning character builds for subsequent playthroughs.  A PC can spend skill points in a variety of general weapon skills such as guns, crossbows or unarmed; you can eventually specialize further via feats, into a field like energy weapons, for example.  There are diplomatic, crafting and psionic skills available as well, seemingly allowing a huge variety of builds and experiences in Underrail.
<br>
<br>Underrail&apos;s combat uses a competent turn-based system utilizing action points, again similar to Fallout, or more recent releases such as Wasteland 2 and Divinity: Original Sin.  Your character build, special abilities and relatively low action point cost per ability give you a lot of options in combat.  Definitely more than standing around, taking pot shots at your opponent&apos;s eyes, anyway.  Combat on normal difficulty feels just about right after spending roughly thirty minutes with the character generator to create, what I hope will continue to be, a well functioning character.
<br>
<br>Gameplay out of combat is where Underrail really shines.  Your character build comes into play heavily when interacting with the game world.  Genre standard locked doors, computers to be hacked and pockets to be picked are everywhere, of course.  If you specialize in diplomatic skills, Underrail provides you with opportunities to apply them to turn combat situations to your favor, or avoid them entirely.  An encounter fairly early in the game allows for a handful of resolutions, from stealth, speech skills, technical skills or, of course, charging forward, guns blazing.  This type of thought and accommodation for a variety of character builds is what the RPG genre should ultimately be about, and Underrail nails it.
<br>
<br>My gripes with Underrail are few and far between, but need mentioning to validate a score of 9/10.  What most people will immediately notice are the game&apos;s rough graphics.  Character models reflect gear worn, which is a huge plus, but they don&apos;t look too great regardless.  The interface is simple and effective, but could benefit from more artistic framing, similar to Fallout or Wasteland 2.  The art direction is consistent and serviceable, but Underrail just looks dated overall, which will, unfortunately, turn many people off.   On a related note, Underrail&apos;s musical score is fantastic.  Grammar nerds will notice some issues throughout many of Underrail&apos;s branching dialogue trees.
<br>
<br>Underrail is a game literally brimming with promise and excitement.  Even despite the recent renaissance of old school computer RPGs, Underrail looks to be able to count itself among the best of them.  I have yet to complete the game, which likely won&apos;t occur for quite some time, but I have nothing but the highest of expectations for what is to come from the rest of this brilliant game.  If you are at all into this genre, you would be a fool to not pick this game up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/underrail/user-reviews?user_review_id=5889992">Expand</a></span>

I get lost roaming the rails, the caves, the tunnels, the abandoned warehouses - for no particular reason, just waiting for the next interesting encounter or nasty surprise down the road. I revel in the ambiental music, which picks up the pace smoothly when combat starts. The general theme is bizzaro-techno-cyber/steampunk depending on which area you&apos;re on. I fool you not, I had the feeling I was exploring the Hub, the Glow or some dark alley in Necropolis more often than not. There is also a strange coolness and attention to detail that usually defines everything: stylish art direction and intentional retro fitting. The gunshots have just the right kick to them, the echoes and screeching sounds in the caves are exactly the right fit. Even the neon flashes in the dump, gritty, grimy, depressing dread dystopic metro stations have the right sound to them.
<br>
<br>&quot;More often than not&quot; is the word to remember here. More often than not, Underrail gets things right; it delivers on atmosphere, combat and mechanics, exploration, inventory system, stats, skills and &quot;perks&quot; and quests. But let&apos;s not get ahead of ourselves.
<br>
<br>The highlight piece of the game (but you should know this already) is the turn based combat system. Take Fallout&apos;s combat system and reimagine it into a more complex counterpart. Add cooldowns, movement points in addition to action points, interesting cloaking and hide in shadow mechanics and we&apos;ve got a winner. To be honest, this is the most maturely developed turn-based combat system I&apos;ve seen in a while in an isometric RPG. Hats off Styg, you&apos;ve managed to outperform even established developers - Wasteland 2 for example doesn&apos;t even come close, in my view. Well, if you were to be extremely picky, you could say that a proper cover system is missing. Also, multi-level combat a la Jagged Alliance 2. Or, from the same game, ducking or going into prone positions. To Underrail&apos;s defense: remember this is not a tactical game with RPG elements (as much as it may seem at times :wink:) - but quite &quot;au contraire&quot;.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d like to say at this point that no matter what builds you&apos;ll be experimenting with, you are going to miss a lot without being at least partly invested in PSI abilities. Needless to say that mind-affecting abilities aside, those fire, ice, electricity and telekinesis attacks will just come in handy when dealing with a large variety of enemies, each packing a different flavour of resistances. The usual archetype builds you&apos;ll meet are the PSIchopath, chiller, firestarter, electronist, gunner, cutter or invisible stalker with a crossbow. Expect to meet anything in between. There are mostly two approaches when talking about defense: one, you can pack the heaviest suit of metal armor that you&apos;ll find and become essentially a tank (and try to resist almost every attack) but suffer movement, evasion and stealth penalties. Two, go as light as possible and invest in actually evading the bullets and dodging the cranium-targeted sledgehammers. By going with light armour, you&apos;ll keep your ability to be effective at stealth and make it your life&apos;s purpose to actually avoid getting hit in the first place. Now, the plus side to this approach is you&apos;ll attack first and surprise your enemies more. On the down side, expect to risk being put down by a single, well-aimed sniper rifle bullet, simply because your armour doesn&apos;t have the stopping power to withstand the mechanical impact. My views on defense are quite biased - to quote a line from a favorite game of mine, &quot;neither view is balanced, but one is less unwise&quot;.
<br>
<br>Speaking of enemies, a scavenger named Marty once told me that there be bandits around; robbers; raiders; outlaws; marauders; gangsters; criminals; crooks; thieves; railroadmen; thugs... his own words you know. Don&apos;t get me wrong; packs of rathounds, bugs, giant insects, lizards, spiders, or even robots - can be menacing in most situations, especially when they surround you or surprise you. However, *nothing* really compares to dealing with a roomful of human enemies, no matter what faction or allegiance. The fact that they can and *will* use the entire arsenal at their disposal and all the offensive capabilities that *you* yourself can, well, that makes them downright dangerous. At most times you&apos;ll have a chance to prepare for assault, which is tactical goodness right there. You can position yourself, hide in shadows or trap the room if your skill is high enough. Attacking first allows you to pick targets close together and blast them with grenades, EMP their energy shields or simply mass PSI them with fire, ice, electricity, telekinesis or mind-control abilities, instilling fear or mass enrage. Carnage is guaranteed and a lot of itemy swag will be left on the corpses, for pillaging purposes.
<br>
<br>Just pick up this piece. You&apos;ll remember it for a long while and never regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/underrail/user-reviews?user_review_id=6197286">Expand</a></span>

Honestly i haven&apos;t felt this draw to a game since fallout 2. This game punishes mistakes so hard, but rewards good tactics. The story maybe a little shallow at first but i progresses nicely.
<br>A job well done. This game proves that passion for a project is more important then money and profit.</span>

Sounds trivially, I know, but that is what I felt. You see, Fallout had a face - a dirty bearded face of a drug addict who spend most of his free time at the local brothel. In Underrail it seems like nothing happened to the world and people just suddenly decided to go underground. They don&apos;t starve, they have power and clean water, they don&apos;t die in slavery and I could continue, but I think you got my point. In Fallout 2 one locations such as New Reno provides more unique experience than the entire Underrail game. Not to mention it looks better, dispite the game is 18 years older. Again, after all what I&apos;ve said, the game is good, it just has nothing special about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/underrail/user-reviews?user_review_id=6634924">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s one of the best cRPGs in over 10 years and the closest game to Fallout 1/2 than any other game (including New Vegas). Still, it&apos;s a worse game than Age of Decadence which is the best cRPG ever (only Fallout 1 can compete).
<br>
<br>The exploration here is superb (if you think exploration in Gothic was great you should play UR, you can even blow up rubble that blocks your way and make your own passage), fights are fun and often challenging forcing you to use your brain instead of mindlessly clicking on an enemy, crafting is quite complex and well developed, character creation is well designed and allows for different builds and different playthroughs (not as good in AoD though). The plot and dialogues are decent and even though most quests are fetch/kill quests there are many very interesting ones so that the player wouldn&apos;t get bored.
<br>
<br>The game isn&apos;t without flaws of course. My main gripe with this game is that you can&apos;t run here and travelling is so slow. Due to this about half of your gameplay time will be spent on walking from point A to B. It&apos;s not as bad as in Bethesda games though where locations are bloated so that the world would seem bigger. In UR there is also a form of fast travel so after first few missions it gets much better. The other thing that annoys me is that font is too small. There are some more minor annoyances but all in all pros outweigh the cons in overwhelming proportions. Because of these cons however, I consider Age of Decadence a way better game despite the fact that Underrail is one of the best games I&apos;ve played in 10 years or so. But UR is cheaper and it has as good value for money as AoD.
<br>
<br>tl;dr
<br>This game is worth way more than it&apos;s being sold for and instead of wasting time on reading reviews just play the demo and see for yourself (same goes for Age of Decadence),</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/underrail/user-reviews?user_review_id=5952401">Expand</a></span>

La verdad es que Stygian software ha hecho un trabajo excelente con este gran juego, que m&#xE1;s que un juego es ciertamente un tributo a los clasicos juegos de Black Isle studios (especialmente a Fallout 1 y 2). Seguramente uno que cualquier jugador de rol empedernido seguramente aprobara.

<br>mainly those that grew up on things like the original fallouts, baldur&apos;s gate, planescape and other rpgs of the golden years of the 90s and early 2000s. If you enjoy challenging games and you wanted something with the post apocalyptic feel of the old fallout games then this is probably a game you will cherish. Be forewarned, this game is not a polished casual game with the type of things that are &apos;standard&apos; in modern rpgs and games in general; there is no map and you don&apos;t get your hand held through quests indicators or directions, you will be required to explore and reload many times. I&apos;ve seen many negative reviews on steam and other forums where people complained about how it was too difficult and they couldn&apos;t get past the first area or quit within the first few hours out of frustration and let me be clear; if you aren&apos;t a veteran rpg player with a good grasp of how to play a tactical turn based game then you will probably die quite a bit but imo that&apos;s what makes the game so special in an age where games are designed for the lowest common denominator and you have to purposely make a game harder manually to not steamroll through. Now that I&apos;ve said that I&apos;ll talk a bit about the setting; Underrail takes place in the distant future in an entirely underground setting where the remnants of humanity live after Earths surface is ruined. I won&apos;t go too much into the story because it&apos;s a great game and I don&apos;t want to spoil anything but there&apos;s a general lawlessness to the setting and there are many competing political movements vying for control over resources, real estate and power. What starts out as a chain of what seem to be simple fetch quests eventually spirals into a much bigger conflict and you get thrown into the middle of it. If you&apos;re someone that likes to explore and enjoys a game that allows you freedom off of a linear path then you will love this game; once you get past the &apos;tutorial&apos; area you are given near free reign to go almost anywhere in the game(at your own peril) and this game is huge, that can&apos;t be understated as a full clear could take you well over 70 hours depending on the pace you take. The character creation and customization is pretty deep and allows you to successfully pull off a wide variety of builds that include multiple weapon types and crafting. I will warn that the tutorial area at the beginning I spoke of before is designed to test the viability of your build and a strange build that isn&apos;t thought out might require a restart. The OST and the general tone/setting of the game come together well and leave a memorable impression the likes of which I haven&apos;t experienced in many years before. I could go on but I&apos;ll end it here by simply saying that if you like this type of game then this is a gem you shouldn&apos;t overlook and with such a low price for so much content you would be hard pressed to find something comparable by a modern studio.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/underrail/user-reviews?user_review_id=6985177">Expand</a></span>
