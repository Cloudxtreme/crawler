<br>Pros:

<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>1. The cards are random, so you can&apos;t even pick which cards you want to buy, leaving you with weaker cards or unable to upgrade a new tower for much of the game.
<br>2. You have to either grind or spend real money. I&apos;ve spend some money on this game and, due to the random nature of drawing cards, gotten very little for it.
<br>3. Both in-game currencies are hard to come by. If you want to upgrade all of your talents, you MUST buy (with real money) stars beacuse you simply cannot earn enough over the course of the game.
<br>4. The levels are repetitive. A random mission from the first level will look the same as a random mission on the last level nearly every time.
<br>5. The difficulty goes from easy to incredibly hard real quick if you haven&apos;t upgraded the right towers out of the two dozen or so you can get.
<br>6. The game offers little strategy aside from &quot;get as many fully upgraded high-damage towers as you possibly can.&quot; Slow your enemies? barely works. stun them? Don&apos;t make me laugh.
<br>7. Magic is absurdly weak to the point that i question why it&apos;s even in the game. At the last levels every single spell is useless because they do 6,000 damage and the enemies have well over 50,000 hp (some have around 150,000 as far as I can tell).
<br>8. At the end of each level, you&apos;re presented with five cards, ranging from useless (xp bonuses and low level cards) to amazing (epic-level cards). You have to blindly pick one at random, so if you do see a good card, you have a 20% chance of choosing it. You can pick up to two other cards for extra silver.
<br>
<br>In short, this game is made well but poorly executed. Too much random chance, towers and levels are bland (and due to perspective and the graphics can be confusing), and the difficulty is really all over the place. Very little about this game is good.
<br>
<br>If you want a good tower defense game, go play Kingdom Rush/Kingdom Rush: Frontiers or Bloons 5. Leave this one alone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prime-world-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=4621149">Expand</a></span>

<br>Having a full deck allows you to think each level and how you can beat it.
<br>The graphics are pretty nice too, but the towers look ugly and the enemies are the same over and over again.
<br>The real problem with the game is that it gets boring real fast. First you are presented with a story of two warring factions that do not appear in the game at all. Then you go to the tutorial, which shows you every detail about the nuances of the game but it does so in so many levels that it gets frustrating and, sometimes, counterproductive.
<br>After that you&apos;re off to go play the real game and, guess what, nothing changes. You&apos;re off to level after level of the same enemies, not so different map layout and same towers (they don&apos;t chance when you level them up to look different or mode bad ass). And since you&apos;re going to have to play a lot in the same levels for money and new cards, well, you can imagine that the game gets dull fast.
<br>Not to mention that the game is pretty unbalanced, you&apos;re getting your ass wiped easily, then you get a new card to upgrade an already existing one and suddenly it&apos;s a piece of cake. The damage sometimes more than double for one level up of a tower. All I had to do for most of the levels was to level up the most basic tower to max level and place it on the levels. I got perfect on all of them. Didn&apos;t even need another tower.
<br>Oh, and don&apos;t think it&apos;s easy to get new towers to upgrade, you&apos;ll be playing level after level after level and, at the end of each one you&apos;re going to have to get lucky and pick, between five cards, something useful. You can spend in-game currency to try and pick 3 out of the 5 instead of 1 (which is free after the level is beaten), but it doesn&apos;t pay off since they charge a lot for that second and third try.
<br>Despite all that, the game will grow on you if you&apos;re a fan of tower defense and can overlook it&apos;s many flaws, spending some nice hours beating all the levels and trying to get perfect score on them.
<br>For me, it was a pass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prime-world-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=3236223">Expand</a></span>

<br>In terms of pros, the game is visually very nice.  The &quot;creeps&quot; you are killing can be very funny.  Some of them look like brooms and some of them have eyeballs that dangle in front of their bodies.
<br>
<br>In terms of cons, the very first &quot;bomb&quot; they gave me does less damage than a single hit from a single tower and costs more than all the other starter towers.  That should tell you how poorly conceived this game is.  The card forging system is interesting, but ultimately fell flat for me.  The tutorial is endless, condescending, and in some cases counter-productive.
<br>
<br>This game is a rewrap of several other free-to-play casual games I&apos;ve seen from the same genre but with the Prime World theme and characters.  If you love Prime World, stick with Prime World; don&apos;t get fooled by the marketing.

<br>I bought it for only 3.89$ on steam, I just haven&apos;t stopped playing in days. I love it. The system is great, it&apos;s challenging yet forgiving. It allows you to customize your different cards (towers or magic) and has multiple talents to choose from. I think it&apos;s the first 3D paid tower game which is actually well balanced. The story is small but fun and adds to the style of the game.
<br>
<br>Well, I wish we could classify games on steam by user ratings instead of critics ratings.
<br>
<br>BTW there&apos;s a demo for this game. I played it before buying the game, it convinced me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prime-world-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=3894464">Expand</a></span>

<br>On the downside the biggest factor is the growing tedium of the grinding required between main missions in order to gain the gold and cards needed to pay for those upgrades.  Not only does one need to play through a lot of side games, but these use the same maps as the main missions completed to that point, so sameness sets in quickly; they also aren&apos;t very challenging even on the Hard level.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prime-world-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=3179691">Expand</a></span>

The social aspect of it is the most &quot;epic fail&quot; I&apos;ve seen.
<br>
<br>Not all of the players were bad, but those that were not completely silent. I would suggest avoiding this game and looking elsewhere. There are plenty of great games out there where you won&apos;t be abused by troubled kids. and those that as them.  It seems to be a haven for cowardice and misdirected hostility.  Combine that with a frequently buggy game accompanied by painfully long queue times to play, and I would hope it fades away sooner rather than later.  Do yourself a big favor and spend your money and time elsewhere.

This game does require a lot of grinding to be able to rack up money, exp, and stars....but that&apos;s where the fun comes in. If it were just so damn easy to play through this game and win, then it would not be fun. I have to say it is one of my favorite games i have played in the resent years. Only fault i have with this game is there are a minor glitch with the STEAM achievements, there are a few that even though you achieve them, they do no work. BUT they have just released a new patch that is supposed to fix this. I can not wait until they release more content, or even a sequel game! A must buy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prime-world-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=3967830">Expand</a></span>

Some towers are just to good not to use in every map while some have no place in the game at all. Also as you progress in the game, earlier maps become retarded easy. Overall It has its flaws, but I personally had a great time playing this one took me around 70 hours to beat normal and heroic. Im sure I could have beat it alot quicker, but I was just having a good time with this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prime-world-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=3963174">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I played the game for eight straight hours and i must say that it is worth the money i payed. There are some bugs with server that needs to be fixed. Atmosphere is very good, graphic is vivid and colourful. To keep the story short, this is not the best tower defence game but it is worth playing.</span>

I like the Idea but you don&apos;t get to create anything outside of the box. You advance towers according to your play style. The interface reminds me to much of a &quot;free to play&quot; game, other than that  no negative from me. 1$ an hour for entertainment is fair, and this game has gone above and beyond the 1$ mark. I look forward to any DLC that may come. Yes this game makes me want to play Orcs Must Die /sigh.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prime-world-defenders/user-reviews?user_review_id=3249283">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Bought this in the Steam sale...

<br>Yes it&apos;s grindy...
<br>Yes you can see it was originally meant to be an F2P game...
<br>

<br>what you get is a lot of fun, some great ideas, and a huge time-sink..
<br>definitely one for TD fans...</span>
