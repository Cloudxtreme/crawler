<br>- You might struggle with the controls, especially if you use m+kb. They are unconventional even for twin stick shooters. (I used an Xbox One controller and had no problems however.)
<br>- It&apos;s a little short, and there are many NPC sub-plots that go nowhere.
<br>- While the game has an excellent style, there&apos;s a bit too much on the side of underground mechanical dungeons. It needed more environmental variety.
<br>- Some bosses are weaksauce, like Hongshi, which is a shame because I thought he had a very cool design. There were a few like him that I took down with no sweat, very underwhelming.
<br>- It lacks endgame content. It really needs something like NG+ or some kind of endless or pvp mode with a leaderboard.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+ The art and style are excellent.
<br>+ The soundtrack is excellent.
<br>+ It&apos;s fast paced and never feels like a slog.
<br>+ Some bosses are really good.
<br>+ Once you get past the controls, the mechanics work incredibly well.
<br>+ I personally really liked the story and writing. It&apos;s simple, but feels nuanced and definitely cyberpunk.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s a good game and I recommend it. I look forward to seeing more content for the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruiner/user-reviews?user_review_id=7559306">Expand</a></span>

<br>Twin stick greatness
<br>Ruiner is a cyberpunk styled twin stick shooter set in the year 2091, you play as a sociopath out to save your kidnapped brother...
<br>This game was designed to be brutally difficult and has even gotten flak from other reviewers for being so tough&#x2026;
<br>But this game actually has difficulty settings... and if you set your ego aside and play on the games easy mode which is designed to be just the right amount of challenging...
<br>This 5 hour game can be insanely fun, satisfying and hard to put down&#x2026;
<br>This game features 16 levels total and each level really looks and feels the same&#x2026;
<br>But the game is so fun to play that you hardly notice as you&#x2019;re going batman on the enemies surrounding you to this games amazing soundtrack&#x2026;
<br>Enemies have a variety of weapons they carry all of which you can pick up and use on the fly&#x2026;
<br>at first you have a shield and you&#x2019;re able to dash as well as use a melee weapon and a ruiner gun with infinite ammo, and of course enemies are all carrying better weapons&#x2026;
<br>getting used to combat can take a little while, but once you do you feel like a superhero, snatching up new weapons and looking at your surroundings while the game briefly goes into slow motion
<br>defeating enemies will award you karma, which can also be found in chests, and extra weapons laying around after a fight can be put into a weapon grinder for karma as well..
<br>This is essentially your experience&#x2026;
<br>and you level up in ruiner at a very satisfying pace, the game doesn&#x2019;t feel grindy once&#x2026;
<br>Managing your skill points and crafting your ruiner around your playstyle is where the greatness of this game comes in...
<br>You have a variety of choices on where you can dump you skill points into and if you&#x2019;re not happy with your choices you can take skill points back at any time... you&#x2019;re not stuck dealing with it&#x2026;
<br>a lot of your skills such as grenades  and your shield use up your energy, but you can unlock the ability to spend your energy on health regeneration, you can spend your health on energy regeneration&#x2026;
<br>by the games end my character felt like a tank as id be using energy for grenades and health but I had the perk of shooting refilling my energy&#x2026;
<br>this came really late in  game, the final couple of levels.. but I felt unstoppable with this chain of abilities I worked my way up to&#x2026;
<br>there are also robots that will drop in with gifts like energy, health, and weapon drops&#x2026;
<br>where the real challenge comes into play is with this games bosses.. It&#x2019;s filled with mini and main bosses that definitely take effort to defeat... but this game is great with its checkpoints&#x2026; letting you hop right back in with all of your health and ammo back to give it another shot&#x2026;
<br>The game on its easy mode felt perfectly balanced.. I was challenged and I was having fun&#x2026;
<br>but of course you can go into a hire difficulty If you&#x2019;re more about frustration... the point is the option is there to play this game the way you want&#x2026;
<br>Ruiner is a tad underrated..
<br>If you&#x2019;re a twin stick shooter fan don&#x2019;t skip it...
<br>I give Ruiner
<br>an 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ruiner/user-reviews?user_review_id=7558990">Expand</a></span>

The design, writing, and soundtrack are really well thought out. It&apos;s too bad it&apos;s paired with a dev team that simply can&apos;t deliver on gameplay. There&apos;s no real excuse for this.</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Excellent style, amateurish execution.

<br>Akira and Evangelion were better at symbolism in stories. They should have studied them instead of banally recombining the artistic scheme. Still a good effort.
