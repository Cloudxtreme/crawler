Search Phage Wars and you&apos;ll get a better, more pretty, more sleek, more fresh version of what you would get from buying Galcon Fusion. There&apos;s no story, it&apos;s basically a grab-bag style game where you select the game mode, and play through a bunch of randomized maps with no actual goal. I personally like the Flash game version much better. You should never have to pay for a game like Galcon Fusion, thus you should save your money if you were ever considering buying this game. Personally I love the type of game GF is, but if I can play a better version for free why would I pay for this? I think it&apos;s a decent basis for a game, but they really didn&apos;t try too hard with this one. The AI is really unintelligent, and there really isn&apos;t much challenge to the game either, once you understand how it works. This game is just too dull, and not worth the money. I&apos;ll pass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galcon-fusion/user-reviews?user_review_id=4238348">Expand</a></span>

Sadly, multiplayer has many problems:  The games are essentially decided by a popularity contest.  If you are not well liked, you will be eliminated almost immediately.  This wouldn&apos;t be so much a problem, except the average game can easily stretch on for over an hour, with long periods of absolutely nothing happening.  And THAT wouldn&apos;t be such a problem, except usually there&apos;s only one or two rooms you can join to play in, so you HAVE to wait for them to finish.  Combine all this with obnoxious and immature volunteer administration that will mute, kick or ban you without any real reason, and you have a completely toxic gaming environment.  I wouldn&apos;t even recommend this game to somebody just to spite them.
