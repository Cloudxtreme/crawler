<br>
<br>Graphics and animations are good, but sometimes you feel that some of the enemy sprite does not even belong to the game environment. Controllers and it&apos;s physics needs to be upgraded, this is where most of the indies makes the same mistakes. The upgrade of health, armor and weapon is not interesting. The level design mostly is very good, but sometimes annoying. Sometimes the levels feels too long, making you thank the old mega man levels length.
<br>
<br>Music, very good, there are tracks that should added to best of video game music archive, but there are also  song that sound very bizarre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4324043">Expand</a></span>

Sure, you could go out to the store and buy those cookies that come in packs, but nothing beats the taste of one&apos;s made with ingredients right off the shelf. It may not be the perfect game, but looking past the flaws, you are in for a treat. No, more like a feast.</span>

<br>
<br>...The gameplay is not. It&apos;s frustrating, it&apos;s repetitive. It isn&apos;t &apos;hard&apos;. Anyone can beat Shovel Knight. Anyone can walk through barbed wire. The experiences are very similar. Endure the pain long enough and eventually you win. At the end, you&apos;re unsatisfied. And bleeding.
<br>
<br>It boggles my mind the game is so well reviewed. I can only assume it&apos;s pure, unadulterated nostalgia blinding people to, what if viewed on it&apos;s own, would be a very average, flawed game, and this is coming from someone who owned an NES when it was new. Literally the target audience. Get Splunkey or La Mulana if you want a platformer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=5949139">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What an amazing game! As a child of the 80s, I had an original NES and LOVED Mega Man, Mario, Zelda et al in the prime of their 8-bit glory. Shovel Knight dips into that nostalgia while being genuinely engaging and entertaining in its own right. The game provides the perfect balance of fun, challenge, minor rpg elements (powering up mana vs. health), and level progression. The game includes fun achievements, which is something that I appreciate. Combine the excellent game play elements, a fantastic score, and lovingly created 8-bit art, and you come away with the total package here!
<br>
<br>I Kickstarted this game, and my only regret is not chipping in more. Definitely well worth the 14.99 retail for those that purchase through Steam. I can&apos;t wait to see what else Yacht Club Games come up with in the future.  A highly enthusiastic 10/10 for Shovel Knight!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4298264">Expand</a></span>

The creators of Shovel Knight are obviously fans of classic games on the NES like Mario Bros., Megaman, and Castlevania just to name a few and great care has been taken to use the more memorable elements from these games both the loved (Duck Tales style pogo attacks, Megaman style bosses, and Castlevania style sub weapons) and the hated (knock-back deaths and difficulty on the level of Megaman 2). Even so, Shovel Knight does enough to set itself apart as it&apos;s own game with it&apos;s quirky cast of characters, awesome music, amazing sprite art, and rather odd choice of weaponry. It is not perfect however; even though I would consider Shovel Knight a fair game, there were times where I felt that no person playing for their first time would be able to avoid death just because an enemy popped up over a bottomless pit when they weren&apos;t expecting it. A death in a video game is fair when the player sees danger coming and simply doesn&apos;t respond to it accordingly, it&apos;s not fair if you get sucker punched. Even so this only emboldens that classic NES feeling where a gamer will play again but this time with memory on their side. Shovel Knight is a game that is well worth your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4314758">Expand</a></span>

But this is a masterpiece, with the only issue being some mechanics are infuriating. The combat is tight, the game has charm, a plethora of content, and loot a plenty. The game can be brutally hard (paying homage to the titles its based on), but make beating a particularly hard boss that much more satisfying.  The game features stages cleverly based on other titles, while bringing its own charm. Who can forget Treasure Knight and his Metroid themed level? Or the towns based on Zelda 2? It brings everything that was amazing (from my limited experience) of the older generation, but updated everything that was awful and made me shake my head. This is one you definitely don&apos;t want to miss, if you are up for a little challenge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4305765">Expand</a></span>

<br>Story

For</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Shovel Knight is a retro 2D platformer game deeply devoted to its aesthetic and its puns. Designed as a pseudo-NES game, it harkens back to a long-ago era in gaming, and the game itself feels as if it fits into the era of Megaman. You are the Shovel Knight, a knight armed with a shovel who must beat his way past 12 stages to confront the Sorceress and rescue Shield Knight.
<br>
<br>Story
<br>
<br>For being such a simplistic game, there is a clear story to the game &#x2013; Shovel Knight feels guilty because he could not save Shield Knight, and has recurring dreams of catching her while she is falling. Black Knight stands in between Shovel Knight and his goal, not out of loyalty to the Sorceress, but out of loyalty to Shield Knight. The Knights of No Order stand in the way for their own reasons.
<br>Is there much story here? No. But there is enough of a story &#x2013; and enough reinforcement of the central theme of the game &#x2013; that it works, and is a bit more than an excuse plot due to the recurring dream of saving Shield Knight.
<br>The game is also wonderfully full of terrible puns, and there are various townsfolk in a couple towns who can be spoken to and who often have silly dialogue.
<br>
<br>Gameplay
<br>
<br>The gameplay is very straightforward &#x2013; Shovel Knight can hit things with his shovel, or use relics (of which there are 10), each of which has some special ability. Later on, Shovel Knight also gains the ability to charge up his shovel attacks to make them more powerful, and to switch which armor he is wearing for some minor bonus, frequently counteracted by some minor penalty.
<br>The game is very much classic platforming, with the ability for shovel knight to attack enemies from the side with his shovel or spring up and down on top of them using his shovel like a pogo stick, occasionally necessary for navigating the levels or accessing secrets. The levels often make use of the fact that the protagonist wields a shovel, forcing them to dig through obstacles, sometimes taking advantage of the fact that the pogo sticking has to be stopped manually, and sometimes making use of the shovel otherwise by having Shovel Knight dig stuff out or dig through walls. There is a surprisingly decent variety of enemies, harkening back to Megaman type games, though some of them are repeated with only minor variations between them.
<br>The relics add an additional complication to gameplay; however, I found that I didn&#x2019;t end up using most of the relics very often, while the basic fireball attack relic, which granted a cheap ranged attack, and the temporary invincibility relic, were very versatile and useful. The rest were all very situational or just less cost efficient, though there were areas which specifically relied on the special properties of specific relics to navigate, which were interesting.
<br>The levels themselves were reasonably varied, in a way somewhat reminiscent of the Megaman games, where each of the 8 major bosses had a specific world, and there was a prologue stage and 3 end-game stages which combined elements from all the previous stages. In addition to the main stages, there were a number of additional mini-stages which often focused on some specific aspect of the game; the overworld map even had Super Mario Brothers 3-esque enemies pop up and walk around on the world map, encouraging you to go fight them.
<br>The levels also had various secrets hidden around them, and in hiding its secrets the game did quite well &#x2013; the secrets are not immediately obvious, but if the player knows how to look, they stand out, and again remind me of secrets from the era. In addition to the relics, there are also musical tracks which serve as collectibles in the game, with one hidden in every level.
<br>The bosses themselves were reasonably varied and had a decent variety of abilities, but unfortunately suffered from being rather too easy; only two bosses ever killed me, and both of those were because of environmental hazards in the stage which spelled instant death, rather than the actual boss whittling away my health. They were reasonably interesting to fight, but unfortunately the ease of beating them combined with ready access to relics and a couple items reminiscent of E-Tanks from Megaman (fully restoring both magic and health &#x2013; you could refill them before every stage, too, and could carry two of them) meant that losing to them was extremely unlikely, making them a bit disappointing in terms of difficulty level.
<br>On the whole, the game does a good job of recalling the 8-bit era, and it feels like a very solid game from that era. It is worth noting that the game also recalls the 8-bit era in terms of length as well &#x2013; the game is pretty short, likely clocking in at 6-8 hours to complete, if not less, depending on how good you are at it and how much time you spend trying to collect achievements and gather money and search for every secret in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4493353">Expand</a></span>

It draws its aspirations from Zelda 2, Megaman, Mario 3, and Ducktales, but has so many creative concepts to form its own identity.
<br>
<br>The environments and characters have so much detail and personality to them, it&apos;s suprising and fresh to see that level of detail in an NES 8-bit styled game. Mostly because it treats its genre (8-bit retro game) with the utmost respect and seriousness. There&apos;s no stupid gimmicks or references or winks to remind the player they&apos;re playing an 8-bit NES style game: the style is used to deliver a genuine oldschool experience with a straight face and the best of intentions.
<br>
<br>The music is amazing, catchy, and fits each theme very well. Jake Kaufman is a brilliant composer and his experience truly shines here, as it has when creating/remixing music for other games he&apos;s worked on (Contra 4, Ducktales Remastered, Shantae, etc).
<br>
<br>The challenge has the perfect gradual shift throughout the entire game. It starts off normal enough, then consistently increases in challenge until the very end. While you can improve Shovel Knight with new upgrades and abilities, as the player you will feel your own skill increase as you become familiar with how Shovel Knight handles ingame and learn to use him and his abilities much more efficiently. It&apos;s a magical learning curve that I haven&apos;t experienced since having played games from the golden age when I was a kid back in the 90&apos;s.
<br>
<br>Regardless of what console you purchase this on, it is a fantastic game in its own right, and provides an incredibly genuine experience and challenge that so many games are lacking nowadays. Perfect 10 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4325851">Expand</a></span>

The music is amazing as are the levels and features. It pays homage to older NES games like Ducktales, Mega Man, Castlevania, etc in a very beautiful way. A must buy on any system</span>

The game features several equipable secondary items to use throughout, and a simple yet great storyline. Fantastic game, and if you enjoy platformers in general or played games on NES or SNES, this game is for you.

<br>Thank you Yacht Club Games, well done.</span>

<br>A must Play For all
<br>Shovel Knight is a beautifully charming action platforming game.
<br>Shovel Knights art style screams nostalgia sale, but I was happy  to find that this game isn&#x2019;t just here to pull money out of your pockets with heart strings, Shovel Knight is it&#x2019;s own game, an instant classic.
<br>Shovel knight consists of 12 main levels all with their own boss battles, each level and stage getting progressively more challenging.
<br>The pacing is really some of the best ive ever seen in gaming.
<br>Every level has checkpoints, this may annoy the hardcore gamers at first, but you really come to appreciate them, platforming can get really trick for those of us that are impatient.
<br>These type of gamers are who the checkpoints are for, they are essentially training wheels.
<br>Shovel Knight is really more than just a flat forming game, it truly is an experience, and im happy these checkpoints exist so all can experience and guess what&#x2026; checkpoints are COMPLETELY optional.
<br>Don&#x2019;t like them?
<br>Break them, they drop cash so now you have nothing to complain about.
<br>I wouldn&#x2019;t recommend doing such a thing your first time through as again, shovel knight gets increasingly challenging.
<br>Enemies will start throwing projectiles, youll have to dodge lava and spikes and look out for enemies while you seek out secrets.
<br>There are tons of secrets to be found in shovel knight that I wont spoil, but they add such a great deal of wonder to the game, you never know what youre going to find in a room you just uncovered from an exploding rat.
<br>It could be a music page for you to sell in the villiage, or a new relic waiting for you to grab to help you out through the rest of the game.
<br>I wasn&#x2019;t expecting relics, but im so happy they exist, these relics all cost magic to use so cant really be spammed, but they are all varied and make you look at levels for better, more efficient ways to traverse them.
<br>You can also save your gold for armour and shovel upgrades, maybe increased magic or meal tickets to increase your health, the choice is yours, but unless youre completely confident in your skills walking into an unknown area you better make that choice before going back out, because every time you die you drop 3 pouches of gold much like in the souls series.
<br>If you want that gold back youre going to have to go grab it, if you die on your way back then its gone forever..
<br>The risk reward makes traversing these gorgeous levels even more enjoyable.
<br>Not only did this development team due a great job with level design and enemies, but also with bosses.
<br>Each boss has its own attack style, so no 2 relics will be equally handy in these encounters, gratefully though, they all die the same way, hit them an x amount of times.
<br>Games can get in the habit of making bosses a little too unique, what shovel knight does so great is make the encounters similar enough to give you a sense of pride and feeling like you used skill to defeat a new enemy rather than you just got completely lucky.
<br>It isn&#x2019;t common to die during your first encounter with a new boss and that is so refreshing.
<br>I wont get into story all too much, but I will say that it is there, there is reason to the madness and it, at least to me is beautiful.
<br>After you&#x2019;ve completed the game and have picked every level apart for its secrets and treasures, you have the option to start a new game +.
<br>New game plus lets you start from the beginning with everything you collected in your previous play through, but this time levels are a little tougher as youll notice some checkpoints are missing, enemies do double damage, and there are no health pick ups.
<br>There are tons of challenging feats to accomplish in shovel knight.
<br>Totally worth the playthrough just to experience, a highly recommended game title to both casual and hardcore gamers alike.
<br>I truly believe that everyone can find something to love about shovel knight.
<br>For what it is
<br>Action platformer 10/10
<br>and as an overall game my first ever 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=5225794">Expand</a></span>

An affectionate homage to the golden age of console gaming, Shovel Knight comes to us from former members of Wayforward Technologies, creators of the Shantae series. The game&apos;s incredibly varied stages play out like a greatest hits album of classic platformers. But unlike, say, Ninja Gaiden or Castlevania, Shovel Knight never feels cheap or punishing. The game is filled with a lovable cast of characters, excellent music (courtesy of the ineffable Virt Kaufman, the musical genius behind Contra 4, Scurge: Hive, Shantae, and several other games), useful powerups and hair-pulling jumping puzzles. The controls are extremely tight, and any mistakes you make are your own damn fault. The game rather mercifully makes use of checkpoints, only depriving you of money when you die, money you have a chance to retrieve when you make it back to where you died. And even if you don&apos;t, you can always farm for more, and you will need quite a bit to buy all the upgrades. I had to take a few breaks over the course of playing Shovel Knight to cool off, but I kept coming back until I was done. I do not regret for a second backing this lovely game on kickstarter. If you enjoy platformers and classic NES era gaming in general, then grab yourself a copy of Shovel Knight and prepare to strike the earth!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507844">Expand</a></span>

<br>The shovel knight just feels like **** to control, very clunkey, especially mid-air. The stairs just make no sense in this game, at all. You will die on nearly every staircase in the game.
<br>
<br>Level cycles are too random to be memorized. Enemies are RNG galore and always feel like they move faster than you giving you no time to react, UNLESS you wait for them. There aren&apos;t enough checkpoints.
<br>
<br>Should I mention the **** feel of the control again? Shovel knight controls like a rock. Just go outside, pick up a really big rock and move that around, and you will get the general feel of moving shovel knight through the levels.
<br>
<br>Game isn&apos;t bad, it&apos;s okay. The presentation is the best part of it, oldschool gfx are well done, especially the animations, they are amazing. Music is great too. They got so carried away with the presentation that they forgot to like, actually make the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7087323">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s perfect in every way; the pin-point controls, the awesome soundtrack, the endearing characters, the quirky humor, the exquisite level design, the balanced difficulty and the emotional gut-punch of the ending. Shovel Knight is brilliant beyond all comprehension. If you ever wanted a modern 2D platformer to catch the true essence of the all-time classics then you can&apos;t afford to miss this game. To echo the most common words associated with this title; Shovel Knight is an absolute masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4365590">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This game reminds me alot of Megaman, only with Megaman you had to defeat robot masters, with Shovel Knight you defeat different types of knights. Which Megaman you have Doctor Wilys castle and in this you have the same thing but not with Wily..
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a good game, it&apos;s not perfect but it really took  me back to the days of the NES.

GAMEPLAY itself is a solid 9/10 for this genre.

In an industry were &quot;innovative&quot;, &quot;groundbreaking&quot;, &quot;brand new&quot; and procedurally generated &quot;infinite possibilities&quot; are thrown at us so easily and so much that it almost causes physical sickness to read them, someone remembers that games should be fun, that games shouldn&apos;t just blindly try to be innovative for the sake of it, that creativity comes from restriction just as much fun and awe can come from a pre-constructed level and from venturing in it.
<br>
<br>Now for the non pretentious part, this game has mechanics from most thing that are impossible to dislike: Castlevania and Megaman&apos;s atmosphere and gameplay combined, the DuckTales NES gem&apos;s pogo mechanic, and Dark Souls death penalties, and throws them together bound by a love(?)-driven story about character with a simple yet cool gimmick (every knight is a Something Knight, with Shovel Knight being the main character with a... uh, Shovel). In its simplistic story it even manages to be slightly sentimental and dramatic (Shield Knight&apos;s story) and has a couple of neat details that one may not even notice (Being a Cerulean knight with horns wasn&apos;t just a random design choice, as you are kind of given hints of character&apos;s &quot;origins&quot; in the Polar Knight stage).
<br>
<br>What can I say? The only way to fail with this premise is to have poor level design or not being polished, and that&apos;s not the case either: the game never goes out of its &quot;NES game with some technological licenses&quot; self-imposed stylistic boundary and the levels play and feel like they&apos;re straight out of a classic, alternating action, puzzle and tense mixes of the two.
<br>
<br>One minor complaint: among the things the game takes inspiration from, there&apos;s Super Mario Bros. 3&apos;s level selection and roaming enemies, but overall it only gives the illusion of non-linearity and it&apos;s pretty much a superfluous thing that doesn&apos;t really give you much options other than choosing what boss to beat first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4440793">Expand</a></span>

Just play the first level of the game or even the demo and you&apos;ll see what I mean. In an era of mostly AAA publisher **** where corporations think we&apos;re too stupid to see through their crappy games, Shovel Knight rises among the indie genre and is well worth your $15. The only downside to SK is that it&apos;s very short, but only at the moment. The Yacht Club is adding updates every so often once they create the additional content of Kickstarter Goals that were all met, such as playing as Shield Knight instead of Shovel Knight, 3 playable boss characters, a VS mode, a Challenge Mode (similar to the New SMB U version or something akin to NES Remix) and a whole lot of other stuff! Well worth the wait and the money, and deserves all the praise it can get.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4386163">Expand</a></span>

This attitude has flooded the market with mediocre 2D &#x201D;old-school&#x201D; platformers and instantly became the &#x201D;go to&#x201D; genre for most Indie developers, spawning hundreds of failed Kickstarter projects and all of that is not a case when it comes to Yacht Club Games, they&#x2019;ve raised $311,502 and released their first game, Shovel Knight. The game delivers a visually appealing 8-bit aesthetic, an amazing soundtrack and smooth animations.
<br>
<br>Let&#x2019;s talk about the story. The game opens up with the &#x201D;cutscene&#x201D; showing the game&#x2019;s protagonist, Shovel Knight and his partner Shield Knight, you can clearly tell that the devs put a lot of thought into the characters&#x2019; names. Following a tragedy, Shield Knight is taken away from Shovel Knight by The Enchantress and her army, the Order of no Quarter&#x2026;I&#x2019;m not making that up. The Order consists of eight knights, each of them is originally named, for ex. Mole Knight, Plauge Knight or The Black Knight&#x2026;yeah.  Back to the story, you grab your shovel&#x2026;yes, a shovel and go off on an epic adventure to defeat The Enchantress.
<br>One of the things I love about Shovel Knight is how it teaches you how to play it without spamming the text boxes with &#x201D;TO JUMP PRESS THE A BUTTON&#x201D; and things like that. The first few stages teach you everything you need to know without saying anything, this is great, it made me want to play the game even more.
<br>
<br>The stages play like in a Mega Man game, the monsters are not your only enemies in the game, the environments can get involved in the action too, for ex. the lightning effects occasionaly light up making moving from platform to platform that much more difficult, it got kind of frustrating but it was interesting. The combat is extremely basic, but satisfying, just like in the 8bit era&#x2013;had to download an NES emulator to realize that.  You have your basic &#x201D;shovel slash&#x201D; but you can also do sort of a Duck Tales attack by leaping on top of your enemies. You can also use your shovel to epically dig out a treasure from the ground. Shovel is not your only weapon, throughout the game you come across other weapons that allow you to attack from afar aka fire wand.
<br>
<br>I really liked that the devs included the checkpoint system so that you don&#x2019;t have to start from the start when you die, I&#x2019;m glad that you guys did not go hardcore mode with your old-school roots. You also have an option to destroy a checkpoint for some loot, I have never done that but If you enjoy challenge then sure, go for it. The treasures you&#x2019;ve collected throughout the game allow you to purchase certain things like health/mana upgrades. After each stage you are transported to a world map that allows you to access different levels, in order to advance to a next area you first have to beat one of the previously mentioned, originally named Knights.
<br>
<br>Each stage presents new challenges that make the game more difficult the further you advance. They each have a unique theme and sometimes, new enemies that act differently and force different approaches, it makes for a very enjoyable gameplay experience. Same goes for the platforming, it gets more and more challenging as you play.
<br>
<br>I need to touch on one more thing that in my opinion, might be the most enjoyable thing about Shovel Knight, the boss fights. Each Knight has a unique fighting style and requires a bit of thinking, you have to figure out a pattern in which they move before attacking. You can&#x2019;t just spam the attack button, just like in the old days(so I&#x2019;ve heard) you have to think before approaching. I can safely say that this game offered me the most enjoyable boss fights I&#x2019;ve ever experienced. Big round of applause for that.
<br>
<br>Lastly, I would like to talk about the difficulty of the game. I&#x2019;ve had two weeks to write and publish this review but instead it took me three. I really did not think that the game would be that difficult, I thought that I&#x2019;d be able to swoosh through the game in a couple of days but no, that was certainly not the case. It might be because I did not grew up in the 80s, and I did not fully experience the true &#x201D;holy-f*cking sh*t, this is hard&#x201D; era so, It might be easier for you old people out there but nonetheless I&#x2019;ve had a ton of fun and I certainly will re-play it again, this time with cheat codes. (there are over 300 of them in the game).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4816662">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ A very good mixture of level mechanics and themes, and while the player has limited mobility and attacks, the levels provide new tools and experiences time and time again.
<br>? The spell system is interesting in providing a variety of new tools, but ultimately feels like mixed bag random additional mechanics that reduce the tight execution of the title.
<br>? The tedium of some of the boss fights makes it too easy to be tempted into using the invincibility mechanics on offer to cheese combat.
<br>- The base movement and combat systems, while true to retro games, often don&apos;t feel good to use. The lack of directional attacks make many of the enemies nothing but annoying unless you happen to click with what&apos;s on offer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6959595">Expand</a></span>

It may be a niche game for retro gaming fans, but it&apos;s brilliantly crafted in every aspect. Bonus points for top-notch writing and a charming (if simple) story.</span>

There are some fun levels though I noticed they are mostly very short with some difficult platforming to take up your time.  The music is good but repetitive (like the old school games) so I muted it after the first level.  I noticed the keyboard controls are not very intuitive and responsive for platforming type games.. I wish I had a controller for my PC to see if it was easier to play, but my hands felt cramped and crowded by the AWSD keys and I wish there was a better way to traverse the menus and use your special power... which required hitting 2 keys which I would not time correctly very often.  I played with the key setup constantly but didn&apos;t find one that I would like.  All-in-all I found some levels to be extremely difficult though but the boss battles were easy.  One level I just couldn&apos;t get through so I quit altogether,  It was a fun few hours until it got too frustrating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=5284020">Expand</a></span>

The difficulty is just right: very challenging (&apos;80s style), but not offputtingly frustrating. The art style of this game is top notch, and the Mega Man-ish music just really hypes you up for the level. Seriously, the 8-bit styled atmosphere and music shows off real love towards all the classics this game was inspired by. And if you play with a controller, the controls are excellent. Level design is fantastic, boss battles are great, there are lots of collectibles in hidden areas. Also, the destroy-the-checkpoints-and-get-goodies-idea is genius.
<br>
<br>All that being said, the game might be a little bit over-hyped. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I had a blast playing it, but I don&apos;t think I enjoyed it as much as some other people did.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless, this is a really original and fun game you absolutely need to have in your library. 8.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=5244543">Expand</a></span>

There isn&apos;t a real bad thing about this game. It&apos;s like Super Meat Boy in the sense that if you die, it&apos;s entirely on you; This is one smooth playing game. It&apos;s plot is very intriguing, even though it&apos;s not much. Once your motivation is given to you for going through these lands and slaying enemies with your trusty shovel, you don&apos;t wanna put it down. It can be very challenging, you will die. A lot. But there&apos;s nothing stopping you from trying it right after it&apos;s done. The music is insane, one of the best retro-esque chiptune soundtracks I&apos;ve heard. The level design is top-notch, you can tell this wasn&apos;t a level editor type of game, with the same type of platforms in a certain way for a whole area of the map; it&apos;s a game that is identifiable as a really well thought-out game. When you finish a level, you feel a real sense of accomplishment of what you&apos;ve done. This game deserves all the unreal praise it&apos;s getting, this game is essentially flawless. Pick it up. I promise, you will not be let down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4476354">Expand</a></span>

Anyway, I was a bit sceptical at first when people were recommending this game all over the internet. telling that this game was amazing. $ 15 is not that cheap but I had some money left in my account so  I bought the game and started playing. From the first level until the last one all are really beautiful fun and innovative in there own way. It&apos; felt like the first time I started playing zelda game.  It looks retro but it doesn&apos;t feel this way. If your are looking for high end 3d hd res etc. don&apos;t buy it, but when you like a good platform game  and can look through 8bit this is a game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4561304">Expand</a></span>

It took everything that was great about Mega Man games, and polishes them and improves them. Dying means your money flies away, but you can get it back! Meaning if you&apos;re good, an occasional death is literally inconsequential. Its graphics really leave quite a bit to your imagination, but are detailed enough to be amazing looking! Oh, and the music. Ohhh the music. It&apos;s amazing. The bosses have telegraphed moves, but they don&apos;t have an order! Boss fights are therefore fun and challenging, and even a little enraging at some points. =D This game is a masterpiece, even without nostalgia goggles making everything look even better. The one point off is just the fact that it feels a bit short, but honestly, that&apos;s not much of a problem. Trying to get all those feats will CERTAINLY make you work hard and keep replay ability high.

<br>Short Version
<br>Pro: Excellent mechanics, fun enemies, tight platforming, heaps of replay ability, and a decent challenge!
<br>Con: A little bit short.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4708740">Expand</a></span>

I think its that some enemies in the game feel cheap like in risen 3, except hear their much easier to kill and can kill you faster, it may not sound that bad but i got so mad at this game that i broke my headphones by ripping the wire. But this game is good, it has great music great platforming  and some amazing things that you can use or buy, i mean use because there are platforms that can kill you but if you&apos;re smart and you time it right you can use it to your advantage. if you have one, buy it on your 3ds, if not, i would wait for a sale</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=5117663">Expand</a></span>

The music is so good it is worth to download the soundtrack and the 8 bit gaming features are on point. One of the best platformers that has challenge and charm. My only complaint is that its a bit on the short side. (For me it only took 3 hours). But at least every minute I enjoyed.</span>

<br>
<br>This game is beautiful, fun, excellent to handle, catchy, and fair (people who played old games will know what I mean). My only problem was that is was too short (yep! in other words it was so great I wanted more).</span>

I recommend this game for the nostalgic duty that has money to spend on Steam. Your money paid will not be in vain</span>

<br>
<br>The graphics and music and charming, and I think they&apos;re great even though I have no nostalgia for them. The story is simple and skip able, I couldn&apos;t ask for much more. The game become&apos;s very challenging, and even though it teaches the mechanics of levels well before you encounter them in a deadly situation, you can still die in some cheap ways. The game is full of adorable characters, and it never felt like it was wasting my time. If I didn&apos;t want to talk to a character I usually didn&apos;t have to, and if I did I could skip their dialogue if I wanted.
<br>
<br>This is one of my favorite platformers mostly because of the amazing level design. There is so much polish on every detail of this game and it&apos;s noticeable. It&apos;s fun, and even though the gameplay can be unforgiving checkpoints are frequent and give you some breathing room. This entire game is an example of a great tutorial.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6037517">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s well done, the controls are tight, smooth and amazing graphics and backgrounds, and to top it all off, the gameplay is amazing!! I love the bosses, especially Plague Knight and The Enchantress. I can&apos;t forget the second phase of the enchantress when you down-stab on Shield Knight&apos;s shield and smacking the Enchantress&apos; head with my shovel, using my favorite Relic: The Propeller Dagger to continue stabbing her mercilessly till she dies! God, everything is amazing!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shovel-knight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6463474">Expand</a></span>
