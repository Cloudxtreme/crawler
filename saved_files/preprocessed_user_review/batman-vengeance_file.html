The gameplay is very fun, there are some puzzles that are pretty good. The combat is OK, because you need to get used to it first. I didn&apos;t really like the flying and driving sequences, as they were hard to control in my opinion. The looks of the characters and the voice acting were amazing, just like in the animated Batman series and Batman: Arkham Asylum/City. Overall a great game, I would recommend it to all Batman fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-vengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=2559689">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a good game but it&apos;s just too hard and the akward controls dont help either. Also like someone else mentioned the driving and flying levels are hard too and some boss battles which require first person mode are really annoying too. Overall it&apos;s one of the best Batman games I have ever played not too great but not bad either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-vengeance/user-reviews?user_review_id=5541682">Expand</a></span>
