While this series does a lot of things right, it is a subpar experience even by Telltale standards. Playing the new walking dead at the time of righting just further illustrates the amount of care, both to the story and the technical side of things, is vastly different between these two games. It could be due to the fact that this series was rushed.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>1. Good Batman atmosphere, Bruce Wayne is even more fun to play.
<br>2. Not a retread of a familiar story, the lore is changed somewhat allowing you a fresh experience while still feeling true to the essence of Batman. (Would suck if we had another Hush or Arkham Knight kind of twist where fans would see it coming).
<br>3. Visual style is nice, voice acting is on point
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>1. Runs like diarrhea. Scenes just feel like someone is inserting a DVD in between interactions. Fight scenes that have this pause between camera switches completely break the enjoyment.
<br>2. Illusion of choice is always a telltale issue, but I almost never felt my choices mattered here. There&apos;s no weight to any decisions, even if they pretend there is.
<br>3. Gameplay is hilariously bad, even for a game based on quick time events (I enjoy telltale, so I knew what I was getting myself into). There&apos;s a gameplay mode that literally asks you to pick what you want to do, watch a quick little cut scene of it happening, and once you&apos;re done choosing all your cutscenes, it plays the QTEs. This is not gameplay, this is just work. On top of that the detective parts require zero thinking and just linking obviously related objects which allow Batman to inexplicably figure out things in ridiculous ways.
<br>4. Character interactions: Just awful. You can see certain characters arcs and the thoughts that would lead to their arcs very obviously. There&apos;s nothing you can do to stop the inevitable from happening. Interacting with Catwoman is just cringe worthy, with some of the choices making me feel like Telltale is predicting what their target audience wants in very cynical ways. Interactions with Alfred are basically just reassuring him over and over that he&apos;s family. Illusion of choice is very strong here.
<br>5. Pacing: This is where the game falls apart. The episodes follow a very formulaic design where you can see what&apos;s coming next easily. The game focuses on uninteresting characters like the main villain while more personal conflicts are just swept under the rug. The game plays it too safe, and rush through way too much detail at the last second to give the finale any real weight.
<br>
<br>It has it&apos;s moments, and it&apos;s hardly awful, but this is more like Game of Thrones (barely acceptable cash in) rather than their more polished and enjoyable Walking Dead/Wolf Among Us/Borderlands series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-the-telltale-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=6898014">Expand</a></span>

Telltale Games still did a fine job of making their OWN Batman/Bruce Story. Unlike others, they did not only focus on The Dark Knight but also highlighted the man behind the mask as well as other characters which are usually ignored or isn&apos;t touch upon in the batman universe and some known villains and characters that they changed that fits their story. I really cant say anything about the story that wont spoil but I can guarantee that if you are a die hard batman fan and you want something fresh and new. Then take it. My only issue is that the decision making part of the game doesnt really change much in the story. Regardless, A great score of 9/10.
<br>
<br>Gameplay - As a interactive Story-Driven game, gameplay is not their forte as well I had doubts at firs on how they could execute batman&apos;s action scenes. However, I was surprised and really am impressed how they executed the action scenes in this game decently. Its fun, cool and fair. Though I would have preffered more difficulty in it, they still did that aspect well. The stealth and strategy sequence of the game is also interesting and fresh that is showed in that genre. Thus, a score of 7/10.
<br>
<br>Graphics - Well, this is the part where Telltale really struggles. Despite the obvious improvement in their graphics, fps and lighting due to a better engine. It is still disappointing or below average in this generation of games. The classic Telltale stutters that you see in their games is still in here as well as the fps drops in certain cutscenes and dont forget that occasional awkward body motion or movements you will see during its scenes. In addition, the character designs of their characters and environments are still on the negative even though you could consider them as improvement. Overall, It is an improvement but is still bad. A bad score of 3/10.
<br>
<br>Sound - First is the voices, It is really good. Troy Baker&apos;s voice acting is truly top notch on how he could change to a calm and collected voice of Bruce to the monotone rugged pitch of Batman. Other good voice acting is also performed from almost everyone in the character line up that fits their persona, the only one in my opinion I have reservations is to the Joker. As to sound, I liked the intro sound that comes out at the first and last part of the episodes though I cant say this part is good because it isnt put well inside the episodes there are parts in the action scenes that is awkward cause there are no music played and some sounds are delayed in certain parts of the game. Overall, a decent score of 6/10
<br>
<br>Fun Factor - As someone who loved Batman media (Im a big fan of Dark Knight Trilogy and also played all of the Arkham Series games.) I have first doubted if Telltale can make a Batman that can be distinguished from the titles I mentioned in terms of gameplay and story. But alas, my doubts been extinguished since I really like how they made an original story of Batman while maintaing the core parts of the plot they also added their own twists in the game which didnt hurt the story, in fact, it made it even more interesting. On the gameplay side, I liked the action sequence they made as well as other aspects like the stealth, the Boss fights are pretty plain though. Overall, I really enjoyed Telltale&apos;s version of Batman and it is distinguishable to the others. A good score of 8/10.
<br>
<br>Average Score = 6.6</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-the-telltale-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=7629703">Expand</a></span>

Since the &quot;game&quot; basically plays itself and only requires minimum player input, it&apos;s kind of like watching a terrible movie. There are no choices at all in the game. Regardless if you save Harvey or Catwoman, Harvey still acts like two face and you can still bang Catwoman and regardless of if you band Catwioman, Harvey still gets pissed off and tries killing you. All his dialogue is exactly the same with or without half of his face intact. The only reason I&apos;m giving this a 4 and not a 0 or 1 is because I had a couple of good laughs when the game was trying to be serious about some thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-the-telltale-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=6897851">Expand</a></span>

<br>Favorite Thing: Story was cliche but enjoyable and full of action.
<br>Least Favorite Thing: The game hitches a lot. Once or twice it was really bad and impacted the flow of the story.

<br>Playtime: ~ 8h
<br>Enjoyment: 8/10
<br>Recommendation: If you&apos;re a fan of TellTale or Batman.</span>

                                        <span>the telltale games are intriguing and unexpected due to the VERY HARD choices, unfortunately this games lacks that ( a little ).
<br>Has a good character arch, and a good story with some (maybe) epic moments, i just hope that the next episodes are better.  BUT!.... it&apos;s a good game, and i would recommend it</span>

However before the main villain identity is revealed its pretty easy to guess who it is, which made me think that Telltale writers are bit losing their touch. Expected a more ambitious and bombastic ending, but Telltale played it too safe with it, still its decent enough. Im not too familiar with Batman lore apart from movies and few cartoons, but from what ive seen and know, i think this was a interesting take on Batman and origins of Wayne family, while a decent take on other characters and their stories from the universe.
<br>
<br>From gameplay perspective it feels even more like a interactive cutscene story game now more than ever, adventure game elements are really scarce here and the puzzle elements were too easy for even my liking.
<br>
<br>What lets this game down so much is the quite simply most abysmal PC port i&apos;ve seen from Telltale. Frame rates can get extremely low, especialy when you have to interact with the game outside story driven cutscenes, theres massive frame skipping problems, audio sync issues and huge freeze ups which at many times make the game borderline unplayable. I&apos;ve never had any major issues with the small problems their games have had in past, but here oh boy. Its quite insulting theyre still charging money from PC players with optimazations this god awful.
<br>
<br>All things considered i have to give it a 4, the optimazation problems this time are just too hard to ignore, if the port was properly done or fixed i would rate it a 7</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-the-telltale-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=6924118">Expand</a></span>

Didn&apos;t like it, or rather, my recommendation was to re-found it. Got a whole season as a gift and decided to give it another shot.
<br>Most of the bugs and technical issues I saw back when the first episode was out got fixed, the game keeps the resolution, bugs and glitches, although still there, aren&apos;t as prevalent and they&apos;ve fixed the controller issues on PC. Nice. Now bugs are mostly reserved for animations, like Batman&apos;s head looking to his let for a whole episode, to the point where it looked like he had a broken neck. Funny, but didn&apos;t happen after I tried to get it again to get a screenshot, so... good.
<br>Graphics look dated, animations are stiff and really funny (walk animations are just laughable!). In game assets are being reused for different locations and that&apos;s distracting. Sometimes audio just cuts off, that awkward silence, sometimes lip syncing is so bad that people talk without opening their mouths, sometimes dialogues refer to options I didn&apos;t pick in previous episodes, yet are considered as something I did anyway... There is a lot of bad here, but the meat is the story and characters...
<br>Story is predictable and boring, at this point perhaps, I&apos;m too familiar with Batman to be surprised by anything. Characters don&apos;t look like anything you&apos;ve seen, the designs aren&apos;t from any known incarnation of Batman making them rather forgettable and bland. Harvey Dent doesn&apos;t look like a district attorney but more like an athlete, Oswald Cobblepot is British despite being from Gotham and looks like any normal guy would, no deformities we associate with Penguin are present. Okay, the cast looks like they belong in Archer, Perhaps Telltale wanted to make a game in Archer universe, but got Batman instead...? The story and plot point are predictable and, in my opinion, too much is crammed into it. Did we really needed Two-Face so soon? Wouldn&apos;t it be better to keep him as Harvey, build up a relationship with Bruce then use Two-Face in season 2? The only character that faithful to the original is Catwoman and she&apos;s a blast whenever she&apos;s on screen, be it in costume or not.
<br>Overall, it&apos;s not bad, not great either. Telltale, at this point, should start changing their way, improving upon the formula that gave then success, yet they prefer to stick to what works, washing down all the good will build up until now. They need better writers and new animators, perhaps stop relying on QTE for action sequences and implement more player driven mechanic. I think Batman is a prime example of Telltale running out of creativity... I won&apos;t say to re-found this, but get it only if you&apos;re a huge Batman fan or if it&apos;s cheap as dirt. I got it as a gift from a friend as I would never buy it myself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-the-telltale-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=7494746">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Visually there&apos;s a noticeable bump from the older games due to Batman using Telltale&apos;s updated engine (not new, but improved). The QTE fight scenes flowed well and were enjoyable, kicking butt as Batman was satisfying. The voice work was top notch as always. The bottom line is Batman is a good Telltale game hurt by the usual technical issues that plague all Telltale games, so if you&apos;re a long time Telltale fan you&apos;ll be right at home.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/batman-the-telltale-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=7374884">Expand</a></span>
