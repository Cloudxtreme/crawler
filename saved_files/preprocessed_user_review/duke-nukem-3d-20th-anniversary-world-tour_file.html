Great variety from the famous city maps style to larger more elaborate ones like Egypt or a Greek Arena.
<br>
<br>Gunplay is fun as ever, doing the shotgun shimmy, the new Incinerator is fun too (if messy, leaves lava everywhere)! The new music by legend Lee Jackson is very cool by the way, has a John Carpenter vibe to it. Duke Match is great as ever, and the Workshop is starting to get going. Countless great user maps out there.
<br>
<br>On the remastering, I really dig the new renderer, the lighting adds a new sheen of quality (lighting done by Blum and Levelord), ambient occlusion is cool too. Framerate is butter smooth, Jon St. John&apos;s new Dukeisms are superb, some of the sounds like the pistol are a bit muffled but not distractingly so. In general this port looks great, plays great, could patch in a few more options, no complaints here. All around a great game here.
<br>
<br>Duke is back! New episode is the best thing going, every FPS dev should study these masters showing how it&apos;s done. Let&apos;s rock!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/duke-nukem-3d-20th-anniversary-world-tour/user-reviews?user_review_id=6745116">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>On the plus side, there&apos;s a bit more &quot;professional&quot; Duke to be played, soundtrack is pretty good, I like the mini boss idea, and the chronological play-history thing is very efficient and practical (no more save-load redundant reflex).
