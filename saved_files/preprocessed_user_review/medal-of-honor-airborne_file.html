The bad thing with this game is the short campaign, only 6 missions so the game ends very fast. But the replay value in this game is high so you will want to do the missions again and again because is really fun and you can unlock upgrades for your weapons and win some medals to the collection.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-airborne/user-reviews?user_review_id=79693">Expand</a></span>

However, I realize that often times these things are overlooked and that is why, as has been mentioned by EA staff members, a patch is already underway and has been before the game was released based on beta comments. All this aside, this game is great! To those who said it brought nothing to the WWII genre...are you kidding? Or maybe you haven&apos;t actually jumped out of a plane yet. With the option to parachute just about anywhere on the battlefield, it brings diversity to the game. But I guess you all like starting in the same point (wherever the last checkpoint you reached was). As for the sound...I have a decent 5.1 surround setup, but am using integrated mobo sound, and yet I STILL give the sound a 9. The sound of stones crumbling under your feet, wood creaking, parachute flapping and wind, bullets and yelling all in your face; what is not to like? As for the game play with respect to the realism aspect: yes the guns are not the most accurate. Let me remind you, its 1942, not 2142. And have any of you actually fired a 1945 U.S. Issued .45, or a Thompson? They kick like the devil! I will agree that the story line is not nearly as solid as one would except from the greatest war the world has ever seen. And as for the AI; I am not saying I am a world class FPS player, but i often had a bit of trouble pushing my way foreward and many times was saved by the duck and cover method. And for the graphics, well, if you want to play games in this new day and age of graphics/physics technology, you may need to step up your game and get a good card (or even a decent one like my Radeon X1950XT, it ain&apos;t the best but it plays the game on medium-to-medium-high superbly, makes the game look Amazing, and only cost about $200 now on NewEgg.) Overall this game is by far one of the better WWII games to be release in the last year and a half! Despite the problems, that will be fixed through an upcoming patch, you need to get this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-airborne/user-reviews?user_review_id=401879">Expand</a></span>

Now, there are problems (Hence the 9 rather then 10). There are a few bugs in the MP system and the first few levels of the game are a joke. The system where you redrop instead of having to load a new game is interesting and allows for the &quot;special&quot; drops, but doesn&apos;t really help with realism. The medal system for firearms is fun, trying to get each gun up to the top is not too challenging, but being stupid enough to charge a pillbox with a pistol provides for some crazy moments. I wish they added more weapon customization and did more to make a story out of the game. I felt no connection to my squad mates like I did in CoD. One of the most interesting parts of this game was aiming down the sights. The gun bucks and moves like it would in real-life, but more importantly there are a few more options for taking cover. You can&apos;t move, but you can duck, stand, and bend either direction without having a seperate set of keys. EA, put out more titles like this, please.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-airborne/user-reviews?user_review_id=401826">Expand</a></span>

I played it over and over again so much that I finally sold it thinking that I would never play it again, and about a year later I couldn&apos;t help myself I saw it and bought it again and I NEVER do that....that&apos;s how good this game is. It is really fun being able to land wherever you want on the map and do objectives in whatever order you want to do them. I thought that was cool, but what gets lost in the uniqueness of this game is how great the gameplay is. The crouching behind cover and leaning out to shoot or snipe is done better than any game I can think of, this is the only game that gets it right. It does not have very many missions but you can play them all so differently each time that the replay value is awesome, and your weapon upgrades come with how much you use that weapon, it doesn&apos;t automatically upgrade all you weapons for beating a mission, if you are good with the pistol it will upgrade itself the more kills you get with it, and its that way for all the weapons. Also, there are some difficult parts and it can be a challenge, so I give this awesome game a 10, I just wish Medal of Honor would do another one instead of pumping out lesser games like warfighter and stuff.....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-airborne/user-reviews?user_review_id=4565414">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>In my humble opinion, this is the best WWII era first person game ever. It avoids the &quot;on rails&quot; style of the COD series, which gives it nearly limitless replayability, as the open world approach really plays out different depending on how you approach the battles. Fantastic AI, sound effects, weapons, with tons of cool touches like motion blur/shake while running-very realistic.</span>

<br>
<br>However there are some major failings in this title. The first is the clumsy control system - it feels cumbersome and out dated. 
<br>
Second is the pitiful hit box detection - you can see you have a clear headshot (even with a sniper rifle) and low and behold you still miss - often. 
<br>
Third is the fact that the enemy soldiers all appear to be psychic. No matter where you attack or flank from, the enemy always know your there. And its only you they aim for - they will ignore your buddy in front of them to shoot at you even when your miles from them. Also they don&apos;t seem to have dodgy hit box problems - they will hit you even if its just your elbow toes poking out!
<br>
<br>Finally the last problem is the sheer repetitiveness  of the task in hand. Kill x number of enemy then blow something up. It seems only you were trained in explosives out of the entire US army in WW2. 
<br>
On the plus side the graphics and sound are great, and there is some fun to be had out of exploring the maps, however you may find this very short lived entertainment once the real gameplay flaws kick in. 
<br>
Really unless your a diehard WW2 junkie this game adds very little to the genre, and there are far superior FPS out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-airborne/user-reviews?user_review_id=74233">Expand</a></span>

In a way it is kind of a sandbox shooter, where you are allowed to do tasks one at a time and then start doing something else, but in any order you desire. So, you have to destroy Flak Cannons, Enemy tanks and secure the strategic building - you do it your way, paving your path the way you want it. In MOH:A there are about 10 to 15 weapons, including M1926 Thompson, Colt M1911, Kar98k, Gewehr  43, Mauser C712 and several others, which all have 3 levels of upgrades, each unlocking minor upgrade for the weapon. Very nice, exluding the fact, that some of these upgrades break the weapon absolutely! Take G43 - first upgrade is high-capacity mag (20 instead of 10), then its optics and after - GRENADE LAUNCHER... Why would I need my sniper rifle to become a GL? Not only previous two upgrades become useless but the GL itself is much less effective than thrown grenade! Add to this several bugs in which you stuck in interior and exterior and you get somewhat interesting at first, but very buggy game, which will hardly stay on your HDD for long.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-airborne/user-reviews?user_review_id=1592636">Expand</a></span>

The gun assortment is fairly small however they mostly feel different from eachother, but the upgrade system is very weak and feels so dated. The upgrades consist of grips, launchers, extended mags, and scopes. The airdropping is a nice touch, but really being able to land anywhere is such a small part of each mission as you&apos;re still going to go to the SAME position each time, it just gives you a chance to choose a starting point really. The AI is alright, however your friendly units are a disaster most of the time, they seem to want to just melee and get in your way. Enemy units seem to be balanced, they will notice you from long distances but they aren&apos;t insanely easy or difficult, and the game is overall easy on expert, besides the completely random panzerschrek and MG nest deaths which can be extremely annoying. Story is forgettable, the one thing they did well was the jump scenes in the beginning of each level and the locations, historically it&apos;s pretty accurate on its objectives and even the weather. Other than that there is no real story, just the briefings and jumps, it feels pretty bland. In terms of length, the mission count isn&apos;t the problem, it&apos;s the tediousness, every mission feels the same. The combat is decent, but ruined by clipping problems. I don&apos;t know whether the weapons are inaccurate or the hit detection is messed up, but a lot of times you won&apos;t hit your target when you&apos;re dead on. Nothing special, would get a 6 if it had better combat but as is it gets a 5, I&apos;d recommend you not to buy it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-airborne/user-reviews?user_review_id=2486817">Expand</a></span>

Many MOH fans will be upset when they get the game home and find out it won&apos;t run on their system. The quality of the graphics is high, but no more than a game like Oblivion. Only supporting a few high end cards is bound to come back and bite them.</span>

Bugs are all over the place (Such as Holing &apos;E&apos; does not always pick up the weapon advertised) and there is no name creation or even clan tag option. Seems like there is a lot of potential that now will be left to a long chain of promised patches that may or may not come. I don&apos;t think this is acceptable anymore.

There are some great things about this game. The duck and shooting. The recovering health after you get shot. When you shoot the enemy they figure out where you are at in the battle. The Italian mission which I think is the most fun mission of the entire game. That said here are some things that bother me. The game is kinda glitchy. You can tell the EA released the game in a rush. There are pieces of the map that look like a clipping problem. Anyone familiar with the days of Doom will know what I mean. Enemy soldiers don&apos;t act like a intelligent group. Although fun it gets kinda old to blow off someones head and then have man after man replace the last one. You have scattered body piles around the battlefield and I&apos;m no history buff but I doubt that Germans fell in piles on the WWII battlefield. Next the sniper rifle is maddening. If there is a fence in the way the bullet hole will appear floating in space on the fence. in front of the German! I sometimes have to fire many times to kill a enemy soldier even though it looks like I have a clear head shot! Lastly the most frustrating part of the whole game is the save system. I know that EA probably did this so that it would be more realistic. But If I wanted realism I would play Call of Duty and get my head blown off. How do they justify saving in the middle of the mission as unrealistic while you are picking up medikits and ammo pack conveniently situated thru each level!? This checkpoint save system sucks. It really does. First you have to trigger a specific checkpoint to save to that level. If you get an early checkpoint no dice. You get to parachute in again. yah. The level I played today I made it through 80% of the level and was killed. I restarted at the point I was at and then in the latter half i was shot dead by a German Sniper. Where do I start? Again the stupid parachute! After I had 2-3 upgrades on my guns! So I nearly finish the level and I have to do it all again. This one flaw takes so much fun and excitement away from the game. You can be duking in out in an intense firefight and boom you die and jump out of an airplane again! I don&apos;t even play after that I quit the game and exit. This is the one flaw that will stop people from ever wanting to finish out the game to 100%. I know after I win I will take the game and onto the shelf it will go.. EA needs to insist on a large level of play testing with these MOH games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-airborne/user-reviews?user_review_id=404900">Expand</a></span>

You can only climb with stairs, boxes or ladders so vertical play is mostly one-way (down) and even with airpdrop into game the game still feels linear and controled. With so many new FPS coming out soon, won&apos;t get my $50US.</span>

The good: Its a new WWII game that delivers the experience of paradroping onto a map filled with objectives to complete. Thats about it, just a new experience, but nothing new to the genre. The sound SFX. Bad: They said they had the most advanced AI. Wrong, these paratroopers are not even 1/100th of your skill level, they block you, and often melee enemies. They might as well be meatshields, as there are unlimited supplies of paratroopers for you. The enemy&apos;s AI is weak at most, they just use cover and shoot at you in predictable patterns. Rushing you when they have numbers is stupid as you just mow them down. They also tend to move up once you stop moving and thus allowing you to cut them down when they walk around corners like idiots. The hardest difficultly barely makes this game challenging, the shortness of having only 6 levels is laughable. The customization of weapons is cheap, like bioshock&apos;s, you get it when you level a weapon up by using it repeatedly. You cant actually make it non linear by choosing a landing spot. The medal system is weak as half the time you cant &quot;earn your wings&quot; as otherwise you have to repeatedly drop into the zone into the special landing areas. Hit detection is horrible, recoil is horrible (but that didnt stop me from headshotting everything). Yet another game that could have redefined the FPS genre like Bioshock but fails to do it by a lot. And of course, its lacking a solid storyline to save its own butt. But I said that about bioshock as well, as its story could have been good, but was paper thin.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-airborne/user-reviews?user_review_id=401459">Expand</a></span>

If it made the reall soldier experience, doing patrols, walking around, it would be quite intresting. some might conciter it dull, but it would be VERY relistic. 3) weapons. always a problem in WWII FPS&apos;s. they just arent accurate. I realize its a minor complant, but a Kar wouldn&apos;t reload just by manual reloading; charger clips would b used. if they dont change the goddamn thompson, ill be pissed. seriously, be norman and use a fuckin M1A1, not just an M1. otherwise, its pretty much the average WWII game. the airborne part is fun, but doesnt add much (ohh, i landed on a rooftop. extreme!). very recomended to people who have never played a FPS. of course, youre omish if youve never played a FPS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/medal-of-honor-airborne/user-reviews?user_review_id=401505">Expand</a></span>

Also the missions where you have to destroy tanks are again just funny. A normal person would go and search for a bazooka to destroy the tank with, but no... not a single of it anywhere so instead lets just toss grenades at the tank until it gets destroyed.
