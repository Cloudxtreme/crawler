Checkpoint saving is terrible, since there are really few checkpoints. The story is one big mess - don&apos;t even bother to really understand it. I still don&apos;t know which purpose the natives in the beginning served. Turn your brain off and do the mission. Speaking of mission: the last level is a big disappointment - easy and very short. But all in all this is good enough to kill some time but nothing I would play twice because I have an urge to collect all bonus items (= incomprehensible diaries) etc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=1468143">Expand</a></span>

The real surprise though is the on the ground vertical combat, which will have you trying to remember which way is up !  Sure, the story is tacky but the graphics are pretty good, the soundtrack is nice and the combat is great fun, if not up to Gears of War.  To the reviewer (sorry, fanboy) who says it&apos;s not up to Halo3 (in his words, &apos;the greatest game ever !&apos;) then that&apos;s down to taste.  I, for one, think Halo 3 is the most over-rated rubbish to have wasted my time on but I would pick Dark Void over the scurrying little alien drones in halo any day.  Give it a try, it&apos;s a fiver ffs !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=1451450">Expand</a></span>

It is very fun to use the jetpack to hover above the enemies shooting, throwing grenades. There are plenty of great shooting setups that make a good use of a very simple covering system. The thing is that in the end you start wondering what made you especially remember this game for. Well, not much.

Other then that it was a solid game but slightly lacket execution @LeoM Don&apos;t compare games like halo to this game, its not even the same genre.

Many state they were very disappointed in what they saw and how the game played overall. I usually wait for my fellow gamers and critic reviews before I purchase a game but for some reason I went ahead and bought the game. It took me a few moments to rearrange my keyboard mappings and mouse to the way I prefer but right off the bat I was thrown into a hellish aerial firefight with all kinds of alien and human craft darting in and out. I couldn&apos;t tell who was friend or foe while I struggled to figure out how to control the jetpack. I couldn&apos;t hit a goddam thing, only after I readjusted up the mouse sensitivity and made a few more keyboard changes was I able to make hits and take downs. I was finally able to jump on one of the alien spacecrafts and take it over just like in the slick looking previews. Anyway, my impression is that they worked really hard at getting the eye candy, audio and music just right but kinda left the story to fit in any where it could making it very thin. The upgrade feature feels tacked on, you collect blue, red or purple glowing orbs strategically scattered in inaccessible locations all over the levels. Find an orb you get points towards upgrading your weapons, pretty simple except the upgrade interface is overly simplistic and tt looks like it belongs in a indie game instead of one striving to be a first class FPS. It would have made more sense to implement a system like maybe finding and using alien tech laying around under bushes or trees and fashioning better gadgets and improved weapons then the one in place now. The Journal and its pages also seem like a poorly contrived plot device added to help move the idiotic storyline along. Apparently they&apos;re are provided to act as backfill for the story but all they seem to do is add more confusion to the already muddy plot. The most absurd sequence in the game occurs when both protagonists encounter the villagers for the first time and are introduced to Nikola Tesla. Neither one of them had the good sense to ask the most obvious, basic questions like &quot;Hey, How did you get here&quot;? or &quot;What the hell are those robot things and why the hell are you all running around half naked&quot;? or &quot;WHERE THE HELL ARE we&quot;? Instead we are treated to a cutscene where Tesla gives them both rocket jetpacks he somehow magically put together. Tesla gives them an important goal, shoves them out the door then promises more will be revieled later, weird. The game does have a nice open world feel to it, you&apos;re not prevented from exploring a good ways away from the beaten path. The AI enemies are pretty stupid, they just stand there taken hit after hit until they fall down. It takes a butt load of shots to drop one but by the time it does more enemies come boiling up out of no where takenb potshots at you, nice. Overall I&apos;m giving the game a 3 because of the poor storyline, stupid AI and tacked on weapons upgrade system. Don&apos;t drop $40.00 bones for this game like I did just rent it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=745351">Expand</a></span>

The TPS portion of the game is fine, but not innovative (save for the instances of &quot;vertical cover&quot; which are good but limit you to pretty much a predetermined path). The flying/jetpack sequences are better, that is once you get used to the wonky and somewhat unresponsive controls. (I used a keyboard and mouse, but I understand that a controller works better.) The graphics are adequate, but nothing to write home about. The story is weak and poorly presented (although the voiceover work is generally fine), and the game itself is very short; at most, maybe 6-7 hours of gameplay. The best part of the game, by far, is the soundtrack. All-in-all, the game is average, I enjoyed parts of it more than others, but I doubt I&apos;ll go back to it anytime soon, if at all. I do think that it&apos;s worth playing, if you can get it on big-time sale. At $40, it&apos;s overpriced.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=745356">Expand</a></span>

<br>Compared to most 3PS&apos;s, the enemies have slightly more health but all the machine guns are more accurate, which I feel is a much better system (you&apos;re fighting the enemies, not the weapon spread). Plus one-hit melee kills while standing or over/under cover for additional options. And the game is really good about recognizing and rewarding headshots. I tried to replay Gears of War 1 recently and got bored halfway through, but this just feels better.
<br>And the vertical cover system works great. If you&apos;re flanked from above and below by enemies, then whether you take cover above or below the ledges becomes a shifting element of strategy. Whether you mantle upward for melee kills at the risk of giving the enemies a better shot is another element of strategy. And frankly, it&apos;s just cool to see a killed enemy ragdoll toward you as it falls off a cliff.
<br>Compared to the Rogue Squadron series, the jetpack flight seems just fine to me. And the ability to zoom into a horizontal ground fight or hover out of vertical cover for better aim (a the risk of exposing yourself) adds another layer.
<br>The slugs-inside-robots aren&apos;t quite as interesting as the multi-destructable robots of Binary Domain (another underappreciated shooter), but they are unique(r) than most games. I like the exploding red guys that leave damaging large energy spheres.
<br>Also I don&apos;t get the criticisms about graphics. It&apos;s not the prettiest game in the world, but I think it looks good (especially compared to the average Xbox360 title), and I like the semi-cartoony 50&apos;s style art choices. Admittedly the environments repeat.
<br>I love this game and have recommended it, especially now that it&apos;s dirt cheap ($5 on Steam as of writing, but you really need an Xbox controller to enjoy it). Mostly I&apos;m just disappointed that a fun game (I would say 8.5/10) with a lot of great ideas won&apos;t get a sequel it really deserves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=3034776">Expand</a></span>

There is a few cool scenes and a few cool ideas but most of it is the same repetetive crap that you saw 10 minutes before but ina different location. The flight mechanic is a distaster. Fly straight up? You do a loop and go flying straight into the ground. It takes WAY too long to turn around and even aim properly. Often I found myself flying into my objective as I could not turn around. Even the camera goes all loopy on you when fly as it is very hard to keep your vision &quot;level&quot; so one second you are flying dead on, the next you are looking at a crooked angle and BAM you hit a wall. The sound track however, is freaking amazing. By far the best part of this game, if I had a chance right now, event hough I know it is being release soon, I would go buy the sound track to this game and get a refund on the game itself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=744392">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll give this game a 1/10 just for the concept; if not for that the game would&apos;ve been a 0. Usually I think most of the games here on Meta deserve a higher score. This one here though..... it deserves its score to be cut in 1/4s. For the life of me I can&apos;t see how it got anything above a 20. I **know** this review is very long, but if you&apos;re thinking about buying, you should honestly read it, it&apos;s worth it. It won&apos;t take up THAT much of your life. I was waiting for this game for months, and bought it the day it was released. Jetpacks and vertical combat? I gotta have it!! So far, I&apos;ve made it past the initial Jetpack scene and about 5 minutes of the FPS beginning.... thats about 10 minutes total, if that. I&apos;ve resigned myself to believethat buying it was just one of those mistakes you make when it comes to buying games. Wasting money is never fun but it happens. I&apos;ll start with the FPS half of the game. I didn&apos;t find much wrong with it except for the fact that, somehow, the game constantly made me nauseous after only a few minutes. The odd part about this is that Im an FPS vet and I&apos;m playing 4-5 of them every day right now as is usually the case. Therefore, it&apos;s not the fact that its an FPS with quick turn-arounds and the like, I just really don&apos;t know WHAT it could be :/ Now the flight.... *shakes head*. I have NEVER seen such horrible flight mechanics. I&apos;m absolutely SHOCKED that I haven&apos;t seen similar complaints in these reviews, I would be insanely surprised if it was just me who felt this way. Along with FPS and RPG games, flight games are my next fav so it&apos;s not flight itself that is making this so difficult. The controls (even customized (with my G19 gaming KB and G500 gaming mouse) as best as possible) and mechanics are just bottom-notch. It may be better with a joystick, but I didn&apos;t bother to try just to somewhat salvage this terrible game. The entire experience is an adventure into &quot;What the &amp;%$# is going on?!?! This is ridiculous!&quot;. The last thing I have to complain about, is very odd. I&apos;ve never come across this problem before in my life. I am a graphic/game designer, so I have a very high- end rig along with large monitors, and top of the line gaming peripherals (KB, mouse, gamepad, stick, headset, speakers.... this has a point). That being said, I have NEVER had to adjust the sensitivity of my mouse ingame before as I have way of doing it in realtime on my mouse and KB. This game however, required me to spend almost an hour tweaking the sensitivities of the mouse during ground and air movrments (each has its own sensitivities). That&apos;s a HUGE pain that completely takes away from the fun of the game. Even with the sensitivities tweaked as much as possible I STILL had to constantly use my DPI switcher depending on what I was doing at the time (running, aiming, platforming, free-flying, dog-fighting). Unforgivable.... Ridiculous. So I say to you few who read this insanely long review, or the people who just skipped to the last paragragh.... Avoid this game like the Black Plague. It had a good concept, but I&apos;ve never seen a game mess up a good concept so entirely. If you happen to be a masochist though.... this is the game for you, hands down. One of the worst games I&apos;ve ever bought, and I&apos;ve purchased more games than I can remember or care to admit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=746970">Expand</a></span>

The plot is a little silly and the game takes a while to get off the ground  but once you get the jet pack things become a lot more fun. Controls can be a bit of an issue as the thing handles like a greased piglet in flight, but I thought Dark Void had some very nice touches, worthy of special mention is Bear McCreary&apos;s soundtrack.</span>

The use of jet packs and .45 cal machine guns is very inventive but the overall plot is kind of lacking some realness.  All in all the game was fun, a bit to easy at times but still very fun. The flying battles were boring and repetitive and the final boss battle was too easy and was over before i knew it. Overall this game is a solid one, nothing that is a must have though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=2544300">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game does a some things SO well; the jetpack controls are tight, the vertical shooter gameplay is great, and you can approach missions from almost any angle to gain a tactical advantage. Unfortunately, it&apos;s ridiculously unfinished. The story is garbage (with thinly veiled stolen plot sequences from The Matrix), the missions have no build-up, and the transition between cutscene and gameplay never stopped being jarring. Also, the later levels were completely unfinished, with tiled textures being extremely obvious on completely flat terrain. Not to mention I finished the game in under six hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-void/user-reviews?user_review_id=6021972">Expand</a></span>
