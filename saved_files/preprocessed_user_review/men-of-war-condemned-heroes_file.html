<br>This could have been one of the better or best ww2 squad based action rts out there, but it fails fairly miserably due to poorly implemented basics.
<br>Veterans of the game may say otherwise, but if you&apos;re a newbie to the genre, there are better offerings out there like Relic&apos;s Company of Heroes. If you&apos;re a sucker for punishment, then try one of the many Men of War iterations. However, stay clear away from Men of War Vietnam, as that is the worst of the entire franchise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/men-of-war-condemned-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=2486094">Expand</a></span>
