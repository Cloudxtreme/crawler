<br>About as fun to play as watching paint dry
<br>Now don&#x2019;t get me wrong, Armello is a great strategy board game with many layers to make this game potentially insanely addictive, but it&#x2019;s problem is it&#x2019;s pacing.
<br>There are 4 heroes on the board at a time, now not only are there 4 heroes, there is a king, 3 guards and sometimes multiple banes.. and you have to sit through all of the these characters turns and it becomes dreadfully boring quickly.
<br>To be fair, heroes can play cards on each other at any time and the king makes decrees but an optional fast forward button absolutely needs to be patched into this game at least in single player, with a force pause when a character plays a card that affects you, there really is no point in waiting for what feels like an eternity to go again, there is already a tab that allows you to check the current stats of the other 3 heroes you are competing against.
<br>Other than the dreadfully slow paced gameplay, Armello is a wonderful game.
<br>Every character has their own bonus perks and starts out each game with a mission that they can
<br>go towards for cards, companions, gold, and prestige to help further their odds of winning this chance based strategy game. After you&#x2019;ve completed a mission, you&#x2019;re then given a choice of the mission you want to go for next, but these missions are completely optional, there are tons of strategies that can be used to win the game.
<br>You can use your gold to activate combat and trickery cards, and can use your magic to activate magic cards.
<br>You are allowed to draw cards every turn assuming you have less than 4 cards available to play
<br>If you don&#x2019;t want a certain card you can burn it in battle for a guaranteed attack or a guaranteed shield
<br>or really to just free your hand for hopefully a better draw.
<br>Combat cards will boost your combat skills,
<br>Trickery and magic cards can be used either on individual heroes or effect a section of the board.
<br>These hurdles can hinder the other heroes in their quest, which is a good thing because you can also gain gold and prestige by killing other heroes, by claiming villages on the board, by killing banes, or exploring ruins.
<br>By being the character with the highest prestige, you get to choose the decree the king makes, this decree can effect the entire board or just a few, which does include you
<br>If the king dies by the rot before a character can defeat him, you will also win the game.
<br>The rot can be a good or a bad thing depending on your strategy.
<br>You get the rot by playing cards or losing a battle against banes, if you get up to 5 bane your character becomes corrupted, and like the king, every dawn you lose 1 health, but by defeating other character you gain 1 health. And dying isn&#x2019;t all too bad here in armello,
<br>if you die you aren&#x2019;t out of the game, you just go back to your starting space.
<br>To win with the rot, you simply get your rot higher than the kings is, you attack the kingdom and defeat him in battle.
<br>You can also just straight up attack the king to win or collect all 4 spirit stone to cure him.
<br>I really love the game of armello, I want to pour hours and hours into this board game
<br>But I feel like it doesn&#x2019;t respect my time enough and in the current state it&#x2019;s in I just can&#x2019;t
<br>For being a game, you do a lot more waiting than you do playing, and that&#x2019;s a huge issue
<br>For what it is
<br>Strategy Boardgame:
<br>8.5/10

Granted, there&apos;s a huge luck factor... it&apos;s a board game, after all. But there is enough casual strategy to keep you interested. You unlock more options as you go along, and you can combine those options with characters better suited to capitalize on them, giving you a considerable higher chance of winning. But the underdog can still win, and luck can still desert you... and that&apos;s part of the fun! The DLC gives you even greater character options and better aesthetics, but the base game is solid, and there are no real microtransactions that affect anything important. (You can buy cosmetic dice, but you certainly don&apos;t need to, for instance.) The graphics are great, the music is great, and the gameplay is solid. Single player is fun, but the real fun is in multiplayer, and the limited conversation options and recommendations system keeps it clean and fun for everyone. If anyone ever played the wonderful but short-lived Key Quest on Neopets, this game is like a brilliant step-child of that game, with board game elements, fantasy elements, plenty of luck, a little strategy, and a brooding but cute anthropomorphic cast of characters that somehow brings the brutal but adorable Watership Down to mind. But I digress. If you like the genre, the game is... well, at the top of its game. Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/armello/user-reviews?user_review_id=6818994">Expand</a></span>

Yea, i would also want it to be a strategic game, i love strategies, but it was intended to be BOARD GAME. As far as i played, most of board game are based on throwing dice, and it&apos;s mostly how you play them.
<br>For a game, it looks great, it sounds great, gameplay is nice. Unfortunetly there is no story.</span>

<br>Waaaay to much luck
<br>AI always try to hinder me and not the AI that are close to winning
<br>To slow watching AI turns.

<br>Interesting to see *the thing that never happens* that professionals dont have any critics about what the game even though everyone else have the luck as a issue for example.

<br>Armello has some similarities to Talisman, in that a way to win is in the middle of the board, but you need to improve your character&apos;s stats and gather useful equipment before you have any chance at it.
<br>
<br>However, killing or curing the king hardly ever happens as you have to be incredibly lucky for either to be feasible, so pretty much every time the game will run out of turns and the player who happens to have the highest prestige wins.
<br>
<br>Winning or losing is almost entirely based on luck. Meaningful decisions don&apos;t really come up, each player will tend to do their own thing, clicking on the next &apos;quest&apos; and hoping to randomly have the most prestige when the game ends.
<br>
<br>Quests and encounters consist of a random die roll. Most of your time is spent waiting for the other players to take their turns, more so even than most other board games thanks to all of the neutral units taking their turns.
<br>
<br>In general it is just rather shallow, dull and repetitive.
<br>
<br>I love board games but there are many other board games, both physical and digital, that are better and cheaper than this one.
<br>
<br>However the 2D artwork is gorgeous and the in-game graphics and animations are nice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/armello/user-reviews?user_review_id=5458644">Expand</a></span>

The sound design is pretty weak and the levels are all over the place. Maybe they will improve it as time goes on.  I think you are better off with something else for the time being.</span>

<br>The problem is, there&apos;s just too much luck. This is like playing a slot machine. I played my heart out for 8 turns and got nowhere. Then I picked up a lucky card that grants you 1 prestige per turn for 3 turns...and 4 turns later I won the game.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a shame, because there&apos;s so much to like. The idea is unique (to me, anyway) playing different characters is fun, the sound is great, the game is enjoyable to look at.
<br>
<br>But the thing about strategy games is...they have to be about using your mind to win, and this isn&apos;t. There&apos;s no doubt strategising helps *a little*, but it&apos;s overwhelmed by luck.
<br>
<br>If they could make the game less dependent on luck, I&apos;d be willing to give it 9 or 9.5 (The game area itself is very small too in terms of hexes and quickly feels cramped, you see everything in a few turns.)
<br>
<br>I found this game very fun to play at first, but quickly lost interest. They need a bigger game board, a longer game and more things on the board (currently bare terrain, a settlement, or a stone ring....not much variety.)
<br>
<br>If they can make a few changes, they&apos;d have a real winner on their hands. As it is, it just isn&apos;t a strategy game. Giving it and eight anyway because it&apos;s fun for a while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/armello/user-reviews?user_review_id=5458331">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There are supposed to be various ways to win, but unless someone has a lot of blind luck, the game time will run out and whoever happens to have the highest Prestige value wins.
<br>
<br>You constantly have to wait for all your opponents and NPCs to take their turns and that takes a very long time.
<br>
<br>The supposed RPG elements are non-existent.
<br>
<br>The videos and artwork are very pretty but they don&apos;t make a good board game alone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/armello/user-reviews?user_review_id=5455745">Expand</a></span>

After a few hours of unfocused trodding on a map at the mercy of the RNG, you will shelve the game, never to return.

<br>Think Talisman, with better lore and graphics, blurred and bloomed to hell, with more directions to go.

<br>
<br>For me personally - i respect the game as it is programmed on PC. I see that it seems to be very well done. I just do not care for the actual &quot;game&quot;. Its like getting a near perfect PC version of Monopoly where you can safely say &quot;yes - that is how it should look and feel like on PC!&quot; - but simply not liking Monopoly.
<br>
<br>A game session is nice and short (however - too long for just a very quick casual burst) - the AI ... well.... does not seem to play impartial but tends to team up against the player (at least in solo player mode)
<br>It does sometimes feel like the AI either has a ton of luck on rolls and encounters - or simply cheats a little.
<br>
<br>In terms of design - i would have liked a much much longer experience to get to know the hero one is playing - as well as the other players heroes. I have played it a few times - and caught myself simply not caring for the lore, the background in general - or whats actually going on at all. - In short - i am not immersed in the game and the game does not make an effort to immerse me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/armello/user-reviews?user_review_id=5477404">Expand</a></span>

<br>Playing solo campaigns, I tend to ensure that Quick AI is turned on to help speed things up. In multiplayer sessions, you do have to wait on your opponents, but that&apos;s standard fair of any multi-player turn-based game.
<br>One of the things that takes this down a few notches is the lack of couch co-op. It would be really nice to play a game with my friends while they&apos;re at my house and not have to be on separate systems.
