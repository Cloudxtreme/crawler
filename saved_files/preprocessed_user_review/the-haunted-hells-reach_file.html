If that&apos;s what you want look elsewhere. Do you like a challenging shooter/survival game that has you frantically shooting and dodging demons? This game was created for people like you! Not to mention it&apos;s decently priced, and I just haven&apos;t gotten sick of decapitating demons after the tens of hours I&apos;ve spent in the game so far. Some highlights are:<br><br>Visuals are great.<br>Levels are very different and fun. Controls are good (love queuing up combos between shooting).<br>No story (plus or minus depending on your taste). Free DLC later (yes please). Challenging difficulty (you will have to work up to normal or hard).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-haunted-hells-reach/user-reviews?user_review_id=1816329">Expand</a></span>

You should definitely pick this game up for a good time! And the developers are incredibly nice should you ever need to contact them! Two thumbs up! :]</span>

If I want a story, Ill read a book.  In the meantime, I enjoy running around playing explode-a-minion as there isn&apos;t anything more satisfying than ridding the world of hell&apos;s minions in a beautifully bloody, gory fashion.  For a small Indie Dev team, they did an awesome job.  This game offers free updates, free DLC and plenty of modding support.  It&apos;s 20 bucks well spent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-haunted-hells-reach/user-reviews?user_review_id=1858719">Expand</a></span>

Even on easy mode the game is challenging enough to keep you engaged; you&apos;ll be dying frequently until you figure out how to manage your ammo.  The blend of gunplay and melee action keeps the game fresh as it relentlessly throws hordes of demons at you.  There isn&apos;t a great deal of variety in the enemies, but the map and weapon design is superb, ensuring you won&apos;t quickly get bored decapitating the undead.  The game is a steal at $20, but make sure you&apos;re able to talk some friends into buying it as well because it&apos;s no fun alone.  It&apos;s nice to see an indie developer release a real game instead of some cutesy side-scroller for once.  Great games with production value can be made on an small budget and I hope the rest of the indie community takes a page from The Haunted: Hell&apos;s Reach&apos;s book.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-haunted-hells-reach/user-reviews?user_review_id=1926143">Expand</a></span>

You get an arcade-style beat&apos;em-up. You get a third-person shooter. You get violence of a wholly-new level (rolling and uppercutting a minion, only to break his torso off tells you you&apos;re not in a game for the faint-of-heart). You get 4 demon-crushing heroes, each with their own personalities, their own glib remarks, and their own salt for adding to the atmosphere of the game.<br><br>Running into Inferno mode, you square off against ever-increasingly difficult waves of enemies. They drop HealthStones on occasion to heal you - keeping you active, in the brawl, and a functioning killer. Then, a random ChronoStone drops and you scramble to destroy it - or face brutal environmental hazards like Thunderstorms, Acid Rain, Flies, or even worse... it motivates you to keep moving, keep killing, and have fun. Similar games try hard, but fall short of TH:HR&apos;s sheer brutality, minion killing inspiration, and variety of enemies to dispatch. But with friends to back you up, TH:HR can be one of the most fun games you&apos;ll have for a mere $20.00 USD (Steam as of 01/04/2012).<br><br>The graphics are simply gorgeous; the Unreal 3 engine powers through a wild display of surreal environments, from desert Canyons to Mining outfits, to lost temples and even excavation sites. The level count initially had me worried; but the sheer size and replayability of each level more than compensates for this. With hidden weapons, and attention to detail, each level will have you worried over it&apos;s unique environmental hazard, while you take in the sights afforded by the engine.<br><br>The music is very unique, fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly, and crafts a mood of both despair and adrenaline-soaked furious combat, all in one package with superb execution and timing.<br><br>Gameplay controls are offered for both the typical keyboard and mouse setup, or even the XBOX360 controller. With the 360&apos;s controls, the game becomes a snap, and the seamless transition between melee combat and blasting off that minion&apos;s head behind you with your pump-action shotgun become second-nature. Fighting long enough will build up weapon experience, allowing you to upgrade weapons wholesale; a simple pistol becomes a burst pistol, a UMP-like weapon becomes a Colt Commando-like weapon. The upgrade system even applies to your close-quarters-combat (CQC) weapon, which can dispatch enraged and tough minions.<br><br>The attention to detail in minions also shines; everything from large hulking minions carrying spiked clubs, to minions wearing helmets so you can&apos;t headshot them, to minions barfing toxic acid on you can be found. The combination of these different characters meshes well, and genuinely disencourages blind melee attacks or using only projectile weapons. It&apos;s clever, inventive, and invokes varied gameplay with a touch of ingenuity.<br><br>As for Co-Op, there&apos;s few games that give us what we want nowadays. You can have coop online with some games; but no dedicated servers. A slap in the face for any PC gamer. You can have dedicated servers, but then the gametypes offered might not be coop. You might have both; but then you get stuck with a peer-to-peer system with no choice out. Or - you could be playing The Haunted: Hell&apos;s Reach, which offers us dedicated servers, easy-to-use peer-to-peer hosting, or even a friends-exclusive match to ensure your friends get their slots. TH:HR did very well here, catering to the PC gamer and giving us what we need most in our network games; flexibility and CONTROL.<br><br>All-in-all, this is an outstanding game through-and-through. I bought the game on discount, but it is very well worth the $20.00 USD admission price. With friends joining in (or if you&apos;ve sprung for the 4-pack) it becomes a running riot, sure to entertain you again and again. Games of this value and this magnitude are seldom and few between.<br><br>Check out TH:HR. It&apos;s worth every penny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-haunted-hells-reach/user-reviews?user_review_id=2089118">Expand</a></span>

Whoever said this game is ugly and has bad graphics is either blind or stupid. It&apos;s a rough, dark and demon-filled world and the developers did a great job displaying that with the graphics. They aren&apos;t top-notch but still good.<br><br>You got 4 unique characters, all with badass quotes the old school duke would be proud of. But if you expect a more in depth character development or some sort of story, this game is nothing for you.<br><br>The gameplay is very challenging and I mean VERY challenging. It&apos;s not just a Killing Floor like run around and shoot freaks kinda gameplay. You have to use evasive moves, combine them with one of several unique melee attacks, use your guns to keep away the horde before you finish the foe you knocked down a second ago. It&apos;s not just a 3rd person shooter. You can combine melee attacks and weaponkills to chain some combos and achieve a much higher score through that. This game is so hard that the devs had to implement a &quot;beginner&quot;-difficulty, because &quot;easy&quot; just wasn&apos;t easy enough for most of the players (by that I mean, that learning the game and all the melee mechanics was quite hard on easy, but it was still possible).<br><br>To bring in some facts, this game has 5 difficulty leves (beginner, easy, normal, hard, nightmare) and believe me when I say that the last 2 difficulties are really worth their name. There are 2 coop modes (up to 4 players), Inferno and Survival. In Inferno you have to survive 4 rounds, while each round requires to kill a specific amount of baddies (depending on how many players are on the server) + between all the kills you have to look out for randomly spawning blue stones, that you have to destroy quickly in order to prevent a unique and hazardous environmental event (different on each map), which makes killing and surviving extremly difficult. After those 4 rounds you end up facing a huge endboss, which isn&apos;t that hard to beat, but can deal quite a huge amount of damage if you don&apos;t pay attention.<br><br>Survival mode is just what you would expect from a survival mode: survive as long as possible. Every few minutes a healthstone spawns to help you survive. Blue stones don&apos;t spawn, instead the hazardous environmental events I mentioned before just happen and you can&apos;t prevent them.<br><br>If I remember correctly there are 2 pvp-kinda modes, which also allow you to command and take control of demons, in order to beat up other human players.<br><br>The Haunted: Hells Reach had a few little starter problems when it was released, but those were disposed quickly. The game now runs pretty stable and I&apos;ve yet to see any bugs.<br><br>To summarize a few finished thoughts I have:<br>I did not expect this game to be a graphic-fest with epic story and in depth gameplay. And you shouldn&apos;t either. Hells Reach is more an arcade&apos;ish game. You start it, join a server or create a listen server yourself, beat up some demons and stop playing anytime if you want. You are not bound to anything like savegames or things like that. If you enjoy beating up strange creatures in a bloody, dark and gory way, then this game is what you need. If you like hard games, getting better at them and mastering them, this game is what you need. And if you like highscore games, trying to beat your friends with all your heart, always striving to get a better and longer combo to get the best out of your highscores, then you better get on steam and buy this game now. Did I mention that this game is freaking cheap?

<br>It&apos;s a third-person shooter and a very good one too!  The game does not hold your hand, it is difficult but it&apos;s a lot of fun too.
<br>
<br>The maps are very big and the horde are a constant stream that will attack you mostly non-stop until you complete you complete each section, you also have environmental disasters (fog, thunder and lightning, etc.) which can be avoided if you can find and destroy the chronostone which will spawn in a random area several times during each phase, you&apos;ll then face the end of game boss, Abaddon, very tough but a nice challenge too.
<br>
<br>The weapons are also very nice to use, from the single handgun to the akimbo shotguns, RPG, mini-gun, akimbo uzi&apos;s and the deadly arsonator, etc.
<br>
<br>You can choose 1 of 4 characters to play as, each with their own characteristics and dialogue, you also have melee attacks for close-range battles and can pick up different types of grenades/dynamite during each phase which are scattered throughout the level.
<br>
<br>The levels are well designed and one of the things I like about this game.
<br>
<br>A low score that is undeserved in my opinion!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-haunted-hells-reach/user-reviews?user_review_id=2125839">Expand</a></span>

Might also be something to work on, or maybe it&apos;s simply a matter of time and practice. I was skeptical about the 3rd person view before the game was released, but I have not been dissapointed. KTX did a great job making this game, and with the next patches this game surely deserves a 9 :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-haunted-hells-reach/user-reviews?user_review_id=1818181">Expand</a></span>

<br>Cons: Upgraded weapons go away after each game, no leveling up or perks outside of match, Inferno is not fun when the entire level is filled with flames that slowly kill you. Difficulty is not balanced. Easy should be Normal Normal should be Hard and Hard should be suicide. Game is too frustrating when you die every 3 seconds with virtually no pacing placed in the game. Wave 2 is just as hard as Wave 4. I actually spoke to one of the developers on their website pre game release and suggested that they add in a leveling and stat up system. I felt that this was really what the original mod was lacking. He said that it was a good suggestion and that they already implemented a upgrade system. Well they did add one and its completely useless. People dont enjoy pointless shooters anymore. Unreal tournament and Quake era are long gone. They should have listened to me and made the game more rewarding. They should use this is a lesson. Killing floor was succesful because it had a certain charm and it was very addictive to level up. This game will be dead in 3 months because people will lose interest. They will really have to add in some kind of a leveling system, fix the diffculty, fix the pacing, and add new game modes to try to keep their gaming crowd.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-haunted-hells-reach/user-reviews?user_review_id=1816389">Expand</a></span>

You will be launched into a world, with no obtrusive story line poking it&apos;s head in to annoy you between levels, and certainly not gigabytes of bland videos to fill your HD that you watch once and never bother with again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-haunted-hells-reach/user-reviews?user_review_id=1810640">Expand</a></span>

I can&apos;t explain why, except it&apos;s unusually satifsying to get that squishing noise when you crush them. But it&apos;s ugly, the monsters are dreary, it&apos;s repetitive, it&apos;s limited, and its controls are awkward as hell. Granted, these guys are new. I take that into account. Perhaps I was hoping for the jaw-dropping visuals and frights of Painkiller or Doom 3. So many little issues that screw it up - and yet it&apos;s a fun distraction and stress release with its very basic and sometimes goofy kill-fest. Unfortunately, that&apos;s all there is to it. No back story, no context, no cool hidden stuff to find, just a few maps (which aren&apos;t that interesting), hoaky monsters, ....and plenty of annoyances with the way you do battle. It&apos;s insanely awkward to aim your weapons, so you rely on kicks and punches. Those attack combos are odd and way too many of them to learn. The camera view - sort of third person, over the shoulder - is a bit wonky and headache-inducing. I far prefer the way the new Tron works in that regard, or even the latest Transformers. Misses the mark on so many levels - and yet it can still be a kick to play when you want something mindless. It&apos;s like craving and then porking out on bad candy - fun for a while, but you can get stomach sick and sick of it fast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-haunted-hells-reach/user-reviews?user_review_id=2091754">Expand</a></span>
