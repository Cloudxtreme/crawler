There are also misc items you find such as &quot;skull&quot; with the description of &quot;a skull&quot;.Another non feature of the game is the skill tree, skill palm tree is a more apt name as really you just assign your points down the obvious linear path not really branching off to other choices as there are no real choices in this game on any level,run through and spam attack anything in the way,that&apos;s your ability.As for going to town to sell, forget it, haven&apos;t seen anything like that, you just run into merchants that are awkwardly standing in a corner of the dungeon,guess the monsters must not mind them.All in all spend a few more bucks and grab torchlight 2, as this no depth game will appeal only to the most brainless adventurer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/realms-of-ancient-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2694055">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Story: It feels like they used dozens of generic placeholders while meaning to replace them with a real story before launch, but they never got around to it. You know the type of placeholders I&apos;m talking about, &quot;For reasons unknown&quot;-esque. When the playable character speaks, their personality feel extremely off. Boo. 2/10 They also reuse phrases and words; The word &quot;bogged&quot; apparently is the creators&apos; favorite word.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: The gameplay is decent, but certain skills feel a bit off; Perhaps the fault lies with the unchangeable controls for certain skills rather than the skills themselves. (Having to hold shift for a brief period to charge, but with no indication on when a spell is fully charged makes it awkward to use these skills.) One of the few nice feature is the ability to [minor spoiler] possess foes    [/spoiler]    but the limitation is only certain enemies and at certain times, which makes the feature something that could have made the game special to offset the story, but nope.
<br>
<br>Graphics: Some levels look as if it was designed by a brilliant artist, while some look like they... well... They look as if they blew their budget on the other levels and had to get an unpaid intern who just wanted something to write down in past experiences for future job applications. The levels are also some of the most generic places you will ever see.
<br>
<br>All in all, If you&apos;re the type that focuses more on the Diablo-esque gameplay instead of a game&apos;s story and the game is on sale below $5, meh, make that for &#xA2;99 you might want to pick it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/realms-of-ancient-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3641744">Expand</a></span>

<br>4&gt; Poor itemization.
<br>5&gt; No meaningful description of stats, and their uses.
<br>6&gt; Absolutely no character customization as the game all but requires you spam AoE skills (on every class) to avoid certain death whilst surrounded by monsters.
<br>7&gt; Almost no range in monsters-when my player character commented &quot;Again?!&quot; I saw it as a sign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/realms-of-ancient-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3643921">Expand</a></span>

The game is a simple hack and slash RPG, easy to play, not much thinking required. You could draw a parallel to comedy movies: you have comedies with very deep storylines and you have these college comedies that only involve the regular booze, sex and love. Then you also have RPGs where in games like Diablo, Path of Exile and Torchlight you need to put much thinking into the skill build (or item build concerning Diablo 3) and can enjoy a rich storyline. Realms of the Ancient War fits in the college comedies category: it is an RPG that requires no thinking, just hack and slash. The game is short enough to get away with that.
<br>
<br>The best part of the game is that it is not too short and not too long to keep it enjoyable and the level design is fairly nice. The game does miss points on storyline though. Characters and regions do not even get a name, you have &quot;Northern king&quot;, the &quot;king of the North&quot;, &quot;Eastern king&quot; the &quot;king of the East&quot; etc. Also it is impossible to &apos;grind&apos; levels in this game, because it seems like you only receive XP in the latest level. It is also not worth it to bother much with items, because the items seem to be in certain set tiers. There is no rare loot, there are just these item tiers. Eventually you&apos;ll have to upgrade and you just buy the set from a shop. Nothing in this game really rewards you, only the progress of the storyline. Furthermore there is no after-game, there is nothing to continue with when your character completes the game. Therefore, again, it is not worth it to bother much with skill builds or item builds. Finally a small negative point I have is that in the Steam version of the game, you can only complete all achievements if you are able to connect an xbox controller, so for me, having no controller, even hunting achievements was not worth it.
<br>
<br>To summarize, the game is enjoyable but lacks all depth that you can get from other RPG games. Fortunately the game is short enough to keep it enjoyable for one playthrough. 15&#x20AC; for the game is quite a lot though seeing it has no replay value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/realms-of-ancient-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3662345">Expand</a></span>

If you want a good hack and slash buy Torchlight or Torchlight 2.

Also add lack of area map of any kind, very few different kind of monsters and walking back great distances to complete side quests. There are no portals to travel, no clever tricks to employ, nothing - you just walk straight, killing mobs and hoping that another horde spawned behind your back won&apos;t kill you while you are dealing with adversaries ahead of you. There always *that* haunting feel that devs tried to make this game as unlikeable as possible.
<br>
<br>Still, I give this game 5/10 because it might come in handy when taking a break from more complex games like Torchlight 1 / 2</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/realms-of-ancient-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2716457">Expand</a></span>

The story in the game is not the worst we&apos;ve seen so far, in all honesty it&apos;s fairly interesting and one of the stronger points of the game. The game starts years after the so called Ancient War which divided the land to 4 territories (East, West, South and North...duh, imagination at its best). The Northern King proposed truce so he invited the remaining kings to the Hero&apos;s Garden. Something went wrong because the Northern King was never to be seen again and the rest of the kings became soulless zombies. Yes, clich&#xE9;s after clich&#xE9;s, but it&apos;s not all that bad. The game contains some witty dialogues and turns.
<br>
<br>We can pick from 3 unnamed characters: wizard, warrior and rogue. Each have different styles but they aren&apos;t that different that any would change the gameplay significantly. Each class has it&apos;s own skill tree, where you can level up your attacks. There are 1 level and 3 level skills. Skills open up gradually. The first group right after the beginning of the game, the second after you reach lvl 10, the last after lvl 20. However, there are two problems related to your skill management. First, in every stage you can gain exactly one level. No matter how much you fight or how many side quest (there aren&apos;t that many) you complete. You can only get 1 skill point in each stage. That makes the whole level grinding procedure useless and dropping all the challenge. You will get your skill point no matter what.
<br>
<br>The second problem comes with the use of your skills. You have only 4 skills at your use at a given time. Two of them are to be activated with the mouse and two with keystrokes on the keyboard. You can program these skills to the aforementioned buttons. If you want to use other skills you have to use the alternative set. Essentially you have 2 sets of skills, which can be changed at any time with a button push. Easy enough, in theory at least. Practice is a different beast. Remembering which skill you have assigned to which button in which set is pointless, painful and horrible. When a dozens of foes are attacking you there is no way this system can be use properly. Using this method is understandable on consoles where there are limited buttons to use, but on a PC it&apos;s unacceptable. This is where you realize that 4 skills/attacks are well enough to complete the game.
<br>
<br>At least the fighting and hack&apos;n slashing is exciting. You are continuously attacked by tens of enemies, making the game challenging and intense. Sometimes it is hard to hit smaller enemies, like spiders which live everywhere, rain forests or volcanoes it doesn&apos;t matter for them. Graphically the game doesn&apos;t excel, but it&apos;s not bad either. For an XBLA title it&apos;s passable. Not are the audio tracks though. Audio effects are horrible and repeating. Listening to the same 3 grindings throughout 8-10 hours when you hit enemies is annoying. The music is on par with the rest of the audio. You get one passable song which plays when you start the game, the rest of the music tracks during gameplay are just pointless burrs.
<br>
<br>R.A.W. is a below average hack and slash game that tries to build upon it&apos;s great predecessors of the genre but fails in every possible way. It&apos;s chaotic, mediocre and boring. A game that is hard to recommend when you can get a dozen of it&apos;s kind cheaper (or even for free). If you can finish it once there is no point starting the game ever again.

But they have absolutely no purpose to exist. Everything &quot;Realms of Ancient War&quot; offers has been done before and executed far better. If I was asked to name the most generic hack-and-slasher, this would be it. There is nothing about game that is particularly bad, the most accurate word to describe the game&apos;s quality would be mediocre: 3 classes (Rogue,Warrior,Mage), a story that exists just for the sake of it ( I don&apos;t even remember what the plot was about as I am writing this review), generic characters, you click on the generic monsters to slaughter them with your generic weapons to collect generic loot and complete generic quests. While the ARPG isn&apos;t the most innovative genre, at least most hack-and-slashers posses at least one unique quality, but not this game. The only thing remotely original is the visual design in a few areas, that&apos;s it. &quot;Realms of Ancient War&quot; is a waste of code and money, nothing can justify it&apos;s existence. People need to stop being so lenient to generic games.Bland garbage like this deserves nothing more than a 0/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/realms-of-ancient-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=4367966">Expand</a></span>

Has a really good feel with a controller, great art style, and I liked the streamlined progression system compared to the overly complex, smoke and mirrors pathways of other games.
