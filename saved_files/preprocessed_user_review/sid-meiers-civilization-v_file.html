First off, as of 2 days after the release of the game I have logged 16 hours of play time. About 12 of them on 2 to 4 player multiplayer games and the rest on single player.<br><br>Civilization V is an amazing game, but it is not without its faults. The combat system is amazing. The use of hexes and the fact that only one unit of each type can be on a hex opens the game up to much more challenging combat as well as unique tactics. However, while the combat system is very nice, the computer never uses any tactics when attacking you. Making defeating the enemies in all situations a cakewalk.<br><br>The new culture system is also very nice. The removal of religion and civics will definitely annoy some, but the new system of policies is a pretty good replacement. One is forced to plan ahead by timing the construction of wonders, settlers, and military units to coincide with the adoption of new policies. The new method of expanding ones border is also very interesting, a combination of culture and gold. Gold allows to choose what tiles you wish to buy, while culture automatically claims tiles for you. The AI is typically pretty good about picking the best places, but you can always buy up the places you really want if its going too slow. My biggest complaint for this game is the very very very spotty diplomacy system. For a game that was made with the intention of being more diplomatic and AIs are uncommonly aggressive. Diplomacy is now like taking a shot in the dark. You have a good idea of how to lower it, very little idea of how to raise it and absolutely no idea about how you stand with the other nations. In the previous Civ games my favorite way to win was diplomatic victory. Now, having tried for 5 to 6 games and having not succeeded even once, I&apos;m starting to question if its even possible. If someone figures out the diplomacy system, without the use of a guide, please let me know. Another complaint I have with the game is the very bad multiplayer support. You can&apos;t save a multiplayer game, only autosave, and the autosave is not very reliable and is prone to self deletion. Having lost 4 to 5 current games with my friends, this is annoying to say the least. Furthermore I have yet to figure out how to play mods on multiplayer, someone let me know when they figure it out? For a game that comes from a long line of epic multiplayer friendly games, this is a huge disappointment. Many of my friends have already said they&apos;re not gonna waste anymore time on this game until the multiplayer aspect is fixed. Yet, if you don&apos;t mind single player games. Or if you don&apos;t mind multiplayer games that you&apos;ll almost never finish. I actually enjoyed the single player games and unfinished multiplayers to refine my strategy (But I am an addict). This is the pinnacle of turn based strategy games, and the design of the game itself outweighs most of the negatives that come from stupid AIs, horrible diplomacy, bad multiplayer support (all of which I hope will be fixed by patches). But until they do, this is not worthy of the legacy of Civilization. For now, a 7 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1378739">Expand</a></span>

Yes that&apos;s how oldschool I am in terms of Civ. AND LET ME MAKE CLEAR THAT I HAVE PLAYED WELL OVER +100 HOURS FOR CIVILIZATION 5, I have tried my absolute best to try and love this game but I am sorry to announce that I have FAILED MISERABLY. Okay here are two different reviews: 1) YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED A CIV GAME BEFORE Game is pretty cool, a lot to do and discover in the world of civilization. Graphics are somewhat up to date and it&apos;s a fun learning experience. Not the best strategy game you&apos;ve ever played most likely, but a solid outing nonetheless. GRADE: B- 2) YOU HAVE PLAYED OTHER CIVS AND ARE POSSIBLY A CIV FANATIC LIKE MYSELF If you&apos;ve played any other Civilization game to date, you will almost instantly notice that the game has been dumbed down SOOOO much it possibly brings tears to your eyes.<br>- You can no longer manage your economy, taxes, luxuries, culture, religion, research, espionage, or just about anything else. The only things you can manage are your cities and units. - Diplomacy has been dumbed down as well. You can no longer trade techs or maps, and there is very little reason to conduct diplomacy besides trading luxury resources to keep your empire happiness. - MANIFEST DESTINY? THINK AGAIN. Oh how unhappy the happiness in this game will make you. Happiness is not city based anymore, rather it is now on a universal +/- scale for your ENTIRE EMPIRE. On any difficulty above Prince (I usually play on Emperor/Immortal) your happiness cap will SEVERELY LIMIT your ability to expand around the world. You will most likely be stuck to a handful of cities for a long time and you will have to carefully and painfully slowly expand so that your precious happiness doesn&apos;t drop. THE RESULT? Somewhere around 40-60% of the world map will be unsettled depending on your map type. ON IMMORTAL DIFFICULTY, EVEN THE AI WHO IS CHEATING THROUGH HIS NOSE STRUGGLES TO EXPAND ACROSS THE MAP. - WANT TO MAKE A BUSTLING DEMOCRACY THEN SWITCH TO FASCISM LATER IN THE INDUSTRIAL AGE? I THINK NOT BISMARCK. Once you pick your Civics you&apos;re stuck with them until the end of time... literally. And it&apos;s not like civics are easy to get, late game with large empires it takes 100s of turns to get enough culture. - Single Unit tiles is good and bad depending on your perspective. Ultimately though, it makes it very difficult to position your 8 units every single time you want to move across the map and makes invading other empires/cities more of a chore than fun. - A LOT OF FUN.... for until you&apos;re in the middle ages. Then the game drags and drags and dragssssssssssss like no tomorrow. WITH SO MUCH OF THE MICROMANAGEMENT STRIPPED FROM THE GAME, there is almost nothing to do besides choose what buildings to make in your cities. If you&apos;re not constantly declaring war on your neighbors then expect to spend most of your turns STARING AT YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN HOPING SOMETHING INTERESTING HAPPENS. USUALLY DOESN&apos;T UNLESS YOUR HOUSE CATCHES FIRE. - WANT A CULTURE VICTORY? TOO BAD GANDHI, THAT 4TH CITY IS GONNA COST YA... the game. Different victory types in Civilization have almost always been choose what you want to do early/mid way through the game and stick with it. But with this civilization, you damn better well have a strategy set if you want to win. This makes the game oh so much more boring that it was before. - Despite it being the year 2011 now, the AI of Civilization is still almost as woefully bad as it was in CIVILIZATION I ON DOS. The AI is AMAZINGLY STUPID, and all ramping up the difficulty does is MAKE THEM CHEAT LIKE NO TOMORROW. AIs will outresearch you, make far larger armies in less time, build wonders in half the time you do, and YOU WILL STILL ALMOST ALWAYS STOMP THEM. A travesty for modern gaming. Don&apos;t even get me started about diplomacy, the majority of the AI leaders are schizophrenic on their best days when taking their medication. GRADE: D- I&apos;m sorry but this ISN&apos;T CIVLIZATION. Empire Total War has far more depth than this current outing and that REALLY PAINS ME TO SAY THIS because I&apos;ve always far preferred Civilization to the Total War series. I DON&apos;T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE THINKING WITH THIS GAME, it&apos;s more suited to be played with on an arcade stick much less on a PC. WILL EXPANSIONS SAVE THIS DISASTER OF A GAME? It could, but it&apos;s going to need something absolutely BRILLIANT, and judging by how bad this game is I have my doubts. Fingers crossed though.... BOTTOM LINE: I REALLY DON&apos;T RECOMMEND THIS GAME IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM SINCERELY: AMAZINGLY DISAPPOINTED LONG TIME CIV FANATIC :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1602118">Expand</a></span>

Other wise CIV V just takes away too many of the more detailed and nuanced parts from previous games, especially items such as religion that really added a lot more depth to the game. Also missing is the ability to see the your diplomatic ratings and relationships in order to understand your neighbors.  You can see current deal but have no sense of why or if the other civilizations like you or not. Also you cant make your own saves during multiplayer and need to rely on autosaves, and you have no other option other than simultaneous turns when playing multiplayer. This option when using the combat model simply does not work and feels more like an RTS or console game than what many of us have grown to love about CIV. If you have not played a CIV game before start here, if you own CIV IV stick with that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1378558">Expand</a></span>

The game looks terrific out of the box, but just on setup a few worrisome issues come clear. The number of civs and maps available to play is surprisingly low--okay, we get it, you&apos;ll be selling DLC--but it&apos;s like half of the counts available in Civ 4. Once in-game, excitement at the new graphics and combat system are tempered by all the things that are missing. As others have posted, the missing details in the diplomacy screens are a huge problem that renders diplomacy almost useless. City States are even thinner in detail, and that is a feature that GalCiv 2 did way better. City management is a lot easier and the whole turn cycling interface improved is nicer, but the tech tree is also a dissapointment. And the whole anti-expansion philosophy is just un-fun.<br><br>I can see why the game developer might have wanted to take the game in this direction. It&apos;s probably more accessible to more people--thus it has a larger potential market. But making the game easier to play didn&apos;t have to mean taking a lot of features away. It&apos;s easy to imagine ways that religion and detailed technology--even espionage!--could have been left in, yet hidden from novice players or those players uninterested in detail. Instead, lots of fun stuff is just gone.<br><br>Finally, while I presume that the game will be patched quickly, it is crash-prone and has poor performance. The protracted time between turns is just unacceptable by even the middle of a Marathon game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1379586">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t expect anything revolutionary, not even with the hex tile switch, but I did expect to get what I had gotten out of the others. I bought Civ5 because I liked how the series didn&apos;t change much, just got prettier. Overall, my biggest pet peeve is that the over-simplicity of this newest version has made the game less of a challenge and more of a tedious waste of time. I liked Civ4 because micromanagement seemed to really have an effect in the grand scheme. However, doing so in Civ5 feels like playing a pretty spread-sheet. First the bad:<br>-The adjustment of the game length makes it feel like Civ3, which I like, but combining that with the extended length of turns makes for an over drawn out experience.<br>-Difficulty is not adjusted by leader craftiness, but by the number of units that they bring to the fight.<br>-The introduction of city-states was nice, but their nagging gets old really quick.<br>-Not allowing unit stacking promotes strategy, but makes for increasingly frustrating front-lines.-<br>In the 30 hours that I&apos;ve played, I have found that there doesn&apos;t seem to be any kind of situation other than war to win. The readjustment of victory conditions makes domination more accessible, but the others become easily forgotten when trying to keep enough units around for defense (I&apos;ve always been a cultural/space race victory kind of guy).<br>-Boring, tedious, and exasperating war. I&apos;m not kidding, even if a rival has basically no military, it will still take 10 turns to conquer  a city.<br><br>Now the good:<br>-The introduction of straight purchasing of city improvements and units is a huge boon to the game. Assuming you can afford it, popping out much needed military support doesn&apos;t waste time in production.<br>-Barbarian activity is better balanced. In Civ4 at the 5th difficulty level, barbarians would wipe you out way to quickly.<br>-Ranged attack. Finally, logical ranged attack. Why did this take so long?<br><br>Maybe it&apos;s just my play style, but Civ5 doesn&apos;t pull me in like previous iterations. More often then not, I find myself wishing that I hadn&apos;t bothered with the game that enjoying it. If you are looking for the fun challenge found in previous versions of Civ, I suggest that you go back and play those as this one just doesn&apos;t cut it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1379320">Expand</a></span>

It feels rushed, looks rushed, and will play like its rushed when it either crashes or grinds to a halt an hour or so in due to a memory leak.<br><br>As to the new combat system that everyone seemed to go so crazy about- its just Civ 4s combat system with one unit per tile.  I will say that its actually a nice improvement, because wars are much more about strategic position and tactical maneuvers.  However, its also applied to non-combat units and has a tendency to break workers that you have set to any level of automation.  And, as nice as it is it just can&apos;t fix the fact that everything else in the game is so bad.<br><br>On a final note, I know that a lot of hardcore Civ fans don&apos;t exactly have the best computers.  Well, you might want to rethink this game.  If you don&apos;t meet the rather high recommended requirements you will not be able to play on a map larger than standard- and even then the game will run like crap.  I&apos;m just below the recommended reqs, and with all my settings on minimum the game starts to chug on mid-late game standard maps.  I have to say, for the performance the game doesn&apos;t even look that good so be warned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1379535">Expand</a></span>

I am a great fan of strategy games and relish playing against others. This game, despite being fascinating at first (It&apos;s a big change from civilization 4, whether that&apos;s a good thing or not will be discussed later in the comment) but very quickly, the only thrill you&apos;ll recieve from civilization 5 is from mods and multiplayer.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer is fun, I&apos;ve poured more than one thousand hours into it and quite enjoyed it. But it&apos;s sub par, and there is an extreme lack of innovation. Most reviewers usually review the single player game, and since that&apos;s the case I&apos;ll cover that segment first. Single player get&apos;s boring quick, the AI doesn&apos;t become much smarter in later difficulties and just cheats with higher perks. The game is unbalanced as hell and you can basically win any war against the AI no matter what difficulty or scenario. In the base game, there is no religion, no spying and relatively boring social policies (By the way, some of it is just poor thinking, there is absolutely NO reason why you don&apos;t grab some then the other). The game, at a glance is fun and quite friendly to new unexperienced players, but if your looking for a decent game as a down to heart civilization fan you will be disappointed.
<br>
<br>The DLC mongering is terrible, there are so many DLCs (some even demanding you pay 5$ for one civilization) Regrettebly, if you want to play with religion, tourism, spies, and so on you need pay over 60$! Don&apos;t even get me started by the &quot;map packs&quot; which are for some reason client side when it comes to multiplayer(Yes, if the host has a generation configuration that the players don&apos;t have, you can&apos;t play the game... It&apos;s not like the maps offer any new content that would make those who don&apos;t have the DLC incompatible)
<br>Diplomacy is shortsided, it&apos;s not much better then civilization 4, but there should be more innovation on civilization 5&apos;s part. City states can be useful in singleplayer, but sometimes actually get in the way of expansion. Speaking of which, I love the new city bombardment and health, but the health is way too overpowered. In late games units can&apos;t even touch a city, even when the city is completely surrounded.
<br>Now on to multiplayer; the multiplayer is basically what you should play for, the AI is blunt and uninteresting but even the multiplayer experience has it&apos;s own flaws. For one thing, when playing against others does the inbalances in the game show, some civilizations are overpowered, you can win early game wars by spamming ranged units (Yeah, warrior versus archer. Archer wins!) which completely defies strategic logic. Some resort to what we players call &quot;turtling&quot; and &quot;wonder hoarding (the less vulgar version of the term) to address those who sit on their corner of the map with 1-2 cities and take all the wonders (Buildings that can only be built once in the world that give large bonuses) and beeline technologies. In the end, the people who just turtle and hit next turn win over those who actually try to play the game. Granted, turtling can be done legitimately (With none of the exploits or anything) but most don&apos;t really care about everyone else&apos;s game. There are many glitches, one that hasn&apos;t been fixed launch until AFTER their &quot;Sid Meier&apos;s Beyond Earth&quot; is released. The particular glitch I&apos;m talking about was the &quot;trade glitch&quot; were people can basically demand and accept anything from another player (Pretty much everything they had) without the other player even having a say in the whole matter. That&apos;s just one of many glitches that Fireaxis appearently doesn&apos;t care about, as they fix that ONE glitch after the next game has been released (Thanks Fireaxis). The community on multiplayer, though some are legit, are mostly trolls, kids who are drawn by the increased simplicity, exploiters and those who will quit on a minutes notice. City states are abused, exploits are used... and I almost forgot... no MULTIPLAYER MOD SUPPORT. This angers me because independent modders have been able to do this unofficially, Firaxis has done this in the past and since mods fix and enhance the game it seems insane that they don&apos;t allow us multiplayer users to play with mods without a third party program. Even with DLCs (You pay more then double the price for original game for these) multiplayer and singleplayer is below average. Now, let me remind you, I love this game and I have played multiplayer vigorously but I am tired of the DLC mongering, the catering to simplicity, the lack of innovation, none of these problems EVER being addressed. I rarely ever finish a multiplayer game because people crash left and right late game (and sometimes early game), sometimes games freeze up randomly and other times the game crashes when one person experiences difficulty. To sum up, this game is not worth buying without mods or the overpriced and numerous DLCs. If you are new to the franchise I recommend you buy previous titles first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=4724264">Expand</a></span>

It looks better than 4 but it should, it&apos;s a newer game. I feel like many of the streamlined changes from &quot;revolution&quot; found their way into 5, as in many of your actions lack depth. Still, hundreds of hours of play has to count for something and it&apos;s certainly enjoyable despite being shallow.</span>

While the game has wonderful graphics, hex grid, and intense battles, there is much to be desired. Depth was simply stripped away for a more action-based experience. This game never felt like a grand strategy game to me. Hopefully, the new expansion pack will address some of the shortcomings, but in my opinion, it is too little, too late.</span>

With each new one, we were offered a steady (yes) upgrade of quality and experience - I was brilliant at its time, but II introduced new things, III even more, and IV was clearly the pinnacle. Yes, you can see where it comes to...<br><br>I mean - V feels as an inferior one to IV in almost all things. Religions are gone. Science is now just linked to population, no game of balancing the budget. Diplomacy is worse. Diplomacy with city states is just laughable in its stupid simplicity (you just pay cash to buy points, straightforward as that). Gone is the choosing of governments - you get to keep all civics earned to the end of time, eliminating deep play and any resemblance to real governments. Combat is actually worse than in IV - one unit per tile! Gone are the Stacks of Doom, say hello to the Carpet of Doom! Land units become weak transports at sea - but no convoys - one unit per tile! And cities just defend themselves like some damn forts. Ridiculous! And - one leader per civ. Not even multiple DLCs change that.<br><br>There are however a few things done good. Hex tiles are nice. Border spread is better, one tile not entire range, and you can buy land. Ranged bombardment is back - though I don&apos;t get it how riflemen can&apos;t have it while archers do. Graphics are noticeably better. Great people can build special improvements on tiles, and this is quite neat.<br><br>Gameplay is even interesting, but seriously lacking the full depth of previous titles. In itself, it is not a completely bad game, hence score of 5. But after playing it once, I can hardly come back to it. I can safely recommend it to people who didn&apos;t play previous titles or thought they were too complex - they will have quite a fun with this title. But old veterans like me will feel disappointed, and frankly - rightly so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=2334724">Expand</a></span>

Tons of dlc but no innovation, odd new combat mechanics (1 unit per hex but the maps are too small), a lot of missing features from the old games, less management,....
<br>
<br>Feels like a &quot;Civ Light&quot; for newcomers to the genre</span>

No religion, no public health and diplomacy options have been badly pruned, providing a most straightforward gameplay, if well lacking many features. On the good side, the hex tile is well implemented and, combined with the inability to stack units, renders most of the old &quot;square tile&quot; tactics useless, which is a good thing, since it encourages tactical thinking instead of just sending the infamous &quot;Stacks of Doom&quot; and watching things burn. The graphics look awesome, yeah, but I would have sacrificed the eye candy for some gameplay depth. In a nutshell: If you liked Civ4, odds are you won&apos;t like this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=2771144">Expand</a></span>

<br>The medium: Combat is both good and bad. The good news is that combat is much more strategic, and is based on chance anymore. The bad news is that the AI doesn&apos;t know how to use 1 unit per tile!!! This makes the AI so easy to just destroy.
<br>
<br>The Bad: And that&apos;s another horrifying aspect of this game, the ai. Unless you are a new guy to the series, or are playing like in Deity, if you lose, you probably screwed something up horribly. Also, the game seems WAY too over simplified, and there aren&apos;t as many features to shape the way you want your empire to be run as there were in Civ 4! Now, this is fixed in 2 expansions (plus the AI is way better), but the fact that you have to buy two expansion packs to make a below average game turn into an amazing strategy game is highway robbery.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=3580813">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Taken by itself, Civ 5 is a solid game.  In a vacuum, I would say my biggest gripes are that the city-state system feels a bit unloved and leaves a lot to be desired.  Additionally, diplomacy is a bit of a black box that&apos;s difficult to wrangle with.  Plus sides are the level of complexity that allow for different playstyles and paths to victory that provide a lot of replayability.
<br>
<br>Compared to the other Civ games, I feel like the updates are a wash - things have become less complex, but I really appreciate the removal of the infamous stacks of doom we saw in Civ 4.
<br>
<br>Bottom line is, if you&apos;re a Civ freak, you might be disappointed with Civ 5 if you compare it to the previous installments.  If you&apos;re a casual Civ fan, or have little-to-no familiarity with the series, you&apos;ll find Civ 5 to fun and engaging and offer you many hours of enjoyment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=4224814">Expand</a></span>

If we look at it without knowing there are DLC&apos;s (Gods and Kings, Brave New World) and out of context, we could say it&apos;s a 9/10. So if you&apos;re new to Civ, it&apos;s worth your money. Now I highly recommend buying the full pack on Steam with the DLC&apos;s, which is now very cheap, because it adds so much to the game, that you can&apos;t go back to the normal one after that.
<br>
<br>There goes my negative point. Why the hell didn&apos;t they put those add-ons in the first place ? I know the answer is &quot;money&quot; but for Civ-addicts like me, this is an insult. I managed to get the extension for a minimum amount of money but Gods and Kings was over 30&#x20AC; when it came out, this is ridiculous for a bunch of options that could have been put in the early game.
<br>
<br>The Civilization franchise has always been good, we enjoy the new combat system, not allowing you to stack 1 billion units like it was in Civ IV, we enjoy the new culture system (replaced in Brave New World). I miss the cultural expansion of your cities, sometimes swallowing other players cities if your culture was massive, but let&apos;s say they needed to make it different, it&apos;s not a bad thing.
<br>
<br>Conclusion : With the DLC&apos;s it&apos;s much better, if you buy it, buy it all, but try to get in on sale, because the full price is exaggerated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=4294650">Expand</a></span>

<br>The AI is as dumb as ever, despite it apparently focusing on winning the game, rather then just role playing a country. Some AI civs will go for a cultural, or diplomatic victory, completley ignoring their military, and being invaded by a neighbouring civ. Even offers to join the war on their side, or ask for open borders, to help defend them, has them ignoring you and not accepting, until they are eventually conquered.
<br>
<br>It also requires steam to install and patch, whether or not you purchase a physical copy of the game. A major let down.

<br>
<br>I&apos;d really hope to see a really decent AI in a future game, something that is a challenge to the player,  but without getting insane bonuses, or spawning instant units or more or less breaking the rules that the player is forced to follow - such as having extremely large armies whilst ignoring caps, happiness and upkeep or instantly building wonders when you have 1 or 2 turns left on building them yourself.
<br>
<br>Playing at higher difficulty settings the cheating starts to become obvious and heavily lets the game down - we&apos;ve all witnessed it, there isn&apos;t any denying it.  Even Firaxas themselves have openly admitted it that is just easier to program AI with bonuses and &apos;unseen&apos; abilities working in the background to give the player more challenging gameplay, this is fine when its hidden and not openly obvious, and that is where Civilization V fails the most, because it is that obvious.
<br>
<br>Sid Meier//Firaxas -  I openly dare you to create a proper adaptable AI for Civilization VI without resorting to these cheap AI tricks of the trade.  Give us something that can best Civilization V -
<br>
<br>For new players to 4X games -  Civilization V is the best of the best, but just be warned on its infamous AI.
<br>
<br>+ Best turn-based strategy
<br>+ Best in class 4X
<br>+ Classic and loved franchise
<br>+ High replayability
<br>
<br>- Poor AI
<br>- AI cheats at high difficulty settings</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5536542">Expand</a></span>

This is the first Civ game that I did not play 6+ hours the day I got it. Ia few hours then I lost interest. I try it again now and then but, I won&apos;t be buying anymore civ stuff until the inevitable civ 6. The game mechanics have more of a casual game feel. Heck, I almost epected the city screens to have me play Gems with resources. City states are interesting, but otherwise Diplomacy is marginal. War is launching marching wave after wave onto a city. Archery and artillery was kind of neat at first, but couldn&apos;t carry the game. Worth a try if you can pick it up on sale or if you&apos;re new to the series. Not for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1693582">Expand</a></span>

I even played Call to Power by Activision (which were deviations from Sid Meier games, but had the same game concept). I bought Civ 3 twice. Civ 4 became my most favorite game. For Civ 5, I bought a new computer, and had a new graphic card. Honestly, I could never believe that I would be writing a bad review for a Sid Meier&apos;s game. I loved almost every game by them. And I tried very hard to like Civ 5, but I could not. This game is simply not the usual &apos;Addictive&apos; tag that all the civilization games had.
<br>
<br>Civ 5 is not a game of the series, made for the fans of the series. Off course, it can be fun for many others. But the people who enjoyed &apos;Strategy&apos; in terms of empire management, this game is a simple piece of trash. In Civ games you usually made the decisions based on the situation. In this game, you would have to build a simple chain of tactics, and once you would have that, you would be repeating that for almost every game. It&apos;s all based on the gaining &apos;Bonuses&apos; by selecting different options. Once you know which bonuses are better than others, nothing would be anymore &apos;Optional&apos;. No strategy, no tactics.
<br>
<br>The only place this game tries to excel is the war tactics. However, even in that it fails miserably. In the early game it gives you a feel of fun to play one unit on a hex tile. But after middle age, and mainly in late ear, when you have enough troops, managing them becomes a real problem. The game gets too boring if you&apos;re not at war. And if you&apos;re at war, it becomes simply irritating. With civilization game, I want to play an empire building/management game, and not a war tactics game. I can play lots of games much superior on war tactics.
<br>
<br>I know most of the Civ fans would not listen to me and would still try this game. But in the end, they will also quit the series. So sad, as we all all loved this series greatly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5285417">Expand</a></span>

But this feeling doesn&apos;t last. Previous Civ games kept their charm after hundreds of hours of investment. By your second time through a match of Civ5, you&apos;ll start feeling frustrated.<br><br>The good: Graphics are great, especially the diplomat renderings. The sound effects are mostly the same as old civ games, giving some nice nostalgic moments. The soundtrack list is huge. Combat is an enormous improvement over old games: the combination of hexagonal tiles, and no unit stacking makes it much more dynamic than previous Civ iterations. The bad: Simplification! Civs aren&apos;t action games. Civ players don&apos;t want action games. They want a cerebral experience that challenges them over and over again, each time they play. Firaxis has taken steps to streamline the experience that end up detracting from the game as a whole. Civ IV&apos;s religion and civic system is now a non-dynamic culture system, where you spend accumulated culture points for a once-off gameplay bonus. It is a step backwards. Diplomacy is terrible: the opaque system leaves you in the dark about what is going on. Want to enter a pact of secrecy? Uh, sure... I have no idea what that is!<br><br>The ugly: The soundtrack! Civ4&apos;s soundtrack was a masterpiece. The choice to progress the time period of origin for music based on the age of your civilization lent a feeling of progression to the game, as you ushered your civilization from the ancient era, to the future era. In Civ5, the soundtrack is now based on the (real life) origin of your civilization, and further whether it is engaged in war or peace. While the song-list is enormous (possibly larger than Civ 4&apos;s), you&apos;ll find that if you play a mainly peaceful civilization, you listen to the same songs from 4000BC to 2050AD. The fact of the matter is this: after months of Civ4, I still loved the soundtrack. After a week of Civ5, the soundtrack had become repetetive to the point that I started muting it.<br><br>The REALLY ugly: Remember how bad Civ4 used to tank your system when the AI was thinking during the later portions of the game? Remember how your computer would slow to a crawl for 20 seconds when you clicked &apos;next turn&apos;? Civ5 is worse. By the 1800s, clicking &apos;next turn&apos; becomes a dreaded thing: it means your computer will be out of commission for 30-60 seconds while the AI slogs through what it wants to do next. I find that post-1800AD, I typically spend more time reading stuff on my cell phone, or watching TV, than I do during my turns. It is bad enough that after playing through my first four or five full-length games, I had no desire at all to take another game into the later stages, as it was just tedious. Don&apos;t blame this on my system: it was built recently, and is more than capable.<br><br>Add to this a large list of other bugs, such as(the camera wildly swinging around as the game auto-selects units available for action from across the map, even though it is already positioned directly over another such unit, and you have a game that wasn&apos;t ready for primetime. For the civilization series, 5 was a step forward, and multiple leaps backwards. If you have a hankering for a good game of civilization, fire up Civ4. You&apos;ll have a better time.<br><br>On top of all of this is the single worst part of the game: the computer AI takes entirely too long to think on its turn. Civ4&apos;s early days had a similar problem, with the late-game turning into a slog-fest as clicking &apos;next turn&apos; inevitably resulted in anywhere from 30 to 60 seconds of down-time during which your computer tanks to a crawl. By the end game, I typically find myself spending more time reading news on my cell phone than actually playing the game. As such, it got to the point where playing past 1800AD was more chore than fun.

It&apos;s the 5th major version of the main game, and has had a ton of other manifestations, patches, add-ons, etc. Because of that, Civ 5 should be an embarrassment to the franchies. A new version of a game should build on the positive things in past versions. But there are features (particularly in the user interface) that are MISSING. They didn&apos;t bother to include a lot of the things (mostly little) that they included in *previous* versions. It&apos;s very difficult to get easily accessible information about profits and cities in a format that is intuitive and informative. It feels like one step forward and two steps back. It could be recoverable with some relatively minor fixes, but if they haven&apos;t done so yet, I doubt they are going to. As others have said, they lost their credibility with me on this game and the &apos;brand trust&apos; has been eroded. -- I&apos;ve raised my rating 2 since the last patch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1620184">Expand</a></span>

City states were a great addition and make the game a lot more interesting.  Being able to purchase land is awesome and realistic.  Easier rushbuying is a lot of fun and doesn&apos;t unbalance the game.<br><br>The new combat system is pretty goofy (for example, archers are a ranged unit but riflemen are not).  It&apos;s a bit more fun than the old &quot;stacks of doom,&quot; but I see reviewers praising the new combat system as &quot;more streamlined&quot; when it is definitely not.  Moving an old stack of doom required 2 clicks (click on SOD, click on destination).  Now you need to do the same thing 5-10 times as much to move an army.<br><br>The new Civic talent tree offers more customization of specific traits, which is fun to plan around.  However you can&apos;t swap civics to match a change in strategy in-game (eg. teching up at the beginning of the game and then turning to a warlike theocracy once you realize you&apos;re likely to lose the space race).  This is disappointing.  Overall, when Civ5&apos;s civics are compared to Civ4 its a wash. In-between-turn load times suck.  On a normal size map in the modern age, I was sitting and watching the hourglass for an average of 15 seconds in between each turn--even when I wasn&apos;t watching animations of enemy moves.  I&apos;d blame my computer but it runs pretty much every other game at high settings without a hint of a problem.<br><br>Music is bad, particularly the asian themed music.  I can&apos;t believe they wasted time animating leaders and making them talk in their own languages.  It doesn&apos;t add much to the game and some of their voices (Queen Elizabeth) actually detract from it by being annoying.<br><br>The lack of science/gold/culture sliders takes away a lot of customization potential that was fun to tinker with in previous Civ games.  This became painfully apparent when going for a cultural victory.  A cultural victory doesn&apos;t require the last 25% of the tech tree, but you can&apos;t stop researching until you run out of money.  And in the meantime, because you&apos;re still researching new tech, your puppet states are building more and more new buildings and costing you more money.  And when you run out of money you can&apos;t do a LOT of things, like rush-build or more importantly buy luxury resources and establish good relations with city states that provide culture.  Basically you lose the ability to do the things that make the game fun.   This is especially frustrating when it have been so easily solved with the old-school sliders, which were never that difficult to manage in the first place. Overall, it&apos;s a good, but not great game.  It reminds me of Civ3, in that it attempts to add interesting new game concepts and surprisingly flops at aspects in which its predecessor excelled.  On the bright side, Civ4 did a great job of combining the best of Civ2 and Civ3, so hopefully history repeats itself and Civ6 will be awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1379816">Expand</a></span>

This product is a noble effort to improve the Civ franchise, which has probably brough more fun into the world than any other, but ultimately it is an incomplete product.  If you haven&apos;t played Civilization before, play Civ4, it&apos;s better, on balance.  And, alas, more fun.
<br>
<br>Civilization V fixes most of the problems that plagued Civilization IV.  Gone are the &apos;Stacks of Doom&apos;, outlawed by the &apos;1 unit per tile&apos; rule.  Economies are again driven by the land, not by cottages or great people.  Happiness has been consolidated to an economy-wide focus, rather than a city-centric focus, which saves time.  Geographic constraints on city expansion have been relaxed.   The largely pointless and annoying disease/nutrition system is gone.  The combat system has been beefed up, with ranged units and squares replaced by hexes (why wasn&apos;t that part of Civ 1?).  The need to check diplomacy every turn to trade techs efficiently has been replaced by a system of collaborative research agreements. And some entertainment has been added through single city states. These are all substantial leaps forward.
<br>
<br>The game fails because despite all of these improvements, I can attest after 80 hours of gameplay, it just isn&apos;t fun.  The four fun-killers are:
<br>
<br>First, the focus has clearly moved towards military conquest.  The AI declares war on you because it can -  the United States wants to conquer Canada in CivVWorld.  But the AI sucks at war.  If you can build an army of 6 units you can hold off an infinite attack from an enemy civ.  Build an army of 12 units and you can advance on 2 fronts, which is enough to win constant war against everyone. To be fair, Civ AI has ALWAYS made for a poor man&apos;s wargame, but that has never really been the point before (well maybe in Civ 3, but ...), rather the fun has come from building up the civ and watching it thrive.  Which brings me to ...
<br>
<br>Second, foolish humans, such as my good self, have always enjoyed the Civ franchise because of the micro payoffs, the &quot;just one more turns&quot; ... This game shows all the hallmarks of squished or hurried design.  Tech advances are greeted by quotes both less sage and delivered less compellingly than Leonard Nimoy&apos;s efforts in Civ IV. The tech payoffs are sometimes nonsensible - the technology of &apos;Telegraph&apos; lets you build battleships, miltary based and Rio de Janeiro&apos;s Christo Redento. Stop.  Most of the Great Wonders confer largely irrelevant advantages, which is perhaps why Firaxis got rid of the beautiful wonder movies and replaced them with inane pictures, so no more do you curse and punch the wall when some other civ beats you by 1 turn.  And the rewards for victory ... well, I wouldn&apos;t want to spoil the disappointment for you.  Game designers everywhere need to understand that if you play for 20+ hours to achieve some condition that they set, you expect some quid pro quo.
<br>
<br>Third, there are design flaws - things that clearly just don&apos;t work the way any sane person would make a game work.  Such as the maritime city states that provide a quantum of food to each of your cities, no matter how many cities there are in your civilization.  Or the &apos;bonus&apos; resources you wish you didn&apos;t have so you could just build a farm.  Or the fact that in 1820 you should still build cavalry spearman so you can upgrade them to knights, then rifle-armed cavalry, because the upgrade system is so cheap. Fourth, there are bugs.  Lots of bugss.  Suffice to say that when you&apos;ve played a game for 20 hours pushing for a domination victory and then find you can&apos;t kill your last opponent because the 10 turn peace treaty you signed 200 turns ago is still in effect, you&apos;ll probably consign this game to the dustbin, as I did.  I&apos;ve know doubt these will be fixed in time.  So wait before you buy.
<br>
<br>In summary, I see in this product noble efforts to improve on civ 4 that, on balance, failed.  The game is less likely to keep me up until 4am pressing the &apos;Next turn&apos; button than did Civ IV because I care less about my little baby civs then I used to, and find it more inane beating up on my supid enemies than in the past.  Nice try Firaxis, but no good.

They had some interesting ideas but they failed to implement them.  I don&apos;t like to post bad reviews, but I think they earned this one.  It&apos;s pretty much the &quot;strategy game for people who don&apos;t like strategy games&quot;.  Superficial, clumsy design, bad AI (even worse than usual), it might be an interesting failure from a new studio, but it loses a couple of points due to the pedigree.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=2696370">Expand</a></span>

In past iterations the player needed to be diplomatic in order to rule the world. Oh, did I say deep and refreshing? Forgive me, I meant to say that Civilization V, in comparison to its predecessors, is shallow in game mechanics which ultimately left me regretful for not reading more reviews before the big purchase. Luckily I found Civ V on sale for about $20 dollars and that&apos;s just about what this game seems to be worth. Why Sid Meier and his teams left critical gameplay features on the cutting room floor escapes me. Religion, a major staple of the Civilization franchise, has been completely removed. Diplomacy consists of few clickable options such as trading, war, and &quot;discussions,&quot; which truly only serves as a shortcut to the trading screen. However, Civilization V is not a hole-filled game.<br><br>After playing several long matches on standard settings I will say that Civilization V picks up the slack of its former iterations. Cities are much harder to capture. They require the coordination of several units, all on the offensive against powerful city cannons that can brush away small forces. Military combat is much more streamlined; with hexagonal tiles and no unit stacking, smart tactical management of the player&apos;s units takes a major role in world dominance. Although combat is much improved, other methods of winning matches are shadowed by the polished combat systems. In every match I played, online and offline, I found that players and AI opt for the Dominance victory instead of the more peaceful options such as cultural or scientific victories. Towards the end of long games, many players will have a hefty income of gold and will be able to instantly purchase whole armies or buildings, easily turning the tide of a battle. Whether or not this option is a glorious feature or a mechanic hinderance still eludes me, perhaps some sort of penalty for abusing the new system could be set in place.<br><br>Civilization V would have worked at a higher plane had it choose to adopt the micro mechanics of Civilization IV while keeping the new military system. Diplomacy definitely needs more depth; the detail of the different world leaders and their backdrops are fun and animated, but it&apos;s only the icing on a cake made from rocks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1706103">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>It&apos;s a good game, but just not nearly what Civ IV was (or Civ III for that matter). I&apos;ve been playing Civ since the original was released many years ago, and have never been disappointed by anything the series has ever done. But once I played Civ V I became worried about the future of this series. Civ V has been dumbed down significantly from it&apos;s predecessors. It&apos;s a sad change.</span>

<br>
<br>The only part of Civ5 game play that I found better than Civ4 was that there is a limited quantity of strategic resources like iron.
<br>
<br>Civ5 has some things that are different than Civ4. To me these things don&apos;t really make the game play better or worse, just different. City states, more ranged combat, hexes instead of squares, and updated graphics are examples.
<br>
<br>Now the list of things Civ5 does worse: 1 unit per tile (this one has a lot of repercussions on the pacing of the game), global happiness, the AI, less flexibility in your economy due to the removal or research/culture sliders, less flexibility in your government due to policies that last eternity rather than civics, removal of the health system with nothing to take its place, and probably many more things I&apos;m forgetting at the moment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=3005167">Expand</a></span>

While the hex tile change does add some freedom and depth, too many options have been removed and replaced with very uninteresting combat mechanics that, especially at endgame, result in a clickfest without any soul or body to it.
<br>
<br>Graphics  6/10  High detail but has various graphical glitches (such as terrain changes applying far too late).
<br>Sound  8/10  The soundtrack and fx add a lot to the experience of immersion and never annoy.
<br>Gameplay  5/10  Fun to play once or twice, tedious and boring after having seen the first few games you play. The AI is not up to scratch either and very easily defeated, even at high difficulty.
<br>Mechanics  1/10  Extremely lacking game mechanics that get worse as a game progresses along the tech tree  late game virtually always results in mass nuking everyone, because every other option results in an endless, tedious clickfest to push through your turns and execute the attacks.
<br>
<br>Final note: the DLC&apos;s and expansions to this game, completely change the picture and fix most of its flaws.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=3283715">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>CONS:  Dumbed down, bigtime.  Another example of catering to the post BC WoW crowd that whine about stuff being too hard.  Like the foregone conclusion of helicopter mommies and the bubble wrap generation where kids now are raised to get everything for almost nothing, cuz they&apos;re special, right?  Don&apos;t give my kid a markdown on her paper cuz she has excuses for the late turnin creates monsters.  These monsters are affecting gaming in a bad way.  /rantoff   Seriously, CIv III and IV fans are going to cry after playing this game.
<br>
<br>No religion, corporations, fine tuning, etc.
<br>
<br>Culture on takeover doesn&apos;t make sense.  I did breathe a sigh of relief on seeing the borders unchanged, but such a thing doesn&apos;t make sense.  City flipping by culture is gone.  Again, doesn&apos;t make sense.
<br>
<br>Diplomacy makes no sense.  You can have good relations with someone only to have them scream at you the next turn for no known reason.
<br>
<br>Loss of discovery on mining sites.  The mined resources are set, they don&apos;t deplete, ever, and you can never discover anything new elsewhere.  Doesn&apos;t make sense.
<br>
<br>No armies.  There is room here for the old 3 stack on a general, I think.  Could add some complexity.
<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>
<br>Ranged combat.  Done right.
<br>
<br>Non-stackable units.  Allows for real tactics over, for example, China showing up with 70 endgame units on a single tile to attack a city in a single turn.
<br>
<br>City defense: Common sense addition.  Adding structures like walls adds more to these defenses.  A garrison, more defenses.  Again, you cannot stack 70 units on a single tile, though one could argue more than 1 for the city, you have an option for 1.  The inherent defenses of the city compensate for this though...and the city itself can fire a ranged barrage every turn.
<br>
<br>Navy: A powerful navy can take over coastal cities without any need of land units.  Adds balance.
<br>
<br>REPLAYABILITY:  Honestly, couldn&apos;t play a game through until the expansions.  I got bored, even with an audiobook running.  With III and IV losing half a day wasn&apos;t uncommon, this was a drag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=4283808">Expand</a></span>

The only people who don&apos;t think that this is major dumbing down of the series obviously just don&apos;t &apos;get&apos; strategy games. I&apos;ve played through two full games now, one marathon and one normal. I like to play Huge, Marathon, Earth maps because of the &apos;epic&apos; feel. this virtually can&apos;t be done on CIV V. Marathon is simply too slow (my rig exceeds recommended specs and hasn&apos;t crashed once). City-states make ridiculous demands eg &quot;build a road to my town (on the other side of the planet) and they get really old really fast. On normal it was a bit better, except there&apos;s no way of telling if your neighbours are happy with you, so it&apos;s easy to descend into bloodshed if you&apos;re not disciplined. The end screens on Civ IV were short little movie, depending on which victory you attained. Civ V doesn&apos;t even have this - it&apos;s more like a  &quot;Conglaturation!, you have completed a great game&quot; screen, and that&apos;s it. Combat is better, but the dumbing down of naval invasions means it&apos;s really easy to snatch the enemy&apos;s capital from sea. Capture all the enemy capitals and you win the game. That is of course if your units don&apos;t get lost on the way. Civ V has a really annoying habit of &apos;losing&apos; units. it&apos;s a bit like the Total War series, where you have the remember where your units are. Not cool if you come back to a game after a long break. Likewise their &quot;goto&quot; commands break when they embark, often leading to a huge build up of units on the wrong coast.  Aerial combat isn&apos;t much better, animations for the planes don&apos;t play properly. The ranges of combat missions aren&apos;t clear. etc etc. It just doesn&apos;t &apos;feel&apos; epic anymore.<br>I&apos;ll be looking forward to the first patch for this game and expansion, but at the moment my advice is to steer clear, definitely not worth the $$$</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1379679">Expand</a></span>

The empire building aspect is shallower then it was in Civ 4. There&apos;s less to build. There&apos;s incentive for building a lot of cities but not letting them grow. You can buy most of your food from city states if you want to, and come out ahead by just spamming trading posts. You notice that only a few Wonders are really worth their cost, let alone the difficulty in building them when the AI gets building speed boosts on higher difficulty.<br><br>Combat is awesome, except that the AI is REALLY BAD at it. Once you know how to use rivers, hills, great generals, and ranged attacks strategically, you will dismantle armies significantly larger without difficulty.<br><br>That&apos;s the problem here. The AI is bad and it makes the game really easy once you know how to play it. The shallower nature of the game means there&apos;s less fun without a challenging AI to push you.<br><br>The game isn&apos;t bad, and if you&apos;re not a Civ fanatic you will probably find a lot to like. But for the people who are good at the TBS genre and Civ in particular, there won&apos;t be much to hold your attention over Civ 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1380677">Expand</a></span>

To sum it up as best as I can, I think Civilization 5 is just &quot;dumbed down&quot; a bit. You don&apos;t have to focus on as many things, religions were completely removed from the game, and hexagon upgrades were way more obvious. Speaking of hexagons, I absolutely hate the hex system. It means you have way less plots of land available per city, which took away a lot of the fun. The city-state system was a little lame too; I didn&apos;t want to have to bother dealing with greedy and disobedient city-state allies when I could just conquer them and use them and their land for myself. The AI has some of the same, if not worse, problems that Civ 4 had. Why in the world my best ally spontaneously decides to declare war on everyone, including myself, is beyond me. The expansions for Civ 4 were definitely worth it on Steam when you could get Civ 4 + all expansions for like, 20 USD/Euros, but Civ 5&apos;s DLC that adds just one civilization choice makes me want to vomit. Honestly, most games of this current era tend to &quot;dumb down&quot; their gameplay, but the Civilization series is all about strategy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1526627">Expand</a></span>

I spent a long time playing the game before commenting as it is difficult to review a classic franchise. The best improvement is the combat system. Combat is now on a hex system. One army per hex. Ranged units can fire from hexes away but are generally weaker from attack, making the organization of your army critical. Non fast units move as fast like scouts in prior game (2 hexes over open ground, 1 hex over rough terrain), which makes terrain important. One bad change, and a baffling design choice, is the UI. In Civ 4 the UI told you everything you needed to know. You could tell how you were doing in points, and could hold your pointer over a resource to instantly know how many you have. No longer, for some reason. Advisors are back, but they only give general advice that most experienced civ players should already know. They are not an adequate replacement for Civ 4&apos;s excellent information screens. Cities take much more time to produce both buildings and units. Which means you must be selective about what you build. I can see why this was done, but the effect is that the game feels much slower than its predecessors. Happiness is now an empire wide trait. Instead of having happy and unhappy cities, every city has an equal amount of happiness which rises and falls together. Unfortunately, this means that a game of conquest and annexing conquered cities (which is now much harder, as cities take several turns to fall and can defend themselves with ranged attacks) can cripple your entire kingdom. This also slows down the game. I&apos;d give this game a hesitant recommendation. I would also strongly advise having a very fast hard drive if you wish to play on any map beyond the smallest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1567706">Expand</a></span>

This game grabs you with a weird kind of addiction if you start playing. You may sit to play this for 30 minutes and find out that 2 hours are already passed. But the important part is the Civilizations actually have no difference than the other in particular. This makes the game really basic in variety. For godsake the only difference Between Aztecs and French are 1 different unit for each and 1 more unit/building if you are in luck. And uh there is also 1 more bonus between any 2 countries(For example Aztecs get some culture bonus for each enemy units they killed). I don&apos;t study history but even i can tell you at least 10 difference between the Aztecs and French People. This game really needs some more variation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1783820">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m one of them. I bought Civilization I on release, and every other version since. Civ V is the first one that I can&apos;t even begin to enjoy. It&apos;s a massive step backwards. It&apos;s basically no longer Civilization, but some weird war game without any of the depth that made all the previous versions fun to play and saw the series progress with each iteration. If anything, Civ V is kinda like Civ I in that it essentially removes all the additions to the series in between. Except that Civ I was actually fun to play and gave you the feeling of building a &quot;Civilization to stand the test of time&quot;. This is a monstrosity not worthy of the name. I definitely won&apos;t be purchasing Civ VI in blind faith - and I never thought that I&apos;d say that about a Civ game! Please Sid/Firaxis: focus on what made the Civ series so great - the &quot;interesting decision paradigm&quot;. If you want to make a war game, by all means do, but then don&apos;t call it Civilization.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=2279850">Expand</a></span>

You can develop alliances with them and this can result in them giving you free units, or you can fight with them. The interface is also much cleaner in Civilization V, with the exact level of happiness and culture produced clearly displayed. The graphics have also been vastly improved, with terrain surfaces looking highly detailed and vibrant, especially the water which reflects the sunlight. The sound effects and music is also good, although I did prefer the Leonard Nimoy voice overs in Civilization IV than the voice overs in Civilization V. Some of the gameplay mechanic changes have drastically altered the tactical aspects of the game. Having only one unit on a tile encourages more tactical unit placement rather than just mass unit rushes like you can do in Civilization IV. The capture mechanics of cities is also better with cities having a health rating. I also like the fact that cities can bombard nearby units, and this is especially useful in counteracting annoying barbarian attacks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=3742547">Expand</a></span>

<br>In addition, the battle part is indeed the game&apos;s weakness, you have to control every army one by one and see their laggy animations. When in later game, this is more disturbing so that I just gift most of them to city states.
<br>IMO, This game is about parameters balancing (you play with numbers), mainly food, culture, science, gold and fairy. you control them by actions, mainly building, diplomacy, research and policy. And you enjoy how wonderful values you can achieve.
<br>So, if you prefer more direct stimulation like graphics diversity in many RTS games,  Civ is not for you. In graphics, Civ looks very repetitive. The difference between civs are distinct parameter enhancing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=4142801">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s exhilarating to choose a civilization and try to dominate the other opposing civilizations. Whether winning by cultural, domination, diplomatic, or science victory, it&apos;s all really fun. It&apos;s a great experience to see your civilization explore the area, meet new civilizations and city-states, and fight off barbarians, as they grow and technologically advance from ancient times to modern times. Multiplayer can be really fun, but it&apos;s almost impossible to finish a game because either the random people you get paired up with leave the game right away or everyone gets disconnected, so it can be frustrating at times. This is a fantastic game but also addicting so beware.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=4387194">Expand</a></span>

Until CIV2, then CIV3 and CIV4 (however I miss my throne room and palace from the earlier iterations.
<br>CIV5 looks great, however lacks the single biggest facet of realism, that all the previous iterations provided. Distance. There are so many different civilizations on our planet and they are brilliantly diverse. By allowing every nation to travel across water in Civ5, so early  and so easily in the game, there is no diversity. Everyone grows and learns at the same rate.
<br>The early Mayans were one of the most advanced cultures on the planet and then the Greeks and romans, further down the tracks the English where it was said the sun never set on the empire.
<br>All of these were achievable in all earlier versions of the game. Now, you cannot, in any way provide the single greatest part of being human, diversity. In CIV5 its everyone, at the same technological level (or ridiculously close to it), for eternity. No religious path, no progressive path and no dark ages.
<br>While the game is pretty, has nice no stacking dynamics and makes even the fastest system chug under its behemoth of calculation, there is no way to be any different to any one else.
<br>I&apos;ve clocked hundreds of hours playing each version of Civilization, though after 40 playing this, I wish I&apos;d never bought it. I&apos;ve tried so hard to enjoy it, but once you&apos;ve played it once, nothing ever changes</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=5192050">Expand</a></span>

In the franchise, great steps were made to separate this from previous games with new concepts from hex, unit stacking, graphics, social policies, and city states. These succeed in creating new challenges for the player and add to the military strategy game. However, what the game does not deliver is an adaquate AI that fails at even the simplest of tasks. For example, an automated worker in an unhappy, fledgling empire at game start will not attempt build immediately on resource one tile from the capitol to connect it. Increasing difficulty beyond King (L6) doesn&apos;t incorporate new AI routines, it simply handicaps the player by huge bonuses for production, happiness, science, and gold output for all AI players. I have over 200 hours into this Civ with another 500+ for Civ4 and another 500+ hours for every Civ incarnation before it. Even if purchased on a Steam sale, it doesn&apos;t overcome the disappointment at the lack of re-playability compared to previous Civs. The game can be fun at times, but those moments of enjoyment are too rare. Like a tribal hut, you get the immediate sense of reward and that is about as good as it gets as the game goes back to tedium of micro-management to overcome a weak AI.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=2787393">Expand</a></span>

I am extremely disappointed the flawed gameplay mechanics are still around, I am even more disappointed about the technical bugs.  There is no reason that my cursor should disappear in a section of city management after 18 months of release, It should support dual monitors, my cities shouldn&apos;t disappear occasionally, I shouldn&apos;t have red sprites appear, etc etc. I think these things are the biggest proof of what a failure this game is.  People argue that the gameplay is well done and thought out, if they thought so they would have completed the rest of their game.  If an Indie game had this many issues a couple months after release it would be unacceptable, for a series with this much renown to suffer from these types of bugs 18 months after release is completely unacceptable.  I am in the camp of never buying another firaxis/2k game on day one, I&apos;m going to wait for extensive reviews before I purchase one.  I think this is an extremely good example of how ridiculous critic reviews are, for this to be one of the highest rated games of all time is shameful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1401194">Expand</a></span>

The changes that are negative are: &apos;embarking&apos; where almost any unit can cross water without the need for a ship, incomplete information regarding your diplomatic relations, a simplified tech-tree. These and other tweaks make the game &apos;smaller&apos; in it&apos;s feel. (There are also some oddities - e.g., great person buildings are now built outside of the city, and are harvested like any other resource).  Somehow, even on larger maps and longer duration games, it doesn&apos;t feel as absorbing as the previous versions did. Sure - the &apos;stack of doom&apos; is now gone, but defending against such a force was a drama of its own, and doesn&apos;t result in the strange mechanic that only one unit can be stationed in a city (which makes it feel more like a board-game then an empire simulation). Overall, I am sure this is a good game, but it has to be compared to Civ IV, which was excellent. And in that comparison it fails. My guess is that future expansions may address some of these issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1379407">Expand</a></span>

The bad is that the game is unecessarily hard to manage.  A lot of techniques that existed in prior versions are missing.  Such as being able to set your city preferences across the empire from one city.  Or, being able to go to a city screen from the F2 city summary view, or being able to change production in the same F2 view.  It also is cheap that you the game does not take into account production to date when purchasing a building.  All of these were probably left out to help sell the sequel in typical Sid Meir fashion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1708128">Expand</a></span>

Its significantly better than this one. I was amazed when I first saw the graphics of this game. They are beautiful and seamless. I also liked the idea of resource scarcity where an iron supply can allow you to build up to 5units. (For example) In Civ 4 once you have the critical resource there is no incentive for you to get another one of it. You&apos;d have to be stupid to trade it and so except for the shield bonus it goes to waste. I was unsettled by the move to hexagonal tiles and the no unit stacking. Also cities acting as their own (Flawed it turns out) defense. However I found all 3 changes tolerable and even enjoyable for a time. I like the move to range units however what unit is &quot;ranged&quot; seems kind of arbitrary. The fact that two units can attack each other for a few turns without utter destruction of one in a way compensates for the lack of &quot;stack&quot;.
<br>
<br>The main thing however that I cannot abide is the dumbed down gameplay. I only played 1 game on medium difficulty. Won with the top score. And uninstalled the game knowing I never want to do that again.  There was no challenge to it. Worse it felt like the game was steering. To do modestly well I needed only to click whatever was flashing and do the suggested thing. Same with suggested buildings/units. It was the difference between strategizing and being the guy who says &quot;I approve this message&quot;.
<br>
<br>Due to the lack of stack it is quite easy to gang up on individual units making military conquest quite easy. Even when you are the supposed underdog. While I initially enjoyed the city states they quickly turned into an annoyance always demanding gold or new things to stay payed off and under my influence. I started wiping them out to build my empire and was glad I did. Even though it did mean they ganged up on me and all declared war. Nothing came of it. Just more cities for me. I found it was more efficient just to have the city then to be trying to bribe my way into their good graces.
<br>
<br>When it came to technology I understand the move away from tech trading. Much kinder on isolated starts. But doing so removed 90% of diplomacy for me. The &quot;research deals&quot; which replaced them were a sad surrogate. As well sometimes a civic would make a research deal with you and then break it prematurely. Costing you both gold to no ones benefit. That is either spite or poor game design. All and all this game is beautiful. But being a strategy game stripped of any real strategy it is quite pointless. I wish they would re-release civ 4 with this level of graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=3015402">Expand</a></span>

On the lowest settings possible I still watch the world drawing in tile by tile (with a 1GB Radeon HD 4890) but I don&apos;t mind, it&apos;s a strategy title.  What I do mind is the average 3 minute wait between turns because the ONLY time you can turn off combat animations is if you happen to click the much smaller &apos;advanced options&apos; button while setting up your game then scrolling down to find the check box.<br><br>Diplomacy is a farce, for the past 4 titles it was always right there in clear view and easy to interpret.  In a half dozen play throughs I have yet to figure out a way to find out how the other cultures feel about each other aside from noting Pacts of Secrecy they have with me.  Even finding the &apos;Global Politics&apos; requires you to poke down through 3 screens and yet there&apos;s no information about the other cultures besides how they relate to yours.  The lack of detail and attention to diplomacy renders the AI &apos;personalities&apos; at best minimal and on average completely non-existent.  The worse though, is the victory.  What a let down / slap in the face.  After having to sit through the first 20-30 seconds of that intro animation every time I tried loading the game I expected a little something at the end.  instead - a splash scree with 4 tabs - that&apos;s IT.  There&apos;s more animation involved in transporting your spaceship parts to your Capital(some) than there is when you actually launch it (none at all).<br><br>The first one if your victory image WHEE!!! the next are the global demographics, best and worse only, no actual way to view demographics by culture.  Then you get your score, and the final tab is a player hall of fame.  There&apos;s no graph or replay - elements that have been STANDARD since the original Civilization - NINETEEN YEARS AGO.  It completely removes the players ability to see what else was happening in the world while they were establishing themselves at the start.  Even with all that negativity this game is super fun and that&apos;s what makes the gripes even more disappointing.  If this was a brand new game from some unknown developer it wouldn&apos;t get the critical praise this NAME is getting.  As the 5th entry in one of the longest standing and most popular series made, shipping with these issues / expecting the mod community to finish up their title is just not cool.  Maybe if the game would have actually shipped with a manual I&apos;d be able to figure out where or why my gripes stem from, especially while waiting for my next turn, but they stripped that out too.<br><br>Thankfully I still have Civ4 installed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1385002">Expand</a></span>

Where CIV IV had one of the best AI &apos;s I&apos;ve ever seen CIV V has a zombified AI. The computer run civ&apos;s are in desperate need of BRAINS! They aren&apos;t out to conquer the world, or even knock off your particular civilization. Instead they&apos;re largely content to let you slowly fossilize or conqure the world yourself.  Conquering the world is actually the easiest way to win this game...yeah, go figure. Partly though, that because you can get started early and get the pain over with sooner. IF you have the patience, you could go for the space race victory. But, if you have that kind of patience, you should be able to hold off on buying this waste of computer memory of a game and spend your time finding something worth your time and money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=2802760">Expand</a></span>

However, as I played more than just a few games, Civ 5 &apos;s many shortcomings became apparent to me. The absolutely horrendous AI, for example, renders diplomacy useless. It is impossible to trade with any AI, because they will not accept any reasonable offer. Instead, they will demand everything you own for a scraps of iron or horse. Plus, the unpredictable way in which AIs act makes it impossible to make plans that relies on AIs. Random civs denounce me for no reason, or acts aggressive despite have an army a tenth of mine. The gameplay is also very shallow. The tile improvements look good at first, but eventually one realises that the only way to win is to spam build trade posts and farms. Every time. The combat is the same. There is no hint of infrastructure or anything, and the combat animations are repetitive and breaks one&apos;s immersion by being very cartoonish. Overall, I disliked this game mostly because of the absolutely horrendous AI. After all, it is no fun building an empire if everyone around you is acting like a dumbass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=2952033">Expand</a></span>

The change from multiple units being allowed to occupy a single square to one unit per square severely limits a player&apos;s strategy, making combat cumbersome, and less interesting. The ability to defend cities without an army seems ridiculous, especially when combined with their ranged attack that is automatically upgraded as the game progresses; starting with a ranged attack even without the knowledge of archery. The scientific aspect of the game is much more simplified, and the amount of civilizations/leaders available to play is abysmal. The city building is more or less the same as in Civilization IV and Gandhi is still as treacherous as ever. In my opinion it is one of the more mediocre versions of Civilization, far inferior to the previous installment in the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1605248">Expand</a></span>

The first hours of gaming I was happy and excited about the game just like most reviewers. After that the serious flaws in AI combat abilities, unfinished UI, bad performance and boring late (modern age) gameplay shocked me with thousand volts.<br>All the previous games in Civilization series I played for months after release and often came back after a break for a game or two. With Civilization V I only played two full games to the end and one unfinished then it was time to shelf the game.<br>It&apos;s obvious that simple patches or DLC&apos;s can&apos;t fix the game. It needs serious overhaul in so many aspects. Civilization V could have been so much better if all the new features had been implemented properly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1446789">Expand</a></span>

It has few nice new elements (like hex fields, nation specialization or barbarian activity) but a lot more were disappointing or just plain bad - happiness was definitely this thing for me - it is just unlogic why it had so global scale - i mean i could understand that if i have 1 revolting city I would get some negative bonus for every other city in empire - but we do not have this kind of mechanics here - here every new citizen gives negative impact doesn&apos;t matter if he was born in reachest city at plannet or poorest one with blazing borders- and when i build coloseum in 1 city it makes my every citizen little happier - the hell why??? It&apos;s like I should be happy when I live in New York that stadium was built in Denver - and like I would even care. Because of this global impact of happiness this killed my main tactics - to be an expansionist asap- you can&apos;t -every new city gives bigger negative impact than it can produce hapiness in next 30 turns. Another thing coming from hapiness is conquering cities - when you do that the only intelligent step is to burn it to the ground and place right away new city in the same spot - because you pretty fast will have population boom there anyway (especially if you have few free states providing food as allies-then new citizen every turn) and won&apos;t get such a big negative happiness bonus for different culture. What a hell? the only right way in conquer is total extermination? I don&apos;t like that - and it&apos;s not teaching kids nowadays to think properly and we don&apos;t want to raise new hitlers are we? I won&apos;t be pointing every other change that I wasn&apos;t found of - others did that already, so will only focus at happiness as main reason why this CiV has butchered gameplay - and in long term is just not fun to play. - So meh. No expansions or DLC that i&apos;ll buy for this one - going back to 4 or will wait for 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1648564">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s playable -- it&apos;s very playable -- but it&apos;s shallow, and too easy. Yes, Civ IV had a lot going on, and this could be a challenge for the mythical mainstream audience (&quot;mythical&quot; because they&apos;d never buy a Civ game in the first place), and it could certainly have been made to flow more easily; but the right way to make a game flow more easily is to refine problematic but life-like features, not yank them out altogether.
<br>
<br>In particular, I was looking forward to a game that handled religion more realistically than the baby-steps of Civ IV -- one in which Islam, Confucianism, and Hinduism were not equally congenial to aspiring world empires, and in which a Christian-Jewish-Muslim city was not a model of ecumenical harmony -- but what the developers gave us was a backing off from the subject again.
<br>
<br>The &quot;one unit per tile&quot; rule is not bad -- it makes war feel less like Civ 3 and more like, well, war -- but I didn&apos;t know that archers had a range of several hundred miles; I also didn&apos;t know that classical armies raised entire armies (division-strength? Larger?) equipped with nothing but bows. The right solution for this kind of thing is to train brigades and use a theater model, like that of _Hearts of Iron III_; will game development ever get over _Panzer General_ and its cartoonish style of combined arms?
<br>
<br>And lastly, what is _up_ with this game&apos;s graphics? Ruinously high requirements; it chugs on my new laptop (which is Windows 7, but with Aero disabled); and it doesn&apos;t even look as good as Civ 3 (let alone 4)! I think it&apos;s a matter of bad artistic design... although even bad artistic design doesn&apos;t explain why the game has late-1990s-level lag in loading ground textures.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1381139">Expand</a></span>

Can&apos;t put my finger on it specifically, but to &quot;tidy up&quot; the game so that strategic moves seem more compelling and the game doesn&apos;t tend to tread water in places.<br><br>Nevertheless, if you&apos;re a RTS fan, you&apos;ll definitely want this one.

While I do miss the sheer depth of the last title Civ V has the sort of simplification that, more often than not, works well for the game.  It&apos;s certainly a more approachable title for newcomers to the franchise, and there&apos;s still plenty for experiences players to finesse.  The process of waging war is undeniably superior in this version, with the new hex grid adding a tactical element none of the other games ever had.  The hex grid itself makes the playable world look and handle much nicer too.  There are some definite improvements here, but the game doesn&apos;t quite live up to Civ IV&apos;s grandeur.  Civ IV, especially after its expansions, is the better game, but Civ IV is one of the best 4x games ever conceived.  By its own merits, Civilization V is still one of the best releases of the last year and well worth anyone&apos;s attention.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1620615">Expand</a></span>

With new technologies the perception is that people lack the patience they once had. Civilization V makes an attempt to streamline the game compared to past games in the series. Unfortunately, Civilization V goes too far. Let&apos;s start off with the good. First of all I like the hexagonal tiles better than the usual square ones. I think it makes the map look much better. The graphics are better in Civilization V, which you would expect. I like how accessible mods are in this game. It is much easier to use mods than past installments in the series. Now, the bad. The one unit per tile was a nice try, but it simply doesn&apos;t work. What should have been done is a Victoria II style supply limit system, where each tile could support a certain number of units. You could put as many units as you want on the tile, but there would be significant combat penalties for going over the limit. One unit per tile makes wars something you dread, as opposed to something you enjoyed in Civ IV. The diplomatic system is still messed up even two years after release. The AI leaders are inconsistent and change their minds quickly. The game got rid of religion which makes it less interesting. Finally, I&apos;ll explain my review score. Automatically, the game receives a four point deduction for not improving on its predecessor, the receives a 3 point deduction for OK gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1718106">Expand</a></span>

Great new features, good to start with both for new players and hardcore fans. Maybe some poor design choices which keep reappearing since Civilization 2, but overall it seems to be great.<br><br>That&apos;s until you play your first two complete games. This game is full with bugs! You might wonder if they even played through the whole game once before its release because it seems to be in beta status. Major performance issues followed by a wide range of ingame bugs, glitches and crashes.<br>But if you think that singleplayer is broken you clearly haven&apos;t played multiplayer games.<br>The word &quot;broken&quot; doesn&apos;t even come close to its unplayability. It simply doesnt work to play a complete game without someone dropping out, glitching through the game or having other issues that make it impossible to play.<br><br>But there you sit having it bound to your steam account and there is no way to get your money back.<br><br>I recommend you to better think twice before you might waste your 50 bucks on a game that seems to be hyped by the majority of review sites and sources but in reality is an accumulation of bugs.<br><br>Do yourself a favour and wait at least a month or two until the first big patches are release... that&apos;s if the developers have the courage to support the game..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v/user-reviews?user_review_id=1381054">Expand</a></span>
