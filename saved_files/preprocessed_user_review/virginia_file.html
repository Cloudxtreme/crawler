                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_6712995"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Before anything is said, I have to admit that I dabble a little in David Lynch films every now and then, but ultimately have to say that I am not particularly fond of his works... I love the atmosphere, but I mislike stories that shroud themselves so deep in mystery that there is no actual &apos;true&apos; story behind it, just an invitation to interpret it yourself. While sometimes fitting, I more often than not feel disappointed. And that is pretty much what I am going to say about the game with a lot of more words beneath.
<br>I am just writing this because this game is very clearly inspired by the series Twin Peaks.
<br>
<br>As said before, this game is pretty much a jump from cutscene to cutscene with no choices (and therefore consequences), so far so good - I knew that beforehand, this is nothing new. What is new (to me at least) was the absence of a vocal narrative - no word is spoken in this game. Which DOES add to the already thick atmosphere, it really encourages you to observe and think about your environment which I actually really liked. The graphics and art style is rather bland, the (outside) environments do look pretty great.
<br>
<br>SPOILERS:
<br>From reading a few (spoilerless) reviews before playing the game, I arrogantly thought people just didn&apos;t pay enough attention and focus to follow the story... Well, it turns out it is too confusing for me as well... It is easy enough to follow everything until after ~two thirds of the game, when the lines between reality, dream, trip, persons become very blurry. Which actually sounds great when reading it, but it isn&apos;t that exciting per se, just very confusing...We see the main character  rise in ranks (in a few unsubtile cutscenes), when she notices that the case she started out with is still unsovled. So the scene jumps back to where the two main characters are (for reasons I didn&apos;t fully understand) locked up, the main character drops LSD from the evidence envelope she carries with her god knows how while locked in, trips out through a bunch of cutscenes that are woven around the people, locations and events you witnessed and...peaks in a cacophony of seemingly disconnected scenes and then ends with no real conclusion to tie everything together.
<br>
<br>A smarter man than me can possibly find a reason for all that we saw, but I get the nagging feeling there is no &apos;true&apos; story behind it, and it welcomes you to interpret it as you wish. Which can be nice, and if it was the first of it&apos;s kind I witnessed, I would have maybe liked it.... but this style of ending a game, book or film more and more seems like taking the easy way out to me - Instead of writing another ending that &apos;was here before&apos;, you just drop a lot of different impressions on the viewers and let them think they missed something or let them put the pieces together the way they want to, so they can&apos;t be disappointed.
<br>
<br>So long story short, I did like the game, but like so many others, it chooses to confuse instead of telling a story. I don&apos;t need games to hold my hand, but I&apos;d still prefer that to putting me on rails with no choices whatsoever and then whilst obfuscating the story on purpose.
<br>
<br>For all my negative criticism, it is a game that can easily be a 7-8 for you if you do actually enjoy such things.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/virginia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6712995">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have nothing against mostly narrative &apos;walkie&apos; experiences - I loved &apos;Dear Esther&apos; which was like a haunting eulogy/poem, and liked &apos;Everybody&apos;s Gone To The Rapture&apos; with it&apos;s small town dramas set against an apocalyptic backdrop. &apos;Gone Home&apos; was nice too with the house revealing bits and pieces of the characters&apos; past.
<br>
<br>I think the difference here is that there&apos;s absolutely no dialogue, text, ANYTHING except animation and music. So it&apos;s all left up to your imagination as to what&apos;s going on. The problem for me was that the storytelling just wasn&apos;t strong or interesting enough to grab me at any point, even though the music kept trying to convince me that I was taking part in &apos;epic&apos; scenes. When the &apos;revelations&apos; come at the end, they make little sense, emotionally or intellectually even if you&apos;ve been following all the &apos;clues&apos; along the way.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve heard some comparisons to &apos;Twin Peaks&apos; but other than an obvious homage scene in a roadside bar with a sound-alike tune playing, it reminded me more of &apos;The X Files&apos;. The music especially was very very reminiscent of &apos;The X Files&apos;. Imagine an episode of &apos;The X Files&apos; without dialogue. In first person. That jump cuts around. And you&apos;re not sure what&apos;s present/past/future/hallucinations. Which is the major issue here... other than some basic plot, I was never quite sure what&apos;s going on, why, or what meaning it had in the grander scheme of things... so I never got caught up in it.
<br>
<br>It sort of feels like it&apos;s going to be playing a detective game... but you don&apos;t do any detecting or figure anything out. You just sort of click through scene after scene. If you do happen to walk around... you can occasionally pick up a flower or a feather, which at the beginning you assume there must be some meaning or point to, but the meaning never really comes...
<br>
<br>Overall the experience was a little too willfully vague and arty for my tastes and left me cold. Points for a nice art style, lighting etc. While the music was well orchestrated, again it felt a little heavy handed without knowing exactly what was going on.
<br>
<br>Even for ~$10... it&apos;s hard to recommend this game. Emotionally it didn&apos;t grab me. Intellectually it was too vague for me to feel like I was figuring anything out. Mechanically there&apos;s really nothing to do other than scan for the next hotspot. Narratively the story is pretty slight and doesn&apos;t hold much weight because you&apos;re perpetually waiting for clarity which never comes.
<br>
<br>Advice for their next game? Steer a little less on the obscure side, just a little, if you want your players to be able to get wrapped up in the tale you&apos;re telling.
<br>
<br>2.5/5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/virginia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6708335">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Then we get locked up for absolutely no reason. Like... wtf is happening?
<br>And from then on the game just spits random scenes at you of a fictional life, then we&apos;re back in the cell throwing in an acid trip... why are we even doing this?

<br>As a gamer, and as someone who loves &quot;walking sims&quot; and artistic games, there is no reason that this should have been told as a game instead of movie. You have no agency, there is no sense of exploration, you can&apos;t affect any outcome, and you never have any option to choose. You pretty much walk through a series of very linear levels with usually only one object to interact with at any given time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/virginia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6713112">Expand</a></span>

I always give at least a one, as a game, at the very least, usually lives up the bare minimum standard of attempting to be a game.
<br>
<br>The reason this gets a zero from me is because I&apos;m being asked to review it as a game, when it is not a game - it is an interactive movie. And in this case, the interactive part barely exists.
<br>
<br>I challenge anyone to answer me this - what would be different, at all, about this &apos;game&apos; if you just watched a YouTube longplay of it? You&apos;d get the same visuals, largely the same pace, the same story, the same music - indeed, the same everything except you don&apos;t press a button every so often.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s not a game! I&apos;m really not trying to be an elitist douche about this, as I&apos;m just stating a fact - a game is interactive and allows a player agency to make their own decisions. Going back as early as Pong, the player had the option of moving up and down to guess the direction of the ball and bounce it back a certain way. This game is just a movie. Honestly, that&apos;s all it is. If you played this in a cinema, and invited people to press a big red button every time they saw an object on screen, it&apos;d be the same game.
<br>
<br>So, as a &apos;game&apos;, it gets a zero. As a movie, it&apos;s actually not that bad and I&apos;d score it a five or whatever, as despite being pretentious, the story that they have chosen is well directed for the most part with a &quot;show don&apos;t tell&quot; structure. It has infinitely more in common with a movie than a game, so why isn&apos;t this in the movie section as a direct to DVD movie? The &apos;gameplay&apos; aspects could be done by a DVD remote control.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll never understand why review sites cream their pants over this type of thing. It really isn&apos;t new - remember the Phillips CDi? Night Trap? Plumbers Don&apos;t Wear Ties? Virginia is in every way a classier version of those with up to date graphics and somehow less gameplay!
<br>
<br>If Titanic had QTEs that said &quot;Press X to grab the wooden door&quot;, &quot;Tap Y to shag in a car&quot;, would that be a game? A discussion needs to be had about how these things are classified, because while they are still being marketed as full games, they are conning people into buying a thing they didn&apos;t expect from a game. At the very least, it&apos;d be nice to see, as a standard, these things put the sentence &quot;An Interactive Movie&quot; on the front cover.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/virginia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6707777">Expand</a></span>

<br>Interactive Confusion
<br>Virginia is a first person thriller where you play as an fbi agent during an investigation of a missing person&#x2026;.
<br>The game starts by telling you this story is based on true events, and a lot of weird stuff happens, so I&#x2019;m not too sure how true that is..
<br>This game is really all over the place and I don&#x2019;t even understand why some things were in the story, or why they mattered, and I came to no conclusions at the end&#x2026;
<br>It&#x2019;s really a jumbled mess&#x2026;
<br>This isn&#x2019;t so much a game as it is a 1 and a half hr long interactive movie&#x2026;
<br>You do nothing but occasionally tap x or find an object to interact with and the story pushes on.. Or back. Or side to side. In dreams... drug trips
<br>Again, it jumps all over the place&#x2026;
<br>The world in Virginia though is absolutely gorgeous&#x2026;
<br>Easily one of the best looking games I&#x2019;ve played this year...
<br>Walking through the small sections I did was a very enjoyable experience&#x2026;
<br>The mood and setting fits the story perfectly&#x2026;
<br>But again, it&#x2019;s pretty hard to call this a game&#x2026; any more than reading along to a mystery novel is a game...
<br>You don&#x2019;t make choices&#x2026;
<br>And the characters in this world don&#x2019;t talk at all&#x2026;
<br>You have to read body language to get any sense of what&#x2019;s going on&#x2026;
<br>and even then it&#x2019;s still tough as there seems to be like 5 different stories going on at once, and out of order&#x2026;
<br>Virginia is beautiful, but a mess&#x2026; and not a beautiful mess&#x2026;
<br>But I&#x2019;m only 1 person... other critics seem to be in love with this game, calling it emotionally powerful and thought provoking&#x2026; but I just don&#x2019;t see it.
<br>I felt like overall this game accomplished nothing but feeling like one of the most movie like games to date, but the story and its delivery just didn&#x2019;t do it for me
<br>I Give Virginia
<br>a 6.0/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/virginia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6707358">Expand</a></span>

There is a lot of detail and nuance in the surroundings and the actions of the NPCs, and the world feels real enough that at times I actually felt afraid to make the player character turn around for fear of what I would see. Given that there is literally no way to get hurt or be set back, that&apos;s an impressive level of psychological impact.
<br>
<br>Having that said, there were some parts that I thought were vague and confusing - and not in the interesting what-is-really-going-on-here, is-this-dream-or-reality way that the game strives for (and often, in fairness, succeeds at). Given how much the game depends on a sense of immersion, any moment when you&apos;re not sure where you are and what you&apos;re doing is a problem. To be sure, it&apos;s very impressive how often you DO understand what&apos;s going on without a single line of dialog or even much in the way of written records, but still - at times, I felt like the game was failing to either show OR tell, and dropped me out of the story as a result.
<br>
<br>All in all, I would consider it flawed but still interesting. If you have twenty bucks to spend on a few hours of strange and haunting experiences, I&apos;d recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/virginia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6713909">Expand</a></span>

Though it attempts to be minimalistic without telling you anything through words, it still leaves too many questions unanswered, and because we never get to know the characters, there&apos;s no reason to care about them. Thus when the experience asks us to feel sad, there&apos;s no precedent, so you&apos;re left feeling nothing.  The worst part of it all is that there&apos;s nothing inherently wrong with the story. It&apos;s not so bad that I can at least laugh at it. It&apos;s actualy boring, which is worse than being offensively bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/virginia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6709264">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It has very good music, produces an amazingly immersive atmosphere with stylized, colourful and vibrant colours. It tells a story with images, cinematic cuts instead of walls of text.
<br>
<br>Games that primarily tell a story need to make compromises. If you include quicktime events (telltale games) it can easily break immersion and disrupt the flow of the story. If you include riddles (Myst-like) it often boils down to a journey from one riddle bottleneck to another. If you allow total freedom of movement and investigation - you can only really advance your story in short bits (mission based).
<br>
<br>So if you want to tell a coherend story (kind of like a book) - you have to restrict the players involvement. Which in turn causes the player to go from being a protagonist to a spectator.
<br>
<br>In Virginia - the player is a spectator. You have no real influence on the story. You do not have choices to make that can fundamentally change the course of the story. All you can do is advance the story at your pace - sort of.
<br>
<br>What makes this story stand out is that there is rather little exposition. There is no narrator, no talking. It is all in the images. There is not even an &quot;inner voice&quot; (or a protagonists thoughts) ... so the player can either understand a scene, interpret a scene or not.
<br>
<br>Personally - i found this very artistic and stylish. And i had a lot of fun just &quot;being&quot; there - getting immersed by the atmosphere and the imagery. I can however understand that one might be disappointed. Not only is there little replay value (you may replay it ... just as you may re-watch a movie. But it is not the same as watching it for the first time) - but there simply is not much &quot;to do&quot;.
<br>
<br>That is/might be a problem for the developers of this game (such games in general) ...
<br>
<br>When the player becomes such an irrelevant element in the game ... and the story becomes the one and most dominant factor ... why buy the game when you can probably watch someone else play on YouTube.
<br>
<br>Still - for me - it is a clear 8/10 for a beautifully crafted and told story well worth the time. (right before or after i go back to something like Fallout 4 - where the player controls everything)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/virginia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6707793">Expand</a></span>

The characters are bland, and not only because they won&apos;t say a word, but because it&apos;s very hard to follow on who? where? what? why? The visuals are fine, but the world is as lifeless as it could be. You basically wander around empty spaces looking for a next spot to click (which is incredibly easy, considering that the mouse cursor changes after you hit a live spot).
<br>
<br>The only strong point is the score played by the Philharmonic Orchestra from Prague. That&apos;s why I&apos;m giving this game a 3. Other than that, I&apos;d tell you to stay away from this one. If you have to, watch it on youtube or something. It takes around two, two-and-a-half hours tops, and you&apos;ll be able to rewind the boring parts. For me it was a no-no.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/virginia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6711398">Expand</a></span>

<br>I went into this thinking I would be hands on in solving a crime, but in reality you just go through the motions and &quot;play along&quot; so to speak, taking yourself where the game leads you. Much is lost in my opinion with no dialogue. It really pulls you out of the narrative because you&apos;re not used to living in a world where everyone is mute. Does it work without it, sure, mostly, but some things can be a bit confusing.
<br>
<br>SPOILER TIME:
<br>I was following along well enough until at some point, the two investigators get arrested for seemingly no real reason, and then your character literally takes a dose of acid in the jail cell and somehow solves the crime i guess while in her own head space? After that point it&apos;s hard to tell when or if she ever snaps back to reality or if the ending I&apos;m seeing is still just fantasy.
<br>END SPOILER
<br>
<br>Should you buy?
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a short game, like only two hours.. Think of it as a silent playable cartoon, and probably worth the ten bucks considering the effort put into it, and it&apos;s interesting enough, but as I said, the end may or may not do it for you, I know it didn&apos;t for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/virginia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6707705">Expand</a></span>

I owe the experience to the great gaming website Killscreen(https://killscreen.com/articles/virginia-vague-jumble-ideas/) ... which wrote a rather scathing review of it. Something about this review gave me pause though. The author traces the game&apos;s cinematic heritage, from X-Files to Twin Peaks and then going as far back as the silent films of the 1920&#x2019;s. In the end it concludes that the game fails to live up to it&#x2019;s heritage, saying &#x201C;the game dives into an irreparable gulf between the way a film camera unrelentingly directs your gaze and the way a first-person videogame camera yields to player control, and all its mistakes begin to snowball from there.&#x201D;
<br>
<br>The critique picks up steam from there and while it admits &quot;There are admirable attempts here at dealing with sexism, racial prejudice, and even gaslighting&quot; it is essentially hostile. It&#x2019;s primary complaint is that the narrative fails to give the player sufficient autonomy going so far as to say &#x201C;But there is no reason, not one, that the player needs to be afforded control in any of Virginia&#x2019;s scenes&#x2014;except as a sop to interactivity in a game that otherwise evinces no interest in player control whatsoever.&#x201D;  At the same time it complains that the interactivity the game does provide, which is to say the ability to navigate the space of the scenes and interact with them in minimal ways is ruins its the cinematic aspirations saying &#x201C;The clarity of meaning that can arise from a well-timed cut is almost entirely lost on the roving camera of a first-person videogame&#x201D;.
<br>
<br>All these contradictions and strong emotional responses from a source that is usually thoughtful and collected intrigued me... Behind the protests of the author I heard the all too familiar &#x2018;But it&#x2019;s not even a game&#x2019; that I have heard from more traditional game media outlets when they were faced with games like Dear Esther or Gone Home.  Normally Killscreen is more self aware and interested in that kind of storytelling in games, so why had Virginia offended it&#x2019;s sensibilities so much? It all gave me the sense that if I should investigate I might well find a game worth playing, and so I did.
<br>
<br>So, Virginia...
<br>
<br>The short of it is that I think in this case Killscreen missed the point almost entirely. They are right about many of the game&apos;s merits and some of it&#x2019;s flaws, I won&#x2019;t argue that it&#x2019;s a perfect work of art. But it is a work of art and the reviewer&#x2019;s assertion that there is not even one reason that the player needs to be given control gets directly to the heart of it, because there is indeed one very important reason. The thing that sets Virginia apart from other games or from movies is that you are not either passively watching the experience of characters as in cinema or playing through a game yourself. You are moving through the story AS the character.
<br>
<br>On the title screen of the game the text below the title reads &#x201C;Press x to take a trip&#x201D;, not press x to play the game, this is the first clue as to what is about to happen here.
<br>
<br>The limitations on your actions in Virginia are not the result of lazy developers, they are the expression of the choices of the character. Choices that are sometimes limited by the personality of the character, sometimes limited by their race or gender.  When you have no choice but to open your purse and open a tube of lipstick and put it on before you can leave the room it is because that is the experience of the character. Welcome to her world.
<br>
<br>The constant cinematic cuts mean that you are not walking down a corridor because it is between you and the next cut scene you are walking down it because the developers wanted you to have that experience. Rather than just venting the frustration and discomfort that it causes ask why the developers included it and what your response says about the character and about you as a player.
<br>
<br>The first person perspective is critical to this attempt to embody the player in the body of the main character. It is subtly and well done and I believe has powerful impact in many scenes. From the first time you look down and see the color of your skin and shape of your body to the juxtaposition of perspective between the scene where you receive your badge to the later scene of an imagined future where you are giving a badge to a new female agent on that same stage.
<br>
<br>The narrative itself is very challenging. It is filled with both flashbacks, imagined futures, dreams and in the case of the last minutes of the game an intense acid trip, yes we see what you did with the wording of the instructions on the title screen, how very clever of you.
<br>
<br>Does the game make sense and present a tidy comprehensible story? Not so much.  Is it something new and important, something that we will look back on as foundational to our art form in 50 years... probably.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/virginia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6715577">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Don&apos;t listen to people complaining about the game length, they really need to understand game development more. No good film or piece of music begins by setting out how long it will be. Gamers need to start thinking quality, not quantity. The two hours it takes to complete is paced perfectly, had it lasted much longer than attention would start to fade.
<br>
<br>Since there&apos;s a demo available, I&apos;ll just end off with a comment on the music. The score is fantastic, unbelievably high levels of production value, and is a step in the right direction for the industry. Play with headphones! The sountrack adds a lot of emotion, and I don&apos;t see that as a bad thing at all.

Its obviosuly not trying to appeal to the mainstream gamer, even not to those who might like the more mainstream &apos;&apos;walking simulators&apos;&apos; like Vanishing of Ethan Carter. There is some walking involved in the game yes, but its not even torturing and areas you explore on foot are small in scale. Its going the linear narrative driven way where theres no dialogue, which will instantly turn a lot of people off, you have to interpret a lot of the plot on your own. Also the game plays out like a TV show where it will instantly jump from one scene to the other, even when youre interacting with the game, sometimes jumping forward when theres something you wanted to finish doing, which was bit annoying. I can see some will try to convince themselves that the game is pushing SJW agenda, but its really not.
<br>
<br>To be honest even i didnt fully understood the story, its constantly messing with your mind with these dream like sequences leaving you guessing whether whats happening is real or not, but i kinda liked it and enjoyed it, but then again i kinda didnt pay my fullest of attention many times and overlooked some of the plot elements. Then again i feel that the devs intended the game that way to introudce some confusion and mistery to the overall experience.
<br>
<br>I liked this game and thats that. And the soundtrack was nice, props to the composer and Prague Philharmonic orchestra.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/virginia/user-reviews?user_review_id=6927422">Expand</a></span>
