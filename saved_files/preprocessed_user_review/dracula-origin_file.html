<br>I must say, despite the general graphics (not up-to-date, not for the 2008) and some enigmas (a bit &apos;too difficult sometimes), the interesting setting, the very complete and mature plot, the sense of growing tension, and some small &quot;gems&quot; that I do not reveal (spoiler), made &#x200B;&#x200B;me really appreciate this game.

You must read all documents you find, for many times the answer is in them. I actually like that, and the texts are not long nor too many so reading them isn&apos;t boring at all. You can talk just to a few people and just about certain things, but most of them would be the ones you would have asked for, so you don&apos;t get that &apos;hey, I want to know about this other thing!&apos; feeling. In the game you keep taking items from the scenario, not knowing really why you can take those and not others until you actually need them. I think it would make much more sense if it didn&apos;t allow you to take anything until you knew that you need it. In any case, that&apos;s a general issue of many adventure games, not only this one. Also, as in most adventure games, you&apos;ll have to combine the items in your inventory many times to discover others, which is a good feature. The game is not hard, but if you have trouble spoting items, by simply pressing the space bar you can see what you can do in an scenario, which is quite useful in a specific part of the game. As I said, the game is not very hard, for most cases when an item is needed the game shows where (a hand icon appears when you put your mouse over the spot) and (by clicking on it)  Helsing says &apos;I need something more&apos;, so you only need to figure out which item could fit the place. However some puzzles simply stand there and you have to solve them with no previous explanation of what you should do. I found this really cool, for it feels more like the real thing, but you may find some of them a little more challenging, which I particularly liked. As to the graphics of the scenarios and characters, I didn&apos;t expected much, and maybe due to that the game looked really good to me. There are even some cutsceenes that, although short, make the game more enjoyable. The only problem about them were the low volume they had, but I just raised the volume whenever one of them started and that&apos;s it. As to the sound, I found the music very appropriate, not standing out but just giving the game a bit of its mystery atmosphere. And I actually liked the spanish voice of Helsing, although sometimes the emotions were a bit exaggerated. As to the duration, it took me just 9 hours to complete it, so it isn&apos;t very long, but in these days it&apos;s easy to find it in offers for 2&#x20AC; or less, so if you aren&apos;t very demanding and like puzzle-adventure games it is worth a try. Graphics: 7.5. Sound: 7.0. Gameplay: 7.5. Duration: 6.0. Price(without offers): 6.5. Replayability: No. Final Mark: 6.9</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dracula-origin/user-reviews?user_review_id=3224321">Expand</a></span>
