So far the leveling experience has been very enjoyable, with some of the best questing thus far. All of the new zones are beautiful. Top notch. Very happy with the way this release turned out. You will not be disappointed again.</span>

<br>Lets see how Blizzards Devs manage to keep their promises say 6months down the line. For now, im rating it Average and if it truly is a great expansion. I will change my rating</span>

I will update this review in a month, but right now it is a solid 9/10 for fun factor and how the combat/classes are structured which is huge for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6677367">Expand</a></span>

So far it&apos;s a mashup of Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King with a constant narrative of your character being the chosen one who will save the universe from the Legion (while you&apos;re running around your class hall with everyone else who are ALSO &quot;chosen ones&quot; wielding the same artifact weapons). Level 103 now and I&apos;m already deathly bored with the expansion. If you&apos;ve played for any decent amount of time, there&apos;s nothing really all that new here - just the same typical Blizzard questing design and story telling all leading to the inevitable raid, raid, raid end game.
<br>
<br>It would appear that after 11 years, I&apos;ve finally reached the point of simply being done. The experiences can&apos;t carry the game any longer and the social constructs that used to keep me coming back for my friends and guildmates have long been gutted. World of Warcraft continues down the path of being hyper casual, with Blizzard milking the diehard fanbase as much as they can while they still can. I fully expect Legion to suffer the same first month player dropoff as Warlords - and I&apos;ll be one of them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6675874">Expand</a></span>

<br>They are trying to make every player feel so important as if they are playing an Elder Scrolls single player game.  Too bad it&apos;s an MMO and that mentality (which works fantastically in a games like Elder Scrolls) goes against everything a massively multiplayer game is supposed to stand for.

<br>Wow used to be the pioneer in this form of social, epic storytelling in the multiplayer setting.  Making the game feel like you couldn&apos;t face the world alone, now it&apos;s the exact opposite and it blows chunks all day long... why Blizz? you really just don&apos;t get it do you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6684123">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- You still click buttons and receive free gear. You can even get legendaries from quests now.
<br>
<br>- The game still feels very impersonal. Server blending, server hopping + easy alts (you can buy lvl 100 characters) completely remove the sense of community from the game.
<br>
<br>- Most of the world is still useless. Sure, you will be doing quests in the new areas, but all the low level areas will be empty. Professions are a joke, as you don&apos;t even need to get materials from the low level zones anymore (for the sake of being able to have a lot of alts with maxed out professions).
<br>
<br>- Rewards don&apos;t really feel like rewards.. I mean, you start the expansion with legendary weapons.....
<br>
<br>- Classes have no weaknesses. PvP is more about spamming all your abilities and hope that at some point the opponent&apos;s cooldowns won&apos;t be up fast enough, instead of actually exploiting the weaknesses of certain classes.
<br>
<br>- The customer support is subpar comparatively to vanilla/tbc/wrath.
<br>
<br>Now, let me also mention some things that were introduced with Legion and make absolutely no sense at all:
<br>
<br>- Scaling levels on EVERY new creature....... I don&apos;t even know anymore.. Am I playing World of Warcraft? Maybe they should rename the game to &quot;World of scaling realities and multiple possibilities&quot;. Why is the entire world instanced all of a sudden?
<br>
<br>- Nothing PvP related has been released, for now. They&apos;re more focused on releasing new battle pets and cosmetics it seems.
<br>
<br>- Terrible class balancing.
<br>
<br>- The expansion had MANY bugs at release and the game still crashes a lot on certain systems (error 132 has been very common ever since beta and hasn&apos;t been resolved still).
<br>
<br>All of the above make WoW look more like a facebook minigame, rather than the great MMO it once used to be. You can&apos;t really blame Blizzard for that however. The average gamer just has much lower standards these days. It&apos;s just sad that Blizzard used to be this revolutionary developer and now they&apos;ve hit rock bottom, releasing one cash grab after another, while still somehow being #1 in popularity among gamers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6684288">Expand</a></span>

Now, I enjoyed Wrath a lot, and it was the only expansion I went to a midnight release for. I was hyped for Wrath in the same way that Legion has hyped people back up for WoW. But having seen this before I was barely hyped for legion, and what hype there was has worn off. I&apos;m level 109 currently, and for the last 5 levels I&apos;ve been pretty bored. The story is decent, but it&apos;s not as good as BC or Wrath. The fact that you&apos;re now chosen one once again is really off-putting, as is how the few other people you see in the world (due to heavy use of phasing outside of major hubs) are the chosen ones of their own phased story questlines. If everyone&apos;s special, then no one is.
<br>
<br>Other things I disliked: that you only have one weapon for the expansion (a unique weapon, the only one in the world - which somehow everyone else also has) and yet weapons drop often (for me it seemed like 30% of drops were still weapons, presumably for transmogs?). Endgame content that exists just so you can grind for artifact power. &quot;World Quests&quot; which sounded cool in concept, but are primarily &quot;fly to this other zone, kill some mobs, and report back&quot;. To be fair - some of those world quests also involve you going into a dungeon before killing mobs and reporting back.
<br>
<br>This expansion is weak. Better than WoD, definitely - but weak. There&apos;s nothing new here, just a rehash of older expansions and bigger numbers. I&apos;m glad I got Legion for free, because it is not worth 60 dollars. 15, maybe. I want to give this expansion a 4, but it loses a point for being boring, for having so much phased content, and for only being a less poorly done WoD.
<br>
<br>Rating: 1/10
<br>Recommendation: Don&apos;t purchase this game. You&apos;ll get bored after a few days. If you want a grindy MMO, go play Rift. It&apos;s free and a modern WoW-like experience. Just don&apos;t spend money on this game because this experience is not worth money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6678981">Expand</a></span>

After years of agonizing alone in our Garrisons, Blizzard released Legion and with it, countless additions and improvements.
<br>
<br>Some big additions include: The Demon Hunter, a new hero class, a huge revamp of pvp, with it&apos;s prestige system being derived from games like CoD, the addition of Artifact Weapons that serve as an extra path of progression during end game, class order halls which are basically populated garrisons and some really cool dungeons with a mythic+ difficulty that resembles the Great rifts from D3.
<br>
<br>Alas, this game just isn&apos;t what it used to be. World of Warcraft just isn&apos;t the game that I grew up with anymore, and it isn&apos;t because of me. I haven&apos;t changed. The game has, in a very bad way. Many of the problems that have plagued the game since Wrath of The Lich King, are still present. The community is non-existant, end-game content with the exception of Mythic (+) is easy and forgettable, but most importantly, this game just doesn&apos;t feel like an MMORPG anymore.
<br>
<br>Being someone that has played since Vanilla, I fondly remember the days in which you actually depended on other players in order to progress. Take legendaries, for example. Forging Sulfuras was a colossal achievement, a server wide event, a great celebration for every member of the guild which had the lucky guy.
<br>Now? Legendaries just drop from doing Dungeons and Raids. Just like that. Randomly. It is so unrewarding and so forgettable, even the Legendary cape from MoP was more interesting.
<br>
<br>Anyways, this is just the tip of the iceberg: Classes are at their worst state ever, many of them are unrecognizable, the method of gearing is copy-pasted directly from Diablo with all it&apos;s RNG, the Artifact Power grind is gated by time as you receive so little AP from **** you do unless you research Artifact Knowledge which takes days. And I haven&apos;t even touched on the PvP, but I&apos;m not a Pvper so I&apos;ll let others judge that.
<br>
<br>There are good things too, I have to admit: Dungeons kick-ass and are actually cool and unique, I like Class Hall campaigns but I despise the fact that they are time-gated with follower missions and I like the Demon Hunter.
<br>
<br>Overall though, when I think what this game once was and what it is now, I just kinda get sad. WoW is still a shadow of it&apos;s former glory, and I&apos;m afraid it will never return to the glory days of Vanilla/TBC/Wotlk.
<br>
<br>Alas, if you are a new player and want to try this game, I&apos;d still recommend it. It is still the best MMO on the market and probably you&apos;ll have a few months of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6905259">Expand</a></span>

<br>PvP was a bit unbalanced, except it was my fault for being new to this, but nevertheless not really welcoming.
<br>As an mmo? yes of course it has great mechanics, after all it was one of the first of its kind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6795439">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played the game up until march 2017 since, well, release I suppose. Story wise expansion is great. That&apos;s good news. Bad news: good news end here.
<br>
<br>Legion has introduced new levels of RNG walls, class simplification and content recycling. Prepare to experience the wonders of grinding for AP and legendaries, doing repetitive World Quests, and visiting same dungeons over and over again, but this time forced to go there, as best AP and out-of-raids gear can only be obtained there.
<br>
<br>To sweeten the pot - chance to get what you actually want in those mythic+ dungeons is extremely low (instead of individual loot pools from each boss you only get 1-2 items from doing the whole thing, so chances to get particular item drop through the ground, not even to mention that most of the time you need that item to &quot;roll high&quot; - get a sufficient titanforged bonus for it to actually be good for you, which adds another layer of rng on top of already awful rng wall.
<br>
<br>Grinding for legendaries is another plague that was added with Legion. If you harbor hopes of doing any high-end content - prepare to grind day and night, unless you are one of those lucky persons who win big in casinos in first hour: getting throughput legendaries that are not junk will require you to sell your very soul to RNG gods. Out of pool of ~8 possible legendaries (for the time when I quit) normally only 2-3 are really good, rest varying from semi-decent to &quot;burn and scatter that trash right now&quot;, really depending on class. This also not only impacts directly your chances to be taken into a good progression group (also directly linking your luck to how well you can perform - without right legendaries you will never get close to other players who have them, and so you will be quite likely turned down by many progress raiding teams). Not to mention that you should probably give up any hopes of playing your alts - if going through legendary and AP grinding hell on main wasn&apos;t enough, you can always opt to repeat it on your alt and sink another sizable chunk of your life into this frustration fueled experience.
<br>
<br>This expansion is totally not alt friendly for said reasons: grinding AP, grinding legendaries, and the fact that thanks to lack of weekly lockout on mythic+ time you spend on your alt is time you could spend improving your main (and potentially getting that one sweet, sweet legendary). If you are in a progression/mythic oriented guild - you will always be reminded that you should be grinding on your raiding character instead of having fun with alts.
<br>
<br>Definition of &quot;Legendary&quot; items has reached new bottom: not it&apos;s not just rather ordinary to receive a &quot;Legendary!&quot; item, now it also can be disappointing and frustrating!
<br>
<br>Players that stay for longer periods of time are the ones that are getting hurt by new Blizzard course the most. Currently game is strongly oriented towards &quot;seasonal&quot; players: players who come for a few weeks every time new content is released, only to abandon game until next content influx. If you are kind of player who sticks around from patch to patch.
<br>Prepare to be frustrated by the game, and prepare to be disappointed every time you see that one friend of yours (who doesn&apos;t even really remember what&apos;s going on plot-wise) log in for a few days when new content is out to &quot;check it out&quot; only to luck out and get his best in slot legendaries and high titanforged items, then snarky remark that &quot;lol, that&apos;s all content?&quot;, and proceed with quitting until next patch, while you still don&apos;t have the legendary you want half a year after launch and doing content weekly since then.
<br>
<br>Prepare to grind your soul out trying to get your hidden artifact appearance (especially Combat &quot;aka Outlaw&quot; rogue one. Really, good luck with that, I&apos;ve personally met ppl who have ran both of those dungeons over 400 times each, and I myself ran them over 150 times without getting anything). Prepare to hear how some random guildie will get one on his alt and never use it, or laugh in chat about how easy it was.
<br>
<br>Classes have devolved even further, under false pretense of &quot;trimming&quot;/&quot;pruning&quot;/making them &quot;fun&quot; to play. Instead of fun you get flashiness and instant gratification centered gameplay with little depth to it and low skill ceiling (even MoP/Cata were better in that). Some classes stay broken months into expansion without any improvement (promises that &quot;it&apos;s coming soon&#x2122;&quot; don&apos;t count) - look up hunters ever since legion launched, or warlocks.
<br>
<br>Overall I would place Legion among worst expansions World of Warcraft ever had, even more so because things it did get *really good* get simply crossed out by how frustrating and grindy game has become. Yes, story is good. Yes, raiding is somewhat solid. Yes, mythic+ is fun to do, but only at first. Yes, introduction of appearance collections and sets is welcome. But all of it gets totally overshadowed by how much game has degraded in its very core aspects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=7377172">Expand</a></span>

<br>PVP is template based and...it&apos;s UNBALANCED.
<br>They sometimes introduce small class changes in order to balance things...SMALL they say.. from 7.2 to 7.2.5 they almost doubled the Warlock Chaos Bolt damage. SMALL changes. This goes to show how balanced things are... I almost feel like they never play a battleground before releasing a patch.
<br>Feels very stupid from their side.
<br>
<br>Coming from someone with vanilla experience I have to say that the fun factor has dropped significantly with Legion....
<br>
<br>I&apos;m really sad to say and write this,...was hoping for some patches to repair things but unfortunately it&apos;s worse and worse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=7376618">Expand</a></span>

Sadly this isn&apos;t the case.
<br>The reason why we all loved The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King is because we had the feeling of something that was actually new back then. We got new races and a Hero Class, something that was really cool! But now that we&apos;re seeing it done time and time again in every expansion, it&apos;s no longer as exciting as it once was. Here&apos;re some of my feelings towards this expansion:
<br>
<br>---
<br>Let&apos;s talk about questing
<br>
<br>While it took me a while to get to max level (110) due to the fact that I got bored out of my mind while questing in each zone. The reason for this is perhaps that there are still too many quests in each zone and a lot of them gets repetitive after a while with its typical kill this / fetch this. There&apos;s also a lot of Rares and Treasures which gives you either gear and/or artifact power, yet the farming for artifact power is just as boring and tedious as questing in the long run. However, I do like the artifact talent tree which is obviously a throwback to the talent tree of old WoW.
<br>
<br>---
<br>Let&apos;s talk about PvE
<br>
<br>This is basically the same as it&apos;s ever been with a minor twist. They improved the dungeons this time around by giving you keystone challenges that let you run dungeons with a harder difficulty for a better reward and a true feeling of teamwork where you have to communicate with each other instead of being silent. This is definitely an improvement over the stale queuing for randoms just to have the same experience every time.
<br>Raids are pretty much the same as I understand and it seems that dungeons kind of replace them by having some replay value, though the better gear will still be attainable in raids.
<br>
<br>---
<br>Let&apos;s talk about PvP
<br>
<br>There is no longer any PvP gear and that shouldn&apos;t matter anyway, farming for PvP gear was a boring grind in the first place. You now randomly receive a strongbox with loot - and if you&apos;re lucky enough you will receive something good - even though most of you won&apos;t have as much luck, I certainly haven&apos;t. Instead, you get your own talents for PvP to unlock by acquiring enough honor and eventually you&apos;ll be able to prestige for greater rewards such as cosmetics and mounts.
<br>To me, this is actually a major improvement to the PvP aspect and makes me want to constantly play BGs.
<br>
<br>---
<br>In retrospect, I think most of us are done with WoW and it feels like no matter how much they improve the game it just won&apos;t make us last playing it any more. But for new players, this might be fun for a while, but it&apos;s still going to make them look for other opportunities in games after a few months.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6712789">Expand</a></span>

Short answer: No.
<br>
<br>World of Warcraft has faced a significant issue of slowly moving away from its roots in recent years, with expansions like Warlords of Draenor draining the subscription base more in pure number and % of players than any expansion previously, losing over half of its subscribers within months of release, and that is just that we know about it could very easily have been much more since Blizzard stopped telling the public the subscriber count towards the final year of WoD. Mists of Pandaria introduced some very controversial changes and had a significant lack of balance in certain areas such as PvP, and refusal to buff or nerf any classes after the first week or so of a tier. This lead to a very poor response to MoP early on, but it still provided an excellent quality of PvE and casual content. WoD swung in and provided a whole new level of &apos;leveling&apos; but that was all it brought, it took away a significant amount removing things such as snap shotting and many classes received extremely large nerfs to their kits and even removed a huge level of skillful play, along with the worst PvP seasons we have ever seen even including TBC.
<br>
<br>What does Legion offer at first glance? A LOT of playtime value, in the past there was never a reason to become intimately familiar with the landscapes and areas of WoW, in Legion this is changed you will become more familiar with the areas of the Broken Isles than even your favorite Vanilla zones as World Quests will keep you constantly exploring areas. Dungeons have a legitimate reason to be done after the first couple of days with the introduction of mythic dungeons on release and even the new Mythic + dungeons. Artifact weapons will keep you constantly progressing even in the highest of mythic gear a heroic dungeon still gives you something you desperately want, and that is artifact power, all while wielding a weapon of incredible power that makes you genuinely feel like a hero more than any other expansion.
<br>
<br>But what is wrong with the expansion to make me give such a promising sounding expansion a mere 6? They have truly attempted to turn the game in a direction of pure casual play, you should not ever expect to be competitive with everyone else with the largest separating factor being skill anymore. With the addition of Artifact weapons we see a whole new metric that Blizzard has significant struggles attempting to keep in balance due to the lack of experience they have with it. This concept however is not new they suggested in back in Wrath of the Lich King as the &apos;Titan&apos;s Path&apos; system which was almost exactly the same and was meant to replace glyphs, which wouldn&apos;t you know it the expansion we lose glyphs we get this exact system only in the form of weapons. The issue is that they play a massive role in your dps, your dps will almost double from a 0 AP weapon and a maxed one. That doesn&apos;t sound terrible until you realize just how long it takes to fill one up, the average high-end player as of now almost 2 months in aren&apos;t even 20% through their artifact, and what is worse? Even if you join right now you won&apos;t be able to catch up due to the Artifact Knowledge system, which increases AP gains by huge margins, up to level 28 which increases AP gained by 24,900% you would think &apos;oh then eventually it&apos;ll be easy to catch up&apos;, unfortunately Blizzard has already confirmed they will be extending these systems within half a year of launch, which is roughly around when the very first players will reach level 28. Is there a catch up system? Yes, and if you started only 1 week after everyone else you&apos;ll finally catch up by January... Is this the worst part of the game now? No, in fact it is one of the less problematic issues with Legion. Legendaries are by far the most controversial, having recently confirmed in a Q&amp;A that there is no bad luck protection, but that there was a bug that increased the drop chance of legendaries for those who already had one, they have confirmed an extremely unfair system, there are literally high-end raiders without a single Legendary 2 months into the expansion while others posses 4-5 and you can wield 2 at a time, but surely you can atleast make sure you get a good one right? Nope, they scrapped that idea, you now just have to pray you don&apos;t get a bad one. Surely that must be the worst thing about the expansion right? Haha, nope, mythic+ literally ruined the tier, when you can literally spam the dungeons over a hundred times a week this means anyone who wants to be even slightly competitive has to spend 40+ hours a week JUST in dungeons alone, where people can literally get the luck of gods and get items dozens of ilvls above what they should be.
<br>
<br>I would go on but I&apos;m at character limit, game is fun for casuals, garbage for anyone who wants to be able to compete.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6754278">Expand</a></span>

Forcing PvP players to do PvE i.e. Or announcing that gear will make almost no difference in PvP, still it feels just as bad facing a well geared player with all honor talents and full artifact traits as a partly maxed character. Also random PvP balance is lackluster.</span>

<br>Dungeon groups and LFGs (Unless you are doing them with people that you know), are no better than the rest of the Internet, full of trolls, haters, and as*es.  Why would I want to participate in that?

<br>This is it for me.  I have been playing since 2006 and I simply refuse to be forced into a situation that I absolutely dislike, like being stuck in a dungeon with people that I rather not associate with.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6716037">Expand</a></span>

<br>1) Too many options of PvE. Seriously, Blizzard, previously we had 5 man normal, 5 man heroic, 10/25 normal, and, ok, 25 heroic. But in WotLK, during Crusaders&apos; Coliseum, it was already pain in the ass. Players should complete the same content over and over, for the same items with better numbers. Now I should complete the same 5-ppl (!) dungeons, again and again, over and over.
<br>
<br>2) Artifact system. Great idea, but in the end it&apos;s just a lot of farming, Moreover, EVERY player has this freaking legendary-mythic-omg items. Every paladin has Ashbringer. Nuff said.
<br>
<br>3) Suramar. They tell us that here we have a great story. Agree. But &quot;great story&quot; in Suramar - it&apos;s just ~20% of all quests / activities. Other ones - yeah, farming again.
<br>
<br>4) According to last two things - it&apos;s not possible to improve your offspecs or alts. Oh, ok, it&apos;s possible of course, but you should spent twice more time on it. Farming, again.
<br>
<br>5) Professions. WTF? Bllizzard says that they amazingly improved professions system. But I see only boring quests (2016, quests like &quot;got this ****, go through whole map, gave it to another NPC&quot;?), and &quot;recipe leveling system&quot;, which is affects only amount of reagents for crafting. Yeah, it&apos;s a great feature for game, where every player can buy gold for nothing, and top players have billions. Of course minus couple of golds for additional reagents will be interesting for them.
<br>
<br>6) Legacy mechanics &amp; tech core. Graphic is outdated (and still require good hardware for ultra settings :D), gameplay mechanics is bored (target system is dead, default UI still useless af).
<br>
<br>7) Talents &amp; skills. Tough topic, but from my point of view - every spec is broken, some fun skills removed from game, some useless skills added. But same story for every expansion, so, nothing new.
<br>
<br>Overall.
<br>During tBC and WotLK this game had great gameplay with dozen of options for every spec, focused way for both PvE and PvP (not like &quot;do a bulk of activities and you will recieve rng item&quot;) less amount of farming, and great stories.
<br>
<br>Now WoW just push you farm some stuff &amp; spend time in game. That&apos;s it. If you complete your leveling - let&apos;s go to Suramar. If you complete normal and heroic dungeons - let&apos;s go to Mythic. You&apos;re complete Mythic? So, let&apos;s do Mythic+! And don&apos;t forget about world quests, LFR, artifact power farming, Class Hall stuff farming, professions quests, etc.
<br>
<br>Dear Blizzard, please, just leave WoW in peace. Your gamers already grown up, they want to play in something completely different. Focus your WoW-team on new MMORPG, seriously. WoW2, Diablo MMORPG, Titan, whatever. It will be far more better that another expansion for game which can&apos;t give anything new to players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6914849">Expand</a></span>

The reality is it&apos;s the pretty much the same situation as WoD - Everything outside of raiding and dungeons sucks.
<br>
<br>World quests:
<br>They very quickly get very boring, and they are spaced out so they are very inefficient. They are time consuming but most of that time is spent on flight paths from one quest to the next. Old style dailies were pick up a group in one area, do them all in one area, hand them in - fast and efficient. World quests are a waste of time, except you need to do them for the reputation grind. When flying is available world quests will be better but currently they are just painfully dull.
<br>
<br>Crafting:
<br>WoD crafting was so bad it pretty much removed crafting from the game. Legion crafting is barely any better. Profession quests are tedious and annoying and definitely not more &apos;fun&apos; than just getting a recipe of a vendor. Worst of all is rank 3 recipes are all locked behind revered/exalted rep or waiting for a random spawn world quest.
<br>
<br>Dungeons/Raids:
<br>Legion dungeons are pretty good. A bit too long and some of the trash has too much HP, dragging them out, but good overall. The raids are good so far too but the problem is the community.
<br>
<br>Community:
<br>The community is back to WOTLK behavior again. Every group needs to be completely overgeared for the content. You have to link the heroic achievement to get a group for normal. Once again forcing people to start their own groups as the only way to get anything done.
<br>
<br>Gating systems:
<br>
<br>Legion has too many systems to slow down progress. Comparing the content to MoP, We still get 2 raids and 1 small raid, but one at a time over about 9 months instead of all 3 at launch. There are 11 world bosses but there is only 1 up per week, so you do your one raid lockout and your one world boss and then you&apos;re done for they week, there&apos;s nothing else left to do.
<br>
<br>Misc:
<br>Stats are a mess, so ilevel upgrades can be a downgrade in actual item power. Some stats are completely useless for some specs. You can get legendaries that suck. Mythic plus dungeons give so much more gear, so much better gear and even have no weekly lockouts so they make raiding for gear almost pointless.
<br>
<br>Overall, if you REALLY like 5 man dungeons, be it easy heroics or increasingly difficult mythics and would be happy spending all your time doing dungeons then Legion is for you. Otherwise its really kind of a flop. I wish Legion was great, but its really just not. It has some good things but a huge list of small, bad design decisions that all combine together to make it a real disappointment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6761006">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>the mythic+ system they introduced this xpack has potential but fell flat as it is poorly tuned and some affix combos arent even worth the frustration for some dungeons.
<br>
<br>along with the raid ToV which was 3 bosses basically virtually gated and impossible to do so you have something to do till nighthold. if you find bashing your faces against a brick wall &quot;something to do&quot;,
<br>
<br>ultimately this expansion has left alot to be missed about the old wow as all it is now is virtually impossible content only the best of the best even have a shot at. and playing as much as possible to stay competitive cause unless youre that .5% lucky few with great rng drops.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6899223">Expand</a></span>

You have got garrison like mini games (similar like in WoD) where you send your champions on various missions. The rewards from these missions include gold, resources, artifact points and what is more important THEY PROGRESS YOU FURTHER INTO YOUR CLASS STORY. What does it mean ? Well generally it means that you can&apos;t progress in this game in your own pace because you are stunlocked behind a time-wall and there is nothing you can do about it. Your champions first have to complete missions for you to get new items or abilities for your class and those missions take up to 6-8 hours time. So I can&apos;t just play freely on the day I like or when I have free time because I am simply BLOCKED FROM PROGRESSING FURTHER ! I have to wait several hours for the content to unlock. This is getting similar to EVE Online model where you also have to wait for your skills to progress automatically in time.
<br>
<br>If that is to be the direction that WoW is heading right now ... then I am leaving this train on the nearest station. Seriously this game at the moment feels like a chore. It feelks like I have to come to work and do some boring stuff that I simply have to do. Right now I should log in to WoW just to click my class hall and send my champions on another mission so that I could finally do my class mission. But I am already bored. I do not play video games to keep on passing some stupid timewalls that game developers impose on a player. I do not want to login to WoW just to constatnly uncheck those stupid missions.
<br>
<br>Another thing is dumping down the skill system. I mean the last time I was in normal dungeon a protection warrior was doing more healing overall than I did on my resto druid ! I have been playing from Vanilla to Pandaria and I have never seen thus before ! Seriously - wtf has happened to this game ??!! He was doing this heal to himself and I had a really hard time catching up with him. They have simply made healers redundant not only in regular missions (because right now this game is much more focused on a single player) but also in normal dungeons. Basically if you are smart then you can solo most of the dungeon content by yourself as a tank now.
<br>
<br>I have been month to this expansion and I am back after two years and I am already bored with this game. They even managed to stunlock your professions because right now you HAVE TO visit all the dungeons (even several times) or visit some stupid places that normally you wouldn&apos;t like to go but you HAVE TO. It does not feel like an open world game anymore. It feels like a prison run by a guard who tells you when to piss, when to sleep, when to eat and when to go for a walk.
<br>
<br>Besides this ... again and again Blizzard is just unable to manage their servers. There is a mini hacker group that keep trolling Blizzard with some DDoS **** and they simply can&apos;t defend themselves. As a result official EU and USA forums of the game are full of topics about ppl having serious connection issues. And yes you guess it right the regular response coming from Blizzard is &quot;check with your IS provider&quot; even though you have no other internet issues besides playing WoW.
<br>
<br>I have still 1 month to go with this game and that is it. I am done with this game ... and this time forever. I came back after 2 years to some totally messed up lore with nothing making sense anymore (I feel too uneasy to even describe in a nutshell what happened with the lore in WoW but believe me - IT IS TERRIBLE). I won&apos;t be resubbing this. If any veteran wanted to come back to WoW then I must say that you are too late - there is no more World of Warcraft. This game is not the game it used to be. I mean it&apos;s core, it&apos;s flavor evaporated along with totally demolishing its PvP system. It&apos;s just gone. You no longer have to fear elite mobs when questing, CCing in dungeons or watching your mana. It&apos;s gone. You just rush forward, yawn and destroy mobs with total ease with anything else progressing automatically - similar to EVE Online. The last WoW that felt like WoW was Mists of Pandaria even though I didn&apos;t like that expansion very much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6718780">Expand</a></span>

Also they have already announced 7.1 very early in this expansion so it seems like they are going to be supporting it a lot more than previous expansions.

Order Halls are basically the same boring grindfest as Garrisons were. The new artifact weapon system and inflationary use of legendary items is just ridiculous. Lore wise every player is now the savior of their faction which feels plainly stupid. Bust the most annoying part is that everything has become so incredible easy. The whole leveling process from 1-110 is so dumbed down that even a six year old child could do it. Another thing to mention is that a lot of the new questlines seem to be instanced, that means most of the time while questing you don&apos;t meet any other people. It feels like playing a singleplayer game. WoD already did that and i already hated it back then. If I wanted to run through an empty world I wouldn&apos;t play an so called MMORPG. Also i can&apos;t find anything interesting in the storyline, cutscenes every 5 minutes do not make the game any better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6779196">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The artifact system is very unforgiving, the catchup mechanics are only stop gaps and the later you join the expansion the farther you will be behind anyone. God forbid you want to change which character you &apos;main&apos;.
<br>
<br>The weapons themselves could be done far better. There&apos;s only one iconic weapon that was made into an artifact (the Ashbringer) with most of the others being completely new additions to the world/lore of the game or weapons that were fairly obscure before hand. The hidden skin system is an absolute laugh as well. Most were simple affairs of RNG without much actual effort (or skill) to acquire.
<br>
<br>Then there is the legendary system, and the main problem with this entire expansion. In a game where you play to primarily play to increase the strength of your character by their items/gear, the system of Legendaries in Legion is an absolute farce. RNG baked into RNG and god forbid if you don&apos;t get a decent legendary and one of the extremely mediocre utility ones. The system is neither fair or balanced and the fact that someone at Blizzard got paid to design it is a joke.
<br>
<br>The legendary system is worse than Garrisons, another of those great ideas but completely wrong execution features in the game. Except Legion has only been out for less than 4 months and the current problem is far worse than what Garrisons did to Warlords of Draenor.
<br>
<br>I would contemplate returning for their first actual &apos;tier&apos; of raid (they have purposely time gated it for some reason) but by that time I would be too far behind other people in Artifact Power, not to mention behind people with good legendaries, that it wouldn&apos;t be worth it.
<br>
<br>Even the World Quest system is boring and quite buggy, with quests not showing up on your map or actual bugs where you can&apos;t complete them or what not since launch that have not been fixed. Also, every other week it seems like a bunch of people get banned for &apos;exploiting&apos; bugs that Blizzard implements in their game without checking.
<br>
<br>All in all, I give Legion a 3. For trying. But there are already way too many flaws to consider this even a &apos;good addition&apos; to the Warcraft franchise</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6880899">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Simply put, I believe they must have hired a new team because everything was given more character, more meaning, more fun, more..everything. Class changes are upsetting, no more dropped weapons (although artifact weapons is awesome), less areas to explore than most expansions. There are some serious saddening parts. However, I truly believe if Blizzard continues with this act, they very well may gain a substantial amount of subscribers soon.

<br>Normally, comparing this expansion to WOTLK and BC or even Vanilla is just not the same. I&apos;d probably rate it an 8 or possibly a 7. However, comparing it to the past few expansions, Legion has definitely shown a new face to World of Warcraft that I&apos;m going to inflate it to a 10 as in &quot;It&apos;s well worth the time as a Warcraft fan&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6677053">Expand</a></span>

As a fan of MMOs, jumping back into a game 12 years gone said to me that I&#x2019;d be at it for months simply reaching a point where I could consider attempting a dungeon or raid. With great skepticism and nearly 10 years of inactivity under my belt (last seen in Burning Crusade) I reinstalled WoW to see what all the fuss was about.
<br>
<br>In the build up to release, a great many things had been touted about Legion&#x2019;s story and I was curious about the &#x201C;reset&#x201D; heralded by the expansion. In all, I was re-entering the world to answer three questions: can a brand new player jump in and have fun; am I able to play the game without it being obvious I&#x2019;m a brand new player; does this thing have legs?
<br>
<br>Legion&#x2019;s starting area is fantastic for introducing the new Demon Hunter class, adding mechanics to the player&#x2019;s arsenal (and to that of your enemies&#x2019;) and showcasing the various status ailments you may receive and how to counter these. By the time the 2-3 hour starting area is well and truly rinsed, you should be ready to tackle the meat of the expansion without delay. Given the quality of story even in this first zone (and around the Demon Hunter class campaign), you should be smitten from first glance.
<br>
<br>The game area is broken up into four leveling zones scaled to your current level, meaning you can tackle them in any order and follow the stories that interest you the most. 2-3 hours per zone means leveling an alternate character after your first feels no less tedious than completing things sequentially. You can traipse dungeons while leveling and indeed, must, in order to see all stories to their conclusion. Once you hit the new level cap of 110, which took me a good 10 hours from the creation of my character, dungeons will be a good chunk of what you&#x2019;re doing.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, I also found myself reaching Legion&#x2019;s end game zone &#x2018;Suramar&#x2019; after only a few hours of questing. Here, you&#x2019;re expected to do world quests simply to boost your faction reputation and grind for better gear. No stranger to MMOs and the grinding generally needed for end game activities, I was well prepared but also couldn&#x2019;t help but feel a little let down as Legion seemed only to just be getting started before dropping everything and telling me to rinse-and-repeat on a slightly harder difficulty.
<br>
<br>Also disappointing is the new class Demon Hunter only having around 15 abilities to use in combat. With a top level of 110, I was hoping for a similar number of combat skills to that of other MMOs. This sort of restriction can feel a bit jarring when compared to the 40+ skills you&#x2019;re used to running in something like Final Fantasy XIV.
<br>
<br>As a storied player, if you&#x2019;re wanting to jump back in, smash out Legion and re-examine WoW&#x2019;s long lineage, now&#x2019;s as good as time as any. You can run solo the majority of previous 25-40 man raids and easily experience everything pre-Legion, albeit in an extremely cheap way. Killing Illidan at the top of the Black Temple in one hit is definitely amusing, as is watching the life drain from Arthas. By the time I got to Deathwing though and was able to avert a time travelling apocalypse with the simple press of &#x2018;2&#x2019;, I just felt dirty.
<br>
<br>New players, on the other hand, can find a lot to love starting with Legion. As always, Blizzard&#x2019;s world building is top-notch and learning the ropes won&#x2019;t take anyone too long. The quest introducing the new story does a stellar job of teaching new players the ins and outs but those wishing for something longer (by MMO standards) may be left underwhelmed. If you&#x2019;ve always wanted to see the World, I would strongly recommend a visit. The game is in great shape and easily the most accessible it&#x2019;s been since the vanilla launch.
<br>
<br>As for my own Azeroth adventure? Right now, I have 20 days of game time remaining and I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll be darkening those doorsteps again anytime soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6707794">Expand</a></span>

Some quick points on what I think make this expansion stand out:
<br>
<br>1) Questing - So far the story driven quests with voice acting, cinematics, and improved dialogue have been phenomenal. Suramar is probably one of the best zone ever created for this game, you really feel like part of the world again, a massive world that drew us in initially as players. I really hope blizzard continues with this as it has been the single best part of this expansion thus far.
<br>
<br>2) Artifact Weapons - Yes, I know there is a large body of folks who see artifact weapons as a negative,, quite frankly as a player who has end game raided since vanilla, it is a nice change of pace to immediately have my BiS weapon. The artifact system so far has been rewarding and a fun experience. The artifacts themselves are some of the best looking weapons to date, and the unlockable appearances really motivate you to go out and do things in the world again.
<br>
<br>3) Broken Isles - This continent is beautiful, absolutely stunning zones that don&apos;t feel &quot;reused&quot;. I really think this continent has the potential to make me log more hours in it than I did in northrend.
<br>
<br>4) Dungeons -
<br>
<br>Typical Expansion: Get to ilvl xxx, farm normals to ilvl xxx, farm heroics to ilvl xxx. 3 months in speed clear the place, minimal value.
<br>
<br>Dungeons in Legion: Complete each dungeon quest to retrieve a pillar of creation, each pillar has a story that you should be familiar with via the questing. Each dungeon is voice acted, intense, and story driven. You can&apos;t always hit ilvl xxx for heroics via dungeons, you are encouraged to go do world quests to get into heroics.
<br>
<br>6) Legion/Wrath Mashup - I don&apos;t understand fully why people see this as a bad thing. If you know anything about the lore of warcraft this isn&apos;t the first time these two themes meet. So far the mashup hasn&apos;t been all that cheesy either, all of the overlap is explained organically through the story.
<br>
<br>7) Class Changes - The class changes for the most part have been rewarding. Fury warrior is more enjoyable than it has ever been imo. There are a couple duds though as always: Ret is extremely boring and a little under powered, for example.
<br>
<br>8) New Animations - The new animations in and of themselves make this expansion at least 4 stars. If you log as many hours as I do in this game then you will come to appreciate the change of scenary and the amazing sounds that followed the updated animations. Heroic Leap is satisfying, fire mage feels as powerful as it is, blood dk feels as sinister as the spec suggests.
<br>
<br>9) Graphics Improvements - The constant optimization and updating of the game engine has really given me respect for blizzard and their devs. Be as cynical or pessimistic as you want regarding the game and its timeline, but you can&apos;t really find fault in the continuous improvements that hit this game on the backend. I will never forget seeing bugs for the first time in the whirlwinds in Silithus back in vanilla when I went from 1GB to 2GB of ram, now seeing the game in its current state, it would have been too easy for blizzard to let the engine sit stale.
<br>
<br>10) Soundtrack - As always, blizzard delivers one of the best soundtracks I think I have heard in some time. The Anduin series is THE greatest game soundtrack I have ever heard, period.
<br>
<br>11) Class Halls - Believe it or not, and I was skeptical myself (I hated WoD garrisons) the level of &quot;garrison&quot; is bearable if at all present. If you consider having 2 initial &quot;followers&quot; and 2-3 missions daily a WoD level of garrison, or the 7 day or so CD work order for artifact research again a WoD level of garrison, then you have fallen into darkness and cannot be redeemed, your soul is damned forever as the void consumes you. Class halls are beautiful (I have seen every one in person), the lore behind each and the initial garrison campaign has been amazing. I think my favorite order hall so far is the paladin class hall.
<br>
<br>If you were burned like most of us when WoD turned out to be trivial, or if you have been missing that special feeling WoW used to give you back in wrath, I think you might enjoy giving this expansion a play. It will never be like it used to, but WoW has recovered a bit of its magic no doubt.
<br>
<br>I give this expansion a 10 not because nerdgasmed all over my screen, I give it a 10 because I think blizzard really deserves the credit for this one. You can see the work they put into it, WoD left me feeling like they abandoned us, Legion so far has been a testament against that. You can see their diligence in every aspect, whether it is to the lore or to the design, your character feels important again, you feel invested in playing, you feel rewarded for playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6680822">Expand</a></span>

Legion promised a few things that caught my attention. Since leaving at Cataclysm&apos;s launch, I can tell that many improvements have been made to the game as a whole. The visual update was a solid one. It seems Blizzard recognizes that level-grinding wasn&apos;t a key component of the game anymore therefore grinding was transferred to other more end-game niche interests like raiding, Achievements, item skins (&quot;transmogs&quot;), pet battles and other things. The idea seems to be &quot;grind what you like&quot; while providing you many choices. The developers seem to be keeping up with the competition, drawing inspiration from the successful aspects of games like Guild Wars. World events and quests are more interesting and the game rewards you for being attentive and observing and interacting with the world, not merely following the quest tracker. Combat is somewhat simpler, though. While the action remains much the same, specs, talents and &quot;gearing up&quot; has become much simpler. There seems to be some effort toward &quot;pigeon-holing&quot; to make balance easier to achieve. Mathematically I understand the need for this, but it is kind of sad to see the possibility for creativity largely taken away. Another gripe I have is phasing. I get that it is useful for immersion and storytelling but it gets in the way of playing with friends and sometimes seems overused. My last gripe is minor but there was a narrative choice within the major plot that I wasn&apos;t happy with. I don&apos;t want to spoil things but it made me rather ashamed to call myself Horde after that debacle. So far I&apos;m having lots of fun and hope people get to experience Legion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6679478">Expand</a></span>

<br>My WOW experience began at release and went on until just after Cataclysm. The underwater zone Vashj&apos;ir basically had me quit until just before Draenor release. I returned for Draenor and was VERY happy. I enjoyed the content and managed to cap out all 10 toons to max level and decent gear (iLVL 690s).
<br>
<br>Based on my experience above and playstyle Legion has been pretty disappointing.
<br>
<br>The good:
<br>The class artifact quests are VERY VERY good. They have excellent stories and are tuned to your character class and spec. My assassination rogue has to sneak, pick pockets, pick locks, and...assassinate people. The same is true for each different class.
<br>
<br>The story line is good and filled with typically fun cut scenes and lore.
<br>
<br>The class halls and the new mission systems are an improvement on the garrison system of Draenor. Less &apos;champions&apos; and mission to manage makes altaholics happy. It also puts you back into a more public setting making the game feel more alive.
<br>
<br>The world quest system is better than the old dailies and supplies decent loot transition once the zone quests are completed.
<br>
<br>The bad:
<br>Blizzard has gone backwards with quest design and sequencing. Class and professions all have deep quest lines to open up functionality and these quest lines are not aligned. You spend alot of time on flightpaths and riding around looking for quests. They also went back to dropping dungeon quests in the middle of quests chains. This is a game killer for solo players as you either never finish the quest line or join a PUG.
<br>
<br>The resource system used to fuel mission and followers requires you to constantly quest as there is no time based supply. This is fine for single or duel toon players but true altaholics can no longer just keep running mission for one toon to keep them progressing slowly, This may not really be a &apos;BAD&apos; thing but was annoying for me as I don&apos;t have time to play all my alts enough to stay supplied.
<br>
<br>The rest of the game is typical WOW. generic classes, limited quest dynamics (fedex, kill x, collect y), and of course the aging graphic engine.
<br>
<br>I do suggest getting and running at least one toon through the content just don&apos;t expect Legion to motivate a 6 or 12 month resub.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6923428">Expand</a></span>

I&#x2019;ve seen a lot that the expansion has to offer right now. Know that this review is being written while there are no raids released. The only thing for players to do is quest to level their character and advance in their profession, world quests for rewards, and dungeons (including mythic dungeons).
<br>
<br>Let&#x2019;s start with the pros. The game looks amazing. Aszuna and Val&#x2019;sharah are hands down the best looking locations on the Broken Isles. I love the artifact weapon quests. There&#x2019;s a little scenario that you do to complete the quest. The storylines are always fun and interesting. Havoc Demon Hunters are a ton of fun. You&#x2019;ll never get bored while fighting mobs with their mobility. I think they are hands down the most enjoyable class/spec in the game. Professions are back! I love making money in this game. Grinding material and selling it in the auction house has always been a joy for me. WOD killed professions with daily cooldowns and giving everyone their own cave to farm ores and garden to farm herbs. But Legion has revived professions by taking all that away and I couldn&#x2019;t be happier about it. Also, garrisons are gone! Yes there are Order Halls and Order Hall Missions but you spend little to no time in them. If you wanted you could never go to your Order Hall (except for when you want to upgrade your artifact weapon). That&#x2019;s how insignificant they are this expansion.
<br>
<br>Now the cons. The game is a quest grind. Quests on top of quests on top of quests with more quests and even more&#x2026;QUESTS! If you&#x2019;re like me and you find questing to be boring you will get tired of this expansion really quickly. Right now there&#x2019;s nothing to do but quest. Want to level? Great, here&#x2019;s some quests in some really boring areas (excluding Val&#x2019;sharah). Want to do things for your profession? Great, here&#x2019;s some quests. Want to gain rep? Awesome, here&#x2019;s some more quests? Even world quests are still quests. They give decent rewards but getting to a lot of them requires a Youtube search. Otherwise, you&#x2019;ll never find it or die a million times trying to make your way to the location.
<br>
<br>We also have flying locked behind an achievement that we can&#x2019;t complete yet because only part one is available. When will Blizzard realize that most of us would rather pay 5k for flying than grind useless rep just to fly? The reason I say it&#x2019;s useless is because what will this rep give you other than flying? That&#x2019;s right, a lot of useless items that will be irrelevant in a few months once you start raiding and even more irrelevant in a couple years when another expansion is released.
<br>
<br>PVP is dead. For those that enjoy PVP-ing and was hoping there&#x2019;d be new content, sorry, there&#x2019;s not. If you PVP&#x2019;d in MOP you&#x2019;ll be doing those same battlegrounds with this expansion because there hasn&#x2019;t been new PVP content released (other than PVP talents).
<br>
<br>Every class has had their abilities nuked beyond belief. Because of this most of the classes only have a 4-5 button rotation. In other words, most of the classes are extremely boring. I&#x2019;ve tried all specs on the hunter, destruction warlock, all specs on the mage, and retribution paladin. In my opinion they are the most boring class and specs in the game, especially the beast mastery hunter.
<br>
<br>Right now I&#x2019;ve been max level for a little over a week. I have seven alts and I have zero desire to level any of them. I don&#x2019;t want to go through the leveling process again. I didn&#x2019;t enjoy it. Val&#x2019;sharah is the only area that&#x2019;s fun. The storyline there is interesting and the quests are enjoyable. Every other place is a snooze fest. I don&#x2019;t want to spend three days enduring that again. I also don&#x2019;t want to grind for rep with the Nightfallen in order to progress in Suramar. I don&#x2019;t like questing and I definitely don&#x2019;t like the quests in Suramar. They&#x2019;re tedious and time consuming. And more importantly, they&#x2019;re not fun. I&#x2019;ve stopped advancing my character. I don&#x2019;t do world quests. Dungeons are long and lackluster so I haven&#x2019;t done them (unless it was for a quest) and I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ll be doing them anytime soon. At this point I&#x2019;m just making money by selling obliterum. That&#x2019;s all the game currently has to offer me. When my subscription ends I will not be resubbing. I think I have lost interest in mmo&#x2019;s. I don&#x2019;t like the grind, I don&#x2019;t like the slow progression, and I don&#x2019;t like having to wait for something exciting to happen. When Legion was released I was excited, I was having a blast, and I thought the game was great. But once the newness settled I began to see that although it&#x2019;s without a doubt better than WOD it is in no way good or even great. It&#x2019;s &#x201C;okay&#x201D; at best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6691318">Expand</a></span>

Decent gear now is just rng gods are with me or they aren&apos;t you notice this in example leveling.
<br>How to get penis jousting with other guys you basically grind your fat ass off either its right legendaries or to upgrade your legendary weapon. So repeat same instances, garrison quests or weekly stuff,
<br>Professions have become biggest joke why the hell would you waste stuff using level 1 recipes. Some professions you get these retarded reward quests you get 5 skill points when you go cliff take of your trousers take your weenie out have right items purchased and piss all over poor lad. You should always upgrade recipes to rank 3 because it&apos;s economical same could be said about gathering. So waste of time doing items when they might with be upgrade.
<br>Questing and story same old boring stuff that most players are fed up. Either it&apos;s kill stuff or collect stuff. Each prof is also tied to some dungeon and zone too need to basically do whole zone to open. Dungeon profession quests was stupid idea at burning crusade and still is.
<br>So game offers you grinding, nothing new, copied ideas from free to play games such as GW2, toxic community and joy of getting yourself dungeons or raids with utterly retarded or otherwise speshial people. Oh joy! Luckily there are plenty of better things do like having a life. Best way to enjoy this game is never getting one or uninstalling it. Subsription is not worth it not any login rewards just endless grinding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6750440">Expand</a></span>

It becomes a bit like WoD after you have gotten over the whole starting hype, and you find yourself just mining things or doing pointless World quests you don&apos;t really need to do. Emerald Nightmare is fine, so if you have a raid team i guess you should stay subbed. But i cannot commit to a raid team atm, and pugs are just a nightmare to find or to make. The expac is so alt friendly i cannot believe how alt unfriendly it actually is, so for me there is no point in lvling an alt, just to do the same content again. It is way better than WoD because even if you cannot Raid, there are dungeons, which are the only reason really i wanna stay subbed. I love the dungeons, because i cannot play for maybe more than 1-2 hours without having to leave My PC for an unknown amount of time (5 min- 5 hours really). Another problem for me is you have to do NM difficulty raids for story progression, and i don&apos;t have the time for that, so **** the person who decided that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6708102">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>And sadly, Legion has the pitfalls I expected, and then some. The end game is the standard loot race that every WoW expansion is, with epics and legendaries thrown around like sweets and losing all meaning (remember Thunderfury being the absolute balls back in the day, and an epic was actually EPIC - none of that now...) - but that&apos;s not the worst part of Legion.
<br>
<br>The worst part is how it fundamentally fails to understand what drew people in to WoW in the first place. Yes, I get that a character going through all the experiences it has in the world would be somewhat noteworthy by now, but Legion paints your character as a legend in the universe which all other NPCs revere... that&apos;s not what WoW is! So now, raids are 10/20 legendary characters going into battle against one boss or whatever. Suddenly, instead of gathering your ragtag bunch of friends to try and take on the might of Ragnaros or whatever, you actually feel like the dungeon bosses are the underdogs!
<br>
<br>Being lauded so much has another problem - the willing suspension of disbelief in this universe is now totally gone, because everyone in this universe gets the same treatment as you, so the whole server is filled with people more powerful than the NPCs. That&apos;s the lore. It&apos;s stupid, and it&apos;s tought to get your head around.
<br>
<br>Yes, the levelling experience is masterfully done for what it is, but if you really, really rate it now, do me a favour and go through it again with an alt. It won&apos;t just be SLIGHTLY less fun, but massively so. And it&apos;s weird, because the game now paints you as a legend, yet you feel more anonymous than ever because of it.
<br>
<br>The story itself is OK, but wow does this feel rehashed... To reintroduce Dalaran, after an expansion that basically went over old ground in Outland, really hammers home how out of ideas Blizzard seem to be.
<br>
<br>This expansion is destined to see subscribers drop off in massive numbers very soon, and I&apos;ll be one of them. It really had to be the expansion to save this game, because it couldn&apos;t afford any more screw ups, but barring an absolute miracle at this point in terms of end game content patches and so on, WoW is going to be dead to an awful lot of older players at the very least, and I just can&apos;t see the newer players getting to the end game and understanding what the fuss was about with this game for so many years, as it is an absolute shadow of what it once was.
<br>
<br>By all means downvote me for this review, and loads of you will because you won&apos;t have seen the writing on the wall yet, but don&apos;t be surprised if in two or three months you find yourself agreeing with me. The only difference is that I&apos;m recognising what a colossal waste of time the title is a bit earlier.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6675127">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The class gameplay and graphic changes have really reinvigorated my interest in the game. I was skeptical when I heard they were reworking so many of the classes. However, I have several level 100+ characters, and I am so happy with the new gameplay that I can&apos;t choose a favourite. Everyone feels and plays like they are really powerful, and most of them seem to have a fairly deep skill cap. With the classes seeming so strong, I was a little worried that the game would be too easy - Nope! Your character feels great, and the game challenges you to master it. Legion is no Dark Souls, but this game does take some skill again.
<br>
<br>The most important thing I can say is to take your time from 100-110. There is a lot of content to enjoy along the way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6677467">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Scaling zones - Great for leveling with friends who may be a few levels lower or higher than you.
<br>Artifact Weapons - Awesome stories and great implementation of alternate advancement FINALLY.
<br>Revamped Professions - Loving the quest driven crafting and world drop patterns once more.
<br>Class Order Halls - Familiar enough as WoD garrisons, but unique with it&apos;s own story per class.
<br>Dungeons - Although the normal versions are easy there are tons and  beautifully designed.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Bugs - A few bugs here but nothing unforgiving
<br>Leveling Rate - You seem to level very fast, but this is more of a subjective thing depending how many rares/treasures you go after, so more of a personal con.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6678299">Expand</a></span>

Tons of unique content that had a lot of effort put into it. Best quests ever in WoW, and the artifact and class halls are fun and unique.
<br>
<br>We&apos;ll see how this one holds up over the next 2 years. At the moment, it&apos;s fantastic.</span>

Yep, that&apos;s right - good old familar Dalaran from Northrend - with everything more or less where you left it. Sort of.
<br>
<br>Although it remains, naturally, a massively multiplayer game, there is a lot of focus on *you* as the hero; the class halls really bring that into focus - a special place for each class that&apos;s neatly stylised - what the death knights have before in Acherus, the monks in the Peak of Serenity and the druids had in Moonglade, is now something that all classes have access to.
<br>
<br>The zones, borrow the best parts from the previous expansions, and meld wonderfully with new looks and textures; from the echoes of old Burning Crusade Shadowmoon on the far west, through the classic Kalimdor looks of Val&apos;sharah and Highmountain, to the Wrath of the Lich King-and-Nordic inspired Stormheim. Plenty of old faces show up early on, especially with the class quests, and people like Maiev Shadowsong and Cordana Felsong, the Stormrages - even Rexxar is hanging out in Highmountain. Rather than tediously going from one zone to the next, fairly linearly, prescribed zone that we&apos;ve seen in the last few expansions with precious little difference, we have something different altogether.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m going to thoroughly enjoy levelling up my characters, old and new, in this new expansion. I&apos;ll proclaim it that it is the best expansion to WoW for years, if not the best of all time. If you&apos;ve been out of the Warcraft loop for a bit and were looking for an excuse to get back in, this is it. Buy it, and you won&apos;t regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6697374">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So far, I have played over 14 hours and this expansion has been really really amazing.  Good questing that isn&apos;t boring, the zones are breathtakingly beautiful, the dungeons are really beautiful too and are very well done and they are entertaining, blizzard really overdone themselves with the cinematics, they are AMAZING! Voice acting is on point as well.  The new class changes are good as well.  The new PvP system is pretty good too.
<br>
<br>I have only played over 14 hours and this expansion pack is already better than WoD put together, I just hope blizzard keep the content coming and it won&apos;t turn out like another warlords of draenor (i am 99.99% sure it won&apos;t though).

Quests are still fetch quests, which means going to a NPC to start a quest and return to the NPC. Majority of the quests are still kill X amount of that, and find a X amount of that. Occasionally, they break the stale questing with something different. There are side quests that was borrowed from Guild Wars 2 that helps derail the player from the main path for a while. Legion also introduced level scaling, which was  borrowed from Guild Wars 2. This allowed zones to be played in any order the player wanted instead of a defined route in previous expansions.
<br>
<br>The environment designers did well creating the world and dungeon designs. The music in the game is still great, and the ambiance is great. The voice acting is half and half for me. It&apos;s obvious that Blizzard had limited amount of voice actors and I could start hearing the same voice actors in different parts of the expansion. I mention voice acting because there are a lot more cut-scenes in this expansion.
<br>
<br>Followers are back in this expansion, but they do not feel like Garrisons from WoD. Followers feel like a fun side activity compared to being a requirement. The only time followers felt required was for the class missions for each class.
<br>
<br>If you want to pvp only, I probably suggest you look for another game. The game took out pvp only gear and started making players rely on PvE. This means a player must PvE to get competent gear in PvP. Yes, this idea did smooth access for PvE players to PvP. However, now dedicated PvP players have to dedicate time into something they don&apos;t want to do. Classes are still unbalanced as I always expect from WoW.
<br>
<br>The pruning in this expansion is unbelievable. A lot of complex classes were pruned because Blizzard felt the average player can&apos;t handle complex rotations and raid awareness at the same time. I have a hard time playing most DPS classes because they bore me to death without any complexity to them. I found it amazing how they simplified rotations and put RNG that ends up breaking the flow of some rotations for specific classes The pruning is also why the game is unbalanced in PvP.
<br>
<br>World Quests are now the new dailies for the game. This opens when the player gets enough reputation for certain factions, and I like this idea. World Quests offer gear, follower resources, gold, and more. getting gear from World Quests gives an alternative way to get gear instead of spamming dungeons.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6703871">Expand</a></span>

I never played Mists of Pandaria or Warlords of Draenor. I subscribe for a month and then back out mostly because I&apos;m in it for the lore. I found WoW becoming extremely predictable and something where you go from point A to point B as fast as you can. Then Legion dropped. First I got prepared with the pre-release invasions to get to level 100 then I started on Stormheim zone. I am only lvl 103 and am still in the same zone and I love it. The lands are finely crafted even where no player ever needs to go and are perfect for my play-style. I don&apos;t care about getting to max level at everything as fast as possible, I think that&apos;s a waste of time. I like to soak it in, enjoy what the developers spent their time on and Legion allows me that. Every nook and cranny is carefully crafted and whoever wanders off will find unique experience nobody in your guild might see. That was a big thing in Warcraft 3, you don&apos;t have to explore but if you do you will be rewarded. The same thing applies to the dungeons, there are chests hidden throughout detailed side paths and I get irritated when the party just wants to finish it ASAP. What do you buy these games for? If it&apos;s for the lore and the world, then this return to Azeroth will surely delight you. A lot of the negative reviews are from people who rushed, they say &quot;I&apos;m already top level and it&apos;s been really boring, really repetitive&quot;,you just rushed the entire game, what do you expect? It is repetitive when your focus is to go from point A to point B as fast as possible, once you complete all the zones so fast, going back for the achievements of finding hidden things will become a chore because you are not seeing anything new, you already beat this area. If Blizzard continues to go this route, I will be happy and supportive, but others may need to rethink how they play and what they are playing for into enjoy it fully.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6679199">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been playing WoW on and off for more than 10 years, have played every expansion, and after seeing the high review scores Legion was getting, decided to give it a try.
<br>
<br>The very first thing that happens when you take a character into the Legion content, is a scenario with a dozen or more players, a sort of LFR.  In this scenario you get to watch as the horde and alliance hold hands and pay each other compliments while they chase after alternate timeline Gul&apos;dan, to try and stop him from killing Tirion Fordring.  Confused yet? Well we&apos;ve only just started.  If you hadn&apos;t been paying attention to your character, you might have missed... well actually it&apos;d be impossible to miss.  Character animations have been redone, so seeing my towering tauren death knight in his heavy plate leaping metres in the air and slashing down faster than an anime character, with the attack overextending so much that it looked like my arms had left my body, when I was only doing a base attack, had me scratching my head.
<br>
<br>Without spoiling anything, once the scenario is over the horde are cast as the bad guys (again), and you&apos;re taken to Dalaran, which for some reason is suddenly needed now, and oh good, we get to spend another expansion listening to High Quipmeister Khadgar.  Dalaran is teleported to the new expansion area, and I should point out this is wotlk Dalaran, complete with all the same look, same npcs, even same npc dialogues, and areas, and it&apos;s a shared capital again.
<br>
<br>After Dalaran is teleported to the broken isles (location of legion expansion content), you&apos;ll be greeted by a representative of your class, who&apos;ll breathlessly declare that you are the greatest (inset class here) and that it is up to you to save the world.  If you haven&apos;t played WoW for a while you might be a bit confused that your character is suddenly more important than everybody else in the world, but you better start believing it, because all kinds of famous characters in the lore quickly line up to start repeating to you how amazing you are.
<br>
<br>To give an example, while doing the first steps of the priest artifact weapon quest, just for showing up at a location, Alonsos Faol, Moira Thaurissan, and Prophet Velen all bowed down to congratulate me.  The pattern repeats itself across the classes, every character you play is suddenly now the centre of the universe of it&apos;s respective class.  A lot of class/story/world fantasy just completely goes out the window as leaders and lore characters you&apos;ve admired for years suddenly declare that you&apos;re better at everything, so they might as well quit and let you take your rightful place as champion of the universe.
<br>
<br>You might be able to tell that the magnitude of this shift from WoW&apos;s world-focused stories to cutscene-heavy, single player focused content was difficult for me to stomach, I&apos;ve never thought of myself as a great anything in WoW, I&apos;ve always felt and known that it was only with my friends and my guild that I could achieve great things, and the story always supported that.  This new outlook of short-term gratification, with all the rewards and glory upfront left me feeling deflated when I was finally able to actually start questing in the broken isles.  Just for showing up I&apos;d been declared the greatest (class) on Azeroth, given an order hall, a host of servants/retainers and an artifact weapon... I felt like I&apos;d already accomplished more in an hour, than I&apos;d accomplished in all my previous WoW time combined.  But on top of that, for the first time in a WoW expansion there are no high level abilities to work towards, everything you&apos;ll unlock in the future is tied to your artifact weapon, which is a pale imitation of the talent trees of yesteryear, after Blizzard swearing for years that choices in talent trees and multiple talent flat percentage damage increases are bad, they&apos;re right there in your artifact weapon&apos;s talent tree.  But to unlock complete the abilities of your artifact weapon takes months, and each artifact weapon is tied to a single spec, on a single character!  Worst of all, pruned class abilities have been repackaged as talents or tied to artifact weapons, so you&apos;ll have to work to regain things you had even in WoD.
<br>
<br>Nonetheless, I pushed on.  As can be expected in a Blizzard game, the visuals and music are as good as they can be, a change from previous WoW expansions is spoken dialogue, a hell of a lot of spoken dialogue, all over the place, characters who&apos;d never said a word are suddenly quite verbose, even trash mobs are prattling away, throw that on top of all the clanging and crashing my demon hunter was making and I found myself turning the sound further and further down (but not the music).
<br>
<br>I&apos;m out of words, even though I found something to enjoy in every expansion so far, Legion is hollow, and I say for the first time, don&apos;t buy this WoW expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6699747">Expand</a></span>

The leveling is the best its ever been with rares and treasure literally dotting the map with legions (Pun intended) of points that you cant find quests.(Note that is if you are using an addon to show them). There are 10 dungeons this time at launch, the most since Wrath of the Lich King. They all play and look astounding. 1 of the dungeons is an updated Violet Hold, and like it or not, its still more to do. The 2 raids look like a lot of fun, but we will have to wait and see how those turn out later this year when they launch. The new honor system as actually made me interested in trying out some pvp for the first time ever. I look forward to the hundreds of battlegrounds that I surely will win in the future. Artifacts are a fun splash of change for the game. Every spec has a unique one, and each spec has 4 unique models each with 4 color variations. Thats 144 weapon models, or 576 if you count colors. Thats not even counting the hidden ones that I have yet to find. The skins all look great and beat or match the normal Raid weapon looks you would see save for a few exceptions. The talent trees can be a bit bland for a lot of specs, but they still offer something to work on as a form of max level alternate advancement never before seen in WoW. Class halls play like garrisons that other people are in, and that have a very strong class fantasy, AND without the buildings, AND(out of breath here) there are only 5 followers, so you wont be coming back here more than once or twice a day. They are a take it or leave it kind of thing, but the way they make me connect with my class has me liking them more then garrisons. World quests are a pretty standard form of daily questing, only you dont have to travel between quest givers. I do appreciate always having something to do, even if its just for 100 gold. Professions are amazing this time. Each one has its own unique story line sending you all over the world and even into dungeons to retrieve rare items in order to learn new recipes. I really do feel like a blacksmith now! One has to worry that all of this will be pointless if blizzard chooses not to support their game again for over 14 months like they did with Warlords of Draenor, but the promise of more content, and not churning out expansions every year has me hopeful. Also 7.1 which is said to come onto the public test realm sometime in September looks very promising. It will feature Karazhan reworked as a 5 man dungeon with 9 bosses. Thats right NINE. Dont worry though, the old raid isn&apos;t going anywhere! It will also add a 3 boss raid to finish the story of Stormheim. The bosses for the raid will include Odyn, A 3 headed underworld Dog, and helya. It looks neat. Finally there will be more outdoor content added to Suramar to add to the story of the Nightfallen and their war with Suramar city and its corrupt Queen. By the way, Suramar is amazing. I wont spoil anything, but please READ THE QUESTS. It is blizzard best zone they have ever made and its for max level so there is plenty to do. Overall 9.5/10. Gave it a 9 because I dont feel its a perfect game worthy of a 10, and Metacritic doesn&apos;t allow .5s.  I Strongly recommend everyone who has ever been interested in WoW try this expansion. If blizzard delivers with content patches it could be their best expansion ever. It already is their best in terms of launch content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6683996">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>And last addition &quot;MONEY TRAP&quot;  I&apos;m  very late feeling like this but this is hard truth for example 1,5or 2 years after blizzard  announcement new expansion 4 years after another expansion,6 years after another one with new class and keep continue like this.When a time has come you are completly boring this game and finally understood this is  a money trap nothing new to present just publish some new area new video and probably new class thats it.
<br>
<br>And  some old players very liked this expansion I have nothing to say these guys...Keep dreaming at all.
<br>
<br>Yes this game  still 1st popularity of mmorpg universe
<br>
<br>better than mop and cata that&apos;s why i give it to 4/10
<br>
<br>But please don&apos;t buy it.It is time to stop world of warcraft.The game is dead to me.If you are still playing you share  the same feeling with me couple of years ago(maybe months)I&apos;m sure of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6697545">Expand</a></span>

The story is just great and the artifact weapons and class halls are amazing. There also is a lot to do after you hit 110! I am blown away with this expansion keep up the good work blizzard.</span>

There is a ton of content here.
<br>
<br>+ Artifact weapon leveling system that feels like a real RPG experience
<br>+ Full lore with each artifact weapon
<br>+ Burning Crusade has returned
<br>+Sargeras will be returning, either as a avatar or his true self
<br>+Illidan&apos;s return
<br>+Demon Hunter class
<br>+Amazing dungeon design
<br>+Emerald Nightmare has actual relevant lore unlike Highmaul.
<br>+Amazing filler raid, Trial of Valor
<br>+ Mythic dungeons right from the start as well as mythic+ dungeon system like Diablo 3&apos;s greater rift system.
<br>+World quests always give something useful for fresh level 110 characters as well as a chance for a legendary item.
<br>+Legendary items taken from Diablo 3&apos;s system!  Lots of them are great for each class, and some are bad, but they are getting fixed in the next patch.
<br>+Choose which zone you want to level in first!  First time this has been available in WoW.
<br>+The most intricately designed zone yet in WoW history with Suramar.
<br>+All zones are amazingly well done.  Best zones since Wrath.
<br>+Amazing storylines in each zone.
<br>+Professions are relevant again
<br>+Cool soundtrack and some more epic music.
<br>
<br>Negatives
<br>-Lots of grinding for alts.  Not an alt friendly expansion until patch 7.1.5.
<br>- Very expensive materials because of relevant progressions may be a turn off for people who were used to Draenor&apos;s lazy garrison profession system.
<br>- Very RNG (random number generator) based expansion with legendary items and raid/dungeon items.
<br>- Far too many useless end game items that can be worse than dungeon items (trinkets in particular)
<br>
<br>This is clearly the best expansion since Wrath, and you&apos;d be a complete idiot to think otherwise.  Get it now!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6680539">Expand</a></span>

However it needs to be said that time will ultimately tell if that remains true for the duration of the expansion. Blizzard has to avoid the mistakes they made with the late game of Warlords of Draenor. They need to ensure that they keep fresh content coming. So far though, Blizzard have frontloaded the game with plenty of content to keep players invested.
<br>
<br>The most notable change comes in the form of the new artifact weapons. These weapons grow with you as you level up and you can unlock talents to further augment your abilities. Its kind of a nice throwback to the days of vanilla where you have to decide whether you want that extra crit chance by taking this talent, or do you want the extra damage for an AOE abilitiy. It offers a level of customization that we haven&apos;t had over our characters since they &apos;streamlined&apos; talents by removing the talent point system for your core abilities. These artifact weapons are earned fairly early with you eventually acquiring the others through a series of quests. Each class has an artifact weapon for each of its specs. With 12 character classes each having at least 3 specs (Demon Hunters and Druids the exception with 2 and 4 specs each respectively) that is a lot of content.
<br>
<br>In the process of finding these weapons you will establish a &apos;class order hall&apos; which are like Draenor&apos;s garrisons, but taken a step further. They no longer feel like an isolated area as you see other members of your class. It needs to be said that these class halls are simply amazing from an artistic standpoint. Druids get a beautiful area within Val&apos;Sharah known as the dreamgrove. Not to give spoilers but so many of these are wonderfully designed. However others like those of the Death Knights feel a bit uninspired as they essentially re-purpose Ebon Hold (Archerus) and move its location.
<br>
<br>Legions focus on the class fantasy feels like a return to form and restores some of the identity that some of the classes have lost over time. While older classes have seen a lot of love and newfound attention, Blizzard also introduced a new hero class in the form of the Demon Hunter. These badass mobile characters are a blast to play. Limited to just two specs in the form of a DPS and Tank spec, Demon Hunters easily will find a spot in any party. While they do feel powerful I never felt like I wasn&apos;t competitive playing a different class.
<br>
<br>The new dungeons are fun and have some nice design elements. The normals aren&apos;t particularly difficult and can be cleared with relative ease. Most of these don&apos;t have any odd mechanics and are your typical tank and spank encounters. However I expect heroics to be substantially different as has been the case in the past.
<br>
<br>The zones themselves show how adept Blizzard&apos;s art team have become at creating gorgeous environments. Val&apos;Sharah in particular is one of my favorites.
<br>
<br>Blizzard has further improved on the questing experience. They have also cleverly done some things in the background to improve your experience questing. You now have your pick of which zone you want to start in. From there each zone will scale with you meaning your never over or under leveled for that particular content. The one exception being Suramar which is a lvl 110 zone. However world quests will send you to zones you have already visited so you aren&apos;t restricted to just Suramar.
<br>
<br>Legion is one of the most story driven to date and series veterans are in for some really emotional moments. I won&apos;t spoil them here but these moments serve to underscore just how high the stakes are. The one nitpick I have is that they have steadily been placing a greater focus on you the player as being the &apos;chosen&apos; one or the &apos;hero&apos;. This is all well and good from a roleplay perspective. However it becomes a bit silly when you have countless &quot;chosen ones&quot; running about wielding weapons like Doomhammer, or the Scythe of Elune.
<br>
<br>Take the transmog system for instance which has also been expanded. However its still limiting in the sense that you can&apos;t transmog those Warglaives of Azzinoth as they are a legendary weapon. Yet you have people wielding the same artifact weapons ad nauseam.
<br>
<br>Legion thus far has been a excellent expansion that shows Blizzard can still inject new life into this aging game. Hopefully Blizzard can continue to deliver engaging content even at the tail end of Legion&apos;s shelf life. As for now I am enjoying my time immensely. &quot;FOR THE ALLIANCE AND FOR AZEROTH!&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6687561">Expand</a></span>

As a WotLK fanboy, I never thought I was say this but I believe we have a new best expansion, or at least I mean, equally as great as TBC and WotLK.  After the total disaster that was WoD *insert tons of paragraphs about how bad it was and why*, Legion comes in and fixes everything.  The zones are WONDERFUL.  Except highmountain that can be tricky when you are dead, my god the zones are nice.  Val&apos;sharah, Suramar, etc. just wow.  They are beautful, so well done and the storytelling is beyond expectations.  You will enjoy every moment of it, they really set the bar high.  The lore and quests are back to being significant and related to what we like (well, what I like).  It takes the best out of everything that we had so far.  I liked TBC and WotLK so much because it continues &quot;Warcraft&apos;s main story&quot; With Illidan, the Lich King, etc. and I find this expansion to feel the same.  The leveling experience was marvelou with the new system.  Since levels and xp scales, you can relax and enjoy your questing without falling back.  I mean, if you like a zone, you will get to finish it unlike previous expansions where you had to switch if you wanted to stay where the xp is.  Actually now, you will have to complete every zone.  They made it quite simple, yet so effective.  The found the right way of doing it for the leveling experience.  And by the way, the FINALLY stopped the abusive phasing.  My god that was horrible in the last expansions!   They also brought back the profession to life, I believe professions will be relevant again and they now come with lots of quests to do, just like we now have a glorious class campaign, which is very fun and nice for the storytelling.  WoD felt way too much like a single player experience when it wasn&apos;t intended, now they actually made a kind of single player campaign without making it single player.  It works well.  The artifacts are quite good too and they bring a good sense of reward, which was lacking.  You will crave for artifact power and to get some traits.  The talent system is the same non rewarding one, but this makes up for it.  I am always eager to add points to my artifact.  They also kept the followers and missions, which scared me, but actually they did a good job at keeping that.  It&apos;s not garrison 2.0, not at all.  It&apos;s there, but it&apos;s so much different at the same time.  And with the world quests, which are great by the way, they avoid some major flaws of WoD.  Instead of staying in your garrison, Legion makes you travel A LOT.  At first I thought the zones were a bit small, but once you do &quot;end game stuff&quot; you figure out why.  You come and go across the map so much, it can&apos;t be Kalimdor vast.  Legion feels like there was a lot of testing done to get things right.  Because yes, Legion gets it right so far.  Also, the dungeons are so much better than WoD, I have high hopes for the raids.  I just really really hope that they won&apos;t only release 3 raids.  I am hoping at least 5-6 including small ones.  But so far the quality of the game is so good, that I would settle for less content than WotLK which I praise so much.  I had tons of negative things to say about the previous expansions, but almost nothing to say for Legion.  WoW went downhill so much...  I am now so happy that Legion gets it back on track.
<br>
<br>TLDR : Best expansion since WotLK.  I like everything about it so far.  It has nothing to do with the WoD disaster.  Probably the best leveling experience and the best zones so far that were done, or at least as good as TBC and WotLK.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6682631">Expand</a></span>

The demon hunter class is awesome, artifact weapons are a great addition to the game, and I love the aesthetics of the new zones. In addition, Blizzard has picked up where they left off in terms of storytelling, as Legion continues with the fully voiced cut scenes and interesting quests found in Warlords of Draenor (Word of Warcraft&apos;s last expansion). While tedious bonus objectives and technical issues have somewhat hindered my experience, I definitely recommend that fans of WoW give Legion a try!
<br>
<br>Legion introduces a lot of new features to World of Warcraft, but I think that the one which I was most excited for going into the expansion was the introduction of the demon hunter hero class. The class, which I got to play a bit early due to my pre-order, has been a lot of fun. I am finding that the damage rotation for the havoc DH (the class&apos;s damage spec) is fairly simple, but it still feels really good. I also love all of the mobility based abilities (like the rush ability, the name of which I can&apos;t recall). Gliding from the tops of high places in Azeroth is a blast in and of itself! The class just feels right to me, exactly how I imagined a demon hunter would play in WoW. In addition to adding the DH, Blizzard modified all of WoW&apos;s existing classes leading up the expansion&apos;s release. I imagine that some players will not enjoy these changes (I think that all of the classes were simplified to varying degrees). However, I am having a lot of fun with my old characters: the outlaw rogue, frost death knight, and fire mage in particular have been very enjoyable for me.
<br>
<br>Another big feature added in Legion are class artifact weapons. Every specialization of each class gets a unique weapon from WoW lore, some of which are very recognizable, such as the Ashbringer for retribution paladins, while others are new, like the Twinblades of the Deceiver for the havoc demon hunter. Early on in the expansion, players go on a short quest in order to retrieve the artifact weapon for their chosen spec (they can collect the other weapons after levelling up a couple of times). I have only played two of these (havoc demon hunter and frost death knight), but I thought that they were very well executed. Each quest fit the feel of the class which I was playing perfectly through the inclusion of iconic characters and locations (Frozen Throne!), and solid writing. I found the artifact quests more difficult than those of the standard variety, but this made acquiring the weapons even more rewarding. The weapons themselves also look awesome! Personally, I hope that they stick around for the next expansion, rather than going the way of garrisons. At least let us keep them as transmog appearances, Blizzard!!!
<br>
<br>Other things which I have enjoyed so far are the new dungeons, which look awesome and make very good use of the rich Warcraft lore, and class order halls. Class order halls are essentially the garrisons from Warlords of Draenor, but tailored to each class. The demon hunter order hall, for example, is a stolen burning legion warship called The Fel Hammer, and it looks awesome! Blizzard has designed these order halls to be occupied by multiple players of the same class, which sort of addresses the isolation that players felt with garrisons (though I have yet to actually speak with anyone I have seen in my order hall).
<br>
<br>From an aesthetic standpoint, Legion delivers the goods. Each area which I have visited looks great, despite the dated engine. It is really a testament to Blizzard&apos;s art team that they can continue to design areas which please the eye in 2016, twelve years after the game&apos;s release. I am especially fond of Val&apos;Sharah, an mystical elvish forest occupied by druids. What can I say, I like my elvish forests.
<br>
<br>Legion also succeeds from a narrative standpoint. While Blizzard does not posses the writing talent of Bioware or Obsidian, the use of fully voiced cut scenes, class specific content, and interesting quests (both from a mechanical and lore perspective) have made Legion an engrossing experience for me. It almost feels like a single player RPG at times, but not in a bad way. The group content is still well integrated, and the two aspects of the game (single and multiplayer content) do not clash like they do in other games (such as Star Wars: The Old Republic, which struggled with the single player-multiplayer relationship in its early days).
<br>
<br>Despite having a great time thus far, I do have a few gripes with the expansion. First, I am finding the bonus objectives rather tedious. Bonus objectives become available as players enter certain areas, and usually consist of killing a certain amount of enemies (or clicking of certain objects) until a bar fills up, at which point they are rewarded experience and gold. This is the sort of tedious experience which Legion&apos;s actual quests do a good job avoiding, so I find it odd that Blizzard would insert unnecessary grinding in the game. Moreover, even though they are optional, the bonus objectives award a lot of experience, so I feel compelled to complete them (even though I don&apos;t enjoy them that much). I suppose they pad the run time of the expansion... In addition the bonus objectives, I have found that the game has been rather unstable for the past few days. This may be due to DDoS attacks, but it is still annoying. I don&apos;t want to factor this into my final score of the game too much though: launch problems are fairly common in games, and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s fair to judge the entire game based on technical issues which are, usually, fixed within a week or so of release.
<br>
<br>Still, I am having a lot of fun with Legion. Pick it up if you have played WoW in the past, or if you are just looking for an awesome world to explore. FOR THE HORDE!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6679982">Expand</a></span>

<br>Dungeons are beautiful once again (Halls of Valour and Black Rook Hold stand out for me the most. And that Vault of Wardens last quarter!), the world is beautiful once again, the encounters are surprisingly well-designed. Makes you wonder why the same team of developers have messed up so much before! Or maybe it&apos;s just the Legion theme brings the best out of Blizzard, ha-ha.
<br>PvP progression feels a bit strange and it&apos;s not quite clear how exactly is it going to pan out in the future though and by the great roll of blizzard dice some specs are for piano-players again (holy paladin anybody?) while others are relegated to mashing 4 buttons on repeat (Beast Master hunters). But in these terms it&apos;s nothing new, pick any season and there will be stronger and weaker comps with varying degrees of difficulty playing.
<br>But so far the expansion is nothing short of great. If you&apos;re in doubt, don&apos;t doubt, it&apos;s a great lot of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6684061">Expand</a></span>

There is a new class, and some new way to do daily quest, but instead of daily quest they are world quest, still get repetitive after a while, but that is just the way the game plays out. If you have any interest at all in the world of warcraft games this shouldn&apos;t be missed.</span>

So here it is:
<br>
<br>Legion is an ok expansion. Launch was much better than WoD since many players left and the devs design quests in a different way now to reduce lag. Levelling is extremely long and boring, while doing 100-110 you get no skills whatsoever. Your artifact is generic and gives you mostly damage boosts (WW monk impressions) and extremely forcing artifact power grind. Since WoW officially became Diablo 3 you can play the bounties from Diablo 3 in WoW:Legion and get rewarded with chests. The idea behind choosing any location to level up was good, but there were also a hidden mechanic so you can&apos;t get 110 if you don&apos;t finish all locations. Mobs also scale with your level and gear, so you never progress in Legion, you stay the same.
<br>Interestingly enough, while leveling up mobs are extremely weak and die really fast, you can stack up to 10 mobs and one-shot them with WW monk&apos;s artifact. But right after you get 110, mobs get 2 times stronger and 2 mobs can now destroy you even though you have like 1 million HP. You you kind of progress, but backwards, you get weaker to regular mobs.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+ now you have two garrisons instead of one
<br>+ you get your Diablo 3 bounties as an endgame content
<br>+ good rejected WoD locations and designs
<br>+ about 5-10 really interesting and funny quests
<br>+ you have to feed NPC&apos;s now (realism improvements)
<br>+ no lag
<br>Cons:
<br>- generic dungeons with extremely unfunny AOE action
<br>- failed idea behind artifacts and unnecessary artifact power grind
<br>- 100-110 with no skills whatsoever
<br>- obvious Illidan sacrifice to save Azeroth incoming
<br>
<br>Overall: much better than WoD, but still incredibly boring and repetitive with little new content. Not disappointed cause I&apos;ve taught myself never to expect anything from Blizzard after Diablo 3 launch, WoD, Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm Starcraft 2 mod.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft-legion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6679406">Expand</a></span>
