It is never frustrating and the control system is elementary and perfect .The graphics are to the point but highly immersive and actually still quite impressive. The leel design is absolutely inspirational as most of your time will be spent repeating your previous missions instead of progressing with the game to even greater levels. Each level is extremely immersive and equally challenging. The AI, personally is unmatchable. I believe it is far beyond Far Cry as instead of complex programmed AI, the game uses a unpredictable innovative set of enemies which means you get a different experience each time you replay the game. The multiplayer is truely unbeatable as it is so vastly customisable so that you can have a simple heated deathmatch like Quake to a frantic assualt like Battlefield to a One life last man standing like Counter Strike to a tactical Co-Op without ever downloading a mod! Speaking of mods, they&apos;re is also a great selection which are extremely easy to install. The expansion packs are like parralel games but perhaps not with the equal experience. The only thing that brings the game down is the awful draw distance. This can ruin sniping a little and multiplayer as well. My conclusion anyway is that th new Advanced Warfighter was a step backwards from the original which is quite a pity as this Ghost Recon is truely original, has a simple innovative control system while been a game that anybody can be good at if they have any gene to persevere!

The only thing i have with ghost recon online is 2 things. 1 was that when running on 1.0.0.2 version the number of different game types and maps are small and the same ones are usually played over and over again, therefore is pretty unvaried, but little play 1.0.0.2 so you pretty much have seen one person more than once. :D and the second is that when updating to 1.4 i think it is, the number of rooms available are harder to choose from which makes it annoying when finding a room. Other from that i think Ghost Recon is great to play online and i have recommended it to a friend who now loves playing it too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon/user-reviews?user_review_id=398813">Expand</a></span>

Sure enough I pick it up and it&apos;s Tom Clancy&apos;s Ghost recon for about $3.  I decide to buy it, at first, I was a little bit discouraged by the fact that it is over a decade old, but lets just say, decade old or not, I definetly got my $3 value out of it.  Ok, now If you play a lot of Call of Duty games, you may not like it, for multiple reasons.
<br>1.  Its not just a mindless shooter, it has STRATEGY
<br>2.  Unlike in COD, if you die you continue on as one of your squad mates, an idea that I found ingenious, fun, and it added a whole other degree of realism to the game.
<br>3.  Picking your weapons before you go out for battle, YEAH, YOU WISH YOU COULD DO THAT IN COD!
<br>4.  The game has almost an open world aspect, the fact that you can choose your route to advance and you aren&apos;t just restricted to a single street or alley (like you are in COD)
<br>5.  Directing your men where you want them to go.  Do you ever get the feeling when playing COD, that you just want to throw the controller at the screen when your fellow squad mate isn&apos;t doing what you want him to do or going where you want him to be?
<br>Now, I could go on and on about the differences, but I figure I&apos;ll stop there.  Honestly, the only con I can think of is that sometimes the missions might be short, and overall the game is just dated, but don&apos;t let this stop you from buying the game, because if the PC port is just as good as the PS2&apos;s, you&apos;ll get hours of replay time and overall have lots of fun, as this is a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon/user-reviews?user_review_id=2920290">Expand</a></span>

Even 13 years after its release, it has its distinct advantages over current tactical shooters. The scale and focus isn&apos;t as broad as the OFP/ArmA series, but it makes up for that with intuitive controls and squad command. Unfortunately the sequels didn&apos;t follow up on this.</span>

Probably a 9.5 but i know a lot of people are brutal with reviews. Played the betas liked them. This is the path everyone thought the division was going down. Pvp content coming. I like my dungeon team work feeling games and this is that in droves. Did some questing on my own feels a lot like the old ghost recons. Basic commands for sqaud. Vehicle combat is great. The first moment I&apos;m speeding down a road and we enter combat and someone was in the boot and it opens firing. I giggled so hard.
<br>Graphics on 4k ultra are great. One of the prettiest games ive seen in the co op tactical shooter. Textures are good and i like some of the extra options i havent seen before in other games. Did drop the textures down to cery high and fps fain was massive.
<br>Scale is massive... i have played 5 hours still in the first area out of 20 odd. Im so excited about the scale of the
<br>map. Its packed full.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-ghost-recon/user-reviews?user_review_id=7048424">Expand</a></span>
