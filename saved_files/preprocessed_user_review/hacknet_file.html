<br>I only wish there were more mechanics, such as upgrading your PC to get more memory, or having logs do something (anything really, on my third run I just ignored log deleting entirely).
<br>
<br>If there was another hacking game on the market other than 15 year old Uplink, the score of Hacknet would likely plummet, as the game is &quot;okay&quot;, just very novel and thus gets a boosted engagement factor. This is perhaps the opposite of Shovel Knight, a game with no new novel gameplay, but is incredibly polished and fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hacknet/user-reviews?user_review_id=5874009">Expand</a></span>

It feels so realistic that you forget you&apos;re playing a game after a while, which is weird.

<br>A few minor points are that the music, while very good, gets extremely repetitive, &amp; using the mouse every now &amp; again to connect to a new machine is a little bit of a hassle. There are also some other issues in which the game may become uncompletable if you do certain missions out of order, that was only an issue once for me, but be aware of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hacknet/user-reviews?user_review_id=7631158">Expand</a></span>
