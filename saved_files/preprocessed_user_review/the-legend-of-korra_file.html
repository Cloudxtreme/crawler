Good game, Platinum.</span>

This opinion is based on the fact that I have beaten the entire game in one sitting (~3.5-4.5 hours) and played a decent amount of the probending, which is unlocked after you have beaten the game.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+Feels like a Platinum game gameplay wise
<br>+Great for Korra fans and character action game fans
<br>+Runs at a constant 60 fps with no dips (AMD FX-4300 &amp; AMD HD 7850)
<br>+Great voiceacting
<br>+Art style in game and in cinematics is nice
<br>+Cool final boss albeit not a real Korra villan
<br>+All 4 elements have a specific time in which they are used
<br>+Probending is a lot of fun
<br>+Difficulty (normal) feels good, not too easy but certainly not too hard, looking forward to playing it on extreme
<br>+Counters can be a high risk high reward on certain enemies
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-More times than not counters do way too much damage
<br>-Enemies sometimes have a tendency to wait turns and attack
<br>-Cannot fluently combo different elemental attacks with each other
<br>-Story isn&apos;t up to Korra standards
<br>-Only three real boss battles in the game
<br>-Not much replayability because you seem to unlock mostly every item just one time through
<br>-Naga segments are a chore and are unnecessary
<br>-The platforming is awkward and there is way too much of it
<br>-Repetitive enemies and mostly bland locations (Somewhat understandable due to the $15 price and time in development)
<br>
<br>On a scale of 1-10, Final Score: 6.8/10 (Good)
<br>
<br>Final Verdict: Buy it if you are a fan of character action games, are a Platinum game fan, or are a Korra fan. Wait until it goes slightly on sale (~33-50% off) if you don&apos;t consider yourself either of those things. I do consider this a game many can enjoy, it just depends on how much you are willing to pay for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-legend-of-korra/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617074">Expand</a></span>

<br>All in all, Legend of Korra is a great game and I felt super excited when I played it. The game deserves and 8/10 but I&apos;m giving it a 10 to support future releases and to shut the mouth of this &quot;awesome reviewers&quot; out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-legend-of-korra/user-reviews?user_review_id=4615782">Expand</a></span>

<br>What makes the world of Avatar, Korra&apos;s world, so appealing however, is the story and characters. This is where things are severely lacking. Sure, you get Korra, but where are her friends? Mako? Bolin? Asami?
<br>
<br>For $15, you get some excellent game play, replay-ability for collecting and challenge, and the Pro-bending tournament once you complete the story once, with a passable lackluster story. What I wish, however, is that this was a $40-50 product with content to match.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-legend-of-korra/user-reviews?user_review_id=4872023">Expand</a></span>

<br>things i did liked:
awesome cutscenes
great combat. however felt repetitive.
80% of the voice acting was great.
controls are responsive.

things i hated:
graphics lacking many things. even that&apos;s supposed to be a cartooned game.
the minigames are very dull.

<br>uninspired map design.
<br>very linear.
<br>item store is bad.
<br>
<br>the fact this game is at 15$ dollars. and that&apos;s fine by me. it can be fun. but overall. like i said.

<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a fan of the TV show, like myself, then i recommend  playing this. It doesn&apos;t really have much sway on the TV show. but if, again like me, you have ever wanted to kick ass whilst bending then this certainly does that.
<br>The game has received some pretty bad scores and i can see it isn&apos;t a 10/10 game but it isn&apos;t as bad as some critics have been saying. i&apos;m only on chapter 7, but I&apos;ve already got my bending back so i&apos;m happy! Mixing the bending together feels pretty awesome mid combat and buying the new moves for your bending is nice - Especially when you play the next level and let off a massive combo you just bought.
<br>The game has flaws such as it&apos;s not very well optimised for PC - i can&apos;t change my resolution as it causes my monitor to lose signal. The cut scenes can seem a little bit jumpy at points. Not to mention the most annoying Video game cliche ever of suddenly losing all your powers at the beginning and fighting to earn them back. but i can successfully say after 1 hour i have it all back (the cliche still annoys me.)
<br>Ultimately i&apos;d say if you&apos;re a fan buy this, it&apos;s cheap. If you like button mashing games, this also has lots of that, then I think you&apos;ll like this short entrance into the universe. If you&apos;re not over the top on either this universe or button mashing fighting then perhaps just wait for a sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-legend-of-korra/user-reviews?user_review_id=4615367">Expand</a></span>

My favorite thing that I noticed right away is that they used the same voice actors as the T.V. series which I found brought great realism to the game. The one thing I will say right off the bat is that yes it is a $15 dollar game and not some multimillion dollar blockbuster game. The game I feel is aimed towards the tween/teen age group however even as someone in my 20&apos;s who is a huge fan of the series I was very pleased with how entertaining it was. The art style used fit very well into the world and storyline used in the show. Some of my issues with it so far are the camera controls with the keyboard and mouse are a little frustrating at times, it does not focus on the ideal area within combat and movement but not so much that it makes it unplayable. The games bosses that I have faced so far provided a bit of a challenge and actually killed me a few times but I was able to learn different was to beat them before I got frustrated with having to replay each part. I am not far enough yet to really explore the different move combos but it looks like the game offers a decent amount of variety as you level your skills up. Overall I was very happy with many of the aspects of the game and am looking forward to seeing what the rest of the game has! I am giving this a 10 because as with several other people reviewing I want there to be more games in the Korra universe and am hoping that good reviews will allow this. In terms of game play I&apos;d give it a 8 because of some of the difficulties with the camera control and support for the keyboard and mouse. Worth the $15.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-legend-of-korra/user-reviews?user_review_id=4616052">Expand</a></span>

Sadly, this game is one of my least favorites of all time. Here&apos;s why.
<br>
<br>FEATURES
<br>
<br>Game is really short. 8 Chapters each beatable in about 20 minutes or so. Most of the game is about going back and earning the best medals through each chapter, which is hard because the medal is an average score overall medals earned in the chapter.
<br>
<br>The game is comprised of 2 modes. Standard beat&apos;em up levels and Temple Runner races. There&apos;s also a &quot;Pro-Bending&quot; mode after you beat the game once but after beating the game twice I didn&apos;t really feel like playing it. There are segments in the main game mode that give you a gist of what it is and it&apos;s not really all that fun. There are Naga races inbetween missions that are like something you would find in a Mobile App Runner game. You run straight, and hit left/right/jump. It&apos;s really feels like it&apos;s just there to fill space. I was really hoping for more than just a linear beat-em-up with short Naga races inbetween as filler content.
<br>
<br>There is a shop where you spend Spirit Tokens on equipables/consumables and moves for each style of bending. The shop is small, though. About 10 talismans total, with 2-3 moves per bending style and a handful of consumables. There&apos;s also Korra&apos;s Room, which is just a menu screen to change outfits. Most outfits are just reskins of the same outfit. 2 of the 5 outfits you have to unlock via a secret code.
<br>
<br>COMBAT
<br>
<br>The combat is &quot;Press X/Left-Click &apos;X&apos; amount of times then Y/Right-Click &apos;X&apos; amount of times.&quot; Charging X/Y builds your Spirit which allow for more powerful attacks. You also can time blocks for quick counter attacks that use QTE segments. Stronger enemies can also counter, which brings up another QTE for you to counter their counter. Overall the gameplay feels smooth and the animations are pretty sweet. If you&apos;re expecting something high grade you&apos;ll be sadly disappointed as the combat in this game is really bare bones button mashing with well timed blocks/dodges. While dodging all attacks go through you as well, so you don&apos;t even really need to move out of the way when you dodge.
<br>
<br>You attack with Fire, Earth, Wind and Water. Fire is the worst out of the 4 and is poorly represented in this game. Mostly close ranged attacks, and nearly every attack somehow never wants to hit your target. Water is the first one you get, and is mostly long ranged quick attacks with medium range heavy attacks. Earth is slow burst damage and is easily the hardest hitting element at your disposal, but it&apos;s slowness makes it a double edged sword leaving you open to attacks during your combos. Air is the most powerful element as it has mostly AOE attacks with a crap ton of crowd control. Simply put, as soon as you get air everything dies.
<br>
<br>At the very end of the game you unlock the Avatar state which slowly charges (very slowly) over time. Once you activate it you become unkillable and deal massive damage to everything. It lasts for about 20 seconds but that&apos;s more than enough time to destroy everything except for the final boss which seems to be resistant to everything you throw at it.
<br>
<br>Every other boss in the game is a Mecha-Tank. They&apos;re more like minibosses actually. There&apos;s one segment where you fight a big spirit instead of a tank, but it&apos;s pretty much the same thing. The only real boss is the last boss and he is a giant HP pool with unblockable attacks and AoE&apos;s. You don&apos;t really learn anything about him other than that The Avatar destroyed his body in a past life and he wants revenge.
<br>
<br>STORY
<br>
<br>The story is really lackluster as well. It&apos;s basically Korra, and Ginora as Navi, then the Main Villain. It&apos;s really disappointing that they didn&apos;t feel the need to have more of the characters from the show in the game. Makko and Bolin make a short appearance at the beginning and have 2 or 3 lines of dialog but that&apos;s about it. You don&apos;t see any other characters from the show besides Korra and Ginora through 99% of the game. Sadly, Ginora isn&apos;t played by the same actor from the show either, although she does a decent job at trying to imitate her.
<br>
<br>The animated cutscenes are colorful, but they are choppy. Sometimes it looks like a short slideshow. It&apos;s not bad but it doesn&apos;t compare to the Animated Series at all. Voice acting is good at least. The only one who talks through nearly all the cutscenes is Korra so don&apos;t expect much dialog. I think some sound clips are actually from the show itself, I could be wrong though.
<br>
<br>GRAPHICS
<br>
<br>The graphics feel like they are a PS2 or GCN game from the 1st generation of games. The textures are really bland and the level design is linear as you can get. Some textures even look so poor it seems like they are from a PSX game. The levels are nearly all a straight line with some offshoots that lead to chests with nothing useful in them. They just give you more experience/cash.
<br>
<br>OVERALL
<br>
<br>Overall I was disappointed in the end but the ride was pretty fun. The whole game kind of felt like one big tutorial. Once you get the 4 elements to bend it&apos;s pretty much over about an hour later.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll probably get a few more hours out of it. If you&apos;re a fan of the show or you just want a quick beat-em-up game to kill a few hours then it&apos;s worth the fifteen clams. You&apos;d probably be better off waiting for it to go on a sale, though. It&apos;s a budget title and the end result really shows that Activision/Nick didn&apos;t want to spend any real money to produce this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-legend-of-korra/user-reviews?user_review_id=4615117">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Legend of Korra isn&apos;t a game with an in-depth story, it also doesn&apos;t need that really, for $15.
<br>I liked the game, really just loved it. Normally, I don&apos;t play games twice except for GTA. Well, this game, for some reason I started a new game and just played it for 2 hours straight, didn&apos;t care that I already played it. It just feels so good and the combat is so fun.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d recommend it to any fan over the series, or to any fan of beat &apos;em ups. Crazy what you get actually for just $15, better than your average FPS for $60 (Not specifically talking about Call of Duty).
<br>
<br>So well, I hope there will be more games, I loved it and I encourage everybody that is thinking about buying it, just buy it!
<br>
<br>Explanation for the score:
<br>- Could&apos;ve been better, but for $15 it&apos;s okay.
<br>- No game is perfect, therefore no 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-legend-of-korra/user-reviews?user_review_id=4693379">Expand</a></span>

The difficulty quickly rises in this game, as the game itself isn&apos;t very long. It makes up for length in unlockable difficulties and new, also unlockable, purchasable abilities and increased animation.This game, at first, can be disappointing to the hardcore gamers who expect Call of Duty graphics, and to Korra fans expecting only perfection, but as you continue it becomes one of the most fun games that can be replayed over and over again.
<br>
<br>The fighting allows for creativity, and freedom, and it never stays the same throughout the game. You get new abilities, new combos, etc. It never gets old.
<br>
<br>You feel like Korra, as you&apos;re playing this, too! The animation of Korra in this game is very, VERY well done. As you dodge and flip, she hops slightly in smooth transition. Every footstep and movement is made to be realistic. You will hear footsteps only if her foot hits the ground, whereas in other games, the footsteps start even if their foot stops short of the ground, which I have always found to be a flaw in other games. Her also hair flows properly, and her stand-still animations are characteristic.
<br>
<br>the story, which takes place in between book 2 and book 3 of the original series, is so-so and slightly lopsided. It can come off as corny due to the not-as-great-as-the-series voice acting, but becomes more properly defined as you continue. There are some holes, if you follow the series. But it&apos;s not bad, just slightly &apos;off&apos;.
<br>
<br>This game, minor flaws aside, is amazing. The flaws that one may come across are easily overlooked, and the game just continues to get better and better, even when you already completed the story.
<br>
<br>Extreme Difficulty is like playing a whole new game. It&apos;s unbelievably hard, but once you adjust, it&apos;s doable.
<br>
<br>This game is addictive, a &apos;whirlwind&apos; of fighting. It challenges your reflexes more than some games do today.
<br>
<br>It may be low-budget, but this game is a perfect, enjoyable tribute to the Korra series and its fandom.
<br>
<br>I love, love, LOVE this game. I take back all doubts that I had about it. Once you play and stop comparing it to high budget games, it&apos;s one of the best low-budget games ever. Avatar games have never failed me, and I&apos;m happy to see that Korra is the same.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m very thankful for it, and I recommend it to anyone, age ten+, who enjoys the series.  The combat system is very complicated, and may not be the most suitable for children under the age of ten.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-legend-of-korra/user-reviews?user_review_id=5046449">Expand</a></span>

<br>I don&apos;t find that mini game enjoyable at all, it&apos;s just another temple-run-like game which makes me feel really annoyed! You better not expect much from this game.</span>

The show has the potential to be made into an AMAZING RPG, and this was not it, but it did what it set out to do, and is a fun little game with a surprising amount of challenge. Also pro bending is a little addicting. If it was fleshed out more, would make a fun little online game or something, but as it is, it&apos;s a little plain. They had the right voice actors, which evoked a bit of emotion in the handful of 10 second cut-scenes.  I got it on sale for 3 something dollars and it is absolutely worth that, but I&apos;d say don&apos;t buy above $5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-legend-of-korra/user-reviews?user_review_id=5848332">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>+ Original graphics - just like playing anime
<br>+ Simple and atmospheric normal and combo attacks
<br>+ Short movies from time to time
<br>
<br>- Poor story
<br>- Too less different enemy types
<br>- Too short - at about 4h of gameplay
<br>- Visible world limitations - open places without possibility to walk there</span>
