I just finished the entire thing tonight, and needless to say, this game is amazing!! I love messing around and killing zombies, while completing the game in the process. My favorite part of this game is definitely the story line. The makers did a great job by twisting the story line every now and then, causing you to say, &quot;Wow, I NEVER thought THAT was gonna happen!&quot; or something similar. Also, I don&apos;t know what people are talking about with glitches. My game ran absolutely flawlessly at the highest level graphics, so no complaints there either. So, overall, GREAT game. DR is probably one of my favorite game series. So, without a doubt, this game deserves a 10 </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3663904">Expand</a></span>

It is exhilirating. It is repetitive. It is limitless. It can be whatever you choose to make it. This is the strength of this serious. The problem comes with finding the motivation and drive to complete this game without looking at a wiki. I feel that the time constraints are important to preserve the frantic sense of helplessness and desperation. However I also feel that they force you down a linear pathway with no time to explore or do everything. This means you soon realise there is a cost/benefit analysis that can be done on every decision in this game and for me that means I go google/wiki the best weapon builds and best way to tackle bosses which cheapens the thrill of the experience... you might say I&apos;ve caused it to myself, but I&apos;d say there is some improvement to be made in the game design before you can say it&apos;s worthy of going further into the green territory. Still a worthwhile game to play and well worth the money, but I&apos;d like to see the series progress in terms of engagement with the plot and a bit more freedom when it comes to the time restraints (keep them but make it less restrictive - I know I&apos;m a terrible customer that doesn&apos;t know what I want!).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1981888">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I bought Dead Rising 2 back in 2011 because I thought it would be a great co-op experience with my cousin or my friends. Or both.
<br>
<br>Instead what you get is a shallow, linear game that essentially forces you to play through its tedious story, consisting of you fetching so-called &quot;Zombrex&quot; for your infected daughter, as well as meeting other survivors and escorting them back to your safe spot.
<br>
<br>As far as the actual gameplay goes, this game delivers. You have a multitude of ways you can use to obliterate zombies, which is a ton of fun in and of itself. However, you are under a time restriction... Take too long and you fail the game.
<br>
<br>The graphics in this title are pretty average at best. Character models are pretty decent though, including the zombies.
<br>
<br>Oh and one more huge gripe. Games for Windows Live is attached to this game like a cancerous growth. Buyer beware!
<br>
<br>I did not like this game very much, and I felt cheated out of my $40 that I had spent. But oh well, lesson learned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4427339">Expand</a></span>

<br>Cons: Time limit for every quest you get; time limit for quests also cripples you to explore semi open world because you are rushing to complete them; characters have voice overs but only in cut scenes, otherwise you press a button to read the conversation sentence by sentence; you can&apos;t sprint so you walk at a slow pace everywhere. Also... Windows LIVE!!!
<br>All in all, I deleted it from my laptop after 4 hours, because I was disappointed in what I got. If you have a lot of time and it&apos;s a rainy day, go ahead and buy, have fun for an afternoon, but don&apos;t expect anything mind blowing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2553529">Expand</a></span>

A solid game which boasts beauty, competence, and visceral satisfaction.  Capcom has really outdone their selves with this title.<br><br>Though not truly a completely new game on its own, this game copies much of its style directly from dead rising, the original.  More of a re skin, this game is a second take on the same idea.  However in this iteration it all comes out in fantastic fashion and leads to an altogether new experience.<br><br>Return players to the series will find its controls and handling nearly identical to the first.  A few things later on begin to feel clunky as the controls do tend to get bloated with the addition of several combos and unique moves; this is made worse by one obvious trait: it was developed for consoles.  However it never becomes impossible and with so much time between the addition of these new feats they easily become second nature.<br><br>The unlock system is very satisfying and. in my opinion, perfectly paced.  Some of it is randomized which is neat but really the randomization is rather limited and probably for good reason.  I would have wished for a more god like status at full character, being able to toss zombies with a herculean strength across the silver strip while I rain elbow-thunders from the heavens like Zeus letting only the brief pause to drink from my beer hat allow my enemies to rest.  But I could see others who prefer it the way it is.  However it is very nice to get multiple unlocks at a time and the combo cards really add to this a whole new form of exploration.<br><br>The combination weapons are a novelty that at first seem &quot;sort of neat&quot; on the outside but very quickly transcend to &quot;Holy sh&amp;* yes!&quot;  There is something delightful about the superfluous use of duct tape and the cathartic nature of a pitchfork shotgun.  Yes that&apos;s right, a shot-fork.  Let me just explain this to you: you stick the fellow with the fork, then hold em up so you can put a few right in his stomach.  The shotgun is simply taped onto the pitch-fork.  I know, it&apos;s ingenious.<br><br>Graphically the game is fantastic.  It looks rather nice for itself and is definitely taking advantage of the current hardware.  My system was able to run it on high with everything maxed out but I expect this is not going to be the norm.  With so many zombies on screen, which is quite an impressive and sometimes breathtaking amount, it is being reported that many users are having to play on low settings.  However since it is modding friendly to the pc crowd, which is a huge plus, players should hopefully be able to lower the max amount of zombies allowed.  The actual mechanics of the game are simple.  Kill zombies, save people; the game focuses on combat.  The guns in this game have been chronically underpowered and for good reason, melee is where the game shines.  Lots of weapons feel very cheap, weak and uninteresting; for example you can wield a donkey lamp.  Others however have such a visceral feel, they are delightful in a way.  A certain weapon, which is essentially a sledgehammer and fire axe taped together, has such a heavy weight about it that when its swung you can almost feel Chuck Greene, the oddly stoic father, strain as he swings it like a dumbbell.  Also did I mention the shot-fork?<br><br>The sounds in the game are good.  The weapons sound very solid; and the voice acting is not terrible.  There really isn&apos;t much else to say here.  The ending music is terrible scream-o but that&apos;s my, albeit fantastic, opinion.<br><br>If you are wondering if this game is worth 40 earth dollars you should just be thankful its not more.  For quality at this level it easily meets the price.  Game play is a solid two days of time but is made longer by insane re-playability and co-op mode is a gigantic plus.  If you have a friend who has it you owe it to yourself to at least try it.  There is something very childish about yucking it up with a buddy while you save humanity one zombie at a time.<br><br>It has some flaws.  Its easy; once you get past a certain point nothing is a challenge anymore, for me it was when I learned how to dodge.  But this isn&apos;t a giant problem since the game isn&apos;t really about challenge at all.  Co-op mode isn&apos;t perfect either with glitches/bugs as well as connection errors.  Also the mechanic of giving your daughter Zombrex is cute, but there is no reason it has to be so neurotic and groan inducing.  There is a perfectly abled women in the room who can give her the shot at the correct time, I don&apos;t need to be running my a%$ back at all hours cause I can&apos;t trust another human being.  And some plot holes.<br><br>Get this game.  Stop reading right now and buy it.  Go on, do it.  If you are a zombie fan even a little, you owe it to yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1383106">Expand</a></span>

The save system and timed game play will probably put  rub some people the wrong way, but once you get used to it and understand how it works its not that big of a deal.  All in all its nice to see a game come to pc the same time as consoles and match its console counterparts in quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1382869">Expand</a></span>

The missions and zombie massacres are too repetitive after a while, but if you can live with it, that&apos;s fine. The weapon making system is awesome and creative in every way. The graphics are also (kinda) impressive if you watch it in a standard viewpoint. Overall a game that you would love to play in a rainy day.</span>

Now that doesnt mean it is terrible as it does have some decent fundamentals.
<br>on the plus side there are plenty of weapons to choose from with enough variety to keep things fresh for a while in both the comical and  realistic catagories. The combining system is also  pretty deep with the 50 odd combinations. This combined with some really cool dismemberment mechanics  make for some very thrilling zombie bashing. Another good note, the survivors arent totally helpless now which is great;but as i said before this game was rushed and just about everything else could have used an extra few months work.
<br>
<br>To start with the games presentation is the hardest hit. Graphics wise the game is average , nothing here we havent seen before.  But then there are the littlethings. Things like missing shadows and jerky and awkward animations for the games living cast. This is particularly apparent in the games cutscenes which range from passable to embarrasing. The cheesy dialogue doesnt help either.
<br>Even the much flaunted dismemberment and combing mechanics suffer from repetitive animations.
<br>for most weapons there is only one animation for each attack type ( melee, aoe melee and special move) which can get repetative fast. Another issue came in the form of the survivors. as in the first one there are survivors to save. However  the game chose their life&apos;s story in the form of , get this,  skipable text boxes.  yes the survivors have no audable lines which leaves them with no personality at all. the effect leaves the player identifiying more with the psychos of the game ( who thankfully have colorful cut scenes dedicated to them) than the people we are supposed to save. on the topic of psychoes. all the bosses of the game suffer from pattern ai.  basically each boss has a rigid pattern of actions to use against the player. some of the bosses can be beaten by simply walking outside the room or building which the encounter took place and then throwing objects at them. some times they do the further service of bugging out in these situations to the point where the player can walkup to them and spam the melee button till the green bar goes empty.
<br>
<br>finally the actual story is quite laughable. the characters are all pretty cookie cutter in design to the point of bad taste. the main bad guy is more annoying than threatening  and a 10 year old could guess the plot twists from the very moment  the characters involved present themselves. Its all been done before.
<br>
<br>the game doesnt even get that scary or tense which i think partially ruins the theme of the game (zombies are supposed to be scary).  you can get through the game without killing even one zombie which i think undermines them as a threat.
<br>
<br>over all its only good for a few giggles and laughes but as a serious game, it is not even close which is a shame</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1387876">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Multiple timed missions occurring at the same time on top of the countdown timer for the military.---
<br>Graphics are weak for a 2010 game, even for a console.---
<br>
<br>A sandbox game that does not allow you to enjoy it as you are always in a rush to beat the clock or you fail. Looking at other screens in the game does not stop the clock and zombies can still munch on you while you are trying to look at information. If you can find a trainer or engine that will work with it then the game may become fun to play for you. Otherwise the fun you have killing zombies will quickly turn into frustration over many glaring annoyances and problems.
<br>
<br>I really wanted to like this game, at least the good old standby Left for Dead 2 can give you a good fix when zombies need to be killed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3506990">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m not talking about zombies on drugs like the once you find in Left 4 Dead, I&apos;m talking about real braindead zombies that doesn&apos;t walk any fasther than your grandmother crosing the street.<br>Dead Rising 2 is a time based game. All the missions you will encounter in the game have a limited amount of time to be completed, and even though this may seem stressfull for some it is a well done gameplay mechanism for others. New missions will pop up after you progress further into the game, you have a main &apos;questline&apos; that you will need to follow if you want to progress the story, but they will give you freetime between these main missions that you can use to explore and do other sidequests.<br>These sidequests is usually to rescue survivors, but some are boss fights aswell.<br><br>One of the gameplay mechanisms that makes this game stand out is that you can combine different items. As you gain PP(Prestige Points) you will earn new levels that will unlock new combo cards. These cards give you information about different objects that you can combine into new weapons.<br><br>I strongly recommend this game if you want a &apos;free roam&apos; zombie game with great co-op play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1383682">Expand</a></span>

<br>I didn&apos;t even make it 20 minutes into the game before deleting it. Your weapons break unrealistically fast (a fire axe can only take a few hits before breaking) and it is next to impossible to save the survivors. They are incompetent and constantly get themselves into trouble, and getting them out of trouble inevitably ends with you hitting them. This eventually leads to them defecting and abandoning you. Further, you can&apos;t hit zombies that you&apos;ve knocked down, so you can&apos;t finish them and have to wait for them to get back up to do so. Live zombies that you&apos;ve knocked down can still block your path though!

There are minor improvements abound, from better survivor AI (two tiers of this, second if you find a magazine for it) with better functionality helping them. For instance, when you approach doors now, an icon appears on thier frame when they are within entrance distance, an issue of escorting survivors in the first game.
<br>
<br>The combo weapons are fun, and a handful are downright hilariously broken, like the Rock Guitar. (Amp+Elec Guitar) The story is passably okay, with a few surprises that actually aren&apos;t expected, and a couple that are.
<br>
<br>The only real downsides are a lack of Survival or Sandbox mode like DR1 had, and the multiplayer is as throw away as you can get. Even Bioshock 2&apos;s MP is more respectable, and that&apos;s saying a lot with how awful it was.
<br>
<br>On a sidenote: I have no idea what issues user muad_dib is experiencing, as I use the exact same video card (9800 GT) and a 2.4Ghz Quad Core and never had any technical hiccups. Game runs flawlessly on a pretty standard system with countless zombies on screen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1385961">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay feels slow for a sandbox style game. If you just want to kill time along with zombies, there is plenty of that to go around, but if you are looking to do missions, you really can&apos;t spend time sightseeing due to the time limit. The major weak points are the time limit, the save system, and the fact that the weapons break too quickly. But there are a lot of different weapon combinations you can create and the results always bring a smile to my face. The cut scenes are high quality, but a little on the lengthy side with a lot of them being plain boring. Coop definitely makes it more enjoyable and there is a decent multiplayer experience that reminds me of American Gladiators.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1663437">Expand</a></span>

If you didn&apos;t like the first one you probably won&apos;t like this one.  The save system has been improved from last time, although it should be further enhanced.  Previously, you get one save slot, now you get three.  The idea they don&apos;t let you have unlimited save slots so it forces you to play the game again, perhaps the next time differently, saving everyone, save some people, or not save any.  My gripe about the save system is that you can&apos;t really &quot;save&quot; weapons you put together in a locker or what not, carrying around a rare weapon like the LMG and not using it feels cumbersome.  I would like to be able to combine my rare weapons and put them away like a trophy, and take them out to show them off to friends when I play with them online.<br><br>The online co-op is a fantastic addition.  The boss fights in this one are just as difficult as the previous.  So having a buddy co-op with you makes things a easier.  You are most likely to die at least once when facing one for the first time.  This is intentional, because you can still complete the game if you run away from the bosses.<br><br>It took me more or less 17 hours to complete the first play through, and I managed to save everybody I could find.  It was no easy task, but it was oddly fulfilling.  Currently on my second play through, I started the game thinking I will not save anybody this time around, but when the timer started ticking, I couldn&apos;t help myself but run out there and do it all again.  But this time, I was prepared with all the tools I gained from the first play through, really enjoying the brutalization of the zombies.<br><br>The online multiplayer experience for me was rather sad, not the co-op.  There&apos;s zombie killing sports that you can play with friends, that I never got a chance to play.  Waiting in a lobby for 20 minutes, but could never fill the 4 seats for the game to start, it was really disappointing.<br><br>All in all, the game has much improved from the first one.  Anyone who likes zombies games should definitely check this out.  This one has plenty more weapons, but yet I still wish there were even more.  I will most likely pick up the expansion if there is one, I am curious to find out what happens next in the DR world.<br><br>PS: those who can&apos;t run this game on the PC, needs a better PC.  It runs perfectly smooth on mine even out doors when over 300 zombies are on screen.  You can choose 800x600 up to 1920x1080.  There was never once where my computer couldn&apos;t handle it and affected my game play.  Granted there are slight screen tearing, but you wouldn&apos;t notice it much because it is simply too much fun killing zombies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1383930">Expand</a></span>

This is no different, nothing much has changed from the original on the X-box 360, but this is the PC version. Being there is no PC version for the first one, there is really nothing to compare to but game play. Most noticeable difference is the amount of Zombies. There is so much more in the PC version than any other version. It makes it more of a dire situation than say the X-box 360, or PS3, having both systems and the PC I can see the difference. I didn&apos;t buy the X-box version, but my friend did. Graphics of course are much, much, MUCH, better on the PC than any other system. Not to say, that the graphics are amazing, because there not. There good, but not GROUND breaking. On the PC, it&apos;s a lot sharper, crisp, and smoother at the same time. The graphics are much better than the first game, but not a hug update. On the bright side, I am playing on a 500 dollar PC with everything turned up (Dual Core Athlon 64x CPU, a 9800GT, 2gigs of DD3 ram, and a cheap mother board that does the job). You don&apos;t need a beast of a computer to run this game, just have a good GPU, and at least 2 gigs of ram, and you should be good. I have seen some frame rate issues, but, they have been few and far between.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1633571">Expand</a></span>

Also, mupltiplayer mode was funny as hell but too difficult to enter because of a retarded implementation (you can only play when 3 other humans are available, no bots, and  if one of them exit the whole game shuts down). Definitely worth a 7.5</span>

Non, un point pour le fait que ce n&apos;est pas tr&#xE8;s exigeant et qu&apos;on pourra le faire tourner tr&#xE8;s d&#xE9;cemment sur une poubelle, ce qui n&apos;est d&#xE9;j&#xE0; pas mal ma foi. Et puis on peut jouer au pad 360 avec ! d&apos;ailleurs depuis le premier Dead Rising, ils ont enfin compris que la vue subjective, c&apos;&#xE9;tait mieux si on pouvait la contr&#xF4;ler avec l&apos;analogique droit et non pas l&apos;analogique gauche (&#xE0; moins d&apos;&#xEA;tre gaucher...). Tout arrive donc.
<br>
<br>Mais pas tout malheureusement. Copi&#xE9;-coll&#xE9; &#xE0; 95 % de la daube pr&#xE9;c&#xE9;dente, Dead Rising 2 fait dans une totale continuit&#xE9;, y compris au niveau de l&apos;interface mal foutue, la maniabilit&#xE9; toujours perfectible, les armes ou objets qui s&apos;usent &#xE0; vitesse grand V et surtout l&apos;absence totale d&apos;amusement qu&apos;un tel jeu de ce genre se doit de g&#xE9;n&#xE9;rer pourtant. Sans oublier les boss ing&#xE9;rables et grotesques et le m&#xEA;me syst&#xE8;me de sauvegarde compl&#xE8;tement &#xE0; l&apos;ouest. Aucun progr&#xE8;s, aucune remise en question. Z&#xE9;ro.
<br>
<br>Ce qui fait que je cherche &#xE9;ventuellement un deuxi&#xE8;me point &#xE0; accorder... quel peut-il bien &#xEA;tre ? la musique ? pas vraiment. Les voix ? en anglais seulement, quelle horreur. Le &quot;sc&#xE9;nario&quot; ?... restons s&#xE9;rieux tout de m&#xEA;me. Et puis quoi... cette calamit&#xE9; de Games for Windows Live ne fait rien pour l&apos;aider. Si ce n&apos;est que cette mouture PC &#xE9;tait bien moins ch&#xE8;re que la version console, certes. Mais ch&#xE8;re ou pas, de la merde, &#xE7;a reste de la merde.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-rising-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7229318">Expand</a></span>
