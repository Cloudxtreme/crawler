<br>
<br>At first I was Sad to play the first DLC  I started with a new character  The Assassin Daud. I was Sad that all the character building and equipment was lost&#x2026;. but this quickly changed  I was still very good because of all the skill I picked up through the first campaign and Daud begins to level up&#x2026;. and I chose different skill tree sets  and then I was happy  very happy&#x2026;. The storyline and goals are as fun and the maps as great. KnifeOfDunwallBrigmoreWitches is really all one game. And be forewarned  choices you made in the primary campaign come back to surprise you. Salivate you Pavlov dog  Add to Cart and Enjoy.

The new protagonist is awesome, specially his voice, and his story ties well with the rest of the game. More of the same awesome gameplay, engaging story, nice art design and everything. Really a nice addon, though a little short in length.</span>

Knife of dunwall is pretty much plays on the basis of the original campaign itself. you take control of the the person who assassinate the queen at the beginning of the original campaign and you will go through 3 maps where two of them are totally new and the third is just recycled from the original campaign where you kill Daud with Curvo. the game may be a little big short depend on the style you will chose to play but as a matter of fact it is nice to repeat the first two maps and try out new features or other ways to approach the objectives. The new powers added are somehow interesting addons but they arent amazing or overwhelming in comparison to the original protagonist of the game. finally i guess its worth 10 dollar for it, specially that u own the first game and you are thirsty for some fresh campaign  i hope there will be more interesting improvements in the next DLC which will be the last one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-the-knife-of-dunwall/user-reviews?user_review_id=3119145">Expand</a></span>

I wish I could say that this DLC is perfect, but it isn&apos;t. For as many things as it does right, it does quite a few wrong. The story, for one, is a bit lacking in narrative. The main character you&apos;ll be playing as, Daud, is a bit flat. He doesn&apos;t seem quite as fleshed out as I was hoping he would be. They start off the story with him being a bit remorseful over the killing of the Empress but they quickly drop that. I won&apos;t go any further than that, but suffice it to say the story is every bit as flat and uninteresting as the main story&apos;s was. However, the DLC does do qutie a number of things right. For one, it&apos;s more Dishonored. So you can expect more fantastic and awe-inspiring locales to visit. The first place, called &quot;Rothschild Slaughterhouse&quot;, is probably the best in the pack of 3 places you&apos;ll visit. The second, the &quot;Legal District&quot;, is pretty interesting if not a bit recycled. The third, which is &quot;Daud&apos;s Hideout&quot;, is completely recycled. Im hoping the next pack, which will be entitled &quot;Bridgmoore Witches&quot;, will have more locales like &quot;Rothschild Slaughterhouse&quot;. The gameplay is pretty much the same with the exception of a couple more gadgets which are unfortunately essentially useless if you plan on playing this full stealth. Hopefully the next pack can give us stealth players a few more options other than the sleep dart and the choking option. Suffice it to say, though, that this pack is worth picking up for $10. It should give you about 10 hours or so if you plan on sucking it all in and playing on stealth. If you like to go full bore and shoot everything up, expect maybe 2 or 3 hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-the-knife-of-dunwall/user-reviews?user_review_id=3118328">Expand</a></span>

The only area that felt &apos;new&apos; to me was the slaughterhouse, and the abilities/items added didn&apos;t really do a good job of differentiating Daud from Corvo.

The knife of Dunwall adds 3 big maps to the game.The first map is set in Rothchild Slaughterhouse, a huge factory where the not-so-good people of Dunwall process whale oil. I felt sorry for poor whales and fishes while I snaked my way through rooms filled with gutted sharks, meat hanging from hooks and blood everywhere. The whole map had a very inhumane and dark mood to it. You can also read books about the cruel methods of whaling here (Perfect anti whaling game). On this map you can fight with a new type of enemy that is hard to take down in combat. The second map is set on the wealthier city district, including a huge building which was fun to sneak through and rob. The third map is set on a map familiar from Dishonored: Daud&apos;s base. Every map is rather huge with many ways to approach every enemy and situation. Side quest, lethal or non-lethal mission are also present. There are some new weapons (electric mines, Choke Gas etc.) and some new  powers and bone-charms. Overall I enjoyed the game, and will do a second play through. The story was good, but felt unfinished (I guess other campaign DLC&apos;s will explain and further develop some thing.) Overall Knife of Dunwall adds some memorable gaming hours to the original game, and further expand the lure of the world.

<br>Storyline, i feel it&apos;s not really interesting and predictable,so predictable.
<br>
<br>Corvo and daud is not really different, almost he same skills and abilities from 2 of them, so you&apos;ll play the same way as corvo with different personality. and btw, Daud&apos;s character is boring and voice acting sounds bad to me
<br>
<br>for $10 DLC, well  i dont this this is pretty good one, may be if you&apos;re big fans of this game, you&apos;ll like to buy this. but i personally think this one doesn&apos;t really worth it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-the-knife-of-dunwall/user-reviews?user_review_id=3115511">Expand</a></span>

I like the decision to tell a little side story and I enjoyed playing as Daud, but it&apos;s difficult to present an interesting narrative over three missions and the ending is very anticlimactic. The gameplay is fun and overall the DLC maintains the quality of Dishonored, but I feel there&apos;s not enough new content here. There&apos;s a couple new abilities and items that don&apos;t have any substantial impact on non-lethal players and the levels themselves are disappointingly familiar. Half of the first mission and most of the second one takes place on the streets and back alleys of Dunwall and there was already more than enough of that in the main game. What&apos;s worse, the third mission revisits a location from the main story (guess which one), so only the slaughterhouse actually fells new (it&apos;s very good though). It was a fun few hours but in the end it doesn&apos;t add much to the overall experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-the-knife-of-dunwall/user-reviews?user_review_id=3203825">Expand</a></span>

It was very satisfying to solve &quot;the puzzle&quot; of it. If you were a big fan of Dishonored, this is a no brainer. I&apos;m taking off 1 point for the story. It is not as direct and easy to follow as the main game, but this DLC is all about the gameplay and it doesn&apos;t disappoint.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-the-knife-of-dunwall/user-reviews?user_review_id=3122260">Expand</a></span>
