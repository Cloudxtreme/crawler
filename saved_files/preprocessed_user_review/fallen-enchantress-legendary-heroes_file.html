The RPG part of the game is pretty good, I wish there was greater number of weapons and armor. The city building is also just ok. The races are all really similar; everyone really looks the same. After a few I only play small maps anymore (I have around 40 hours in the game). Late game gets super boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3172225">Expand</a></span>

<br>I really love the quest system and the wildlands addition, it gives to the game a lot more depth. All the editors, the customization tools and the uniqueness of every play are simply exciting and definitely worth all the time spent playing.
<br>What I didn&apos;t like though is the fixed tech tree, which is the same for every faction (a dynamic, galciv-style would be preferred), the diplomatic interface (too basic according to me), the custom content management system (almost non existent) and the inability to create custom scenarios. I found most strange the lack of any scenario editor. I mean, they gave everything to players, even a special effects editor, but not a simple scenario editor to make some player-made gdr-style campaign. Why?
<br>
<br>Anyway the game itself is really good and deserves a long try: so rich of depth, good graphics, good music and sound. Playing this game is relaxing but still engaging, and the customization possibilities are so huge that the game itself could be virtually rebuilt by players!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3866581">Expand</a></span>

Heroes are powerful and make a big impact but standard units can be strong as well and level through combat like Heroes thought they cannot equip items after they are created (they can equip items if you design them with items initially). You expand like most TBS games by creating pioneers who go out and build on new plots of land. Cities are then leveled by increasing population. You can specialize cities for wealth, research or military purposes and each branch has sub-branch specializations. Items are scattered throughout the map for you to find and you can also shop for items in your own territory or in a competitors territory (allowing you to buy items that their merchant offers) as long as you are not at war with them. There are different types of heroes including mages, commanders, warriors, defenders, and some thief type class. Each is fairly strong if you level them right and each can do multiple things though I found that it is best to focus on one type of ability such as damage vs defense.
<br>
<br>The only reason I do not rate this game higher is because the strategy aspects are not exactly great. Its not bad mind you but there is nothing new in this game and combat becomes monotonous toward mid game. In fact if you have played any TBS RPG game in the past (Disgaea, FFT, HM&amp;M, etc) then you have seen everything this game offers in terms of combat. Mages in this game are insanely powerful and can 1 shot entire armies in the initial move of an encounter making battle pointless even before reaching end game. Mid and end game suffer from very slow pacing on large maps. Diplomacy is boring and just straight trade based. Story? There really isnt one; just a bunch of lore that is not interesting.
<br>
<br>Still this is possibly the best TBS RPG around and far surpasses old console competitors like those mentioned above and stands tall against PC competitors as well. If you have not given this game a shot, I definitely recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=6703330">Expand</a></span>

<br>I recommend it to TBS fans especially. Makes a good change from Civ or similar. I don&apos;t think it can be given a 10, as it still has some rough edges and occasional bugs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3174184">Expand</a></span>

<br>After going through two installments and a pretty enjoyable effort with Fallen Enchantress, this expansion has finally shaped up to become a standout 4X fantasy game with sensible features. Costumization of the world, factions, your Sovereign and even your units is big, strategic choices are plentyful, especially at the very beginning of the game, tactical combat relies heavily on positioning and special attacks/abilities but stops short on more in-depth elements like morale or terrain modifiers. Living with and  if you are strong enough  going against the neutral monsters in the world is a blast and always provides a nice challenge. The world is filled with quests, items and lands to explore.
<br>
<br>Issues still arrive with the lackluster diplomacy system and the erratic behaviour of enemy factions. The AI has been significantly improved, especially concerning the use of magic on the strategic map, but still has problems when it comes to army composition and prioritizing which/where to construct its buildings/units. Bugs will also find their way more often than not and the performance tends to become unstable after a certain amount of game time.
<br>
<br>If you are even vaguely interested in turn-based strategy games in a fantasy world, you should really check out this game and maybe watch some videos. At first it might be hard to get into the specific rules of the economy and combat due to a shallow Tutorial, but once you understood all the concepts it can provide for a hapy long-term relationship. Modders are already at work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3177850">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is basically identical to the Civilization series... but doesn&apos;t come with any of the benefits.  There are new units to learn and understand their combat abilities.
<br>
<br>I would say if you are NOT familiar with Civilization or just want a more manageable game, then this one is a great place to go.  If you ARE familiar with Civilization, keep playing that as you won&apos;t have to learn a bunch of new material to basically play the same game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3214625">Expand</a></span>

I highly recommend it to all strategy fans, especially turnbased 4X fans and grand strategy fans. RTS fans might find it too slow for their tastes. Additionally RPG fans who want to try their hand at a strategy fantasy game might want to give it a shot.
<br>
<br>I bought the first elemental game a few years ago and it was pretty terrible. Stardock has been supporting their game ever since and we soon got the next game Fallen Enchantress, which was a decent entry to the genre but still was all that compelling.
<br>
<br>Now with Legendary Heroes the game is much more focused and polished and it&apos;s finally a very good game. I&apos;ve been playing the LH beta the last few weeks and I just can&apos;t stop playing. they&apos;ve finally captured that one more turn feeling that makes for a great strategy game and that&apos;s the highest compliment I can give to any game developer.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: If you are a 4X strategy fan, this game is worth your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3172114">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The graphics might look a little cartoony but who cares.  So did Borderlands, X-Com, and Torchlight.  I&apos;ll take a point off for diplomacy as it could use a little love but not a biggie.  The game is stable and runs smooth.  And above all else...it&apos;s a finished product.  (are you listening StarDrive?)
<br>
<br>Honestly, I have no idea what game the reviewer from Thunderbolt played.  &quot;Building an army is a complex endeavor?&quot;  What?  I want to build a Spearman...click.  Done.  Ok, now I want to build Spearmen riding a horse...click, click.  Done.  Did the reviewer think that Civ 4 or 5 was complex?
<br>
<br>Folks, if you like 4x games then this is a good addition to your library.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3172219">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I was extremely disappointed in the original Elemental game (How could anyone not have been?) and am happy to report that this is nothing like it.  This is the game that I wanted to play back then, and I can easily recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3178724">Expand</a></span>

The new hero trees are stale and boring. Yes you have more control over building the hero but I no longer find myself weighing the Pros and Cons of the random selections in FE. While the new prestige system removes the randomness of finding heroes it takes away some of the feeling of wonder I had previously. Eliminating the multitude of different damage &amp; armor types for universal consistency &amp; weapon specific special moves does slightly erode some tactical decisions. Overall, still a solid game and for me, this series lags only behind Civ 4 &amp; 5 for hours invested in 4X games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3192227">Expand</a></span>

The strategic game is well done, the map tile graphics are very varied and pretty enough. The tactical game could use a bit more variety in maps and placement of the creatures.

I honestly do believe this is the spiritual successor to Age of Wonders or the closest we shall get to it, which is something I&apos;ve always dreamed would happen.At first I pirated the game and on the second day after I went and purchased it off Steam to support the developers in what way I can, I was that impressed. It has so many layers from the research, the rpg-style exploration and questing to the empire building and warfare. Stardock has really impressed me with how much support they have gone and given this game, it is a light and day difference in terms of quality from the original Elemental to Legendary Heroes and this tells me they really do care about their product and their support for such a great game will not be ending anytime soon. I&apos;ll end by saying that the &quot;one more turn&quot; feeling we all love and crave has been captured very well so far for me with Legendary Heroes and what more can you ask for with a game like this? Turn based strategy fans shouldn&apos;t even hesitate on giving this game a try and spreading the word. I&apos;ve been greatly impressed with the amount of work and detail put into this game.

Stardock are a company that have treated their customers well for decades, so always keep an eye out for their games. PS I have nothing what so ever to do with stardock.... I am just an impressed customer. Plus the owner talks a lot about supporting new PC hardware in the future and that always gets my vote.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3518278">Expand</a></span>

After you get familiar with the game I suggest you grab some mods from the nexus that make it even better. My only complain are the maps options, they are to small and lack in variety.</span>

<br>
<br>Besides being a pretty game, Fallen Enchantress: LH features something that has become a rare sight in strategy games: A competent, non-cheating (on most settings) AI that will actually hand you your butt by simply playing better than you. It&apos;s really refreshing in a genre where you normally either get AIs that bore the stuff out of you, or AIs that play by completely different rules and then steamroll you with the 15372 extra units that they got out of nowhere. Brad really shows, again, that few people in the game industry understand AI programming as well as he does.
<br>
<br>The downside is the lack of multiplayer options. I don&apos;t need them, but I would like to have them. I still give this a 9/10 because it&apos;s not super important to me (because the AI is so good), but releasing a TBS in 2013 without any form of MP is a little off and a missed opportunity.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s still the best fantasy TBS in quite a few years. Don&apos;t skip it if you&apos;re a fan of the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3193934">Expand</a></span>

Takes me back to days of playing Civ and Mater of Magic. There are a few little niggles but no majors. Very stable never had a single crash in over 80 hours of play.</span>

This is the game that finally delivers the promise we first caught an ever so slight glimpse of in Elemental. Yeah, it took them three (3!!!) separate, and different iterations to get it where it should have always been, but hey, at least they got it. And did they ever get it. This game is a deep, and satisfying mix of a Role Playing Game and a Turn Based Strategy game. It has all the deep, and satisfying character advancement of an RPG, blended with that ever-so-addictive &quot;just one more turn&quot; feel of Civ. It&apos;s very easy to sit down and start playing, only to look up hours later and realize hours have passed without you even noticing. If you&apos;re even the most casual fan of TBS games, and enjoy RPG&apos;s, you owe it to yourself to give this a go.
<br>
<br>I also have to say, you really have to respect Stardock for how they handled all this, if EA or Activision had been publishing this, Elemental would have been released, it&apos;d have bombed, and that would have been it. But thank the gods that it was self-published b/c it gave Stardock the opportunity to keep working on it til they got it right. Not only did they keep working on it til they got it, but if you bought Elemental, Stardock gives you this, and all future expansions and iterations, for FREE!!!! Stardock has really earned my respect, it&apos;s not often you see a dev/publisher w/ such integrity. They could have just said, &quot;oh well, Elemental sucked, sorry &apos;bout that, try our next game, it&apos;ll be better we promise!&quot;. But they didn&apos;t, they said, &quot;damn, this really turned out terrible, please accept our heartfelt apology, and b/c of this, we will give you any future iterations of this game to you, sans gratis!&quot;.

Fallen Enchantress makes a big deal about its RPG elements, even including a win condition where you can practically play it as a single player RPG to defeat the ancient evil while virtually ignoring your in-game neighbors. You can also equip your (legendary) heroes with armor, weapons, and trinkets, put points into large active &amp; passive skill trees, and use them to enhance your cities, increase your resources, or just go out and kill big monsters. However I feel all this added complexity takes away from the strategy elements of the game and are poorly explained; there is only ONE 10 minute tutorial for the whole game, with everything else explained through tooltips, brief popups and an in-game encyclopedia. In fact, many of the new game &quot;tutorial&quot; popups just link to the in-game manual&apos;s page on that topic.
<br>
<br>If you can look past the low quality, repetitive music, terrible graphics with flat, undetailed textures and poor character models (why is everything so ugly when there are so many close-ups of your heroes?), clunky UI, and tinny SFX, you might have fun with this game. Fallen Enchantress is a very mundane 4X Civilization style strategy game that tries to be something bigger but is too underdeveloped to be worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3833744">Expand</a></span>

I used to be an avid fan of heroes of might and magic 3 and a little into Civ. This is a combination of both genre, with civ style building pattern n HOMM style of combat. The heroes are interesting and varies in play styles, with 5 possible routes to develop them. The rpg side is interesting and fighting the world bosses is fun too. You are also able to design your own units which is a major plus side for a strategy game. However, I feel that the building style becomes more of a number game of addition which becomes dry after awhile. There should also be more variety in the units recruited by each race and make them more useful (other than juggernauts). I think there is potential in developing it into a strong position of rpg/strategy games with more monsters, loots etc After being disappointed with big budget games with poor content and over hyped release (Diablo 3, Rome 2 etc), it is comforting to know that there are a few companies that do listen and work  on their games to make them better and better. Get it on steam sale if you can and you will find yourself trapped with the &quot;one more turn&quot;!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3645615">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s quite easy to get into especially if you have played this type of game before, but some of the deeper game mechanics like the ability to design units are not made so obvious. Overall probably one of best i&apos;ve played outside of the classic HoMM games.

Those with more patience might find this appealing but I grew tired of it. Still fans of these types of games like others have mentioned might find this worth a look.</span>

It&apos;s an extraordinary game that is definitely worth a buy if you&apos;re a fan of the above genres, and I&apos;ve spent hundreds of hours on it. You can create your own faction (think a faction in an RTS game) and create your own leader. You can play random maps or pre-made ones. There is a multitude of quests and random events. Once in game, you can customize each military unit, from their traits to the armor and weapons they are wearing. There are literally hundreds of possible unit configurations.
<br>
<br>Sounds overwhelming, right? Well, it is. There&apos;s a price to pay when you&apos;re attempting to make a game that combines the best aspects of Civ, FF Tactics, and Baldur&apos;s gate. The game is quite difficult to understand, and there&apos;s no real tutorial, or even a campaign for that matter. if you&apos;re not one to learn as you go, this game is going to be difficult for you to get into.
<br>
<br>There are also serious balance problems when it comes to the tougher difficulties. Monsters might ignore the enemy AI units, while they focus yours, so they end up expanding to 5-6 cities while you&apos;re trying to build up an army to expand. Some leader/hero classes are weak, while others are incredibly strong (mages).
<br>
<br>If you love the genre, you will absolutely adore this game. it has its faults, but it&apos;s so incredibly complex and fun (if you like the genre) that it&apos;s easy to overlook them and spend hundreds of hours. You can easily put 50-60 hours alone into designing armies and units. If i was rating this game on how much fun i&apos;ve had, I would definitely give it a 10/10. However, if I&quot;m being as unbiased as possible, I would give it an 8/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4115797">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>From the view of RPG part, it is fairly good - plenty of chests, quests and some interesting monsters. And it has pretty good tech tree to unlock and further develop your city,army. The hero enchantment system  is similar to Warlock-Master of the Arcane, but city enchantment make the resource of essence become overpower.
<br>
<br>The true problem this game failed to solve is undeveloped battle system.
<br>1 ATB:  it is quite simple and traditional ATB, no action delay or attack delay and only a few powerful magics need casting time.  One ting make quite uncomfortable is that it didn&apos;t highlight the current action unit and sometimes its hard to distinguish which one in on move when you get a big army. And the other thing is that there are only a few skill/magic that could affect/delay your foes action or your own, which make the whole ATB not that valuable since most of time you don&apos;t need to care it.
<br>
<br>2 Range Unit: Unlike most of other game, range atk unit(archer and mage) is naturally weak due to the initiative punishment and low damage from their weapon.  Although all range units can attack any enemy in the battle map regardless of the distance,  they still won&apos;t become your main DPS since higher initiative unit have the more chance to attack and do damage. Btw, mage unit cant cast any kind of magic but just do magic type damage.
<br>
<br>3 Magic: I don&#x2018;t really enjoy current design of magic trait tree, which split summon from elements. And if we accept that, then what&apos;s the point of designing those spells that have casting range of ONE- wanna let our hero cast and die? And one more pain issue is that most earlier tactical spells are useless, I mean it won&apos;t really affect your battle(one exception is heal spell), especially when you haven&apos;t get a coupe of same kind of shard. And thus most useful spell need a damn cast time.
<br>
<br>Therefore, you almost cant win fight with weak army in the earlier or even mid game, whatever the battle tactic you can apply. While in the late game, maybe only the overpowered AOE spell can shine not your tactic.
<br>
<br>This is what I feel after about 50h play. It didn&apos;t challenge me a lot in the battle field.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=3978836">Expand</a></span>

<br>Basically what Heroes of Might and Magic 4, 5 and 6 should have been.
<br>Everything is good about this game.
<br>It is a fusion of Masters of Magic and Heroes of Might and Magic. A great idea, and successfully produced! Too many have great ideas and come out with a crappy game, but not these guys! :)

The combat maps is so simple that it yield little fun in tactic choice - either your army suit the ground or suffer huge losses, for example, your ranged units can easily dominant a fight in a mini map with sufficient obstacles to prevent enemy units from reach you or just get mauled by some bears on a flat map.

The RPG part is good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallen-enchantress-legendary-heroes/user-reviews?user_review_id=4520333">Expand</a></span>
