All that is fun to do is basically the free-running, and even that gets boring at sometime. I like the concept, but it is just too repetitive to be a good game.</span>

Great controls and story, the enemies need some more voices, but that&apos;s alright. The thing I don&apos;t like is that the structure of the missions is repetitive, and sometimes the dialog is too long. Other than that, it is a good game to buy. 9 out of 10 is what I give it.</span>

Highly recommended, provided you have a gamepad and the hardware to support it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2292314">Expand</a></span>

Basically, you play as a 21st century person who uses a machine to relive the life of his ancestor-Altair, an assassin in the 12th century. Altair messes up a mission and is demoted in his assassin guild. In order to regain his high rank Altair is tasked by his master to assassinate a number of Templars-his guild&apos;s mortal enemies, including their grand master. The story has an interesting conclusion-I&apos;ll leave it at that. The gameplay is fluid and amazing. My only real criticisms are that the NPCs don&apos;t do much else other than walk around and utter the odd sentence. Also, most of the time you simply duel your target face-to-face, rather than employing skill to take them out stealthily. Overall, a great game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2561115">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunate fact of the matter is keyboard and mouse controls are rather bad. But if you&apos;re set with a controller there&apos;s a bunch of cool stuff here. Ubisoft made a huge emphasis on controls in this game. Just from pressing your left analog stick at different intensities, there are around 4 different walking animations, and then there&apos;s another animation for running once you hit the &quot;high profile&quot; button. This allows you to seamlessly transition between movement speeds for incredibly tight and precise controls. This ties in beautifully with the game&apos;s focus on parkour style gameplay. Climbing up Jerusalem&apos;s tallest buildings and beholding the surrounding view is an amazing experience.
<br>
<br>Sadly, the game does suffer from lack of variety in combat and missions. Not enough to spoil the experience though. Between the controls, the gritty atmosphere and plot, and the environments, there&apos;s quite a lot to enjoy. here A real step forward for action platformers in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2570252">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Unfortunately this game is very repetitive. Basically every mission is exactly the same and every map has the same scripted things you need to do and can do. This gets old somewhere around third mission. I originally expected something more like Thief series. Optional side quests like &quot;collect zillion flags around the map, to get nothing concrete&quot; also don&apos;t help.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s also mind boggling why we need convoluted double plot. You see, all the assassin stuff actually happens inside this guy&apos;s head who is kidnapped by some organization in present time and placed inside machine that can play his &quot;genetic memory&quot;. I really can&apos;t see any relevance or added value between this and the game&apos;s central idea of being medieval assassin. Granted that I didn&apos;t finish the game so I don&apos;t know if it starts to make sense at some point.
<br>
<br>All in all, the game is ok. Unfortunately, there are tons of better ways to spend your time than this game. It offers nothing exceptional or memorable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3242229">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a stunningly realised Medieval world, and the first few missions are breathtaking. Hearing the characters speak, negotiating crowds, and running up walls and climbing is just pure joy. The draw distance is good and I was worried that my PC wouldn&apos;t cope (ports of console games tend to be badly optimised). But my year-old MacBook Pro could play everything on max settings and it simply looks superb. But I&apos;m only going to play halfway through this game because of what everyone else has been saying: the repetition, which is starting to pall. A real shame, because such a detailed and believable world deserves a more developed gameplay dynamic. And the main character Altair is simply arrogant and American (the American accent didn&apos;t exist in 1191AD, but of course it is Desmond being projected into that world as an avatar; but still, why make the protagonist cheesily American like every other action hero?). Definitely worth seeing and playing, but not worth 40.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=416029">Expand</a></span>

You should only plan to buy this for PC if you have a computer capable of taking advantage of the graphics vs a console and if you have a controller (the game instantly recognized my Logitech Rumblepad 2). The PC controls are beyond awful. Controls aside, this game had some good ideas for assassination but could have been executed much better. Every aspect in the game is repetitive. All three cities you explore look exactly the same. The AI citizens same the exact same things, perhaps in a different accent. The missions you do are indistinguishable from the other. Saving citizens, finding flags, chasing people down, everything you do in the game is pretty much restricted to those few actions. This wouldn&apos;t be so much of a problem if the story was good, but it&apos;s not. While getting to the end was intense, the long middle was just hunting down an evil person, killing them and viewing their cinematics, then repeat. You meet no indistinguishable characters and everything gets REALLY boring, REALLY fast. I can only think of one reason to recommend anyone to play Assassin&apos;s Creed, and that is to play Assassin&apos;s Creed II. While it&apos;s not mandatory to play it to understand AC2&apos;s backstory, it&apos;s nice to be less confused in the game. And believe me, AC2 fixes EVERYTHING from the first game, and adds so much more. Assassin&apos;s Creed II alone, makes the first game worth playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1390135">Expand</a></span>

Even the lowest settings are great! The story is about a dude. In 2012 he has been held in captivity by a mad scientist. He puts the dude in sort of a time machine (or what the hell it is) called Animus. You actually control the dude. The environment is massive and you can go wherever you want. You will be in Middle East and there is a village, a big kingdom, and three cities - Jerusalem, Damascus and Acre. There are there three areas in each city - rich class people area, medium class people area and poor class people area. All those things are nice but sadly, that you do the same thing over and over again. There are some bugs too. Two or three times I fell out of the graphics. The good thing is that you can climb walls, jump from roof to roof etc. The controls are a bit confusing but you will get used to them.<br><br>Graphics: They are awesome 10/10<br>Sound: I usually play and don&apos;t listen to sounds<br>Gameplay: 7/10 because of the repetitive gameplay<br>Story: Great but confusing 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1657927">Expand</a></span>

It puts the player in a setting in the 12th century, during king Richard the Lionheart&apos;s crusades. The player takes on a role of an assassin Altair, who is part of a secret group of assassins. The game offers a free roaming gameplay and takes place in 4 cities, as well as a countryside in between those. The graphics are very rich, with stunning environments, the locations are well designed, and the quests are pretty fun, even though somewhat repetitive after a while. My favourite thing about Assassin&apos;s Creed is its fantastic combat mechanic. I can fight guards day in day out and not get bored of it, because there are a number of moves you can perform in combat, with the most addictive one being counter attacks, which can instantly kill an attacking enemy if timed well. And if you aren&apos;t up for a fight, you can play a cat and mouse game with the guards, run through the city streets, dodging civilians, jumping through merchant stands and eventually disappearing in a good hiding place. There are only 5-6 different types of quests which you have to do in every city and every city district, but they do get more challenging as you progress through the game. At the end of each set of sidequests you have to assassinate a certain corrupt leader, and even though that&apos;s a repetitive structure to a game, you still face a different challenge with each leader (for example one you might need to chase, another one to face in battle, third one to stealthly kill, etc). The storyline maybe isn&apos;t anything special, but it&apos;s not exactly bad either. It&apos;s predictable to a degree, but it&apos;s not stale. Repetition might be one issue in the game, but I don&apos;t mind it so much, so long as the game is fun. However there are a couple of issues I wasn&apos;t too fond of. First one was that it took a while to get used to the controls. The fact there are separate buttons for each limb and a button for a high profile stance can get confusing in the beginning. Another problem that brought the game down a bit was that whenever you entered an area where a cinematic had to occur, you would suddenly not be able to do anything apart from walking until the cinematic triggers. This means that if you tried to enter through a roof, you basically wouldn&apos;t be able to jump down and would be stuck on a ledge. Other than those few issues the game is good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1706011">Expand</a></span>

I bought it a week or so ago, and have had about 10 hours play time with it now, won&apos;t be long either, till it is completed, at least with regards to the main story line.<br><br>The graphics, for 2008 are very good, but, ofcourse, compared to todays standards they&apos;re not really that great, at all. Especially the character models and animations can sometimes have me cringing in my shoes, but I&apos;ll survive. The scenery, and the &quot;finish&quot;, the aesthetics, are wonderful, though. I like the &quot;dirty&quot; look/feel to the game graphically, and it conveys a proper sense of atmosphere to the time period. Textures could be bumped up, alot, though.<br><br>Sound and VA works fine, but the lip synch is nothing special, at all. This generation has featured, even older games, with better synching than this. All in all though, it works, but its not getting a 10/10 based on sound, VA and synching though.<br><br>Gameplay wise it is pretty repetitive, listen to this guy, do this guy&apos;s challenge, pickpocket that guy, beat up the third guy and boom you are set to assassinate someone who will give you another piece to the storyline. So far, for me, the story line does seem quite intriguing, which is, as far as I see it (in this day and age) the one reason to play this game now. Especially seeing as Assassin&apos;s Creed II, Brotherhood and Revelations and the future Assassin&apos;s Creed III builds onto this storyline.<br><br>Combat is a bit odd if I have to be honest. Yes you can hit someone with the sword, or stab someone with your hidden knife. If you are discovered, well, hold down right mouse button and stare at the screen until an enemy attacks you, then press left mouse button, and said enemy will either die or be out of combat for a while. You will be pretty much unkillable with right mouse button held, and left mouse button will kill people for you. It is rather simplistic, and would have worked fine, with a few more kill animations. There are quite a few, but you see them soooo often that they get tedious in the end. The first few times are very awesome though.<br><br>Camera angling and control is horrible, it sometimes just does whatever the hell it wants to do and your sat wondering &quot;wtf?&quot; that is pretty much all there is to say to it.<br><br>By 2008 standards it might have been an 8 or 9/10, by todays standards it would barely scrape a 7, but then again, for the money it costs these days, there are quite alot of fun to be had, and the story is pretty good. So 7/10 from me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1840175">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, it seems there were some large growing pains with this first incarnation of the franchice. I have to agree with others who point out the repetitiveness of the missions once you get past the first three memories. The amount of time I have to spend synchronizing viewpoints and such just to unlock yet more-of-the-same types of missions is frankly exhausting. I can forgive the terrible combat controls and copy/paste generic NPC&apos;s everywhere, but if a game can&apos;t at least keep me entertained and wanting to see what happens next, it&apos;s just not worth it.  Also worth noting is how wooden and unemotional Altair sounds throughout most of the game. The &quot;animus translation&quot; excuse just isn&apos;t sufficient for him to feel very out of place when compared to almost any of the other characters, whose performances are much more realistic. The modern-day exposition concerning Lucy and Abstergo is worth getting to hear, but not nearly good enough to save the rest of the game from being tedious and uninteresting. If you&apos;re a die-hard AC fan, you&apos;ll probably want it in your collection. Whether or not you&apos;ll be able to finish it is another question entirely.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2539107">Expand</a></span>

<br>Gr&#xE1;ficamente el juego resulta notable para su &#xE9;poca, a pesar de que su edici&#xF3;n de PC podr&#xED;a haber sido mejor. Sobre todo dejaban mucho que desear la calidad de las sombras, el AA (mejorable con herramientas externas) y la distancia de renderizado, sobre todo esta &#xFA;ltima resultaba bastante inc&#xF3;moda para un jugador de PC, nada acostumbrado a que las texturas carguen a cinco metros. Por lo dem&#xE1;s el juego puede obtener un 7/10 en calidad gr&#xE1;fica.
<br>
<br>La banda sonora es sublime, ambientando completamente la inmersi&#xF3;n en la &#xE9;poca a experimentar.
<br>
<br>La jugabilidad es lo m&#xE1;s pecaminoso de este juego, no valen excusas del tipo &quot;es un juego de 2008&quot;. El juego es de lo m&#xE1;s repetitivo que he podido jugar en mi vida, una vez completada la introducci&#xF3;n, el juego comienza a repetirse una y otra vez, haciendo siempre lo mismo, solo que con personajes distintos y en un  ambiente distinto. A pesar de que la f&#xF3;rmula del sigilo/asesinato resulta novedosa y divertida, cuando comienza a repetirse empiezas a odiarla. Adem&#xE1;s intentan meter un peque&#xF1;o sistema de sandbox que por suerte puedes comenzar a saltarte m&#xE1;s adelante, porque solo consigue aburrirte y agobiarte a&#xFA;n m&#xE1;s. Hay un solo tipo de misi&#xF3;n principal, que se va repitiendo, y tres tipos de misiones principales, que se van repitiendo tambi&#xE9;n.
<br>
<br>La historia es lo que salva un poco al juego, es algo nuevo, usar la historia ya contada de la humanidad como herramienta narrativa, quien dir&#xED;a que un juego tipo documental hist&#xF3;rico podr&#xED;a ser tan enganchante. Y aunque en este juego no lo veremos en su esplendor, el final nos garantiza que los juegos que vendr&#xE1;n, ser&#xE1;n algo m&#xE1;gico.
<br>
<br>En definitiva, es un juego que deseas pasarte r&#xE1;pido para poder llegar al desenlace de la historia y disfrutar de lo &#xFA;nico bueno que tiene este juego, su gui&#xF3;n. Por suerte, algunos ejecutivos decidieron seguir adelante con el segundo juego, y dar pie a una de las mejores sagas de videojuegos que existen. Porque si por este juego fuera, nadie creer&#xED;a que podr&#xED;a venir lo que despu&#xE9;s vino, y que mirando a posteriori podemos ver.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4801745">Expand</a></span>

Assassin creed is fun with it&apos;s unique fighting style, art work, mechanics. BUT it has it&apos;s flaws from not properly saving to clunky jumping, lack of weapons, attack animations, and terrible repetitive gameplay forcing you to find and do boring things like climbing tall towers, pick pocketing that seems so bland and useless, than you realize everything is copy and pasted. The story feels awkward, with no immersion everything you do in the game you do in the first coupe of hours.
<br>
<br>The game sometimes forgets weather you want to jump down or go up and bugs out  on some of the simplest climbing movements. Some games didn&apos;t save properly, and some broken missions caused me to restart several times.
<br>
<br>Also 4 a Assassin game, no stealth is ever needed for the main missions whats up with that?
<br>
<br>The dialogue beside the main assassinations are all repeats just like the buildings, gets old pretty quick.
<br>
<br>I can see why people like this creed, I do not.
<br>
<br>I like the concept of the game, like most it failed horribly at keeping me entertained.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=5356701">Expand</a></span>

I didn&apos;t realize this is a trilogy with a long story. I figured it was just run and gun. Intrigued for AC2. I stalled out on this game in chapter 2 of 7, mostly due to the repetition, but got going again after seeing an AC4 trailer. Took about 24 hours total to get through the game. This is a pretty good stealth game, which is in my wheel house. The combat is fun, but a bit non-intuitive and timing dependent. After you get the hang of it though you pretty much can&apos;t loose.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3616910">Expand</a></span>

Now, Assassin&apos;s Creed is the second best looking AC game, for my opinion, but It&apos;s not the best. The game can feel repetitive at times, and It haves some glitches. But, this game kicks asses, means that it&apos;s great. 83 out of 100</span>

The game play is entertaining for a short time, the player only has skills of combat, but no perks or other tactics that employs the assassin, in other words has very limited capabilities.The game has no re playability, and has no Multiplayer.So far seen few bugs.The story and the main characters are good, make you keep playing.</span>

A lot of people complain about it being repetitive, shallow, boring, etc. and I can understand how they can say that. However I really enjoyed the freedom of movement and beautiful scenery. It&apos;s like you&apos;re a Middle Ages Batman! With time travel! I would&apos;ve picked up the sequel on launch day if it wasn&apos;t for the overbearing DRM.</span>

The storyline is a bit controversial but it unfolds in an amazing fashion as you are transported back and forth in time to relive the &quot;memories&quot; of your assassin ancestors. The developers took great pains to faithfully recreate the Holy Lands during an early crusade and bring times and places to life. One of my favorite parts of this game was simply scaling the large building and taking in the historic scenery. The controls were amazing, IMO, even with the mouse and keyboard. The ability to scale nearly every building, leap from the highest heights, and fight crowds of soldiers, all with an amazing fluidity and a profoundly deep level of control makes this one of the most enjoyable games you will ever play. I can agree with those who found the game a bit repetitive at times, particularly if you do the storyline first and then go back to try to get full synchronization; however, if you take your time and do all the side quests in an area before moving on to the next part of the storyline, it really isn&apos;t too bad. The only reason this game doesn&apos;t get a full 10 out of 10 is because once you finish the storyline, which doesn&apos;t feel rushed or too short, you really have no reason to play it again. It&apos;s like watching a great movie that you feel totally satisfied to have watched, but have no interest in watching again... sure you really look forward to the sequel, but you aren&apos;t going to do the first one over since you know how it is going to end and there is nothing new or exciting the second time around.    .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2788686">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It somewhat fufilled it&apos;s role as a &quot;historical adventure, open-world game&quot;, but unfortunately leaves out the &quot;stealth&quot; aspect away in the dirt.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s a list of pros and cons from my 16 hours of experience with the game:
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>+ Great looking graphics for a 2007/2008 game
<br>+ Game mechanics isn&apos;t really choppy, although the character sometimes get stucked in foliages and invisible floors/walls, but other than that, it still gets the job done, decently.
<br>+ Detailed character modelling, costumes are looks realistic and well-detailed.
<br>+ Missions usually relate to the plot directly, no twist and turns around a corner or two.
<br>+ Plot was intriguing and epic.
<br>+ At least 16-18 hours of non-stop gameplay spent completing just on the story.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>- Repetitive mission types, lacks creativity.
<br>- Artificial Intelligence coding feels half-assed, e.g. enemy A.I falling off buildings, not retaliating frequently to attacks, not noticing &quot;stealth assassinations&quot; when closeby.
<br>- Side missions (or known as &quot;memories&quot;) are completely useless and takes a long time to complete.
<br>- Game stablility issues. E.g. unable to start the game, game crashing frequently.
<br>-  Checkpoints feels non-existent.
<br>- Stealth doesn&apos;t really work all that well in this game.
<br>- Cliffhanger ending was disappointing. Adruptly ended with poor execution methods.
<br>
<br>To sum it up, this game is worth a shot at. I did enjoy this game a ton during the 16 hours of playtime. Good way to start up the storyline of the series to the future games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4070117">Expand</a></span>

One thing that is even remotely bad is quitting the game. It takes over a minute to exit the memory and the animus then quit the game. You cant skip cutscenes but usually they are so big of a deal you possibly cannot play without them, most of them are interactive so you can still do something while watching them. You get used to the keyboard controls very soon but it is clear that they didn&apos;t think of the mouse. the game has good graphics for it&apos;s age. The experience is intresting after memory block 1 and 2. The assassinations are really difficult if you don&apos;t exactly know what you are doing (one instance: I didn&apos;t play for a while and started playing right before an assassination and got killed over 20 times). the game is well balanced you are really agile and have to fight against a lot of enemies. Counter attacks may even be the most important thing in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3231151">Expand</a></span>

Certain civilians (Beggars and lepers, specifically) keep bugging you. So much so that I had to actually parkour out of the way whenever I saw one approaching. The combat can be rather tedious, although new moves you gain after each assassination do help to relieve that. But the biggest problem I have with this game would be the missions, which often end up being the same.
<br>
<br>Yet with all of these qualities, it still stands as a good game, not only for it&apos;s great visuals and music, but also because with each mission you can actually understand who the victim is, why you&apos;re killing him, and how he could see what he was doing as a good thing; something that most modern shooters miss entirely. It also gives a great sense of character development as the main character actually undergoes a major change throughout the story, as those around him begin to notice.
<br>
<br>TL;DR  Assassin&apos;s Creed has it&apos;s flaws, but is a great game, overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3240782">Expand</a></span>

The story will keep you intrigued and keeps you moving forward. Planning the Assassination of each of your targets is interesting, as you have to do investigation to find out more about them. Such as how to infiltrate the building they are currently in, the location of guards, why the target is there, places to climb to get a nice view of the target.
<br>This game will keep completionist occupied, as to get %100 you have to kill 60 Templars, and get a set of flags from each of the three main cities.
<br>You can find secrets in areas in the game that will reveal parts of story you might miss completely.
<br>
<br>The story is odd, and is a little original but it may have been done before. I don&apos;t want to give anything away. But you most of the time you play as Altair, or &apos;The son of none&apos;, who has to assassinate nine targets in three cities in each district of that city (poor, middle, rich). Each memory block contains an assassination (1/2/3).
<br>Memory Blocks are split up so you can get story bits in between, out of the animus.
<br>
<br>Part of the game takes outside of the animus, which can read memories of your ancestors. Altair is the ancestor of Desmond Miles, a bartender. The animus can read his DNA to access Altair&apos;s memories. Like I said I am not going to spoil anything, but this game will interest you.
<br>
<br>Buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3796801">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_4848480"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">So, I recently got assassins creed 3 as it was bundled with these new headphones I bought. It was probably one of the best games I had ever played. So I decided to play though from the start of the series and become a dedicated pc fan.
<br>
<br>The story was fairly good in my opinion, great character development with some twists and turns along the way. But the actual gameplay was realy a bad exeriance.
<br>
<br>The game is split into I think 7 total memory blocks, you must go through each one in order to finish the game, the problem is, They&apos;re all essentially the same. you talk to a guy, he tells you to do 3 missions before you can assassinate the main bad guy. You have to do this up to three times in each memory block and it really starts to get repetitive.
<br>
<br>Another major flaw with gameplay is the free running system, it&apos;s fairly nifty and is actually quite fun..... When it works. I find that I am constantly havering to climb th same wall again because the camera angle was slightly off and the character jumped off the wall only to lose half his health and be killed by the persuing Templars on the ground. The free running in this game was so bad that I found myself rage quitting often just because i couldn&apos;t synchronise the surroundings to continue with the game due to the consant falling or slow climbing.
<br>
<br>Some may not agree with the last paragraph, but i can assure my keyboard works perfectly fine with games such as bioshock, team fortress 2 and titanfall. Anyway, the last problem I had with the game is the map. it is really annoying to use as she you select to only see primary objectives, it then switches back to all objectives once you leave the menu, not only that. But in order to progress you must essentially write the entire map of the world on your own, and I&apos;m pretty sure during the game you are given a map of the town you are in multiple times.
<br>
<br>I have played some of the later assassins creed games and they fixed a lot of these problems, but I&apos;m really surprised the franchise has been this successful with this game being the one that started it. It truely was a pain to get through and I am never going to play it again, nor am I recommending to anybody I come across.
<br>
<br>Thank god it&apos;s over now, I can start playing assassin&apos;s creed 2. XD</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4848480">Expand</a></span>

De la mano de los que trajeron los &#xFA;ltimos juegos de Prince of Persia, llega este interesante t&#xED;tulo sobre un protagonista perteneciente a una hermandad de asesinos en los tiempos de 1191. La historia es muy interesante y atrapante, el cual te tendr&#xE1; atada/o por continuarla. Lamentablemente, junto con su jugabilidad cae en lo repetitivo, ya que tendr&#xE1;s que hacer todo lo mismo durante todo el transcurso del juego: encargos de asesinatos, descubrir nuevas ciudades, realizar misiones secundarias, enfrentamiento con un jefe, todo esto esto est&#xE1; metido en un c&#xED;rculo repetitivo hasta el final del juego, lo cual es un poco decepcionante. Gr&#xE1;ficamente se ve bien, tampooco es la gran cosa, pero no son nada malos. Tiene una buena ambientac&#xED;on de las localizaciones de aquella &#xE9;poca. En el apartado sonoro los efectos de sonidos son muy buenos, y el doblaje al espa&#xF1;ol se deja escuchar. Y musicalmente el juego es bueno, aunque hace m&#xE1;s presencia en momentos que ponen tenso al jugador. En conclusi&#xF3;n puedo decir que es un muy buen juego, pero el &#xFA;nico defecto que le veo es lo bastante repetitivo que logra ser. Si para t&#xED; esto no es un problema, puede que lo disfrutes a&#xFA;n m&#xE1;s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6344043">Expand</a></span>

<br>Positives:

<br>Negatives:
<br>- Extremely repetitive process: go to bureau, climb buildings to get sight of event points, solve events, get information, go to bureau, take down the target, run away, go back to the Mualim.
<br>- Desmond&apos;s story line is completely boring.
<br>- That ending...

The storyline is reasonable, but nothing to write home about. It pretty much spoils itself before it&apos;s halfway through. The &apos;random&apos; banter from NPCs is highly repetitive, most of them have only one or two sentences which they repeat over and over again. Which gets really annoying after a while. This annoyingness is matched easily by the behaviour of the NPCs, drunkards and beggars will only harrass the player. I ended up getting killed several times by a drunkard who for no reason at all lashed out and pushed me into the water. No guards or any NPC seems to care about the violent behaviour displayed by these drunkards, though if you fight back the heat will be on like there&apos;s no tomorrow. NPC guards in mini-game missions will instantly know where you are and of your intentions the second you &apos;lock&apos; on to them, regardless of how stealthy your approach was. This completely negates the option of using the throwing knifes to get a free kill on these mini-games. I find this a rather immersion breaking issue. The controls leave the most to be desired though. Clearly it is a console port and the controls will constantly remind you of this fact. AWSD only allows for movement in 4 absolute directions, where in combat it is often needed to be able to &apos;move&apos; diagonally or else the game will lock onto a different target and ruin your combo. The same goes for getting around the towns, in freerun mode the game decides when to jump, how far to jump and will adjust your direction to accommodate the jump it wants you to make. This will often lead to frustrating gameplay where the character either jumps too far or onto the wrong object killing the momentum of your run. Even when playing with a gamepad the controls feel unresponsive and like you&apos;re not the one in control of your character. Yet despide this &quot;AI&quot; controlling where and when you jump it&apos;s more than happy to let you jump to your doom, even though you have already changed directions or let go of the freerun mode entirely. I&apos;d give it a 8 for graphics and animations, a 5 for the storyline, a 2 for immersion and a 1 for the controls. All in all, I give it 4 out of 10. Sorry, but lavish graphics do not make up for such poor controls and poor NPC behavior.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=412207">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are well done, no doubt about that, assets, clothes, armour and architecture put you back into the time of crusades without too many fantasy like touches -- as an upcoming reenactor I found this very inspiring!<br>+++<br>Game controls are a joy to play with. While many jump&apos;n&apos;run games fail to guide you along thin beam or on critical jumps, you really have to force your character off, which can be done quite well after a little practice. As mentioned before this sometimes gets into your way when your character automatically grabs ladders or beams to climb, while you actually want to run/fall/whatever.<br>+++<br>The fighting system is nice in terms of animations and feeling, but it is way too easy. While you are able to draw attention at you by an entire crusaders encampment you may get surrounded by 20 knights in a &quot;circle of death&quot;, meaning you only fight one enemy at a time. Despite the honor of your enemies you will never get attacked when lying on the ground after you made a bad turn. You can use instant kill counterattacks efficiently after the first few fight leaving no challenge to such situations!<br>+++<br>As an assassin your job is to kill hits (people of influence, nobles, etc.) and nothing is more useful but having some clues on your hit before you strike. The game does not only offer clues, it forces you to collect them by playing repeating mini games. Even failing at those mini games is not a loss as you may retry as many times as you like -- so no pressure. After all clues you get are not only things you already know or you get to know -- at least while you try to find your &quot;contacts&quot; for the clues -- but they also have no impact on how you will strike! There usually is only one way in, no way to really prepare your strike and no way to strike silently. It always ends in a &quot;honorable&quot; fight (mentioned above) so you could rush right through if you didn&apos;t had to do those (now) pointless mini games....<br>+++<br>As mentioned before AI behavior only focuses on the player and gets really annoying as you -- the one in a robe wandering with the monks -- are literally attacked by beggars in a place crawling with nobles wearing silk more worth than half of the city.<br>+++<br>The story of Assassin&apos;s Creed has a nice idea inside. In good story telling characters called &quot;shapeshifter&quot; are the ones who betray you, fooling you to have worked for the wrong side after a long way, but still leaving you -- the player -- fooled as well when done well. Assassin&apos;s Creed tries that as well, leaving hints by each hit that you are fooled and if you have an IQ greater than a stone you will get it at least after the 3rd hit. This would not be the problem if there were not 6-7 more! From this point on I was not that motivated very much as I -- the character -- had to do things I -- the player -- didn&apos;t really want to do.<br>+++<br>I kept playing until the final punch in the face: You finally know what the master plan was behind everything in this game, but then suddenly be left alone in solitary, able to walk around, use &quot;the machine&quot; or literally find &quot;the game&apos;s credits on a wall&quot;. The game has no satisfying ending, keeping you -- the player -- eager to continue right there. You may call it &quot;cliffhanger&quot; but it felt like someone ran off with the bag of money two month before the game was finished....<br>+++<br>CONCLUSION: The game is fun for one or two hours with so many ideas BUT looses depth quickly, like a teaser shooting all golden moments of a movie. As a &quot;pilot&quot; of a series it failed to get me....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2253642">Expand</a></span>

I would like everyone that complains about the controls to read the reccomended specs for this game.. Yes a xbox360 gamepad makes all the difference in the world when playing this game and I highly reccomend everyone picking up a gamepad if they buy this game.</span>

It features a compelling story, great atmosphere, and fresh gameplay mechanics. I found the parts where you must control Desmond to be rather tedious, but thankfully they are relatively short and do at least help to build up the story. The actual heart of the game, playing as Altair the assassin, is plenty of fun. The world is fairly large and mostly open, so you can explore, cause havoc, or do missions largely at your own pace. The cities are beautiful and each have their own look and feel, whether it&apos;s the holy city of Jerusalem, the crusader fortress of Acre, or the Muslim city of Damascus. Unfortunately the game provides you with limited weapons (you don&apos;t have the luxury of crossbows or smoke bombs as in later games), and most major assassination missions end up in huge sword-fights or long desperate chases. Still, there&apos;s nothing quite like hearing the chase music pumping as you leap around rooftops trying to escape a horde of pissed guards!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2901161">Expand</a></span>

This game has a very good story line to it and i recommend playing it if you like stealth and assassinating games then this is the game for you. The story has a big twist at the end of it which keeps you on you feet. The end of the game really shows you about the continuing story from Assassin&apos;s Creed &amp; Assassin&apos;s Creed II via Desmond Miles. Although this is a great game i cannot deny that there are some problems in the gameplay. For example there are a few bugs that get annoying in the storyline, the fighting also has problems and the occasional glitch. But overall its a great game and i recommended it to those who love these types of games.

<br>The game, to me, still looks pretty good, comparable to the Ezio-ACs. They did a great job capturing the vibe of Jerusalem and the whole area back in the days of the crusades. It&apos;s colorful, with lots of detail, and I find that the cities especially do have a lot of atmosphere and do feel kinda alive.
<br>
<br>However, since this one started it all, and the other ACs build on it, there still is quite a lot of stuff missing here:
<br>- The freeclimbing/parcour is still quite clunky. Yes, mistakes can happen even in Unity, Syndicate and Rogue, but here, you will have accidents, it&apos;s guaranteed. The parcour isn&apos;t as &quot;safe&quot; and automated as it is in newer ACs, so you will have &quot;misjumps&quot;, where you don&apos;t reach a ledge and fall. It&apos;s not horrible, it&apos;s just a bit slower and way less safe than in modern ACs.
<br>
<br>- Combat can be tough especially against a group. Please stay patient. At first, Altair has all abilities, then loses them (because he gets demoted), and gets them back one by one. Once you have counterattack, you will have a much easier time dealing even with groups. Hold the block-button or key, and hit the counter attack at the right moment - instakill.
<br>Actually... even though I enjoyed the combat in, say, AC III, Rogue and Unity much more than I did enjoy this one, it still is more fun and feels less frustrating than it does in the abomination that is Syndicate with it&apos;s horrible, spammy and often unfair combat.
<br>
<br>- Abilites are not in yet. You don&apos;t have ropedarts, smoke bombs, firecrackers, mortars etc.
<br>Basically, you have your wristblade (which you can&apos;t fight with once you are in combat, so it&apos;s only for assassinations, killing unprepared enemies), a sword, a short blade, and later on a ranged weapon.
<br>You don&apos;t get health potions either (a bit like in AC III). So if you lose health, you can&apos;t recover it unless you flee. It recovers while you do, so you can retreat a bit, then turn around and kill your pursuers.
<br>
<br>- It&apos;s a bit shorter than modern ACs... but then again, it has less filler. YOu know the deal... tons of side stuff and collectibles. A bit of that is here, too, but not even remotely as much as in Unity or Syndicate.
<br>
<br>- There are a lot of cut scenes, and you can&apos;t skip them. Stay patient and enjoy the story.
<br>
<br>While it might feel weird to play this after more recent ACs, it still is a fun game with a great protagonist and a cool, albeit short story. Playing with a controller is very much recommended.
<br>It still has vibe and atmosphere, and it&apos;s great to see the story begin.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a fan of the franchise, you should at least try it, you can usually get this quite cheap. If you want to get into the series, AC II might be a better start, but this still is a solid, classic game and the start of a great series</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6526770">Expand</a></span>

First of all, the story is somewhat unique and interesting, both the Desmond and Altair parts. Gameplay is not that bad either, but those missions... Holy ****, aren&apos;t those missions a series of boredom sources... First of all, I must say that the assassination missions/main missions were very interesting and kind of challenging to do it sneakily. But the missions we had to do in order to unlock those missions were nothing but repetitive cancer. Here&apos;s a brief summary of the game: eavesdrop, pickpocket, fight some guards, assassinate the significant target. Cool, now all you need to do is to learn about the story and you can start the series from AC 2 !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-directors-cut-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6528980">Expand</a></span>
