<br>
<br>The game has some minor buffering issues. Controller input can be a little wonky, with your character turning around, rather than open a door.
<br>Other than that, I was - initially - somewhat disappointed by the puzzles. Going in expecting this to be a puzzle detective, I barely strained a brain cell for three quarters of it. All the puzzles are obviously telegraphed. Sneak up on the appropriate gaggle of Ne&apos;er-do-wells and they&apos;ll handily exposition you the specifications of their circuitous scheme and how to foil it.
<br>
<br>No matter how obvious though, the act of foiling these plans (or not!) managed to remain fun throughout. The game has oodles of style and atmosphere and just watching the life in the mansion tick down is a true joy. Uncovering the details of a plot, sneaking about the mansion, spying and applying your interesting and well implemented skills, gives you a very &quot;Thief&quot;-like feeling of being the voyeur and saboteur to this beautiful, intricate world. It&apos;s all there for you to outwit, and be privy to the various overlapping intrigues as they run through each other like ornate clockwork. The urge to undo a tied ribbon, lies mostly in how pretty the bow is. The Sexy Brutale is in that, one hell of a tantalizing knot in artwork, sound and snappy character design.
<br>
<br>Eventually, the intelligence of this game is found instead, in how it kept misdirecting my expectations. There were several moments where I thought I had the Sexy Brutale figured out, only for mounting dread to make me doubt, and then fear another theory.
<br>
<br>In the end, the game has one hell of a mind-boggling plot twist that makes everything feel like it made sense. I&apos;ll only say this: The storepage&apos;s tag of &quot;mystery/adventure&quot; suits Sexy Brutale best. Buy this game for the mystery, vague as that may sound, and I can promise you the inquisitive will be well rewarded with one hell of a journey.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sexy-brutale/user-reviews?user_review_id=7223720">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s just no excuse for a game  made in the second decade of the 21st century not to have a customizable inputs! God forbid if you happen to have an inadequate controller plugged in when launching the game. Some commands become plain non-existent and the game, of course, non-playable. After an extensive digging on the Internet I found out that the catch is to unplug the controller before attempting to play the game, and then you may actually use keyboard and mouse and have all of the inputs at hand (although some of them don&apos;t make a lot of sense). Well, I, for one, don&apos;t wan&apos;t to have to unplug my controller in order to play anything. I want to be able to choose whether I wish to use keyboard &amp; mouse or joystick and I want to be able to remap whatever **** of the input setup devs figured would do the trick. And I want it ON SPOT! No third party program, no searching the forums, no waiting for the fixes... These are the controls for the game, for Christ&apos;s sake! Waiting for patches and **** Are you kidding me?! The non-functioning game is in the market and it&apos;s getting a decent reviews?! Beyond idiotic! All paid critics! I don&apos;t give a **** that this is a small company and yadda, yadda, yadda... If you&apos;re gonna make the game, do it right or don&apos;t do it at all. This non-customizable crap with XBox control layout is just not acceptable anymore (if it ever was, in the first place)! Zero!

<br>
<br>The team who designed this, was truly genius hard workers. You could tell by the perfect fitting cinematic music and perfect logic to explain everything in the end and fantastic graphic/mechanism to keep your interests up every minute in the game.
<br>
<br>To sum up, it was a solid 15 hours that I was highly entertained/amazed by, the twist ending was even a greater highlight for it. Strongly recommend to all my friends if they enjoy more than TPF or FPS games. Seriously, give it a go!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sexy-brutale/user-reviews?user_review_id=7280889">Expand</a></span>

How is that a reflection of the game itself?  The game is decent, different and plays well.  I&apos;ve not put that much time into it but I wanted to get an early review in to counter ticroo&apos;s idiotic nonsense.</span>

I&apos;m still considering looking around the mansion to listen in on some dialog I may not have read yet.

<br>The concept is incredibly unique, design fantastic and the gameplay-wise execution almost perfect.
<br>
<br>The flaws are only minor - like not being able to rebind keys and the keyboard/mouse controls being very weird. It shows that the devs don&apos;t play much on PC and didn&apos;t bother to do research. And maybe one or two puzzles that I felt wasn&apos;t well-designed.
<br>I also would&apos;ve appreciated more challenge throughout the game. Because until almost the very end, puzzles are mostly straight-forward. Basically just find 1-2 key things, use them and you&apos;re done. Although I have to say - on the other hand, I think there was one case where that wasn&apos;t enough and I was wondering &quot;So what does the game want me to do?&quot;. I guess if they would&apos;ve done more complex puzzles, one would have to have some sort of &quot;clue progress indicator&quot;, especially since the player character moves very slowly and so one would spend ages just wandering around.
<br>
<br>Oh and they have a loading indicator that&apos;s not showing initially and it suffered from stuttering on my 7970 Ghz Edition card - which was able to play any game I&apos;ve thrown at it in recent years buttery smooth. (I don&apos;t play big budget games though)
<br>It seems like they released this game with no thought of support after release. Because the lack of graphics options and keyboard rebinding is a shame. Or maybe they simply haven&apos;t earned enough. Which may also in part be due to the tacky title that kept me from trying out the game for quite a while too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sexy-brutale/user-reviews?user_review_id=7505375">Expand</a></span>

It throws the player immediately into a stopwatch-based countdown that demands certain actions to be done very fast or the entire level resets, it leaves almost no room for careful exploration and to top it off even the dialogue text disappears automatically too fast without a proper chance to read all of it properly (and it doesn&apos;t even have voice acting)..
<br>
<br>Frankly, whoever created this game has to get some lessons from established adventure games, because you can not inflict to the player anxiety from the get go without leaving him any chance to explore in peace.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m sure there is a minority that will enjoy this game because all kinds exist, but I&apos;m fairly certain it will not be missed by most people, or at least when you do such an effort at least be top-notch on other venues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sexy-brutale/user-reviews?user_review_id=7256129">Expand</a></span>

Running around the mansion becomes annoying and repetitive. Like many indie productions unfortunately, this is yet another case of style over substance. It is not a completely bad game, just a mediocre game, with solid mechanics, that never delivers on its potential.</span>

The Sexy Brutale is sort of a backwards Cluedo, instead of finding out who is the murderer, the weapon and how he did it you are instead presented with the crime as it happens in real time before you can go back in time and prevent it from happening. And its premise is actually backed up by a good story and a well thought out lore, and it is a shame that I can&apos;t explore this further because it would be spoilers, and the kind of spoilers that shouldn&apos;t be revealed. Yes, it has its issues and it may feel weird the way that it plays, but The Sexy Brutale is the kind of short experience (5-10 hours depending on how much of the lore you want to find out) that is worth your time. If you are willing to pay 20$ on this kind of game or if you find it on sale, you should buy it. Avoid spoilers at all costs, you will not be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-sexy-brutale/user-reviews?user_review_id=7276747">Expand</a></span>
