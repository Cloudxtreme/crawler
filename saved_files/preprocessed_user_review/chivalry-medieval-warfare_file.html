What&apos;s nice, though, is that you don&apos;t have any players who headshot you before you can blink now, because it&apos;s the middle ages and you can&apos;t do that! What you do have is a cathartically fun first-person-slasher that is everything its predecessor (Age of Chivalry) was, made better by new voice-acting, better class/equipment organization, and the Unreal engine. There are a couple of bugs here and there, but nothing too drastic. Honestly, I can&apos;t give this game anything less than a 10 because I&apos;ve yet to find a better way to have fun with my computer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2717902">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is addictively fun and their are several gamemodes to enjoy- Team Objective, King of the HIll, Last Team Standing, Free for all and team deathmatch. My favorite is team objective, where team work is necessary to complete objectives to open next objectives and parts of the map on the way to total victory.
<br>
<br>I find myself laughing hysterically at the medieval mishaps that can happen. Play with a friend to double the laughter! Highly recommended. This game is one of a kind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2696998">Expand</a></span>

Amazing.  I never played the beta, and watched a trailer of the game on youtube and took the dive.  My god, did I chose the right decision!  This game is insanely fun to play, and the completely best part about it - combat is 100% skill based.  In a 1v1 situation, the better player will win every time, there is no &quot;rock-paper-scissors&quot; style like there is in WotR.  The combat is amazing, parrying/blocking/dodging your opponents attack feels immensely satisfying when you land that killing blow because of it.  This is old school server style, no match-making which makes it so you never feel a sense of community or whatnot, if you play on the same server all the time you&apos;re going to see familiar faces, and be on friendly terms with players.  This only leads to a more exciting experience because you will have grudge-matches against specific players, or find out you play well with another and can join up on the same team.  This is what makes a game last a very long time, and I think this game has a very good future ahead.  I also wanted to touch base with the tutorial - besides 2-3 misspelled words (that I caught) the way they did the tutorial is really rather fun.  I suggest everyone do everything in the tutorial before you join a multiplayer game because there are many tactics that they teach you which are needed to have a good online experience (stopping your attack by hitting q, leading to a &apos;trick-play&apos; for example).  If you&apos;re on the ropes about buying this game, I hope I helped you out a little bit.  They have also said they are going to release free DLC in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2699591">Expand</a></span>

The first few games I had I was totally confused with the controls (Even with prior experience with similar games), but after being explained the proper controls the game instantly became one of my favorites. The crashing and bugs are to be expected even after release due to being developed by a small indie developer. These problems are easily changed with a few hot fixes and patches which the team so far have been making quite frequently. As a user of Eyefinity, It requires a little configuration to work, which is actually way easier to setup then most games.

<br>
<br>First of all, the game looks great visualy and the gritty look is great! Sounds are on &apos;&apos;ok&apos;&apos;-tier in my opinnion. Controls on the other hand arent that great. Moving and attacks feel laggy, janky and really unpredictable. Attacks dont connect half the time, even when its a clear torso hit, blocks are so random, and the lack of directional blocking is a great miss, And its stupid when you block an greatsword attack (that has the weight of the sword + strenght of the attacked, plus the momentum behind it) with a small dagger. Your shield wont block attacks when its on your back, wait what. Yes you can have a humansized shield on your back and it wont protect you, yep.
<br>
<br>Game has a small unlock system, in which you kill players with a certain weapon to unlock a new weapon on the same tier. This has no place in the game on my opinion and the mod age of chivalry did this right, there was more classes in which the weapons were balanced out, here you only have 4 classes to choose from that have unlockable weapons.
<br>
<br>Game modes
<br>
<br>-FFA: total and utter **** imagine you are in a small 25meters x 25meters arena, with 31 other players, you spawn and you die 5 seconds later! Even if you manage to live the first 10 seconds and get into a duel, someone from behind will come and kill you with one swing to the head OR steal your kill.
<br>
<br>TDM: much more fun than FFA thats for sure. Still, its a mayhem if you wont be killed by enemies in 3v1 situacion youl get killed by that noob on your team that attacks with sweep attacks only.

<br>Objective: Its fun, on the defence, when you only have to walk 10 seconds into the objective when you respawn, attackers have to make a 1 minute run to the objective at the end of it. This mode could be fun if the attackers respawn would move as you go on, but no, it only moves when you complete the objective. This results in frustration, when you die, you respawn, then you run to your objective for 30-60 seconds only to find out that you are the only one there, aginst 3-6 defenders that murder you, rinse and repeat.
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>
<br>-Visualy nice looking game
<br>-Gritty and brutal
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-23 euros for a dumbed down mod
<br>-Controls, attacks and blocking feels janky and laggy
<br>-unlock system does not benefit anyone in anyway
<br>-Respawns are really ****ty for the attackers side on the objective mode</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2772587">Expand</a></span>

The combat is choppy and completely non-fluid, internet play is laggy, controls are worthless, cheesy soundtrack (at times), are just some of the many things horrible wrong here.

<br>Pros:
<br>Gore and Brutality are very high in Chivalry, adding a sense of realism and depth to the game.
<br>Ambiance: Battle cries echo the battlefield, screams of the dying are overwhelming, adding realism to the game.
<br>Game Modes: Chivalry posesses a lot of game modes. This adds variety to your playing.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Slow, Unresponsive melee combat
<br>Terrible hitboxes
<br>Glaring imbalances
<br>Terrible archery system
<br>It doesn&apos;t matter if you use a piercing, blunt, or slashing weapon, the penetrate armor all the same.
<br>Servers rotate game modes every game, so you have to leave and rejoin another server if you want to keep playing your favorite game mode.
<br>Lastly, the in-game class selection is TERRIBLE. You have to re-select your weapons every time you want to change a class. This gets annoying very quickly.
<br>
<br>Final verdict: 4/10
<br>I would buy it for $5, but any more than that, it is simply not worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2816348">Expand</a></span>

It has very little depth, terrible balance, and fights are won by the person who have the highest mouse sensitivity and can drag their overhead downwards faster than the other or are fine with feinting, or extreme dragging. Hit detection is awful and clunky. You can stab past someone and then slowly move your weapon into them after they blocked and deal the full damage, while they have no way of knowing you were going to miss or have any way of blocking, because instead of using a Pirates Vikings &amp; Knights/Mount &amp; Blade-type blocking system, they decided to make a boring 1-button system, where you RMB to block any and all attacks, but can only do it for a small amount of time. Knights can just sprint around, not even looking at you and feint attack you or do extreme drags/reverse overheads hitting you instantly, regardless of being out of stamina. They will only become staggered if they need to parry, which they don&apos;t really have to when they&apos;re sprinting and have a faster or more powerful weapon than you and can either kill you in one hit (the Maul can kill you instantly) or just hit you a bunch of times with a spammy facehug weapon. As a side note, the reverse overhead is an attack where you face away from your enemy, do an ordinary overhead attack, and before the weapon goes over your head you hit them, and they take full damage, as they would with an ordinary overhead attack. The effects of getting hit are terrible as well. They don&apos;t seem like an actual attack, more like just poking a naked man with a somewhat sharp stick. Any methodical combat is completely ruined by the ability of just feinting or dragging your attacks, completely ruining any fight. I tried to give the game a few more tries, but I just couldn&apos;t after they released the &quot;Elite knight pack,&quot; which adds new armor for $9 (per team, so it becomes $18 if you want to have your DLC more than half the time in a team battle), which makes sense to release now, especially because the game is so complete, with the quarterstaff and pole hammer not having its range parameter specified, and the occasional bug that causes people to literally be immortal, and completely unable to die (happened on several occasions). So, of course the first thing you should do is pay for customization. This game should have been in development for a much longer time, as it&apos;s clearly not finished. I lost all the respect for Torn Banner I ever had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=4141507">Expand</a></span>

I got it on sale but knowing how awesome this game is I&apos;d pay full price. I&apos;ve so far only put 5 hours in. I have played a couple team games but I normally hit up the all for all type. The weapon leveling system is really cool too as it allows me to go out of my comfort zone of weapons I prefer and try out others.

This game has very unresponsive controls and several working mechanics, which make the playstyle very cumbersome. This makes the entire playstyle very wonky... I would often find myself unable to hit anything... sometimes I would be right in someones face, crosshair on the chest and STILL missing. Other times, I would click the button several seconds before the initiation of the swing, only to find the fruits of my effort wasted because the other player would be able to dash in and hit me before I could connect.
<br>
<br>Overall, I had a horrible experience and I want my money back. If you have a lot of patience, free time, and money to burn, I guess give it a try. If you don&apos;t, save your money and go elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3968992">Expand</a></span>

The combat is quite deep, but no so complicated that you can&apos;t just jump in and start lopping off heads straight away (just avoid high ranked people).
<br>There&apos;s a good amount of game modes. FFA, Duel, TDM, Capture the Flag, Last Team Standing and the best mode, Team Objective which has teams competing to attack or defend many varied objectives, like burning a town and killing all the peasants, to dumping corpses in a cistern, to sieging a castle and killing the king!
<br>There 6 main weapons and 6 secondary weapons for each of the 4 classes to unlock, which won&apos;t take very long but will take a bit of dedication.
<br>The 4 classes all feel very different. There are archers, who use crossbows, bows, javelins and slings, speedy man at arms who use light one handed weapons and can dodge around the place. Vanguards have the longest reaching weapons, including polearms and can do special sprint attacks. Knights are the tankiest class, with some of the heaviest hitting weapons like the maul. They are also have bastard swords, which they can wield 2 handed or with a kite or tower shield.
<br>
<br>Very good game, I highly recommend to everyone, even if you&apos;ve not really touched the genre of First Person Slashers, because fresh meat is always good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3352177">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It is the most well thought out, put together game I&apos;ve played in a long time. Personally, it has infinite replay value and only gets more fun. There is blood, guts, exploding heads, fisting, and requires a ton of skill.
<br>
<br>I recommend this game to everyone I know who enjoys video games, and I&apos;ve heard no complaints yet!</span>

<br>Unfortunately the achievements are completely bugged out and some just cant be unlocked even if you have done whats required to earn them. The only other drawback is the lack of maps which can make game play a little stale after going through the same map time after time. All of this could be fixed by a patch and a little DLC (hopefully free)
<br>
<br>The game gets a 7 but with some new maps and the achievements fixed its easily an 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3245408">Expand</a></span>

I purchased the game in 2012 and played till summer of 2013. When I played in 2012 it was the bomb best game I had played in a while and by far the best community, then at the begging of the summer things were still great but not as good, people were still amazing and fighting system was good feints were balanced along with most weapons, only problem was people had found the reverse swing exploit and man of arms was to op. I think stopped the game for a series I liked even more total war (great series) and stopped playing chivalry. I came back this week and tried to play chivalry as total war required an update and I was too lazy to install it since it was a few gb large. I was devastated by what I saw. The game had gone form a amazing game that was the top of melee fighting games with the best fighting system I have ever seen to the most **** game if our time. The community had gone to something from CoD and the melee system was broken as **** Everyone was spamming feints running in circles and reverse hitting. I found out that the game has since became laggier do to updates involving new customisation and a rush of poor dlc&apos;s with ripoff prices. All weapons were unbalanced and op, claymore, poleaxe, great sword, bearded axe were so op it wasn&apos;t even funny,all maa weps were pretty op along with vg. Vg and Maa are only classes played anymore it seems and I can tell why, op,op,op,op,op dodge and stab spam from maa, and then super fast, long and maul lvl dmg weps from vg and their reach and speed allows them to run around opponents spam hits and avoid swings by running not to mention reverse overhead spam. the new animations are like stick figures. Also, I do not really get drags, players can now do 0-1mph swings to the toe and explode their opponents faces also counters from maa weps and vg weps are fast as **** and counter look down is just stupidly fast and need to be removes or they need to change it. To sum it up now this game fighting mechanics are crap the fluidity of the game is crap, the community is crap, and it even more crap because beside making all of those things worse nothing has been added I mean yes a few helms and wep paints that have nothing to do with the game, vg and maa must be nerfed to op so op where not fun to play with even let alone play against. The only reason why I did not give a 0 is because I think TB can still make the game better and the fact that a few good, nice players who are fun to fight are still around. To make me give this game a 9-10 which I would have in 2012 they need to change a few things. I would honestly play the game again if they did this: first change the animations and everything involving melee and blocking to who they were in 2012 block are too slow and if you panic or misclick I think you should have the chance to block again, this being said blocks need to be faster to block feints and I think this would be good. I think they need to add upon chivalry, take out the updates that are causing every server to lag, and add new weps, and give option to customise armour, also add more free helms like lvl 50 helm thing and such, and after certain level or achievement I think people should have the choice ti change the armour not just the helm this would be a big improvement. They also need to add new and better maps then the recent ones, however I do like the one where you have to burn a village, and pls pls pls add more maps made for duelling and scrims such as moor. I forgot to mention this but it would be amazing if the reset the animations and melee and block to how it was in 2012 just fix the bugs that there was in the animations in 2012. Where was I ah yes and if those things happened the good community would come back that I had learned to love not this **** community that is arguably worse the CoD. One more thing DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT remove glitches from maps as in ones were u can get to secret places but do not interfere with animations it is the only reason why I still play and it is quite fun to glitch to these secret places and more ppl enjoy it then you might think. Now I know that what I ask will never probably happen and will not be seen, even if it is seen I doubt that TB would listen to any of it since it would take so much effort and time to make these improvements to the game as it is now. I mean its just sad how they keep making it worse and worse each update how could they think it is better then it was in 2012 if you don&apos;t believe me just look at the other reviews 10 10 10 in 2012 and go lower as time passes.

<br>Gameplay/Opinion:
<br>The game starts off with the option to play the training mode (like most of these type of games do), choosing to play the training mode will put you at a training ground where knights are practicing with wooden people. The enviroment in the training mode is rather nice to look at, too bad this is the only part of the game where something looks like it had the most effort put into it. You start off with practicing the basic moves in the game with abilities to run, crouch, and attack, the attacking part seems to be more of a chore than the game teaching how to play the game. You are first taught to do the useless hand-to-hand combat before learning the basic sword moves, surprisingly fighting with the fists seems to be more accurate than hitting with a sword. After learning hand-to-hand combat, you are given a sword to train with, you are told to hit a wooden person learning the basic moves like side slash. stab, and blocking. After you are done with the sword, you are told to practice with two different sides, one is learning how to handle different melee weapons, and the other is learning how to use a bow and arrow. I found the most effective weapon was the bow and arrow, sure it has its problems, but I found it to be more effective than all the melee weapons I had learned how to use. So after training, you are asked to defeat a knight of the opposing side you are on, I was asked to use a melee weapon to defeat my opponent, the problem with this is the AI is so terrible that you will get defeated by your oppenent 2 or 3 times before you can defeat him, I would have rathered swallow the sword I was given instead of trying multiple times to defeat this guy. After defeating your opponent you are asked to board a ship, and that is where the training mode ends.
<br>
<br>After boarding the ship, I was thrown back to the main menu to choose the game mode I wanted to play, it offers simplistic game modes like capture the flag, deathmatch, and defend your base, I chose to play capture the flag. Once a game mode has been picked you are thrown into the game with random players you don&apos;t know playing the game and racking up points. You are asked which side you want to play on, which is the obvious red or blue team, you then get a menu telling what character you want to play as, and you get one final menu what weapon you want to use in the battle.
<br>
<br>Once in the game you will respawn with all the selections you choose from all the menus you went through, the objective depends on whatever mode you picked from the main menu. I started to play the game trying to capture the flag as I was assigned to do, there was the opposing team enemy&apos;s always in my way, I tried to defeat some of them along the way, but I always died to my oppenents whenever I was in a duel with one. I did manage to capture the flag and bring it back to the home base, I continued to play and captured another flag, it seemed the opposing team I was playing against forgot about the flag as I never died the two times I captured it. A text box popped up voting what map to play next, I ignored the text box and quit the game for that day.
<br>
<br>I played the game the next day, I decided to play deathmatch instead of capture the flag, I had the exact same problems with capture the flag. The deathmatch mode is simple, just kill every player around you right? Wrong. The players you play against will always get into a duel with another player, and you can&apos;t even interrupt and kill them both. It always has to be another duel with another player, it is a hit or miss situation when it comes down to melee fighting. I had the same problems with melee fighting as the previous day, I could not hit the player I was fighting against, the hitbox is way too small on the opposing player, and no, you can&apos;t just hit anywhere you want, it has to be a specific area or else the game will not detect it. Why do I have hit somewhere specific when the player is right in front of me? It may sound like I suck at the game (which I did at times when I played the game) but I swear I had hit in some places where the game had to register the attack, I even read some reviews online that players were having the same problem, some believe it was an update in the game that caused this, and some believe it is because a hacker is on the server. Not only that, but when I did not play the game I always had random updates almost everyday for the game, and I am not even kidding, every time I turned on my computer there was always an update for the game, the updates never explained what they were or what they did, it was just sitting there chewing up space off of my computer.
<br>
<br>I also had some frame rate issues, I had to turn down the resolution to reduce lag, even at the lowest settings the game lagged in some places where it did not have to, Skyrim runs way faster than this, and this game is not as large as that game! I noticed a few times that the sounnd effects were off to, there would be times where I would die and did not know what killed me, then a few seconds later I would hear a yell sound really loud, I assumed that I was killed by a player with a sword from behind. After that day, I decided to quit the game and not come back to it, I had enough with the countless bugs and the terrible combat gameplay.
<br>
<br>Final Opinion:
<br>While it sounds like a good idea, Chivalry fails to show how great of a game it could turn out to be. The combat is buggy, the the training mode is one of the worst I have ever played, there are huge amounts of glitches, and the effects just don&apos;t work. If you want to play a game that is has everything I mentioned in this review then do it, I can tell you that you won&apos;t enjoy it if you have played a game just as buggy as this one (or worse).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=5327617">Expand</a></span>

The combat needs some tweeks but nothing too serious. 10 for me simply because it captures everything I expected in a medieval FPS.!!</span>

Hillarious, roaring fun. It&apos;s funny that in an industry devoted to fun, it is rare to find a game that makes you laugh out loud, even as your head and various body parts are scattered all over a grassy plain where birds sing blissfully over the carnage. Of course there are glitches and bugs, more than you would expect to find in an AAA title, but this is NOT an AAA title, it&apos;s an indie game which has managed to be more enjoyable than many &quot;big names&quot; out there. In multiplayer. Someone mentioned &quot;sub-par&quot; sound in an otherwise very positive review. For me, it&apos;s one of the strongest points of the game. The sound of steel clashing with steel or thudding against shield is as epic as the over the top battle cries and taunts are hillarious. And the melee combat, despite the glitches, is still the best I&apos;ve seen in any medieval themed videogame to date, hands down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3186586">Expand</a></span>

I feel that in the end though the price makes this a great buy. The unique combat experience and fun, enveloping maps give this game a big thumbs up from me. It takes some learning to get steady kills in but its worth it. I wasn&apos;t sure how I felt about this game until a free for all kill everybody match started. This was the most fun I&apos;ve had in an online game in a long time.  Attacking the rear of a group of knights trying to take down a weakened opponent like a pack of wolves and after damaging the health of one in back the rest turn on him with you and he become the target. Then it comes down to you and the last of the group and the battle rages on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2805851">Expand</a></span>

I was really excited to play this and I thought it was actually going to be like a tactical melee medieval game.  IN NO WAY IS IT TACTICAL.  People are fighting in the masses which isn&apos;t a bad thing if there was any tactic to this.  There is no strategy or skill involved in this game.  Just charge in and hack and slash everything you see is what this game is composed of.  This isn&apos;t even the worst part.  The hit detection is terrible; most of the hits you get in and attacks you block make no sense whatsoever.  When it seems like you should&apos;ve hit the other player or blocked an attack it doesn&apos;t happen!  Incredibly broken.  It gets really annoying when you switch classes as well; everytime you choose a class you have to set up your weaponry all over again.  It&apos;d be nice to see some sort of loadout instead of having to choose everything individually.  The graphics are fine.  I don&apos;t care for graphics as long as it&apos;s enjoyable but the gritty style put on by this game looks great.  Sounds are mediocre at best but decent enough.  Plenty of variation in game types.  Classes are rather unbalanced though considering some classes run much too quickly or other classes run much to slow when in battle.  This game really needed some polishing before release and for $25 it was not worth it.  There is some enjoyment in this game especially when crushing someone&apos;s skull in and reigning victorious but I still don&apos;t recommend this game, but will definitely change this review if this game would get an update to fix how stupendously broken this game is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2849508">Expand</a></span>

I really, really tried, but I just can&apos;t. I love the setting, love the gore, the simple yet allowing finesse fighting system. But the hit detection and block detection completely SUCK MONKEY BOTTOM. And that&apos;s the most important thing in the game! Many times my spear thrusts were going through an opponents chest without scratching him when he doesn&apos;t have a single problem beheading me. Or blocking enemy&apos;s attack while doing as you&apos;re supposed to, aiming at the enemy&apos;s weapon tip. And yet my head flies somewhere into the bushes. And it happens all. The. Time. It is extremely frustrating when you&apos;re sitting on the edge of your seat, trying to get that hit in with a supposedly long-range swing but nope, you gonna get absolutely mutilated. It is very hard to understand your weapon&apos;s range, as on numerous occasions it seems like it should connect, yet it doesn&apos;t for some reason. Other than that the gameplay is extremely hectic, lacks any tactic or strategy (gogogo in group zerg rush rush rush hurr durr kekeke), feels lacking. I find it a waste of money...yet I keep returning to the game, hoping that maybe it&apos;s my skill or ping or planet alignment. But nope, each time it ends up with unexplainable hitbox missess and teabagging of my bloodied corpse. Yay. Do not buy, I guess.
<br>Graphics are nice, though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3082244">Expand</a></span>

Hard to believe this is the work of an indie team! I used to be a non-believer in first person melee combat games.

I used to be a non-believer in first person melee combat games. I always thought they were generally messy and random and needed to be in third person, but Chivalry has turned this around for me (despite actually having a 3rd person option anyway)! I just love this game!
<br>
<br>Everything from the great combat system to the voice acting (and amusing dialogue) and the environments put you right there in brutal medieval battles. It is even a great game to watch in spectator mode!
<br>
<br>The devs seem passionate and caring about their game and it is great to see patches &amp; content updates being released.
<br>
<br>Aside from some areas that need polishing and fixing (which I&apos;m sure they will be) it is a pretty damn solid game. I also find it seems to be graphically better (max settings) than most of the videos about.
<br>
<br>And just who doesn&apos;t love decapitating their enemies?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2901889">Expand</a></span>

The medieval genre is very empty, but this sets a very high standard for any other medieval game to be made. The combat system is great, because you have to be very precise in aiming, and the battles themselves are good fun. It is also visually good-looking, and the lighting is often rather stunning. Objectives like poisoning the enemy&apos;s water supply, or lighting villages on fire, provides a very good replacement to the team deathmatch-style matches (not that it doesn&apos;t have these!).
<br>Having said this, Chivalry feels somewhat incomplete, because it isn&apos;t polished. At all. The scoreboard in-battle is designed badly, so items often overlap each other, and the menus don&apos;t always work as one would like them to. The subtitles in the training level also get to my head - there is only a certain amount of &quot;fightign&quot;, &quot;im&quot; (fighting, I&apos;m) that I can take.
<br>But these bugs and unpolishedness are easily surpassed by the sheer fun to be had in the game. Chopping people&apos;s heads off after sneaking up behind them will NEVER get boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2861406">Expand</a></span>

Few games I have ever played in my life have come close to giving me the satisfaction I get after decapitating someone after an epic duel. At a minimum this game is an 8, but I gave it a 9 because of the low price and on faith that the Devs will come through on their promises of free updates. My biggest complaint right now is the small number of maps available.

To start the graphics are one of the most detailed and in depth ones I have ever seen in any game, never mind an indie game. The sounds on this game are very responsive, it&apos;s almost as if you can actually feel the sword hit the player/bot - almost as if you&apos;re actually there. The hit detection for me is perfect, it wouldn&apos;t matter if someone had their shield up or not, if you swing at their hand the chances are they&apos;re going to lose it. However I have only played around 4 hours of the game actually on multiplayer, if you&apos;re looking for an easy, relaxing, non stressful game then this isn&apos;t for you. However! For those of you which want intense fighting, great visuals and sound, a good fight and an incredibly fun game then you better log onto Steam and buy this game! In conclusion I have given this game a 9/10, I would have given it a 10 but I&apos;m going to be picky and pick out one thing I don&apos;t like about the game - BOTS! For me, I love playing against bots which are just as challenging as players sometimes but there is no difficulty setting for these bots and to be honest they are pretty stupid bots. I know it sounds like I&apos;m knit-picking, that&apos;s because I am! I&apos;ve never gave a game 10/10 because I&apos;ve never played a perfect game but this is as close to perfect as you&apos;ll get for this genre of game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2886293">Expand</a></span>

Keeping that in mind, Chivalry is clearly a first of its kind.  With that said, flaws and simplistic mechanics can be easier understood.  On the surface the game is simple, but when you really get into it, those simple mechanics are hard to master.  That is the mark of a good multiplayer game these days in my opnion: easy to learn, hard to master.  The controls are intuitive, logical, and easy to manage.  The unlock system isn&apos;t a chore, and is straightforward: each class gets three different primary weapon categories, and in order to unlock the next weapon you simply just KILL!  There are some glitches in the game, like getting caught on pieces of wood.  The physics could be better and the game sometimes has lag issues.  There are only 4 classes: Man-at-arms, Archer, Vanguard and Knight.  Each requires a different playstyle from the next.  Aside from the glitches and mechanics issues with the engine, my only complaint is the game is TOO simple.  It needs more to it, but the combat is great.  Archer is hard to master as it should be.  Since I am loving this game I&apos;m going to give it a 9, but it&apos;s more of a 8.5 or 8.  I expect Chivalry to influence similar games in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2946843">Expand</a></span>

All the little pieces are put together nicely. The visuals, sounds, death screams everything. The only negative i can think is some bugs, and lack of singleplayer campaign. However looking at the size of the dev team, they made an outstanding work. In short, best medieval multiplayer experience.

I&apos;ve been wanting a sort of Skyrim/FPS mix game for awhile, and while there are no dragons, magic, or anything else in Skyrim besides weapons and armor, but this is good enough. There are four distinct classes, each with their own role and special abilities. There are plenty of game modes and even an offline option where you can play against bots. The weapons are pretty much balanced and the hitboxes are good. So many hours of fun I&apos;ve had with this game.
<br>
<br>There are a few quirks here and there which prevents this game from getting a full 10/10. For example, you&apos;ll occasionally get stuck on certain items in a map, the new Duel mode they added is really buggy and they added your win/lose ratio (I didn&apos;t need to be reminded how badly I sucked), and just a bunch of little things. This game is worth the $25 it costs and you will not regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2958142">Expand</a></span>

Nothing is funner than constantly screaming your battle cry. It&apos;s by far the best medieval battle game/sim out there right now, and at a good price.

Reviewing a game in BETA/ALPHA stage, or B. They totally suck at the game and just rage quitted after playing a round. Problem is people think it&apos;s simple, so they complain a lot when they die, instead of seeing the tactic that brought them down.
<br>
<br>This game is very immersive, it has some good blood effects and gore. The combat, which some lesser people claim to be luck-based, is in fact a very deep system with many tactics. The thing is, if people are too set on games being simple, they will feel it&apos;s about luck when they get killed by another better player using special tactics. You can hit people around the shield if they are not careful, and blocking is harder or easier depending on which weapon your enemy uses. The armours in this game also looks quite realistic and good. Other games always have these seriously weird armours with things sticking out everywhere or just armours that look like they weight about as much as a freight train. The ambience is very good, there are way cries and death cries echoing through the battlefield. And also a messenger shouting orders or reports to the presumed commanders further away. Animations aren&apos;t that great in some cases, but the swings are generally really good, it feels like there is weight behind them and you can&apos;t just randomly swing around, because you&apos;ll get tired. There is a good diversity in game modes as well, you can play through the &quot;story&quot; by going team objective, or just FFA or TDM if you would feel like it. There is also a special duel game mode where everyone gathers in one room and duel each other one by one, which is a great way to train duelling. There are also a quite interesting factor in the game, friendly fire, meaning you can accidentally kill teammates. This adds a new level of difficulty to the game, which in my opinion should be added to almost all games, it makes it more punishing to miss and hit your friend. Games like Battlefield and CoD could benefit from this in all of their gamemode, the only downside being that people are too stupid to avoid friendly fire. To counter this in Chivalry, which many people are too stupid to realize, is to simply use trusts and overhead swings whenever friendlies are nearby.
<br>
<br>The guys working on this seems like good guys, like almost no other game companies are nowadays, they release new content and patches, and they aren&apos;t trying to make extra money by releasing a DLC which you HAVE to pay for to get these new things. They recently released a content update in late January together with a patch. I am seriously looking forward to new content, unlockables and more. If I had to guess, I&apos;d guess they will release weapons and different armours soon.
<br>
<br>Many people also claim they have lag issues, this is because they choose servers that have horrbile ping, because they have absolutely no understanding of servers what so ever. If you pick a good server and have a decent internet connection, then you will have no trouble. There might also be some unsupported routers that have created problems for some people. This is a big reason why many discard the game outright and write a bad review here, they are too lazy to fix lag issues. That is why they feel the game is unresponsive, choppy and &quot;unfair&quot;, it is literally only because of ping, that&apos;s how ping works. There are no choppy weapons, this is because of lag only.
<br>
<br>As for people claiming M&amp;B has a better combat system... Yeah, swinging wildly with little to no weight behind your swings and never tiring seems perfect. They are just blinded by their on fan-boyism. I&apos;ve played M&amp;B, I love it. Chivalry has a more skillful and better combat system though. Duels are amazing. The only way M&amp;B or War of the Roses, can be better is when you have a large group (clan or guild) that works together, which doesn&apos;t happen often. WotR&apos;s problem is that it doesn&apos;t have the maps designed for large scale, group or line warfare.
<br>
<br>The only thing that Chivalry doesn&apos;t have, that WotR does have. Is customization options, in WotR you can create your own unique armours and coat of arms, which is really cool, since you basically have your own &quot;house&quot; you&apos;re fighting for. The problem with this is that many players tend to make goofy looking armours and such, destroying the awesome feeling of the game. WotR is also set in a later period it seems, as their armours look like they&apos;re from a later period of the middle ages. Bordering on 16th century armours, I&apos;d say. There&apos;s far too little chain mail, which is sad, it was widely used during the middle ages, with only a surcoat over, something both games lack. Then later, it was used as further protection together with plate armour.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, I love M&amp;B, I love Chivalry. M&amp;B is really fun with a giant group and lots of players, but Chivalry has a more skillful and immersive combat system, where there is a lot more techniques than M&amp;B has, and War of the Roses.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2977965">Expand</a></span>

I started as an Archer and with my first arrow fired slew a knight attacking one of my teammates with about a 60 yard shot.  And then as my foe, fell to the ground, my teammate lopped off his head with his sword.  Yeah it took all of 30 seconds into my first online match and I was hooked on this time killer!  Great Buy if you get it on sale, don&apos;t feel bad if you paid full price the game is worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3081495">Expand</a></span>

Charging into battle while your character shouts a war cry, or laughs like a lunatic is hilariously awesome. I find myself laughing with a big smile on my face the whole time I&apos;m playing this game. Like I said, it is not complex, but there is enough depth for characters to learn new skills and practice techniques to become terrors on the battlefield, and yet not make the game aggravating for other players. If you die, its usually pretty clear how you made a mistake and offered yourself on a silver platter. Anyways, I could go on and on. Do yourself a favor and at least look into this game. Watch some reviews on Youtube, and ignore the haters on this site. Its awesome!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3376509">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>To compare it with War of the Roses, WotR does deliver better customization and depth. But the core gameplay of Chivalry is far superior. TornBanner can and will add more details (such as customization) in future patches. WotR however, or any other game for the matter, cannot change its core gameplay.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re one of those people like me, unsure whether to buy a game and reading some reviews, buy it. Don&apos;t pay to much attention to all the negativity. Chivalry is a skill-based game, and some new players think they&apos;ll know how to play like veterans in no-time. That&apos;s why they get frustrated and blame it on bad game mechanics and glitches. Know however, that I have invested 110 hours in this game and I can assure you,  actual bug encounters or other glitches are rare.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2851421">Expand</a></span>

First person shooters can not compare to a full physics based melee combat system (plus physics based projectiles).  Most FPS use hit scan to detect if you hit or not, but this game uses swings, parries, blocks, dodges and weapon to body part hit detection and physics collision.  I&apos;m a game developer and I can tell you what they pulled off is revolutionary.  All future games should learn from this game!  So good, I can&apos;t stop playing it :)
<br>
<br>Some tips:
<br>
<br>Vanguard is a good starting class.  It has some of the longest reach weapons and you can &quot;mouse up&quot; to stab with one of the pole arms and learn to play distance games while you can &quot;left mouse button&quot; to swing some of the long swords around on a FFA server to get double and triple kills occasionally.
<br>
<br>The Knight is a good second class to learn as it can take the most hits (generally 3 hits instead of 2 from powerful weapons).  It has some variety as you can play with long reaching two handed sword or a one-hander plus shield.  The extra durability comes in useful when you need to increase your survivability (which comes in pretty handy in objective based maps).
<br>
<br>The Archer is a good class to play in wide open maps or maps where there is a front line protecting you as you try to pop off enemies.  My personal favorite thing is using the short bow and doing mid to close ranged shots and killing people as they try to approach me.  You can quickly switch to a short sword, parry their incoming blow and then go in for a quick stab before you run out of range of their next hit, then go in for another blow.  The parry from the short swords and daggers aren&apos;t nearly as effective as just running out of the range of the enemy&apos;s weapon and then running back in range.
<br>
<br>The Man at Arms is my current favorite class to play, but I&apos;d consider him one of the hardest classes to play (advanced tactics required to be good).  Generally a fun way to troll people is pick the Oil Pot and when you spawn, switch to it and run around until you see someone in the &quot;last stage bloody&quot; point.  One shot from the Oil Pot will kill them for a relatively easy free kill.  Then run around and use the class&apos;s extra speed to your advantage by running in, getting as many hits as you can.  If they parry you, instead of parrying their next shot, press backwards+dodge or turn straight around and sprint out of distance from their swing, then when you hear their &quot;grunt&quot; from swinging, immediately turn around and swing and you&apos;ll generally catch them post-swing and repeat.
<br>
<br>So fun, can&apos;t play anything else :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=2857945">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Bought this game out of curiosity last week... and haven&apos;t stopped playing it! Sure there are few tweaks needed and some greater customization would be nice, but the core game play is great fun. Addictive and brutal combat  although archers seem to have the least attention paid to them in game design  .

The combat is wonderfully skill based, the game play is fantastic, the community is generally good and the graphics are more than adequate. I keep coming back to this game without fail, especially with the number of free updates that keep coming. Buy this game, it&apos;s cheap for what you get and you&apos;ll have hours of fun.</span>

Torn banner is a small group of guys that developed this game from virtual meetings. Chivalry is in the beta stage with its few quirks that most indie games have when they start up. A few problems arose with the latest patch but nothing that would kill the game for you. The gameplay is really cool, gore and blood everywhere for you lovers of it. This game will only keep getting better and with the Easter sale I see no reason to not get it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3080547">Expand</a></span>

A couple of hits and you die. Should have gone fantasy, because realism sucks in this game.
<br>
<br>They are trying to create something akin to MMO shooters, but the need to be in close combat at all times just means that if you are outnumbered, you will die. You can only defend against one attack at a time, basically, so two or more attackers will kill you quick. Respawn is similar to other shooters, it just depends on when you die and where the counter was at at the time. Then there is a long boring run back to the battle. Why this sucks is because at least in Red Orchestra or COD you fight from a ranged distance. This is also why games like Elder Scrolls don&apos;t thrust you into endless waves of creatures attacking all at once. At least in fantasy games you have the benefit of magic for defense and offense as well.
<br>
<br>The game also plays in a windowed mode. This wasn&apos;t exactly a deal breaker for me, but it was annoying. The animations were okay, but timing blocks, which is a major part of this game, is sluggish at times. Basically this is all in the mouse. Your movement is still WASD, but everything else uses all your mouse buttons. If you don&apos;t have five mouse buttons, do not even try.
<br>
<br>I bought this on sale at Steam for $10 and I would really like to demand my money back. Like a few other reviewers I was surprised at how high this game scored. My guess is 90% of these reviews came within the initial purchase and few hours of play with the hope that it would get better. Leveling doesn&apos;t do much for you but get you new weapons to swing with. It gets very monotonous after awhile, click 1, click 2, block, click 3, click 1, block.... Oh yeah and die like every thirty or forty seconds.
<br>
<br>This game might be better with a group of players who are all on headsets and communicating, but all I saw was a bunch of people running around swinging at everything, including their teammates. Like many shooters with friendly fire, count on some moron constantly running in front of your swings/shots as well. As a 4-5 layer co-op effort, this game could have been awesome. But thirty fighting each other in very close quarters, even outdoors, just becomes a chaotic nightmare. Anyone who thinks this is how medieval wars took place is just flat out crazy. There are no skirmish lines in this game, no waves of archers followed by foot soldiers, and no artillery that I saw (but perhaps that was a different type of battle I didn&apos;t play). Instead, they call it realism when thirty people with no coordinated effort charge in and start swinging like crazy. Viking pillagers were more organized than this.
<br>
<br>The biggest problem I saw here is that there is no commander, be it a King or a General of some sort. A good system would have been to have a team leader that controlled who, which of the four characters (Archer, Man-at-Arms, Knight and Skirmisher) and how many would be available in a pool that you have to choose from when you respawn. I saw games where there was little to no archer support, and knights were just wading into battle all alone, instead of being backed up by people with pole arms. Every man for themselves doesn&apos;t really work in these types of &quot;slashers,&quot; but how do you avoid it if there isn&apos;t even the slightest semblance of a command structure. Often you have to defend three objectives, such as your catapults, which seemed to be unused, but there is no way of directing people to spread out appropriately. This may seem like an issue of the people who play it, rather than the game itself, but I can see no real way to remedy this without some sort of command structure. What&apos;s really annoying is that if you know anything about strategy in warfare, this game is just going to tick you off with every battle.
<br>
<br>I had eyed this game suspiciously for few months, and after reading the reviews here I bought it on sale. Like I said, I would pitch a fit to get my money back if it were possible. This is basically one of those online games you play in a browser converted into something that looks like a professional game.  I think some of these complaints are partly due to the people it attracts. Serious gamers won&apos;t be messing around with this. It pales in comparison to games like Red Orchestra and even, dare I say, WOW (which I absolutely hate). If you want to play a pedantic time waster for a few days, pick this up. Otherwise I would spend the money on a single player medieval themed game, or some sort of RTS if you are absolutely jonesing for medieval fighting. The positive reviews of this game are misleading, If they use words like &quot;epic&quot; and &quot;awesomeness&quot; it&apos;s probably best to stay away. I certainly learned my lesson about how to read these reviews from now on. It&apos;s a lowest common denominator issue IMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3295221">Expand</a></span>

Gamemodes include: fighting in an arena, teamdeathmath, free for all death match, pillaging a city in a team, castle siege etc. and all of this in multiplayer!

Combat system requires finesse and offers a decent array of weaponry but is glitchy and often out of sink with the picture. The maps are great but offer unseen traps where characters get stuck on scenery. The UI could use some work, most notably the Find Server screen, which is perhaps the glitchiest thing of all.
<br>
<br>If you can get the game to work you have a tremendous wealth of multiplayer combat, most of which will be spent fending off your own team mates. This game is packed with team killing.

<br>I want to love this game, and I play it over and over again in the hopes that just once I&apos;ll leave a session happy. They only tend to end in frustration, however.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3271956">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>One of the most fun online games I have played for a long time. To me this is basically what Guild Wars 2 combat should have been, if that is of any importance to anyone. Deep, skill based combat. Weapons all have a big influence on how a character plays. Needs a few balance tweaks here and there but few games out there at the moment as satisfying as the combat in this.</span>

<br>I bought it on Steam Sale a month ago and tried it for about 5h. When i realised that all my progress was reseted due to &quot;a rank up bug caused by steam&quot; (No it is 100% fault of incompetently developers if you have a closer look at the rest of the game). So well today i loaded the patch and... Yeah well the catastrophy begins:
<br>-NEW helmets to buy for real money
<br>-&quot;fixed&quot; OP vanguard class(nothing has changed)
<br>-The hit detection is even worse than before
<br>-90% teamkillers and noobs spamming left mouse button attacks and turning around like fools
<br>-MASSIVE FPS drops with a PC i can play BF3 on Ultra, just to give an example(Not that the game is even looking like it was released 2 years ago... It is just ugly as hell with bad anti aliasing, awful blur effects and sometimes awful textures)
<br>
<br>You think I reduce the game to its graphics? No, not really... graphics are not everything, i know, but they could distract from the awful gameplay... People who say this is a SKILLBASED combat system have no idea of what skill is or they are just fanboys... Hit detection does practically not exist... No matter if you attack from above, left right or stab... Blocking is completly random... the fact that you can block warhammers, waraxes and huge greatswords with the tiniest daggers the game offers doesn&#xB4;t make it better! But not only the blocking is random, so are the hits! Sometimes you do 360 degree all around dmg with your OP vanguard Claymore and hitting everything in 3m range and then when stabbing at an enemy in 30cm in front of you nothing happens, or he blocks your overhead swing with the fists! Then running around you and hopes for some random hits stunning you and hacking of some limbs... You think i am not skilled enough? Well, I tested this tactics with 3rd person view myself... You are completly invincible dealing 360&#xB0; all around dmg and you dont even take much dmg because when you see an enemy strike you jump that the strike hits your feet what deals practically no dmg. After that you continue spamming LMB attacks and killing people...(Even the dumbest hack and slay games have more mind)
<br>There is also no limit for the annoying archers... Crossbows are able to oneshot half of the enemies... bows shoot very fast and so on...
<br>
<br>Beside of the COMPLETLY AWFUL combat &quot;system&quot; (just spam LMB attacks...) the game modes are boring too because you have seen them in 529xxxx games before... Last man standing(The last who is alive wins), Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Duel (1 vs 1) and the ultra small MP &quot;campaign levels&quot; are boring after 5h. Then there is nothing more to do because there is no single player or level up system for a character or real customization ( Yeah you can buy ugly helmets for 5$ and change colour... &quot;ironically WOW&quot;). You can level a few weapons that are used for the only 4 classes you can change from... No RPG elements, No real upgrades or anything what gives motivation...
<br>
<br>I won&#xB4;t start with the missing balancing now because i could continue the list of awful and dumb things in this game for a long long time...
<br>
<br>Concluding i gave the game 0 points because it has absolutly no motivation over longer time, no story, no singleplayer, mediocore multiplayer, fu***** up gameplay and a mass of bugs! The developers doesn&#xB4;t seem to care about anything and do not answer to support requests. You can find glitches hacks and bugs jsut everywhere...
<br>
<br>SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Rather burn it so it makes a little warmth... Everything is better than wasting your money on this crap called a GAME... This is an alpha in which you have to pay for new elements brought with patches for an absolutly broken gameplay...
<br>-&gt;Zero points for ZERO fun...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chivalry-medieval-warfare/user-reviews?user_review_id=3955819">Expand</a></span>
