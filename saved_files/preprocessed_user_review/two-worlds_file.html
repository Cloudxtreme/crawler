There is something unique about this, that made me stick with it for many hours. Maybe it&apos;s the art style, the character designs or the world itself. Dunno but I really felt immersed into the game. Two Worlds has THE BEST magic system ever created. I loved collecting spell-cards, then finding other cards to mod my spell they way I wanted. The alchemy was also the best I&apos;ve seen in an RPG game so far. Combat is a bit imbalanced and clunky in a similiar way Gothic 1&amp;2 combat is. The world is impressive in size and there are many distinctive landscapes forests including cold mountain tops, desert and rainforest. It had bugs, balance problems and lack polishment but I felt so entranced by the game that I ignored those problems and kept playing. Also some new patches came out so maybe it&apos;s better now. One of the best RPGs in my book. I don&apos;t get it why people hate it. Just try it despite all the hate from people, maybe you will love it as I did. I&apos;m giving it 8/10. Actually writing this review makes me want to replay it right now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=3197348">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> I expected this game to be sort of substandard based on the semi-mediocre reviews. I have been playing this for weeks now and the game just gets better. This game is epic and deeper than any other game I have ever played. The world has 35 km of playable area and an amazing weather and effects system. This game is epic to play and experience and is definitely one of the best games of 2007.</span>

But, if you look deeper you will see a very deep and enthralling CRPG experience, and in some ways it is far superior to Oblivion. You will either love or hate this game, if you hate it after only an hour of playing, give it another shot you may end up liking it.</span>

It&apos;s fun and you get hooked from the moment you start playing. Step by step you develop your character and have the freedom to decide who you want to be, a thief, a warrior, a magician, a bows-man etc. You can also decide between different fractions. The game offers so many possibilities that&apos;s it almost feels like a second life you start in Antalor, the world of Two Worlds. I bought the game on Steam and started playing with version 1.6. Although I played for hours not a single bug occurred. The game runs perfectly smoothly with maximum graphic details (Core2Duo 6550, 7900 GTX). I highly recommend the game for all players who love role playing games in a non-linear open world!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=410664">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m up to level 40 so far. Played with the 1.7 patch. There is a lot to see and do in 2W. Its addictive in a good way. Pro&apos;s: really great scenery and weather; open ended gameplay; fantastic inventory items in variety, cool looks and the stacking abilities; reasonably large world that is rewarding to explore; great mele weapons; lots of nice skills; nice graphics; architecture; lots of quests with okay rewards; nice magic system; the horses ride a bit like real horses so practice is needed; attacking mele from horse is just fun; the story is good; good variety of scenery; nice music; quest system works; good variety of monsters/foes; leveling up is rewarding and foe difficulty scales up well, with you; enemies have the items you see on them when you loot them which I think is great. Cons: My biggest gripe with 2W is the user interface. Just look at how sparse it is. Also it doesn&apos;t scale for high resolution gameplay (I play at 1920x1200). It is also lacking in several other ways for example you can have only 3 spells usable at one time; the medium difficulty level is too easy; stacking items can make items that are way powerful; the world map is low resolution and you cant mark on it with text; there are no hidden areas in towns (what you see is what you get); dungeons are small and not interactive; graphical performance feels studdery on my ATI 4870 card with 5.8 drivers but killing the ccc.exe process helps some, it feels like the graphic engine is poorly optimized. Other comments: many reviewers hark on bad voice acting but I find almost all games have bad voice acting anyway. Some of the voice acting is pretty good, and yes, some of the acting is not. I don&apos;t find the lack of acting talent to ruin the game experience at all. Right now 2W is fifteen bucks in stores and at that price I think it is a must buy for RPG fans. The game was released in a buggy state and that made an angry fanbase but I think a lot of bugs are gone now in the 1.7 patch. A few times my horse has gotten stuck in buildings or structures and then I could not get off the horse and had to re-load from a save game. That&apos;s the only bug I&apos;ve found.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=416453">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m not sure if they are always wanting the *best* shiny graphics or what, but they have missed the mark by a mile by giving this game such low reviews. I held off on buying it due to the low reviews, but then PC Gamer gave it an excellent and Gamespot gave it a good review so I bought it - boy am I glad I did! The game is addictive, fun and engaging. The guilds actually matter and you build a reputation that eventually demands you choose sides in the kingdom&apos;s power struggles. The combat, far from being as hard as Gothic 3, is fast paced and fun. There are tons of options for customizing your character. The only downside might be that you can powergame quite easily if so inclined. Overall, if you enjoy Action-RPGs I highly recommend you get this game - you will not be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=404021">Expand</a></span>

I have played many many games in my life dating back to the old Spectrum 48k, and I have to say that I&apos;ve never spent 4 quid any better than I have in buying Two Worlds. This game escaped my attention over the past months it has been out as I&apos;ve been playing other games I anticipated would draw all my gaming time. So, in short, this game has beautiful, up to date graphics, an intuitive combat system, an excellent levelling system for combat and non combat abilities, and more content than you could ever wish for in an RPG...... You will spend many hours doing great side quests and many many more following the storyline missions too.... If you have stuck in-between games (ie: need something to get dug into whilst waiting for a release) then this game will more than keep you entertained.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=424272">Expand</a></span>

Also, it is very dissimilar from Oblivion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=83949">Expand</a></span>

If someone tells you the soundtrack is cheesy, they are wrong, the don&apos;t know what good music is for an RPG. If someone tell you the combat is bad just becasue it doesnt have a large amount of animations, either they are thoughtless or havent played enough to learn the skills they should before making such a remark. Let me say though, people have complained about the horse control and combat. I find it more entertaining to have a horse react realistically to were it wants to go on the terrain adnd avoid other creatures. So if you are having trouble moving, just live with it and try practicing your horse riding skills. I have nearly mastered it. I think this game is right up with, and maybe better than Oblivion. The story is interesting, and the atmosphere feels a lot like Oblivion. SO, if games that are like other great games is your thing, you will like it. Trust me, its getting harder and harder to find original games. But this is an RPG worth more time than Oblivion, and actually easier to manage too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=404948">Expand</a></span>

What they get in exchange is a lot of almost mindless wander-time. Most of which they will be extremely overpowered.</span>

<br>This game is very outdated with ugly graphics and atrocious voice acting. Nothing managed to grab me and want to keep playing, story seems boring and cliche
<br>I normally try to play a game for at least 10 hours before writing a review, but the voice acting immediately put me off, sounds very robotic with no emotion behind the words, sounds like someone is bored and just reading the lines half heartedly straight off the bat.
<br>The default controls are horrible as well, space for action and e for jump.
<br>
<br>At least you can change it. Though I could not map shift to anything at all and trying to map the tilde key just resulted in opening a dialogue function.
<br>
<br>Character creation is extremely limited, you can only play as a male and change his hair and features a tiny bit.
<br>
<br>I do not need to play much at all to decide that I really hate playing this game. It&apos;s terrible in every way. Talking to NPC&apos;s is like a form of torture, listening to dialogue that sounds like someone is very bored makes me want to mute the sound.
<br>
<br>A waste of time to play such a bad game when there are heaps better games I can spend my time playing.
<br>
<br>But if you feel the need to give it a try maybe get it on a sale. But to me this game is not worth playing even if it was free.
<br>It is not a joy for me  to play at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=5500044">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played through the game, but didn&apos;t bother with completing every side quest. It really wasn&apos;t worth the effort to bother and I really only played it because I wanted to go into TW II having played the first game and it came with it.
<br>
<br>This is a horrible game. The interface is clunky, the voice acting is Resident Evil level awful, and the graphics are dated and inconsistent. The rendered cut-scenes look worse than the actual game does, and that&apos;s saying something.
<br>
<br>That said, it&apos;s not the worst way you could spend your time, but just about any other open world RPG would be better. The lack of quality leads to some amusing moments, but it&apos;s not really enough to make up for how bad this game is. It&apos;s also not particularly difficult and once the main campaign is over, the game ends.
<br>
<br>You&apos;re much better off with something like Elder Scrolls or Divinity, but if you&apos;ve burned yourself out on those games and are looking for something to scratch the open world RPG itch and don&apos;t mind a heavy amount of cheese, this is awful if you get it cheap. You might enjoy it in an &apos;it&apos;s so bad it&apos;s good&apos; kind of way, but don&apos;t expect more than that out of it, and be prepared to deal with the awkward interface and frustratingly flighty enemies and poor ranged combat.
<br>
<br>Melee works fine, bows are useless, and spells are largely only good for stopping fleeing or kiting enemies so you can run up and smack them with a melee weapon. Weapons can be swapped and there are multiple hot bars, but even those are a little awkward to use. Not to the point that they don&apos;t work.
<br>
<br>The sequel is far better, but the events of this game happen just previous to TW II. You don&apos;t need to play this to enjoy the far superior sequel, but you&apos;ll probably get a little more out of TW II if you have.
<br>
<br>If you can get it super cheap, blow through it with some cheat commands before playing TW II. Powering through the main quest doesn&apos;t take that long. Otherwise I really can&apos;t recommend it. It&apos;s not unplayable or devoid of fun, but lacks any sort of polish and is riddled with minor bugs. I&apos;ve yet to run into anything game breaking and most are graphical in nature.
<br>
<br>Get it cheap, and even then only if you&apos;ve tired of better games of the same type and/or are looking to play Two Worlds II with more insight on the lore of the game&apos;s setting. Even then it&apos;s best to just cheat God-mode yourself and blow through the campaign without worrying much about the various side quests.
<br>
<br>Pretty much skip it unless you&apos;re a hardcore fan of this type of game and are willing to put up with it&apos;s many, many flaws.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=4316627">Expand</a></span>

Any game that doesn&apos;t work isn&apos;t worth the time and money I put into trying to get this to work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=410352">Expand</a></span>

The long and seemingly unending dialogue in the beginning of the game had me reaching for the ESC button. I gave it a Four (and not lower) as I intend to pick it back up sometime later, and after I get over my initial anger at paying full price for what seems t be yet another POS from across the sea. As for comparisons to Oblivion, initial impression - the game doesn&apos;t even come close. Verdict? Addicts of the RPG genre, buy it when its on the bargain shelf or used. If you&apos;re not nuts about RPG&apos;s, give it a pass unless someone gives it to you, and even then only play it with you&apos;ve naught else to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=402641">Expand</a></span>

Much better than any of the aforementioned, frankly. The best game I&apos;ve played in the last two or three years.</span>

If they hadn&apos;t have compared this game to Oblivion, it might have been acceptable, but they raised the bar too high and have crippled themselves. I&apos;m so disappointed in this game that I&apos;m blacklisting the developer.</span>

If Oblivion hadn&apos;t set the bar so high last year, this game would be getting better reviews. There are issues with this game, but if you actually play it for more than an hour, you might just find yourself getting into it.</span>

I personally couldn&apos;t play this game below Hard setting because honestly, it is too easy and lacks any kind of challenge due to automatic resurrections and no penalties. But on Hard, you have a real sense of adventure travelling this wonderful world, and the combat becomes really tactical. You&apos;ll have to carefully plan your strategies, attack and retreat, change your weapons, get your timing right... it&apos;s a great challenge, yet it never feels unfair or unbeatable. People these days seem to expect from any RPG that they can just barge through it, mow down thousands of enemies and see the ending. This is not what it&apos;s about. It&apos;s about the journey to get there. And it&apos;s about literally getting lost in the game world. The story and scenario might be a bit generic, but Two Worlds have everything else. I must add that I only played the fully patched v1.7 version. But when I see people writing about unfair difficulty, terrible graphics, bad controls, I wonder what game they have played. It&apos;s not the Two Worlds I am experiencing just now. If you&apos;re thinking about playing this game, don&apos;t care about the bull that is written about it at some places, and give it an unbiased chance. Because most of the downsides people mention are just flat out lies, probably written by players who were frustrated because this is not one of those games that you can rush through and win without any trouble.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=73957">Expand</a></span>

I dont give a 9 score to a game easily. Note that that the latest patch is needed to enjoy the game since the game was quite unbalanced before the last patch. Folks who give low scores didnt play the game for long and/or didnt have the latest patch.</span>

For the quality of graphics, I find the game a little slow. I was disappointed to find that you can&apos;t play the main storyline in multiplayer mode. I&apos;d like to be a little more thorough, but my patience has limits.</span>

This game even has some features that are better than Oblivion. First of all, the armor is much cooler. Second of all, there are many types of mounts, not just horses. You can ride on lizards and beasts. Some people think the combat is too simple and uninspired, however, it is less frustrating and more exciting than oblivion. I also like how it is realistic. You can&apos;t just run into a crowd of 20 enemies and expext to win. You have run away sometimes, wait for them to split up, or think of something else. I love the alchemy system and how you can create your own potions. The only reason i give this a 9 and not a 10 is the mediocre voice acting. But if you ignore it, this game should be a very fun experience. I recommend you get this game on steam, it costs less and you wont have to drive to the store.

Despite the vast selection I had. Other than that the random items(armor/sword) selection and alchemy was enjoyable till the very end. Only complaints were that the factions felt pretty hollow. Unlike games like Kotor or Baldurs gate I didnt have a evil and a good way to solve every quest, which was frustrating. I couldnt really be the evil badass necromancer I wanted to be, because id always end up doing some good.

I&apos;ve had no technical issues and the game is quite fun to play. The world is large, the graphics show a pleasing attention to detail, and the gameplay is tried and true Diablo-style adventuring. Don&apos;t mind the naysayers; this game is, for the most part, very well done.</span>

The sword fighting looks like a haphazard attempt at re-creating a seizure and the enemies are nothing but annoying. I mean honestly, I sat for a good minute, kicking dirt back and forth with some bandits; with the animations on the &quot;dirty trick&quot; move it looks like a faggoty little dance party. I walked up to a boar and died for no reason. I was riding a horse, fell through a level, and died for no reason. Next time &quot;Reality Pump&quot; why don&apos;t you just shit in my mouth?

Once the NPC&apos;s and your character (who you can&apos;t tailor very much - name, gender and race is already decided for you) shut up it makes for a decent gaming experience. Once you get used to the unresponsive control scheme, frustrating combat and odd animations that make your avatar look like he&apos;s in diapers, that is. Don&apos;t get me wrong - it really *is* decent but the polish just isn&apos;t there. You can tell from a mile off that this game was made with the best intentions but it fell short due to half hearted efforts. Bear in mind, though, that only the most stricken RPG fans (like me) will put up with this game for more than five minutes. The first little tutorial fight and the cutscenes during the intro is enough to make even the hardiest Tekken grinder cry. All in all I give it a 3. It doesn&apos;t deserve that much, actually, but again - it was decent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=407623">Expand</a></span>

For those who wonders if it is a linear game, it is nonlinear to the end. 2 Worlds is pretty much like Elder Scrolls series games, except for 2 apparent things; You can fight on a mount (horses, tamed creatures that got legs), plus the combat system is similar to Neverwinters series, an automated fighting sequence in which you have total control of the action, and not like the ackward &apos;manual&apos; fighting in Elder Scrolls series, being the very reason I dropped Elder Scrolls entirely. It is catching dust on my archives now. On the downside of 2 Worlds is the fact that you can only play vs other players via internet up to 8 players in the world instead of the massive online games out there. Oblivion may get an overhyped review, but to me, it&apos;s a piece of crap compared to 2 Worlds.

The skill system along with magic system is confusing or buggy (at level 20 you cannot use spells of a certain school because you&apos;re not trained in it even if you&apos;ve explored around 50% of map).At last but not least after killing the 1001 wolf/boar/bear you&apos;ll SURELY get bored.Better play Oblivion nth time from the very start for other 200-300-500 hrs and you&apos;ll be FAR more satisfied.

Could graphics lack some luster , could more character variety come into play, could more features added would have made this game more appealing , yes. It didn&apos;t seem to keep me interested as much as playing previous similar games for some reason. Bottom line, if you&apos;re new at games or at this type of game you&apos;ll be happy, but for veterans , this would not cut it. There is currently a better game out there called &quot;The Witcher&quot; . It has a very nice look from graphics to combat to storyline etc... But, don&apos;t take my word for it, take a look, you&apos;ll be mesmerized by &quot;The Witcher&quot;, which, I truly believe far surpasses any existing and previous games you&apos;ve ever played. Oh, it&apos;s also rated M so kids reading this, it&apos;s intended for adults and you should be in bed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=406462">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s like one of those old japanese movies badly dubbed over where the people are talking with their mouths closed lol.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s pretty much the worst part and I don&apos;t feel it merits the bad reviews. You basically have three options as a character  harassing your enemies at range with your choice of magic or bow (which are treated pretty much the same  just need different stats) and kiting your enemies, Making your standard melee tank warrior, or being a sneaky thief/assassin.

<br>I haven&apos;t beat the game, so maybe this will change but the plot is interesting but didn&apos;t make me care about the characters  most of them have ties to the first two worlds game which I never played and therefore didn&apos;t care about a lot of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=3877999">Expand</a></span>

Both games are certainly not the Blockbuster big budget games that Oblivion or Skyrim are, but you know what? It&apos;s pretty darn good for what it tries to do! The voice acting is mediocre at best, but the dialogue is good. So it balances out. The animations, like Two Worlds 2 are repetitive and kinda cheezy. However, like many, I find myself drawn to it&apos;s great combat, good story, interaction and gameplay. It is indeed fun. The archery is not Skyrim caliber, but it&apos;s far better than Oblivion&apos;s horrible bow mechanics. Think Fable 2 or Zelda type bow mechanics which are decent. If I were to compare it to anything, it would be a little Skyrim and a little Oblivion and although low budget in some respects, it makes up for it in many others. The graphics are VERY good for a game of it&apos;s time and the engine feels fluid and not clunky. Not as clunky as Oblivion anyway, but not quite as refined or polished as Skyrim. Nevertheless, it gets a well deserved 7 - 8, just because they try hard and what little shortcomings it has are EASILY overlooked because it&apos;s just fun to play! It&apos;s worth a look and you just might be surprised. I would even recommend it over Two Worlds 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=4553259">Expand</a></span>

<br>For me TW started out a bit slow and I was often disengaged and didn&apos;t feel like continuing. Initially it doesn&apos;t succeed in catching your interest. I had a plan to play the first game before playing Two Worlds II and I must say: &quot;Don&apos;t be deterred by the average rating&quot;. TW has more entertainment value than you&apos;d believe. The reason I don&apos;t recommend this to new players is because it is unpolished.
<br>
<br>The combat is mechanically lacking, but regardless, I found tons of enjoyment in it. First time I started playing I chose to play on hard difficulty and went for the mage class. Not sure if I can recommend that. Nearly uninstalled never to play again because of that. Could be that further on as you acquire stronger spells it gets better. Fortunately the melee is fine from get-go. It doesn&apos;t feature swashbuckling per se, but it provides you with a number of approaches to any situation. For example there is a wide variety of different traps, each more applicable to certain foes and situations than others. You also have the option to sneak. Very useful and sometimes essential if you, for example, need to get up close to a more vulnerable target that would otherwise one shot you from a distance. There are plenty of tactics you can utilize if you think creatively.
<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t finished the game yet, but the story is very compelling. It&apos;s generally not cliche and often surprises you.
<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t felt much character development going on, and I guess the dialogue scripts are at blame. They&apos;re mostly there just to give you information, but don&apos;t advance any character very well. The voice acting could be better. Often it seems like the actors voicing their characters are reading their lines for the first time, since their voices don&apos;t convey the emotions expected, &apos;nor do they seem to be affected by what the other counterpart just said. But at other times the voice acting and dialogue are great. I just wish that the characters were modeled better. The same faces and voices are seen and heard everywhere. Even two key figures, Ultar Karga and Ebrat Skelden, both from opposing factions have the same voice actor. What the hell??
<br>
<br>Animations are... interesting, but mostly poor. I shouldn&apos;t expect much from a game as old as this, but certain things could&apos;ve been done better. I&apos;m mostly disturbed by the constant laggy movements of combat animations. It is well motioned, but they don&apos;t flow too well. Perhaps the only time the animation is smooth during combat is the moment a fresh kill flies a short distance from a forceful blow and drops dead on the ground. Regardless of this, I found melee combat satisfying and inviting. I&apos;m guessing archery and combat magic aren&apos;t very viable, since they failed hard early on and I haven&apos;t given them a second chance.
<br>
<br>The quality to content describes the relationship between how much content there is in the game and how enjoyable it is. Based on the time I&apos;ve played so far I&apos;d say it&apos;s a solid 8. The game is massive and features varied content. I haven&apos;t experienced repetitiveness (At first constantly travelling to a merchant to sell your loot was a pain, but that problem is mended with the ingenius teleportation stone that can be earned via a sidequest). But THE LOOT! If you are a loot whore like me then TW is your wet dream.
<br>
<br>One other thing that bugs me is that there&apos;s no way to change your chosen difficulty setting mid-game. If you choose to play the game on medium difficulty (there are 3: easy, med, hard), the beginning of the game feels just right. Everything is well balanced. Unfortunately once your gear improves medium becomes a bit too easy since there is rarely any need for all those tactics I mentioned earlier. You can just go in guns blazing and everybody around you will drop like flies. Some hard-hitting foes will always smack you dead with one hit though. I would love to swap over to hard difficulty to see if I actually need all those potions and traps I&apos;ve been carrying around. You could start from the beginning, but there isn&apos;t really much replay value to help you get to where you were.
<br>
<br>Running out of characters here now. There are still so many aspects I would love to discuss, but my verdict is: If you&apos;re into RPGs, you really should at least try this one, even if you feel prejudiced toward it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/two-worlds/user-reviews?user_review_id=5306565">Expand</a></span>

I really liked some mechanics (and some I hated), at some points story was quite immersive, but most of the time it wasn&apos;t truly memorable. I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s a terrible game, as I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s particularly good. However, I imagine some people will really love it.
