It began as a Kickstarter so the development was no doubt under pressure but the game turned out magnificently. The visuals are great and the turn-based combat is challenging and rewarding.
<br>It has everything you&apos;d expect from crafting, to enchanting, looting and procedural dungeons.
<br>The roster of enemies is rich and there are a ton of things to accomplish within the game.
<br>Full controller support feels natural and almost the intended input method.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+ Nice artistic style in both the gameplay and the cut-scenes
<br>+ Wide range of items, abilities, and monsters
<br>+ Engaging yet simple story and characters
<br>+ The turn-based combat is well-paced and highly strategic with overdrive system.
<br>+ Exploration is done in two fashions (world/dungeon) offering a nice change in gameplay.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- The progression is pretty linear</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battle-chasers-nightwar/user-reviews?user_review_id=7638301">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Backed on Kickstarter this game blends awesome art and turn based combat like i haven&apos;t felt before, down to the animation of each attack, i found myself using moves i didn&apos;t need to just to watch the animating again.
<br>
<br>so the Team of heroes Garrion, Calibretto, Gully, Knolan, and Red Monika set out to protect Gully and her fathers gauntlets, however are run a ground by pirates and are split up, the main party is Gully (tank), Calibretto (healer), and Garrion (DPS) then finding the others through out the story, i stuck with the main 3, i felt they had more potental however that could just be because you play with them and learn the combos so i might of just gotten comfortable with them.
<br>
<br>after finding out these bandits are after cursed artifacts the team decides they need to find the source. i just want to point out quickly, i love that at 1st glance you think Calibretto will be the tank being a massive war golem, and gully will heal. this is quickly displelled, and i love it, have the story of &quot;Protect Gully&quot; but realising she protects everyone else in combat warms my cold void heart.
<br>
<br>everything about this game hits the nail on the head i only give it a 9/10 because exp grinding is a little slow, go. buy this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battle-chasers-nightwar/user-reviews?user_review_id=7634184">Expand</a></span>

The role-playing game I&apos;ve been waiting for for years. gameplay is a hybrid between Diablo&apos;s isometric style for exploration and Final Fantasy for turn-key fights. Someone argues that it does not shine for originality, and it is true but excels from every point of view. Starting with the fantastic graphic style, the atmosphere, the music, the dialogues. The hybrid between a comic and Japanese roleplay is amazing. But the really great thing is the fights, which, while being classic, are graphically spectacular, especially with regard to animations and visual effects. Very deep then the system of progression of the characters and the system of creation of objects and armaments. In the end, this game is a masterpiece and costs very little for what it is worth.
<br>A special mention for visionary comic artist Joe Madureira who has created this magical project!

<br>Ignoring that things, if you like rpgs based in turns dont think twice and get it, it is a very good game, better that many of +++A.
<br>Nice history, the best are the combats, dungeons with difficult selection, loot, is a mixture of all of that, nice music, nice graphics and good optimization :), the design of &quot;talents&quot;, skills, profesions etc are delightfull btw.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battle-chasers-nightwar/user-reviews?user_review_id=7590793">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Difficulty seems to still be a problem, even after the patch, you gotta do a lot of XP farming because the difficulty gap goes sky rocket after you reach lvl 10. So always try to be at least 3 or 5 levels above the required level for some missions and hunts.
<br>
<br>If you are NOT a fan of turn based RPG, then this game won&apos;t be for you, because the characters take quite sometime to attack due the animations. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the animations for each normal and special attacks are well made, but for some people they feel kinda slow.
<br>
<br>All in all, if you were a fan of the comic+ a fan of turn based RPG, then this game is a MUST for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battle-chasers-nightwar/user-reviews?user_review_id=7624456">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The biggest issues with the game are some questionable design decisions like only being able to craft in dungeons or apply enchants in very specific locations. Most of what you accumulate from drops is crafting loot, but 90% of the time gear you can craft is severely dwarfed by items you can buy or earn from the Heroic or Legendary dungeon completion boxes.
<br>
<br>Difficulty is also wildly inconsistent as trash enemies often posed a more annoying threat than dungeon bosses. The exception to this being some of the Hunt targets; in particular the Mire of the Deep hunt boss only has two attacks and one is a group wide attack with heavy damage plus a severe poison effect. If you get unlucky and he only uses this attack the fight becomes basically un-winnable.
<br>
<br>Nightwar is a competent game but fails in some vital areas to rise above other classic style turn-based RPGs; especially coming out in the same year as the exceptional Persona 5 and Divinity: Original Sin 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battle-chasers-nightwar/user-reviews?user_review_id=7795030">Expand</a></span>
