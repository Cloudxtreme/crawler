Criterion has made great games over the years but they need to stick with their &quot;Crash N Bash&quot; formula with Burnout and not dump it on the NFS series. This game is such a disappointment. Criterion took out all the things that made Most Wanted great and added in a bunch of things that didn&apos;t. No more manual transmission, next to no customization, no storyline other than &quot;There&apos;s ten people who are the best racers in the city. Beat them and I&apos;ll give you a cookie&quot;. I don&apos;t think I even saw a change camera option. What the hell happened? And  the so called &quot;Find it, Drive it&quot;? What the hell is that? What happened to doing races for money and using the cash to buy cars and parts? That&apos;s a proven formula and everyone knows that, why take it away and replace it with something as stupid as driving around looking for exotic cars that are (for whatever reason) sitting around a city? I&apos;m glad they brought back free roam instead of &quot;drive on a long curvy road with high-speed corners&quot;. But at such a cost! This game isn&apos;t even Need for Speed anymore. It&apos;s like Burnout Paradise City with Frostbite 2 and a different name. It&apos;s not even as great as Paradise City, it&apos;s like a hybrid that takes all the worst case scenarios EA and Criterion could made each game into (but didn&apos;t thankfully) and combines them all into one fustercluck of unrecognizable programming. If you&apos;re looking for a fun, freeroaming, street-racing game, try NFS Underground 2 or if you also want great graphics, try NFS Undercover.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2719699">Expand</a></span>

One thing I don&apos;t get is why between events everyone keeps crashing into other cars. As a result you&apos;ll be watching so many crash screens in a short amount of time, it&apos;s insane.

If you want a good NFS game, get the new Hot Pursuit. Otherwise get Burnout Paradise. Plain and simple. ---- Now for the sake of the responsibility I carry as a reviewer I will go into detail a little more. The map is small and boring. The cars all seem to handle and perform almost the same, and earning them feels underwhelming because it&apos;s so easy. Also there&apos;s no visual customization and you can&apos;t even pick your paintjob freely. Then there&apos;s the annoying crash cam and less than appealing soundtrack. All in all a bittersweet experience, especially for people who know what Criterion are capable of if they&apos;re not handcuffed by EA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2719666">Expand</a></span>

Typically when you see a massive number of negative user reviews, people are just complaining to complain right?
<br>
<br>So lets break this latest NFS down.  It runs - check.  You can drive different cars - check.  There are cops, races, and other side mission like things to do - check.  The graphics are decent (more on this later) and you have teh dubstep soundtrack!  If you&apos;ve played NFS before EA turned into a completely soulless company, there were some fun moments.  You could get past the small flaws and cheater AI that were part of the experience because the core game was fun.  Now looking back at every NFS since PU, we have a complete and total failure to produce a game that is even worth playing.  This latest entry is full of the same crap and somehow, people keep buying it.  Do you want to dominate a race and then lose in the last tenth of a second because the AI magically caught back up?  Do you want to drive cars that handle without a bit consistently?  Do you think a sandbox racing game should just be a check list of races?  After an hour of attempting not to be infuriated by this game, I lost, and decided that I would rather stab myself repeatedly rather than carry on.  The PC version is an obvious port, and poorly optimized.  You want particle effects? WE&apos;LL GIVE YOU SO MANY EFFECTS THAT YOU CAN&apos;T EVEN SEE THE RACE!  You want to complete that billboard challenge?  We&apos;ll make sure a the &quot;randomly&quot; generated traffic t-bones you.  So what does this boil down to?  EA Games beating a long dead series because for some reason, people keep buying these steaming piles of crap games.  Save your money, or better yet, find a copy of the first NFS : Hot Pursuit and Porsche Unleashed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2725614">Expand</a></span>

How is it possible a average police car run with the same speed with a Super car that runs almost 300 km/h ?!!? (smells like cheating AI to me). As for the rest there is no Single player story or any real purpose just running around some city trying to be number 1 in some list and doing similar races every freaking time (very boring !!!). Only good thing about this game are the graphics which are pretty good as for the rest it is a disappointing game that gets boring really fast</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2718257">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game starts without even telling you the controls.
<br>The turns feel not responsive enough. I just kept crushing and bumbing into all kinds of stuff. After a while i just didn&apos;t care since it seems nothing can happen to the car even if you crush into a wall at 300 km/h. The game forces you to go some place to start a race, then drive some other place. This felt just idiotic. I ended up just driving randomly across the city for a while and then uninstalling.
<br>And yes, the starting cutscene made me lose all hopes in today&apos;s generation. Are players really that dumb? I mean &quot;10 drivers dominate the city and police can&apos;t find them&quot;, and collect all those stupid cars across the city? I don&apos;t remember myself being so dumb to enjoy a story like this even in the age of 12 (if that&apos;s the age of the target audience they had in mind).
<br>Overall, a bad joke and a disgrace of a good name.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3351669">Expand</a></span>

But all that joy went away when I played it for the first 10 minutes. Especially when I found out my first car on the game was a Porsche! I&apos;d rather work my way up to a Porsche than get one right off, its so stupid. Next, there is no story line like I thought there was going to be, big disappointment. But anyway I just decided to keep playing to see if it&apos;d become more fun as i completed some missions, but after that i actually found more wrong with the game. The map was too small, there were no ordinary cars(tuners, muscles) just plain old super cars and all you had to do was find them and you owned them! And there is many more wrong with the game. After about an hour, my mom came i and asked if i liked the game, i didn&apos;t  want my mom t think it was a waste of money so i told her i liked it. A couple of months later, i got Forza Horizon and it was way better. I wish i would have bought that one earlier. Anyway, I beat MW2 in just one day of playing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3177897">Expand</a></span>

The graphic and audio is fine, but the soundtrack doesn&apos;t. In Burnout Paradise soundtrack was great (rock/metal), in this Need for Speed is **** (only &apos;cool DJ&apos;s&apos;, Skrillex). I don&apos;t play multiplayer, because I don&apos;t like play online, so I can&apos;t review it.</span>

So how did EA and Criterion manage to mess up Most Wanted? They didn&apos;t. They didn&apos;t mess up Most Wanted because this isn&apos;t Most Wanted. I think Criterion must&apos;ve mislabeled some games they developed, because this is clearly Burnout Paradise 2: Now with Cops!
<br>
<br>So everything you loved about Most Wanted? Gone. Car Customization and winning races to buy new engines to upgrade your car? In this game, upgrades are given out for winning races  there is no money, and there is no store. Furthermore, there are only a few upgrades  the tire choice are &quot;on road&quot; and &quot;off road&quot;. Just oversimplified, bullet point options. Forget spending hours in the garage getting your car just right. You can&apos;t even choose your car&apos;s color. I have more control over the visuals of this text than my car in &quot;Most Wanted&quot;.
<br>
<br>So how do you obtain new cars if there&apos;s no money and no stores? Do you unlock them as in Hot Pursuit, getting gradually better and better cars as you progress through the missions? No. You unlock them by finding them. With the exception of the cars the &quot;bosses&quot; drive (more on that in a minute) all the cars in the game are available right from the start, you just have to find them around the city. In fact, the city is littered with ridiculous collectables lifted from Burnout Paradise such as speed cameras, billboards, and &quot;jack spots&quot; (spots where you find cars). In fact, there are roughly 3 times as many Jack Spots as there are cars in the game, just to give you more pointless crap to find. &quot;Collect-a-thon&quot; type games haven&apos;t been in style since the N64 era, yet here we are in 2012 preforming extra fetch quests... in a racing game.
<br>
<br>And what of the famous Story from Most Wanted and it&apos;s sequel, Carbon? The interesting characters, the backstabbing gangs and the bounty hunter constantly after you? All gone. The &quot;story&quot; here begins with you driving towards the city and a narrator explains that you&apos;re trying to become the Most Wanted. That&apos;s it. Seriously, that&apos;s all there is  that makes The Run look like a masterpiece of storytelling. There are no other characters  no, not even the bosses  the final boss is literally named &quot;Most Wanted #01&quot;.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s not forget that Criterion apparently stole some design secrets from Zynga  this game constantly badgers you to badger your friends to buy the game. The autolog is here, but unlike the previous 2 games where it was a nice extra to the racing, this game seems to be an extra to the autolog, rather than the reverse. You are annoyed by the game to add your friends to such an extent that you might as well be playing Farmville EA, if we wanted to play a &quot;Social Game&quot; (PR speak for &quot;Bad Single-Player&quot;) we&apos;d go on Facebook.
<br>
<br>But what of the actual events? Well, before you start an event you need to drive to it. That&apos;s right  it&apos;s just like Most Wanted... if it lacked the &quot;Jump to Event&quot; feature. You need to have played an event once before you can jump to it. EA tried every trick in the book to pad their game, didn&apos;t they. At least the game gives you a way to set your destination, so you know where you&apos;re going. Every car has 5 events set up to it. But when you realize there are 40 something cars and only 60 something events, you realize that yes, EA wants you to race the same events again, that you have already defeated, using a different car.
<br>
<br>Once you actually get there (if the cops don&apos;t stop you) there are five different events it can be  Circuit Race, Sprint Race, Ambush, Speed Run, and &quot;Most Wanted&quot; (Boss). The races are Burnout style  with takedowns and crashes. The races aren&apos;t as fun as Burnout Revenge or Hot Pursuit because of one mistake  the racetrack. There are checkpoints on the course to tell you where to go, but it can be quite easy to get lost during a race. Keep in mind that in these races, crashing costs you a few seconds, but a wrong turn can assure you last place. What happened to the &quot;arrow barrier&quot; present in every other Need for Speed and Burnout title? It only shows up when it wants to. Yes, it&apos;s in the game, but it&apos;s not on every turn. It&apos;s like they didn&apos;t even finish the game yet.
<br>
<br>The sad fact here is that EA and Criterion might&apos;ve actually made a pretty good game if they took out all the padding  sure, it wouldn&apos;t be Most Wanted, but it would be a well-designed game. The Races, Cop Chases, and other fun events would be fantastic if they stood alone. There is fun to be had within this game, but it&apos;s buried under mountains of tedious collecting, &quot;Social&quot; pestering, and events you need to drive to. It&apos;s the equivalent of me adding another 5 pages to this review, but there&apos;s nothing but gibberish on them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3844411">Expand</a></span>

The title should read Burnout: With Cops, or if they were so adamant about it containing the Need for Speed title it should&apos;ve read Need for Speed: Least Wanted. There is absolutely NOTHING innovative about this game. This game is the product of cross-breeding between two titles, containing the worst possible genes and deformities between the two. There is absolutely no story-line, you&apos;re kind-of just thrown in a bright colored open-world. What to do now? Want to drive a Lamborghini Gallardo but don&apos;t feel like doing any work to get it? Great, just go find it on the mini-map and hop in it! Want to customize it? Sorry, those features were overlooked. Want to change the color to your favorite color? No worries! Drive through the magic repair shop where your car is instantly repaired and your car is randomly given a color. Don&apos;t like the color? No problem, just reverse through the repair shop and repeat until you get the color you want! Now, aside from the horrendous customization options, the handling in this game is among some of the worst racing games to date. The steering feels extremely clunky, heavy, and delayed. Say you try to avoid a car in front of you by slamming your throttle to the left, then try to correct yourself after you&apos;ve avoided the car, you&apos;ll usually end up slamming into the wall to your left before your car even begins to acknowledge the fact that you corrected yourself. This NORMALLY wouldn&apos;t be that much of an issue in a NFS title, but Criterion felt they had to add in their ridiculous &quot;slow-mo crash cam&quot; every time you so much as bump into something. In which case you&apos;ll be forced to watch your car flop about, and in some cases watch your car sit motionless after a pathetic accident. This is the kind of stuff that belongs on Arcade machines where you don&apos;t expect to be playing the same game for more than a couple repetitions. If you&apos;re not a fan of the Burnout series, save yourself the headache and frustration afterwards and avoid purchasing this horrendous title. Don&apos;t take my word for it if you don&apos;t believe me. Try it yourself either by purchasing or via trackers. I&apos;m pretty sure you&apos;ll come to a similar conclusion. If you want to play a similar title that&apos;s free-to-play without the terrible design choices by Criterion, try out Need for Speed World, as it is at least 10x better than this steaming load.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2726503">Expand</a></span>

You crash all the time and it screws your race. Also if you drive really well, you have that amazing rubber band effect!! In the year 2012 you`d think that EA sports might have the capability to make an realistic Ai!!</span>

Great graphics though, but that&apos;s the minimum they could do it. I&apos;m happy I played before buying, it would be a complete waste of money. Not recommended</span>

This game is note a successful redo of the last most wanted, getting new cars are as easy as driving around and saying &quot;oh look a bugatti veyron......MINE!&quot; no financial buy car trade car system, all these retarded points things, i mean you start off in a porche 911. theres no progression like the classic need for speed games when u have a **** car and progress to a nicer one threw wining pink slips or buying new cars, theres only 2 camera views(no in-car view) and the handling is just terrible, if you want to know what its like, duct tape a hippo to your roof and try drive, as well as there is no Manual transmission, need for speed franchise is on a downhill, and they are become the same as the Call of duty franchise in this regard, they need to pull something out of there asses to make this franchise a gem as it once was. I feel sorry for people who actually went out and bought the game, and ill say this again.... THIS IS WHY WE PIRATE, TO COMPENSATE FOR GAME DEVELOPERS TRYING TO SELL US ****TY WORTHLESS GAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2726525">Expand</a></span>

Kudos to Criterion for trying to showcase frostbite 2, but a giant minus for killing another NFS title. To summarize: The good: nice graphics, good sense of speed, burnout-type sense of speed/action, free roaming
<br>The bad:  the handling model is very poor since for some reason, they made all the cars handle the same (very minor variations between RWD, AWD and FWD); all cars feel like they weigh way too much, AI super speed-banding (ie. AI gets accelerated so that they can keep up with you) in both police chases as well as races, useless progression model (got bored within 30 minutes tbh), useless unlock model (again, no real feeling of progression) and absolutely pointless single-player. I`m sorry, but with such poor design choices, this is ``just another failed NFS title`` in my book. Sorry Criterion, I`ll give you a 2 for the graphics and because you made the original Burnout series, otherwise 0 for EA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2722287">Expand</a></span>

Completely unrealistic demonstration of these cars (except the exterior optics). Only two camera positions. Upgrade system is a joke. Gameplay is rather boring. We had these games even 20 years ago with higher quality levels regarding gameplay. If you want to have fun with driving nice and fast cars you should consider buying NFS: Shift 1/2 or something similar. This stuff is just boring and repetitive like hell.

<br>Also again it is annoying to see who the &quot;Critic Reviews&quot; get influenced by the payment of the publisher because I cannot imagine that the reviews are that high without any bribery. Once more you can realize that magazine reviews are not reliable at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2721206">Expand</a></span>

To start with the adverts, all the billboards you smash through are labelled with EA bought companies like DICE, BIOWARE etc... and this is far from a NFS title, its a Burnout title and I want my money back this game is just horrid.  First while your driving your constantly blinded by the super whiteout sun 25% of the time and even using the calibration, its subpar after calibration is still used for brightness and contrast, this is unacceptable.  Second is the lag with controllers.  Your usually hitting a lot of things because the car continues to turn even after you&apos;ve readjusted your stick on your controller, it just seems to still steer for a second after a lot, not always but a lot which makes driving unpredictable.  Having no customization options just sucks, whatever happened to need for speed underground where you could soop up your ride the way you wanted, with the parts you wanted and even the style.  Did you know there is NO MANUAL TRANSMISSION?!?!  This joke of a game you just drive through a gas station and your ride is instantly fixed and colour changed, COME ON can you get any more mickey mouse job of making a game than this?  The graphics are decent, nothing spectacular but this game is a MAJOR rush job and just quickly put together with social features nobody uses.  The cop chases usually last for an hour because they constantly are on your tail and so many keep respawning, its a joke.  I&apos;ve been parked by the side of the road my first time in the game, no heat on me, while I was setting up the settings and got back to game and BOOM a cop just busted me, this was f**ked!  The other annoying thing about this game is while your driving and hitting objects its like a cop&apos;s cherries are flashing behind you each time you hit an object, its very distracting and not sure why they are flashing white and blue when you hit any object like a light pole.
<br>
<br>SERIOUS GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!  After these few hours I seriously can&apos;t take it no more, this game is in the trash.  This game isn&apos;t even better than the RUN (the last NFS game) when it first game out and that is VERY BAD.  I really miss the games last the old most wanted where it had a story, if this game even had a story it would be something to play for, in its current state I don&apos;t ever want to play this game again.
<br>
<br>This game only gets a HURTING 2/10, I gave it 1 extra point cuz I didn&apos;t crash to desktop once at least.  Never again am I going to PreOrder a NFS title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2724821">Expand</a></span>

But I was wrong, completely wrong. First of all, you can&apos;t skip the intro when you start a new game. So, after waiting for that completely boring intro, there were the tutorials, totally annoying, and then, when I finally get to play it, It&apos;s nothing but Burnout Paradise (which I really like) with less colourful graphics, and a completely boring gameplay. I just hope they don&apos;t release a new NFS: Underground and ruin it like they did with MW. Please, if you&apos;re going to make a ridiculously bad game, don&apos;t name it as a game fans used to like years ago.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2723579">Expand</a></span>

I love the NFS series and have hours of fun with friends racing and competing on Autolog.  While these things still exist in Most Wanted i still feel like there is something missing from the experience. The handling took me a while getting used to and to be honest it rarely changes between car to car, providing no thrills from finding your next vehicle.  The use of the easydrive system is good, if not a little difficult to use while racing, but once you are used to it can be very effective. For me the longevity in this game is lacking it has been less than a month out and i am feeling my will to play just slip away.

<br>
<br>The good things about the game is the graphics are good and the map is great with cities and off-roads. The rest are not good or terrible.
<br>
<br>The main problem is the concept of the game. Everyone knows (truly not those who started playing from NFS14 yelling this game is awesome) the REAL Need For Speed Most Wanted (9th one) is about being the top illegal racer and revenge the No.1 most wanted. All you do in the game is to win races, do milestones (something nasty with the cops) and become the most dangerous speed racer in the game. Unfortunately, this game is quite boring. All you do is to EARN POINTS to be the &quot;Most Wanted&quot;. You don&apos;t need to care about the cops because you get NO PENALTY of losing your car or paying money when you get busted. You can simply just pull off when you get into a pursuit, getting busted and travel back to the spawn. Also, the most wanted list is a bunch of CARS, not PEOPLE. You race with the CARS because you want to get better cars, NOT beating people in your way to the fearsome dangerous illegal racer. The cars in the most wanted list is not stylized, just plain white. The whole concept is not being the MOST WANTED, it&apos;s just like earning stupid points or wins like Burnout.
<br>
<br>The second issue is the cars. It&apos;s really hilarious that you get cars by finding them in the street. You can simply find a Mercedes-Benz SLS or a Lamborghini Gallardo parking on sideways without reasons and you can get into the cars somehow and drive. Also, when you drive your car into the repair shop, it changes your car paint to a random colour without choosing not to. So, when you&apos;re driving a perfectly-matched yellow Lamborghini into a repair shop, it helps you to change to boring blue without allowing you to choose. You cannot personalize your car to make it look cooler and make the cops remember you and your car. It&apos;s simply awful.
<br>
<br>The physics of the cars are just terrible. The races have THE SAME PRINCIPLE AS YOU EXPERIENCE IN BURNOUT. You can simply just get invincible when you aim for an AI&apos;s back, push the nitrous button and the car will automatically crash for you. You can also crash somebody&apos;s car when you slightly hit the side of an AI and it will somehow wreck it for you. You can crash your car easily on the other hand by hitting a road car driving in the same direction with a speed of 120km/h and you get your car flipped by a million times. Criterion is smart by amplifying the &quot;boom&quot; to an extent that you feel it&apos;s really a big crash, when you get the exact same sound when you&apos;re driving a Bugatti in high speed and you crash the exact same car. This is so Burnout, not a normal NFS game.
<br>
<br>Ah, forgot to mention the soundtracks/sound effects in the game. Simply just plain. If you get excited when you&apos;re racing (I doubt if anyone will feel the excitement of driving and racing in this game), it&apos;s definitely not about the sounds.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s easy to conclude the game in one sentence: It&apos;s another fast-food game produced by Criterion using the remarkable &quot;Need For Speed Most Wanted&quot; name to cover &quot;Burnout: Cops and robot cars&quot;. It&apos;s also good to conclude the game by saying it&apos;s a rip-off.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3895912">Expand</a></span>

The online is kind of hit or miss for me...they reward crashing WAY too much.  Nobody races with any finesse they just fly around slamming into you all the time.  And WTF is up with the speed trials and challenge events!?!  This is supposed to be a racing game!!  In some events you actually have to try and PARK your car longer than anyone else in a specific spot!!  That&apos;s right...the object is to PARK your car?!?!  What the heck is Criterion thinking!?!?!  After the awesomeness that was NFS: The Run, I had high hopes for this game but if you ask me Criterion screwed up just about every single aspect of this game and sucked all the fun right out of the online game.  This is definitely one to avoid for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2738720">Expand</a></span>

Long story short, this game is a piece of garbage and waste of my money. The biggest disappointment of my week. This is the first racing game where you only have 2 camera change options. Since I am used to playing all my games with the **** cam this game is completly usless to me!! The far view changes so often its hard to keep control of the car and I cant read a lot of the menu words either. I like the concept of the new game even though I cannot play it, it just feels like an unfinished game to me.

<br>First of all, pointless single player just race around get points beat some rivals get their cars, that&apos;s it.
<br>Secondly, AWFUL seriously AWFUL handling, adding the fact of the input lag the cars drive like bricks there is rarely occasions where you can drive trough lots of traffic, eventually you will crash with something on your way.
<br>Race breaking AI: they crash you whenever they get the chance and make  you get smoked against walls or anything, with the addition of the annoying crash cam they added that makes you loose all your positions, it&apos;s almost impossible to win a race in medium without 5 or 6 retries.
<br>Terribly annoying police: Have you ever seen a Ford Crown Victoria Police car go 280+km/h? If you did not here you can see it, not only they can break the speed of sound but they are tanks literally they will smash you down no matter how hard you try to avoid them, on police chases it&apos;s not a problem but on races where you managed to get past around 7 cars that are on now your tail police cars ramming at you and totaling your car its seriously deserves a rage time.
<br>Race line: I just red IGN&apos;s review saying the closed racing line is annoying, how is that possible? I find far more annoying having to go trough checkpoints without the chance of using shortcuts or using a parallel road I mean if you are going to do an open racing game without barriers on the road they should at least let you take secondary roads or use shortcuts but no, you have to follow the racing line and make no mistakes because you will have to turn 180&#xB0; and head on back to the annoying checkpoint you missed.
<br>Small map: Overall map is the size of a Most Wanted 2005 district nuff said.
<br>0%  Unlocks: You can unlock and drive a Lamborghini Aventador, Bugatti Veyron SS, Koenigsegg Agera R, by just finding them and spending 0$, just pointless and boring I remember when I used to play games like Most Wanted, and seeing the SLR McLaren that was unlocked after beating the 3rd blacklist racer and I was like : &quot;Damn I gonna have to work a lot to get that awesome car.&quot; Now that feeling is unexistent.
<br>No customization: I played HP 2 from 2002 and yes there was no customization but at least you could choose the color from your car, now you get a random color everytime you go trough the shop. In the end this is a game for a very very casual player who have never played a really good NFS title and only wants to race dumbly with his friends.
<br>
<br>PD: Thank god I got a pirated version of it, I was going to try it and then buy now I won&apos;t waste my cash.
<br>I recommend to PC players to torrent it, don&apos;t waste your 60$/50</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2719520">Expand</a></span>

If you look at it as a NFS game, it&apos;s worth 2 or 3. Looking at it as a Burnout with cops and licensed cars, it&apos;s a good game. The cars do feel too heavy, the game is one of the worst ports on PC I&apos;ve seen recently. At first glance, it seems to have graphics options, but don&apos;t be deceived. You can&apos;t change VSync and refresh rate. There&apos;s only one option for textures: high res on and off. My GTX 580 (which runs any other game maxed out no problem) cannot run this at all high. It has severe frame drops. Even on medium and low shadows, there are frame spikes. I was playing with a PS3 controller and got used to the driving mechanics quickly. Single player is easy and lasts about 5-6 hours. Multiplayer is fun, burnout paradise challenges pretty much. Another thing that annoys me a lot is just the overall slow feeling, when you change a car or finish a race, you&apos;ll have to stare at your car with no HUD until the stats of it go away. This is just unnecessary and stupid, it&apos;s wasted time every time. Another thing are EA&apos;s complete and utterly horrible servers, more precisely Autolog. It doesn&apos;t stay connected more than 10 minutes and when it does connect, it DOWNLOADS your progress not uploads. That means while you&apos;re disconnected all the speed points you earn will not be uploaded once you reconnect during the game. It will only if you quit and reopen the game. Also, Origin doesn&apos;t sync save games. I should mention that I paid 1/3 of the price for it and based on that, I did not waste money. I give it a 7 despite the problems, but just barely. TL;DR Bad NFS game, OK racing game, good Burnout. Horrible PC port.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2731139">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Secondly, and basically it is even worse than stuttering graphics (well 30fps is playable), commands lag, everyone (well most of us) play with analog devices (like xbox 360 pad), but the game basically doesn&apos;t care, the more you want to turn the longer you press, and the car only react a second after your input, it is barely impossible to pass by another car at the last second, so if you chose bad lane before doing a turn, you&apos;ll be in the ass of another car
<br>
<br>So I love burnout paradise, but this game is not even as good as BP was so, it is a big NO to EA, after the FIFAs on Vita, now this, if they want the players to stop buying their games, they can just stop making them, we don&apos;t need this crap
<br>
<br>They need to patch it, quick and good</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2723047">Expand</a></span>

This game is a huge disappointment for almost any nfs fan out there... and i`m talking about the ones who played the whole series from the first installment, who know that after nfs hot pursuit, the series slowly died. The only reason why i`m giving this game a 5/10 is that it has great graphics ,great sounds/music, but these things can`t make up for the bad and unrealistic handling of the cars, the stupid crashes with traffic cars, stupid a.i, stupid cops, fps drops, pop-ups that appear on screen in front of you that block the whole view and so on... And above all, this game is dumbed down hard (that easydrive system is s**t) it has only 2 camera views, a pretty small map, no garage, no shops, no customization, no story and no purpose at all. Overall this is bad experience and i suggest you buy something else
<br>
<br>PS: In my opinion nfs hp 2010 was better than this one, this shows once again that history repeats itself, by that i mean: what happened to ea is happening to criterion, but much earlier (next game will be even worse,if there will be a next one)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2727412">Expand</a></span>

I think the phrase &quot;some polish and no spit&quot; seems to sum it up for me. No storyline.
<br>No continuity.
<br>No sense of immersion. Here is car. Drive car. Win race. Get chased. Ad   nauseum. Ad infinitum.
<br>
<br>The graphics may be pretty and detailed for a console, but for a high-end pc like mine? It&apos;s no challenge. FPS locked at 60. Sometimes dipping into the high 50&apos;s. It looks like the washed- out console port it is. It&apos;s pretty awful is more like it. Adjusting options in-game is a joke. it just looks worse.
<br>
<br>And then lets get to the game-play. I&apos;m not going to crtitique the car-handling much. Let&apos;s just say its much of a muchness with very little feel or difference between the cars. An Evoque is an Aventador. Just slower. But the AI? It varies from &quot;Oh my God that was brilliant!&quot; to &quot;WTF??? Did that cop just run into the road-block head-on?&quot; &quot;Umm...I turn left and a cop APPEARS FROM NOWHERE right in front of me on an empty road?&quot; And the last Most Wanted chase they must have figured that its not going to be much  of a challenge as the slightest touch from the Koeniggsegg Agera sends your impact-protected and chassis-reinforced Lamborghini Aventador skidding wildly out of control while a perfectly executed hit on the rear 3/4 panel of the Agera barely moves it. And in one bewilderingly inexplicable moment, I deflect the Agera up an off-ramp to only see it appear seconds later in FRONT of me! How did it go up the off-ramp, 180-degree turn, back down, another 180 and then catch me doing over 280kph? Really. That&apos;s piss-poor and lazy-ass programming.
<br>
<br>Multi-player? Still to make up my mind on that but so far NOT IMPRESSED. But I won&apos;t let me initial impressions are of a chaotic confusing mess that with some effort you can get going and do...stuff.
<br>
<br>Anyway: to sum up. Pretty disappointing for PC-gamers, as usual EA and Criterion have kicked the pc-users in the teeth again delivering a console game for the pc. Up next are the lack of updates, lack of DLC and general support for the platform that single-handedly kept EA &quot;In the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2738908">Expand</a></span>

Overall though the lack of story and somewhat repetitive game-play could turn a lot of gamers off, but believe me, when it&apos;s fun, Its really fun.</span>

New cars are just given to you yet there&apos;s only 5 races per car...that you can only attempt with THAT car! The crash cam is annoying and ruins the intense chases that made the original Most Wanted so fun. Don&apos;t buy this game.</span>

This game is just a combination of NFS: Undercover (which I really hated) &amp; Burnout Paradise (which I really liked). It has no manual transmission, poor handling, bumper cam &amp; chase cam only, the city is very small, no car customizations &amp; modifications, no currency, no story, cheating AI (SUVs that can catch up with supercars), &amp; most of all, there&apos;s no distinct character milieu like in the original Most Wanted. Flashy graphics doesn&apos;t always mean a good game. It&apos;s not worth the money. This game should be boycotted. EA better not touch NFS: High Stakes next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2731259">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is Burnout Paradise 2 not Most Wanted!  That&apos;s my quick review :D

PROS:

Nice GFX, runs well on my PC - AMD quad 3.4ghz, GTX470 8gig 1333mhz corsair ram, WIN7 64bit.
Free roaming.
Nice sound FX for cars, engines, creaking chassis etc.
Great fun for Burnout fans.

<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>
<br>Music is crap, load of dubstep junk.
<br>No **** cam or hood/bonnet cam.
<br>No gears for wheel owners eg G25/G27
<br>Loading screens between race retry/restart.
<br>No Story mode you just get thrown in and left to it.
<br>
<br>I have mixed feelings about this game, overall I like it but there seems to be a lot of things missing and some really stupid design choices - External Camera or Bumper Camera which means you get to see the world as if your face is stapled to the road, I don&apos;t like external cams and the absence of a bonnet/hood cam or a **** cam has FAIL written all over it.
<br>
<br>You don&apos;t feel like you are a real person trying to be most wanted as there is no story and the game sort of feels a bit empty and pointless.
<br>
<br>This game is NOT Most Wanted, as others have said (even before release) it is Burnout Paradise 2.  If like me you loved BP then you will like this, even though cars are given to you just by driving past key spots around the map you have to win races for the specific car to earn its upgrade which is ok for an arcade racer but takes the sense of achievement out of the game.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll give this an 8 because it IS A GOOD GAME, but yet again EA have released another NFS that is not NFS it&apos;s Burnout with the Police chasing you.
<br>
<br>Sorry if this review is mixed up but I&apos;m still trying to work out why this is called NFS:Most Wanted and not Burnout - Yes I said it again!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2731861">Expand</a></span>

The main problem with this is that it&apos;s not optimized for PC. You may want to go straight to your &quot;Criterion Games&quot; folder in My Documents and in the cfg file set LockAt30fps to true. This is not something you should have to do with any game, let alone one designed for casual gamers. 30 FPS does suit the game well though. A recent patch has fixed many problems with regards to controllers and framerates though. In terms of the brick-like heavy handling and the seeming &quot;auto-correct&quot; when steering; just remember that this game is made for non-racers. If, like me, you&apos;re used to super-sharp and technical driving you need to break out of the precision mindset and just throw the car about more generally, since in more hardcore racing games the smallest input at the wrong time can lead to a disaster. Here you need to be aggressive, so it can take some getting used to if you&apos;re serious about your racing games. As for more general downsides, this game lacks any real depth in terms of single player content. It wouldn&apos;t be as empty if the leaderboards were more focused globally rather than on friends. Indeed if you have no friends who play the game all the speedwalls are pointless as always. But this game is designed with mutliplayer first, as stated by Criterion. Hence, the single player is just a free-roam messabout arena rather than the main chunk. The title has caused much confusion. The 2005 game is my 15th favourite game ever (at time of writing). However, Criterion have stated (see Wikipedia article on this game) that their intention was NOT to make a sequel to the original masterpiece. And so it follows that the concept behind the title is being &quot;Most Wanted&quot; amongst your friends. Like in NFS Hot Pursuit, the handling is very arcade and there is no manual transmission. However the city of Fairhaven resembles that of Most Wanted 2005 so you get a good mix of urban twisty roads and inner city centre. The design philosophy for the single player is to keep it very simple and basic. So no budget to manage, no garage, no consequences for getting busted, no special cars or upgrades to unlock from levelling up or whatever. Just very simply: Whatever car you find, you can drive.  The graphics are obviously state-of-the-art; and you&apos;d expect them to be given the system requirements. Compared to Hot Pursuit 2010, there&apos;s no innovation, and handling is inferior to that in The Run. The lack of manual transmission doesn&apos;t help matters. But unlike The Run this game doesn&apos;t have any camera issues, and it&apos;s not linear; it&apos;s free-roam. I like the concept and the game does feel very modern, with an excellent choice of cars which do handle slightly differently (although once again, not comparable to The Run&apos;s handling). This game is not sophisticated, and this is with great delibration. Infact, the emphasis is on the pick-up-and-play, do what you want whenever you want without having to grind through a half-arsed story - kind of thing. If you&apos;re expecting a sequel, then you have either been mislead by the title or deeply misinformed of the game&apos;s intentions. All in all it&apos;s a great game but the technical issues on the PC version on launch and the lack of emphasis on global leaderboards position if you don&apos;t have any friends is dissapointing; given that Autolog has been around for quite some time now. Nevertheless, it&apos;s definitely the game I would recommend to someone who has never tried a racing game. Everyone who thinks that this game is multiplayer only or is not worth getting if you&apos;re planning to mainly or only play single player is lying. When you consider how many cars there are in the game, and that there are 5 races for each, there are upgrades to unlock for each which have their distinct advantages and disadvantages and can be changed at any point even during a race, and the upgrades themselves have &quot;Pro&quot; versions (just as perks in Call of Duty have Pro versions); add in the 60-odd speed cameras and over a hundred billboards to smash and also trying to beat your best time on each race or get more points on each pursuit without having to worry about getting busted and paying a hefty fine - you get the idea. Basically, the amount of content in the single player is actually more than meets the eye if you want to do everything. Variety isn&apos;t great but is sufficient to keep it feeling satisfying. The city is tiny but it&apos;s used so well it feels bigger than it actually is. The cars sound great, have nice colour schemes, and SFX is generally high quality. When you consider that you get the best-looking racing game to date by a large margin with some of the finest cars around in a very casual drop-in/drop-out environment where there is still motive to unlock things but not the main part, it&apos;s very pleasing and relaxing. The difficulty of the races is pretty good if not a little too hard, especially for casuals. Overall, fantastic work Criterion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2730435">Expand</a></span>

Among my complaints are: horrible handling, lack of camera options, and the horribly artsy and lengthy cut-scenes prior to each race. The only thing I enjoyed about this game is some of the soundtrack. I highly suggest just renting this if you want to play it. Do not waste money on this.</span>

I was shocked to see what a piece of crap this was. Customization is my favourite thing in racing games and a racing game without customization is not worth to play in my opinion , NFS was the last title for me to expect that situation. I mean WHAT THE HELL?? At least let me choose the paint!? It does let you choose paint in multiplayer but that requires you to do extremely long tasks for a selection between 5 colors.I couldn&apos;t believe the crap I was playing so I kept playing for 4 days , I waited for a patch to solve the steering and fps problem , I became the number 1 most wanted in singleplayer (which is the end of the storyline , If you could call that a storyline) and played a few hours on multiplayer.I gave this game too many chances and it failed me every time. I would give it a 0.5 for the good selection of cars but there&apos;s no such score in the chart so I give it a 0 and promise not to buy another NFS title made by criterion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2728210">Expand</a></span>

So with these hardware, you would think it shouldn&apos;t be a problem running this game right? WRONG. This game&apos;s first obvious flaw is its terrible optimization. Even when you have a HIGH END GPU you would still be running at around 40-50FPS dropping down to about 30 FPS in the tunnels, something is obviously very wrong here, and forget about overclocking your GPU since the GPU usage barely reach 80% it wouldn&apos;t help at all. 2nd flaw is the cars handling. All the cars in this game felt like you are driving a brick, it felt so heavy and it hard to turn around. Another problem is that since EA is advertising this game as a reboot to the Most Wanted IP, you would think that this game would include everything that the original Most Wanted did so well, a good storyline, some insane customization, pursuit breakers, speedbreaker and more, but NO. Instead, they threw out everything that made the original Most Wanted so memorable and threw in everything that came from Burnout Paradise, smashing billboards, instant repair cars, takedowns blahblah, and Burnout Paradise still runs better and plays better than this game...And also the cheating AI, the cops even though you are driving at 300KM/H they would  still catch up to you no problem and the roadblocks are seriously almost impossible to go through when they are using SUVs although in the original Most Wanted you can pass through SUV by ramming the rear, and now spike stripes have a blinking yellow light to warn you and after you entered cooldown mode, for some unknown reason when you take a shortcut, the cops will still follow you into the shortcuts, SERIOUSLY, DID YOUR CAR HAVE SOME SORT OF MAGNETIC TRACKING DEVICE???!!!!...And also since all cars are already unlocked in the beginning, the sense of leveling up and improving is gone since in the original game you would have to defeat certain Blacklist drivers to unlock cars. car parts, performance upgrades and more. Simply put, this game is very disappointing and a waste of money. The name Most Wanted is just for advertising and nothing inside is even related to the original game, except the most wanted list, but in the original its called the BLACKLIST, not the MOST WANTED LIST ZZZ, even Burnout Paradise is much better compared to this</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2728769">Expand</a></span>

Need for Speed games have always had a place for customization, Burnout games have not. All need for speed games had a garage you could choose your car from, and customize it with more than just the paint job (Save for Criterion&apos;s previous Hot Pursuit)

First off it looks pretty darn good on the PC. People saying it&apos;s a straight port obviously didn&apos;t catch that it has a high definition texture pack that I know the consoles don&apos;t use so they did put SOME thought into the PC but not nearly as much as I would like the graphics menu still doesn&apos;t have a lot of options a &quot;Made for PC&quot; game has. It sounds good most the cars sound somewhat like you expect and the music score is acceptable. Nothing special but it gets the job done without becoming annoying. The AI in the game can be challenging at times especially the police when you aren&apos;t in the greatest car to get away from them but other racers aren&apos;t terribly hard or aggressive. The story is like most stories in every racing game out there. It&apos;s stupid and easily forgotten and doesn&apos;t really matter. Who in the world buys a racing game for it&apos;s story I&apos;ll never know. I hate the way most the cars handle in the game. It&apos;s not arcade but it&apos;s not simulation it&apos;s somewhere in the middle which makes all the cars feel like they handle like crap. It has it&apos;s Burnout moments from time to time with the crashes and the racing which is a nice touch by Criterion Gaming but you can&apos;t help but feel EA was prolly really reluctant to allow them to add what they did. You can&apos;t customize your car that much but there are a few things that make your cars better for certain situations and can vastly differ how your cars handle but if you came here wanting to go all out on cars like some you can in Forza/GT5 and the like you will be left out. If you like arcade racing games then you may want to try this game out to see if you like it. It has it&apos;s moments when it&apos;s fun but the actual act of driving for me is ruined by the way all the cars feel and handle on the road with their in the middle of simulation and arcade feel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2729737">Expand</a></span>

<br>THE GOOD: A big world, decent graphics, high poly cars, clearly some effort made for the PC version (AO, HD textures, etc)
<br>
<br>THE BAD: HANDLING: Its totally not fun, you will be ramming into stuff every 30 sec or so; and unlike other arcade racers, here every ram is a 3 second crash cam; feels like the game is constantly penalizing you for traffic/obstacles you just can&apos;t avoid.
<br>
<br>NO CUSTOMIZATION: No need to buy cars or customize them, basically means there isn&apos;t a purpose to your racing, in fact you cant even choose the color of your car. RACE STRUCTURE: You can only play 5 races with each car. You like the Ford GT? Well you can free roam in it, or replay those 5 races, gawd so many options!
<br>
<br>NOT A SINGLE PLAYER GAME: Bottomline, this is not a single player game; just the fact that the game can be played in SP doesn&apos;t make it one. It should have been advertised as such.
<br>
<br>CONCLUSION: This is neither Burnout nor NFS, something in between that just doesn&apos;t make the grade. Buy only if you are a MP player and don&apos;t care about SP.
<br>
<br>Sadly for me this is the death of a beloved series, its been all downhill from U2/Most Wanted; and NFS just doesn&apos;t have a soul left anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2742895">Expand</a></span>

The car handling is too &quot;heavy&quot;, the camera choices are horrible. All in all, wasted money.</span>

EA wants to know what the bare minimum is, how little effort they can put in a game and still profit from it. Sure, people may accuse them of being perverted spawns from the nether regions of hell, but why should they give a damn, the mainstream public is still more then willing to provide them with do$h. It pains me greatly to see that the &quot;Need For Speed&quot; franchise has become the main victim of these heinous practices. EA rant aside, the game did show some promise, there were a few interesting ideas,albeit poorly executed because EA rushed the development cycle in order to fulfill their satanic duties. But this simple fact gives me hope that the people at Criterion at least care about the series. The 2010 &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot;, the first of the NFS series they made, was actually decent. Then again EA weren&apos;t  the dark lords of the underworld back then. Aside from that this really is a bare bones game and a horrible port.The framerate drops to 20-30 at times on my R9 270, perhaps people with Nvidia cards are doing better. But let&apos;s not forget that our delightful fiends at EA have done their homework, they know that the mainstream players of racing games are console users, so they don&apos;t really give a single duck-toothed f**k about you, Mr. PC User. If you are, of course, ready to surrender all your belongings and/or soul to EA, I am sure the will happily patch your game. Perhaps this review is not very objective due to the fact that I played this game for about an hour, because of reasons mentioned above and perhaps my great love for the wonderful corporation EA has also clouded my judgement. But for now I must conclude this review in order to sacrifice little puppies in my basement and drink their blood to appease our almighty overlords,Electronic Arts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=4210068">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>When I heard about this game coming out I was pretty stoked because I&apos;d already played NFS MW1 from back in the xbox original days - so I was expecting great things. Sadly...not many of those great things happened.  In fact I&apos;m not so sure any happened.
<br>
<br>The game has a decent mix of cars, but there are many &quot;jackspots&quot; that consist of the same car. When you&apos;re left to run around looking for these jackspots you&apos;d expect to find the experience of finding one to be a little more rewarding than just another Lamborghini, or just another Volkswagen or just another whatever - the whatever being a repeat model of the manufacturer&apos;s car you&apos;ve already found somewhere else.
<br>
<br>The game in it&apos;s origins, had oodles of originality as far as the NFS franchise was concerned. Speedbreaking was really handy to get out of tight spots with the cops, or to avoid head on smashes with walls at sharp corners. This doesn&apos;t even exist in the second one. I dunno why. It just doesn&apos;t. But clearly it needs it because driving any car in the game using a keyboard, is akin to either driving a tank, or driving on a skidpan. Criterion and EA pretty much annoyed me immensely with this game.
<br>
<br>Every crash cutscene will eventually drive you completely stark raving bonkers. EVERY. crash. If this is it&apos;s attempt at trying to be like Burnout it doesn&apos;t work, it just sucks worse than Burnout ever did (which if memory serves me well - it didn&apos;t).  Initially I was impressed, I liked the graphics, the intro FMV sequences for the most wanted cars are sharp and snazzy and in all cases, rather smooth. But that&apos;s about as sharp, snazzy and smooth as it&apos;s ever going to get in game. This game single-handedly destroys the fun that was NFS MW and tries to bring too much of a different experience to it&apos;s predecessor to make it even moderately enjoyable. The rewards system is pretty dire, the racing structure is dull - you have to repeat the same process over and over and over again, for EVERY car - the cutscenes will most definitely vex you if you get to driving any of the faster cars (although despite all the badmouthing I&apos;m giving this game, the Bugatti Veyron is a lot of fun, all crash cutscenes aside). I found the logic of the game pretty tough not to mention blindingly unfair. This game seriously punishes you for sucking at driving. If you don&apos;t have the patience, and you do get pissed off watching repeat performances of crash after crash, you may well end up - like me - not really liking this game all that much. What&apos;s worse is that for instance, smashing through a roadblock may bring you screeching to a halt, but during the cut scene (yet another cut scene) you&apos;ll see that bloody AI car boosting on by having smashed through the roadblock and not even slowing down due to contact made. It&apos;s vexing at worst, and really rage worthy at best. The only slight enjoyment in this game, with it&apos;s seemingly smaller than usual map (is it just me or does that map look much smaller in comparison to NFSMW1?) are some of the really good looking locations, and the jumps (so long as you don&apos;t bloody crash at the end of them) can be a bit of good fun for a few minutes until you get bored and go looking for another one. But that&apos;s it. My ultimate bone of contention with this game, is it&apos;s lack of any personalized customization. There are no vinyls, no stickers, no custom paints no NOTHING. That was some of the best fun to be had in the original and they took it right out. So much wrong with this game it&apos;s difficult to really pick out any extremely positive bits.
<br>PC gaming at it&apos;s worst on this one. The worst of the lot though, is the ultimate design flaw. The &apos;on-the-fly&apos; menu which you access by pressing the right arrowed 6 key on the number pad. For whatever reason, I&apos;m assuming that Criterion assumes we have as many limbs as an octopus with which to mess about menus whilst driving a car at over 60 mph or more. Whichever complete total donkeybrain came up with this idea, really didn&apos;t think that far ahead, or with an open mind. If you have an xbox controller on your PC, it may not be a problem, but if you&apos;re stuck with a keyboard, you&apos;re screwed. That &quot;on the fly menu&quot; used to be a pause menu - accessed by pressing a button during the driving session you were having, and then you could tweak the car at leisure, and then resume driving and hey presto the changes were done. This game expects you to stop the car, make the changes, and then carry on driving. This is kind of dumb as **** if you&apos;re driving off road and the situation demands spontaneously accessing the menu to change the tires to the &apos;off-road&apos; variety, when there are a dozen cops up your tailpipe. This game....not something to be proud of. Not something to be proud of at all. I hope EA even remotely care enough to hang their hang their heads in shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2889856">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Coming off the dismal &quot;Need for Speed: The Run&quot; last year, I was glad to hear Criteron was getting back to the style of &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot;, the pinnacle of the modern NFS games. About three hours after firing this up, pumped as ever, I had to stop out of sheer frustration. First, the good. It seems as if there is a massive list of cars in this game. Ranging for the Bugatti Veyron to the Ford Shelby GT, each car is faithfully represented on the screen.
<br>
<br>The graphics in the game are quite good but for me, they didn&apos;t look all too different from 2010&apos;s &quot;Hot Pursuit&quot;. There are a few exceptions which I&apos;ll get into but overall, the game is still great to look at. The Bad.
<br>
<br>First, the controls feel incredibly sluggish. If you put Hot Pursuit at one end of the spectrum and The Run on the other, Most Wanted falls right in the middle. Perhaps I&apos;m biased because I absolutely love the fast paced, arcade style controls of HP but MW falls disappointingly short. I didn&apos;t feel like I was in control of the car a lot of the times, especially if I was rubbing up against a wall. The amount of precision it takes to move away from the wall without slamming into the opposite one, feels inappropriate in this type of game. In Gran Turismo, this may work but I feel for a street racing game it&apos;s frustrating as all hell. I understand that upgrades can remedy this but you&apos;ll be repeating events so many times to get those upgrades the controls will start to wear on you.
<br>
<br>Rubber-banding and teleporting of opponents is commonplace in the NFS franchise unfortunately. Even my favorite, HP, is guilty of this. However in this game, it feels slightly unfair and here&apos;s why: At the beginning when you first obtain a car, you need to race for your upgrades including your boost. As far as I can tell, this happens with every single car (which is annoying to race for your boost on your car every single time). These races are already stacked against the player who already has enough to deal with when racing a new car, since each handles differently. Lack of boost, new car and rubber banding/teleporting in a preliminary race is way too much to throw at someone in the first race. The graphics, while beautiful, can be incredibly distracting. I remember during one race, I had the sun facing in my eyes for the entire time. I couldn&apos;t see a damn thing. Now this might work if the computer racers were somewhat affected, but they aren&apos;t. The amount of dust cars kick up also seems to be too much. In here lies a key problem with this game: It can&apos;t decide whether to be an arcade racing game or a simulator a la Gran Turismo. On one hand, the environmental effects scream &quot;simulation&quot; while slamming into a wall at 200/mph and driving away after multiple barrel rolls says &quot;arcade&quot;. Mixing the two makes for a frustrating experience. Constant frame-rate issues also seem to plague the PC port but along with controls, it&apos;s not something new coming from a console focused title. However, it doesn&apos;t make it right. With virtually the same set up between the two, HP seems to have no frame-rate issues nor touchy control problems. The setting is incredibly bland, not to mention that this city feels incredibly similar to Burnout: Paradise&apos;s. Each race feels the same with slightly different turns. I think the series could have used some sort of plot device where it allowed for racing in different surroundings, like snowy rocky mountains or big canyons.
<br>
<br>The Indifferent
<br>
<br>There is really no story to NFS: MW. Then again, I don&apos;t necessarily play racing games for their story so this wasn&apos;t an issue for me but I could see how people feel less inclined to continue up the ranks. Different personalities for the &quot;Most Wanted&quot; drivers could have been neat but again, not really a necessity. The music is really nothing to write home about. You got your rock, your dubstep, blah blah blah. Typically they get drowned out by the constant crashing and smashing of cars that you&apos;ll barely notice there&apos;s any music. The sound overall is fantastic though, as each car has a distinct sound (as it should). Conclusion
<br>
<br>It may seem like I hate this game, but I really don&apos;t. I&apos;m just incredibly disappointed with the end product after being hyped about this being the spiritual successor to Hot Pursuit. In the end, if you enjoy the NFS series as a whole, it&apos;s probably worth a rental. Anyone else may have a hard time staying interested after a few days.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2898018">Expand</a></span>

EA has told its developers since ProStreet onwards that graphics are more important than gameplay. I find this a complete insult to the entire series, but more over, an even greater insult to the original developers (Black Box, as they are now known) of Most Wanted. This game ruins every single aspect that made the original fun, and then further rubs salt into the wound through its utilization of the terrible AutoLog system.

<br>Gameplay is terrible, 250 kmg drifting on wet asphalt through 90+ degree corners is just ridiculous. It&apos;s so bad that I dont have words for it. Collision and everything physics related is stuper bad.

As others say, it&apos;s a mashup of Burnout Paradise and Hot Pursuit - with nothing in common with the original except the title.  There are no challenges beyond racing (Speed Cameras are implemented totally differently), no environmental destruction to be used to throw off cops, no story, no reason to climb the ladder because most cars are available to you from the start (and the ones you &quot;win&quot; are far from worth it).  Gamers giving this good reviews clearly never played the original or a fans of Criterion&apos;s other games (which I am  not).  I really was hoping for a clean re-do of NFS: MW with all the features that made the original amazing still intact.  Far from it.  Very disappointed - should have re-installed Hot Pursuit instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2750647">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now when this game took the name of &apos;Most wanted&apos; &amp; so they should have at-least tried to make another most wanted not another Burnout Paradise. Well as most of the people now know that this game is made by Criterion who are well known for Burnout series &amp; for NFS HP 2010; one thing was sure that this game will have elements similar to those previous games &amp; this ruined the whole most wanted experience. I can get 2 better games at unbeatable price right away i.e. NFS MW 2005 BE &amp; Burnout paradise Ultimate Ed.
<br>
<br>Now lets look at Pros &amp; Cons from actual game-play :-
<br>
<br>Pros :-
<br>Better graphics than previous MW game &amp; some enjoyable races (There are only a few as most races are repeated no. of times)
<br>
<br>Cons :-
<br>Everything else from new NFS MW game falls in this category..... No story, No money, Game plays like burnout (Crash sequences), Few customizations (when compared with old games), Fewer camera angles, No manual transmission option (Oldest NFS feature), Not ported properly for PC&apos;s (sudden frame drops) &amp; the rivals are either very easy &amp; not challenging at all or too difficult &amp; all the challenge you get is when you try to obtain best parts for a car.
<br>
<br>This game is just not &apos;Most wanted&apos; it is another Burnout but you can get better entertainment from burnout paradise than this. Also there are is no re-playability factor as i upgraded my first car completely by winning all it&apos;s races &amp; was easily able to beat all 10 most wanted racers from it &amp; not only that i took their cars with it as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2820514">Expand</a></span>

Once configured to your specs the game is actually very enjoyable.  Nothing like the original but still lots of fun driving around at high speeds.  Cars are way to easy to get and after a handful of races with each there is really no reason to use it.  There is no story or progression besides taking down the top 10 most wanted.  The city feels empty and pursuits are very easy.  Cops basically throw themselves at you, roadblocks are static and will not pursue you.  Building heat is very easy and escaping pursuits is very boring as cops catch up to you from a dead stop almost instantly.  Crashes are way overdone in both SP and MP.  Multiplayer is somewhat fun if you mute everyone but again it is high speed bumper cars.  I love racing games and have played all the NFS games.  Yet this one just seems empty, its just about driving cars and nothing else.  The DLC is just more cars.  I was really unhappy at first but after a couple weeks it grew on me.  All the cars are fun to drive there just really isn&apos;t any feeling of accomplishment in the game.
<br>
<br>Overall it is a good game.  However the lack of patches and communication kills it.
<br>Criterion basically shut down their forums and won&apos;t respond to any problems.
<br>EA tries to help on their forums but it is frustrating because they can&apos;t do anything about it.
<br>The game crashes on one race &apos;Every time&apos; and caused a corrupt save.
<br>Now the game won&apos;t even start up even after a repair of the install which found no errors.
<br>Many people are getting save problems that is causing them to delete and start all over.
<br>I would rent it if you really want to play it on console, but on PC its just a mess.
<br>How can you make a game and then ignore your customers?  Not fix problems but yet push out DLC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/need-for-speed-most-wanted---a-criterion-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=3123186">Expand</a></span>

I am so disappointed. I got so frustrated with this game that I actually hit alt-f4 from this game. No redeeming qualities what so ever. I hope this never happens again.</span>

<br>Every car I found (yeah, there&apos;re just super cars standing around the city just for people to pick up and race) drives the same, the driving model is just awful (what kind of supercar needs 50 m to stop to zero from 80km/h?) and the tracks are really straightforward (because the driving model cannot handle turning your car that goes ape**** above 80km/h). You don&apos;t really start any race, it just throws you in, every now and then you&apos;re put outside the actual game with cut-scenes after crashing, etc. Also the awful flow of the screen on super high speeds and just rubbish soundtrack made me want to puke after 30 minutes.
<br>Now, I&apos;ve installed the original Most Wanted to see if it&apos;s just me that grew to hate racing games.
<br>No, the original Most Wanted is still a great game.

Criterion Game and EA really needs to re-work this. WAAAASTED money, no doubt. I&apos;m truly dissapointed.
