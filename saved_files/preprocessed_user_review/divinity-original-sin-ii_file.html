<br>A bold way to start a review, but think of the best RPG you have ever played, and then think of the best developers to back it up.  Larian is humble, open, and inspired and they have poured those feelings and skills into this game.
<br>
<br>To be honest, when playing through early access the only think I felt was missing was Voice acting.  I understood of course the challenge that would be required to do it right and I respected the fact that Larian had at least considered it. Without requesting more money or making excuses, they made if feasible, did it in secret, and released it as a gift.
<br>
<br>DOS2 has fantastic graphics, fantastic story, amazing mechanics, and challenges to the player to think through puzzles and mysteries.  Its not handed on a silver platter, but each and every choice is made rewarding.  You can literally play through this game billions of different ways.
<br>
<br>To top it off, you can play 4 player COOP.  I have always wanted an amazing RPG with drop in and out coop and DOS EE was great for that. Now DOS2 has made it even better.
<br>
<br>In summary, props to Larian and i truly recommend you give DOS 2 a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7514996">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>More likely than not you will be able to indulge in upwards of 100 hours of game-play in just your first run alone, in addition Larian Studios have implemented a Game Master mode in which you can embark with others on user created adventures.
<br>
<br>This game is simply a masterpiece and an instant classic in the RPG genre. My top game of the year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7551961">Expand</a></span>

Possibly the best videogame.... Loved the Baldur&apos;s Saga, loved the Incewind Dale, loved the original Torment... This is, in a nutshell, a unique masterpiece. Play it or live in complete ignorance without knowing what an amazing game you&apos;re missing.
<br>
<br>Enjoyed the first DOS and although it had its rough edges and silly tone, it was a solid game. DOS2 takes a more serious tone, a better gameplay/story in all directions and gives all players their desired difficulty with the &quot;A.I. 2.0&quot; (whatever that means, the &quot;A.I.&quot; in this game is extremely well coded).
<br>
<br>Even if you are very reluctant to play a videogame with turn based combat, you should be aware that this game has the best turn based combat in an RPG. You will feel blessed that you have turn based combat due to its complex mechanics. In real time combat, it would be impossible and straight not fun to do.
<br>
<br>Excellent story, amazing graphics, amazing gameplay, superb soundtrack, 4 player coop, split screen coop, 100s of hours of content, crafting, companions, stories.... THIS GAME HAS IT ALL. GO BUY IT YOU FOOL!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7537437">Expand</a></span>

<br>D:OS2 is pretty refreshing and unique in the current landscape of games offering open ended(ish) game-play and fun combat that will remind you a bit of XCOM. It&apos;s hard and can be frustrating, but is rewarding when you figure out a winning strategy. The writing is quite good as well and you begin to build interest in the characters pretty quickly. The game isn&apos;t without bugs on release, but the team has been responsive, and it looks like it will have great re-playability. It&apos;s probably a 9 for me as of today, but a 10 in potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7522534">Expand</a></span>

Also I&apos;m not a native english speaker, so there might be some grammatical errors.
<br>
<br>The good:
<br>
<br>-The Multiplayer is how things should be done. You can actively play with 3 friends can load into the game any time you want from any safegame. Everyone plays their own character and can walk the world, while every interaction has meaning in its own way. So other players can actively screw you if they so desire and at times they will without wanting to do so.
<br>(Been playing with 2 friends for now 40 hours and still going strong)
<br>
<br>-They choices in this game are far reaching and meaningful, so you can actively meet people you saved earlier or some people might be angry at you for killing someone. You can act like a douche or a savoir, but most questgivers offer choices which go more into moral grey areas. This in itself is a great thing to do in every RPG, at least in my opinion. EVERY CHOICE HAS MEANING. It&apos;s like a real world with real people in it. It&apos;s a loveletter to everyone who likes Baldurs Gate 2 or even Planescape: Torment. Still the replayability in this game is through the roof. You can play this game 5 times and not see every choice you can make.
<br>
<br>-The Story is superior to the Original SIn 1, which in itself isn&apos;t all that hard to achieve but this time they actually made more of an effort to engage you in the story. It starts with you not knowing what&apos;s going on at all, but after some time it gains traction and becomes pretty engaging, which is partly due to the great voice acting. Everything in this game is voiced, which is itself is an achievement in itself. There are about 84000 voicelines in this game, which is absolutely staggering. This time around you feel a lot more important in the story and more epic overall. Plus the cutscenes have some of the beautiful art you can get in Video games.
<br>
<br>The turn based battle system feels honed and intuitive. Every skilltree is viable and adds to your character in a meaningful way. Want to be Necromancer, Summoner? You can be and it&apos;s strong tree to actually invest to. Want to be a mage? You can be in so many ways it&apos;s hard to actually count the things you can to in this game.  Want to be a Ranger or Melee? Me and my friends are actually going all physical and it&apos;s working great. There are many ways to win. The magical/physical armor on every enemy makes it possible.  If you smashed their armor they are able to be stunlocked, which makes for some interesting combinations.
<br>
<br>The Bad: These are some minor issues overall, but stil should be talked about.
<br>
<br>-Minor bugs with quests. And the questlog can be pretty convoluted at times, so you have no idea what you can do, or must do to finish some quests. (Which can be a good thing if you&apos;re into that stuff)
<br>
<br>-Your equipment becomes irrelevant pretty fast in later levels so buying new stuff for every character can become tedious at times (which can be bypassed if you have friends and they actually do that on their own).
<br>
<br>The difficulty in later levels is pretty uneven. Early into the game it&apos;s pretty hard and you will die if you approach a fight the wrong way. In later levels it&apos;s getting to the point where it&apos;s pretty much impossible to die if you know what you&apos;re doing. Luckily you can change the difficulty, so it becomes more challenging.
<br>
<br>In conclusion:
<br>
<br>This game is a loveletter to anyone who likes RPGs. The goods heavily outweigh the bads in this game.  This game shackled me to my computer for hours on end.
<br>I implore you don&apos;t pirate this game, the developers deserve your money, you can see their love for games in every fiber of this game.
<br>This game is a masterpiece and should be treated as such.
<br>Buy this game you if you even slightly like games, you will not regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7528271">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you loved the first game, are into Crpg&apos;s or like Xcom style combat. Then this is a MUST.
<br>
<br>Sequel to Divinity : Original Sin and newest entry into the divinity franchise.
<br>And oh boy, is it good. The game is for starters is a huge improvement to the first game.
<br>But thats not the only thing, DoS 2 competes with baldurs gate for beeing one of the (if not THE) best Crpg i have played.
<br>Do i dare say, that annyone can play.
<br>
<br>DoS 2 captures everything what a RPG must be, the pen and paper feel in this game is outstanding.
<br>The TBS battles are so well implemented.
<br>No hand holding, no second tries. Just how i freakin love it.
<br>The PvP and DM mode are the cherry on the cake.
<br>They give you so much more options to play this master piece of a game.
<br>
<br>It runs perfect, constant 60 fps.
<br>Everything feels flued.
<br>The amount of dialouge options makes my mouth water. reading the amazing parts of lore and dialouge.
<br>The voice acting is TOP notch, the narator is a perfect addition.
<br>I can&apos;t find annything bad about this. I have craved for a amazing crpg for years.
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, i love tyranny, Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland, Shadowrun, torment, etc.
<br>and i stil play the infinity engine games. But by the gods, this game just blew them out of the water.
<br>From soundtrack to gameplay, this game is a masterpiece.
<br>
<br>And in my opinion stands tall allongside the great Crpg&apos;s of old.
<br>divinity original sin 2 just became my all time RPG to play.
<br>
<br>Thank you Larian studio&apos;s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7517971">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game appeals to a vocal minority of neckbeard nerds who think the apex of rpg gaming is what they played when they were teens. Thankfuly this niche is shrinking so games like these will dissappear eventually.
<br>
<br>If you want a good rpg, play Witcher 3. Avoid this unless you want to waste your life on reliving your childhood.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7517783">Expand</a></span>

It provides the world with context only books would otherwise provide.

<br>
<br>The world is realistic. You can solve difficult situations with diplomacy or action. You can talk to pets, talk to ghosts, ... The world is great and immersive. And I do not mind that I get killed. It is part of the exploration. You have to gain exp. to become better or you can try your look as a rookie.
<br>
<br>There are still some minor flaws. Without stealing, it is hard to get good gear. And I don&apos;t like having to steal. Pet pall is another very important talent. The crafting menu could be better. The skillbar could use some auto sorting algoritm. But I&apos;m sure Larian will work on that just like with DOS. A free enhanced endition to solve/improve some things.
<br>
<br>This game reminds me of the first Zelda. It is not easy, you can go anywhere you please but that doesn&apos;t mean you will succeed. DOS II is similar only more intricate, more choices, more maps, more RPG elements (obviously) and ofcourse turn based. I would recommend it if you like an immersive world you can&apos;t rush through with strategy elements you can&apos;t always solve the first time and have the patience to see most interactions with NPC as something of value. Hope you enjoy the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7590659">Expand</a></span>

<br>Great writing and character development. Though the overarching story was not so great, you really get to know the characters and each is fairly unique. My personal favorite was Lohse but the others had good stories as well.
<br>
<br>There were no game breaking bugs on release but tons of minor bugs like quests not closing properly and several that cant be advanced. The worst bug came at the end and prevented the end fight to trigger properly. Luckily I was able to force it to trigger in another way to finish the game but I am not sure if I saw all the possible dialog that way. I am sure they will fix these minor bugs in time.
<br>
<br>Combat was changed slightly from DOS1. Mainly, the armor systems were changed so that to disable anything you 1st had to break through either its physical or magic armor but once you do, the disable was guaranteed to land. Its not a bad system, but it is different from what people are used to in other games. It has a lot of similarities to space ship type games except without automatic shield regeneration. Like DOS1, the game is still all about controlling the battle either with disables or by controlling paths. They added a height strategy similar to xcom. The biggest disappointment to me was that there werent a lot of new interesting skills. For the most part the crafted skills were insanely underwhelming and source skills were not very good either with exception to 2 or 3 of them. Also, magic is very underwhelming compared to physical damage though it is very beatable (even at hard difficulty) with magic (just not as easily). Overall I would say this was not an improvement over DOS1 though it was slightly different due to how defenses worked.
<br>
<br>Again its a great game over all. I played it on tactician and there was a learning curve early on which I thought was enjoyable and a nice change from how easy (dumbed down) mainstream games have become. Once you figure out the combat system the game becomes very manageable. I enjoyed exploration though I have to say that due to level scaling, itemization and loot was anti-climactic. For example, after defeating a boss and looting a unique item it becomes obsolete in just one level due to how big a difference there is between weapons of differing levels.
<br>
<br>Definitely give this game a go if you are an RPG fan or tactical game fan. It is definitely the best RPG since DOS1 and Witcher 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7588734">Expand</a></span>

The game is so good it&apos;s hard not to overlook the small flaws here and there, but for the sake of being honest, I&apos;ll list the two biggest for me:
<br>
<br>1) &quot;Surfaces&quot;, such as poison, water, blood or oil puddles, are the best and worst part of the combat system. Concept is clever and gun, but unfortunately, they are less tactic than in the first one. In Div:OS1, they were a bit less omnipresent and could be a game changer. Here, they are just  freaking EVERYWHERE. Half of the skill will produce a surface, and a big one with that. Even things like poison darts thrown at an enemy will create a big puddle at his feet. It became more a pain and an annoyance you struggle to avoid rather that a tactical element you have to plan and think carefully about. Here, it&apos;s just a constant mess.
<br>
<br>2) The crafting system feels half-assed, even more than in the first one. Sure, you can craft great scrolls and there&apos;s still clever combination you can explore, but entire categories of recipe (such as weapons or armor) are useless because the items you craft are ridiculously underpowered compared to what you find every now and then in the game. In Div:OS 1, you had to put a few point in crafting skills such as blacksmith, but could produce useful item and weapons. Here, crafting skills are gone, but I fail to see the point of ever crafting a weapon.
<br>
<br>Aside from that, it&apos;s a fantastic game that anybody can enjoy, whether you like cRPG or not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7590031">Expand</a></span>

<br>Great story, somewhat likeable characters (I enjoyed fane but the rest of them were just.. eh).

<br>The tactical combat combat and dialogue are the best parts of this game.</span>

DOS: 2 improves on the original with a better story, expanded skills, and fully voiced NPC&apos;s just about everywhere. The heart and hook of this game is the combat system though.
<br>
<br>A new system is in place where your characters have both physical and magical armor. It serves as an important &quot;buffer&quot; before they start taking real damage to hit points. Even more important, armor blocks status effects and this game has a slew of nasty ones. Stunned, Cursed, Burning, Petrified, Diseased, Suffocating, Frozen, Crippled, to name just a few. Once your armor goes, things get ugly real fast. Enemies have both magic and physical armor as well, so here is where the strategy on your part comes into play. You can build a balanced party good for dealing with all enemies, or you can focus on doing one type of damage and have a cakewalk on some enemies, and a nightmare with others. Up to you.
<br>
<br>The game has a good amount of dialogue solvable encounters. You work against a persuausion system where where an NPC has a base attitude stat toward you and then an attribute like intelligence or strength is used to reflect the type of answer you can give. To me some of the attributes didn&apos;t make a whole lot of sense. I can see intelligence, wits, and memory being used, but think Finesse and Constitution shouldn&apos;t really be able to help you answer questions.
<br>
<br>The crafting system is there, but in a highly neutered state. There is no blacksmithing anymore, just the ability to craft food, potions, arrows, and grenades. Finding an epic recipe and going on a quest for the ingredients make for interesting quests so not sure why they did away with it. Perhaps they ran out of time to implement it.
<br>
<br>Finally I wouldn&apos;t be giving an honest review if I didn&apos;t comment on the overuse of elements in this game. Sure they were meant to give another layer of strategy to combat, and sometime do, but nearly every skill can produce fire, electric, ice, poison, etc. I don&apos;t think level 1 skills in general should have been able to create fire fields and poison clouds. It also makes every battle graphically quite messy, hard to highlight an enemy sometime because they are often overlayed in smoke, poison, and fire.
<br>
<br>There you have it. I give it a 9 despite my quibbles about the elements and crafting. With the fall of Bioware, we are really lucky to have Larian still producing high quality RPGs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7596382">Expand</a></span>

<br>Okay enough about me, lets talk about the game, yes the game, so i was looking online on guides on how to write game review on metacritic but to my surprise i found barely any guides at all. One guide suggested to keep my review short and simple, straight to the point. But another guide said list all the pros and cons and give an objective opinion on the game, i did not know which one to follow so my mom suggested i enroll in an english course online. Two weeks later i had completed my online training, i even met a girl there, thought she turned out to be a guy pretending to be a girl. Anyway, now i can finally give this game the review that it deserves.
<br>It&apos;s pretty good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7619317">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s pure game as it gets, no micro-transaction bullcrap, no day 1 dlc, nothing - just a brilliant game made with passion.
<br>
<br>Obviously the game is not perfect, no game is and nothing is, but it&apos;s bloody good. You start the game you are not hand-held by anything, you figure you way thru and do your things your own way. You have plenty of option to choose from, starting from your own character - you have many playstyles to choose from: fighter, summoner, necromancer, archer, rogue assassin, mage of 4 different forces of nature, polymorphy and you combine those anyway you like to make a truly unique build and experience in gameplay. You can create your own character from scratch or play one of the 6 origin characters. The origin characters serve as fantastic companions to choose from as well, all of them being different and unique in personality and special abilities. All companions have a unique storyline to experience.
<br>
<br>The quests, dialogue writing and exploration feel really good and thru your gameplay you&apos;ll be accompanied with brilliant music written this time by a new composer (Borislav Slavov) and it&apos;s up to par with original composer that worked for Larian for so many years, but sadly passed away soon after prequel of this game came out (rest in piece Kirill Pokrovsky). Unlike many other cRPG - this one is fully voice acted for all NPC and a narrator and it ads to immersion - believe me!
<br>
<br>Combat is one of the best in cRPG games in my honest opinion. It&apos;s tactical turn-based combat, but it&apos;s not hexagon map based. Instead you only have range units that limit you how far you can move your character or how far you can reach with your skills and how big area you can cover - this way it feels more natural. Each turn your party characters get set amount of action points and there your tactics begin on how to use them - whether to strike some damage, crowd control enemies, buff you or your party member, or move your character to a new position. On top of that - you can combo elements for extra effects: fire + oil = massive explosions, etc. You can use environment to your advantage or it can be used by the enemy against you - so play smart, every decision matters and has consequences. You cannot ask for a better combat in cRPG.
<br>
<br>Ofc there are few minor problems with the game - a minor bug here and there, but nothing impacting your experience a lot and story is not the best I&apos;ve seen in genre, but it&apos;s solid enough to suck you in.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t play 10/10 game yet (because it would have to be absolutely perfect in every way - that&apos;s how strict I am) but Divinity Original Sin 2 is close one. My 9/10 would be 10 for most reviewers out here.
<br>
<br>If you are looking for fantastic adventure without being held by your hand - the game is for you. If your are looking for modern cRPG - Divinity Original Sin 2 should be your prime choice!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7620025">Expand</a></span>

<br>You actually meet interesting characters, who invoke real emotions in you, I felt sad, angry, even giggled a few times. Combat feels balanced on tactician, I have to try bigger battles a few times before succeeding and you have to put some thoughts into your builds if you want to progress. Gameplay is open, and you pretty much do whatever you want, no hand-holding at all. Main story is quite a bore though, if it had an intriguing setup like Tyranny did, I d give this a 10.

1 weird polymorf

4 is spells. (fire/lightning/ice&amp;healing/Earth&amp;Poison)

Feels like there should be more skills to choose from.

<br>
<br>- Story wise it could use more missions with your companions. At least suggest more strongly or give you a better reward for changing members of your party often. I swapped guys at the beginning but later I didn&apos;t care much and stick with 3 since the middle of chapter 1. The superbattle with the demonic spam murder bossfrom hell in chapter 4 was great and I wonder if I just missed some other epic battle of the other characters that didn&apos;t get to follow me.
<br>
<br>- Halfway chapter... 4 I think? you get the option to, let say, swap alliances with some king. I would have love to explore that branch earlier in the game. And the same goes with the demon quests. Just the island felt short.

<br>- The final battle felt a bit short and a bit cheating. I&apos;m not sure what I did to deserve the infinite source points but felt overwhelmingly powerful in every move. Not to mention that killing THAT character ends the entire fight. I did it just because it was tactically convenience at the time, but I was looking forward for a long ass wiping of all my enemies.
<br>
<br>- I find some minors bugs and the ending of the game. One character told me that she wants to make love with me again (wut???).
<br>
<br>- I loved magic and want more. I would say that at the end of chapter 2 you get all relevant spells. I bit more scaling in between chapter 3 and 4 for more spells was a bit needed.
<br>
<br>- If anything I really dislike is that the vendors sells in proportion to your level. Same vendor has a level 1 sheet of paper shield, but later on has the Ultimate Mithril Force Field. In my opinion this shouldn&apos;t happen. You need to go to the bad parts of the neighborhood and slay monster in order to get to the Kung-Fu master that sells you cool shlt This feels bad also because at the end of a tomb quest of 5 hours you get a super armor of level 6; but later on the brain damage vendor has 20 armors of level 10 for you to buy with almost scrap money.
<br>
<br>Again, don&apos;t let any of these to keep you away from the game. You should go play it NOW.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7633862">Expand</a></span>

The best part about it: It has that great Dungeons &amp; Dragons feel where you are trying to be a hero in a chaotic, terrifying world where all kinds of tragedies are happening and maybe if you&apos;re lucky you can do some good deeds, but if you want to survive at all you&apos;ll have to make hard choices--the right way to do something is never clear. It also has a ton of options for various difficulty levels that add a lot of fun. And a huge world to explore with a lot of secrets where information and understanding about what is happening is rare and precious. Graphics are pretty.
<br>
<br>Bad parts: The writing feels like a really bad translation from French from a person who is really bad at writing. The story is great but the way it&apos;s written is awkward. The romance is particularly bad, like they are written by a 13-year-old boy.
<br>
<br>Most of the game play time is spent waiting for the party to walk from A to B. Pretty but kind of a waste of time.
<br>
<br>Some of the traps will just instantly kill everyone, no chance, no matter what. Also some of the battle difficulty is just wayyy extremely high without any particular warning about how hard the battle will be.
<br>
<br>That said, overall, super fun game, just exploring and learning the story and making interesting choices is a lot of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7603434">Expand</a></span>

I write this as starting from 10/10 then go down.
<br>
<br>I like: combat (literally 8/10) ,storylines (so many, almost every one with potential then somtimes abruptly ends), relative freedom (sometimes freddom of being raped by 2 lvlel higher mobs), graphics (just awesome), first 2/3 very entertaining storyline (then derp tend to accumulate), game is HARD even on 2/4 difficulty, on 3/4 i can barely advance.
<br>
<br>I dont like:
<br>Combat: rogue is quite useless, full strength two handed is easily worth 2 characters. AI mobs are buffed so always better armored than ur party, yet they dont capitalize on it sometimes going full suicidal or playing pick with omnipotent knowledge on whose ur most puny member. Confusing af. Also throwing items like there is no tommorow.
<br>
<br>Relative freedom ends when u encounter miniboss on a level higher. Tends to kill one of your character in one turn (usually so high initiative that always starts first and even if they cant u still cant nuke them in one turn). Later in game 3 source skills can easily nuke all your magic resist/armor and leave your party in half strength the other half being knocked/stunned/frozen.
<br>
<br>Graphics are still awesome.
<br>
<br>Most of the side quests abruptly ends, only few (thank god including companion stories) carry to thenext location much less next act. Such a waste. U could easily chain them more. Or maybe i dint find em all.
<br>
<br>ANd final flaw. U are chasing godhood in most grimderpy/cheesy universe to ever existed. EVERYFCKING ONE in this world is tragic/passive/psychopat. There is no in between. Every line includes derping like so hard. Barring mad chief of the cult there is no excuse for citing evil overlord for the half of the enemies. Next half wants u dead for no obvious reason. And gods are sounds like fcking gollums, yes kill&apos;kill u must my precious u must be the one for every moment u hear them.
<br>After 80 hours u are bored to tears, u just want them to end the lines just to kill them and dont hear their babbling. Goddamit, and even if u hook yourself in the sidequest it is 90% possibility u have to kill something. Although most of the main characters are still decent/not cheesy, but after 80 hours the cheesy ones tend to cause rage.
<br>
<br>Protip: dont roleplay nobleknight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7636277">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m kinda suspicions that this is one of these extremely rare cases (nowdays) when developers are fired their marketologists and spend their budget on actual developing instead of buying &quot;stars&quot; and paying to bloggers and streamers.

<br>The graphics are top-notch and there are interesting characters for each origin character.
<br>Each origin character is hireable as a party member (you can have a party of four) and once hired you can do their stories on top of your own!
<br>
<br>So far I have been playing Co-op with my brother and we have sunk at least Fifty hours into just act one, there&apos;s such a large amount of things to find, places to explore, animals to talk to (If you have the required talent) and let&#x2019;s not forget, towns filled with victims to pickpocket!
<br>
<br>Whenever I talk to a vendor the thoughts that go through my head isn&#x2019;t whether I can afford it or not, no, my thoughts follow the lines of &quot;is my Thievery level high enough to rob them blind and not leave a single gold piece?&quot; and also &quot;Are my companions good enough to distract everyone away so they are no longer looking towards my victim?&quot;
<br>
<br>We have yet to even get past the first act. We have got to the end of the first act, but we decided to re-explore the entire map and find every little detail and item we may have missed at first with brand new characters.
<br>
<br>There are so many different classes you can have and you&apos;re not limited in any way, you could be a rogue necromancer or a tank archer if you wanted.
<br>
<br>Throughout the game, we have only ever encountered one bug.
<br>A co-op bug where the player who joins will be locked to whatever character he joined as and would not be able to connect with his prior party.
<br>It&#x2019;s easily fixed by assigning the characters to their respective parties and once you have done that you won&apos;t be having another problem with it.
<br>
<br>The only problem I have with the game is the way loot is shared. The loot is not shared in this game, so, if you play with someone you often have to flip for heads or tails or have a debate about who needs it more.
<br>
<br>Even if you don&apos;t like the way loot is shared, don&apos;t pass up on this game, as this is a negligible problem in exchange for an amazing experience.
<br>
<br>Watch some trailers, buy the game. This is one game you won&#x2019;t regent buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7580807">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I have some gripes with the monetization of this game. It&apos;s clear that Larian hasn&apos;t enterend the realm of 2017 yet and DOS2 is really not up to par with todays standards:
<br>1. DOS2 retails for 44.99US$ or your regional equivalent. A modern game with high production values, which DOS2 clearly has with its beautiful atmospheric graphics, its incredible well written story, an amazing voice acting performance, a grandiose orchestral soundtrack, dozens hours of content and deep tactical gameplay should retail for 59.99US$.
<br>2. No pre order bonus. In the beginning of the game you meet a black cat with its own small storyline, but totally not essential to the grand story overall. DOS2 has tons of sidequests with their own story and those go further than the bland &quot;go fetch me 10 wolf pelts&quot; sidequests. Those sidequests make the game so much more engaging and rewarding to play. That black cat could be easily cut from the game and offered as a pre order bonus, which would be a good incentive for people to buy the game upfront without knowing if the game is any good. After launch you offer the black cat as a 9.99US$ DLC and make some more money out of it.
<br>3. DOS2 comes with 6 origin stories, 6 unique characters, which greatly changes how you will experience your travels and adventures throughout Rivellon. This enhances the replayability of DOS2, but knowing this game is in one playthrough already al least 70 hours long this is perhaps a bit much to offer at a base price of 44.99US$, which really should be 59.99US$ (see point 1.). As you can take only 4 characters in your party, offering 4 origin stories in the base game is more than enough. You can easily cut two, say Beast (a Dwarven Pirate) and Fane (an Undead), and offer them in a Digital Deluxe Special Edition for an extra 20$:
<br>- Divinity Original Sin 2: Pirate Edition for 79.99US$ with Beast origin story
<br>- Divinity Original Sin 2: Undead Edition for 79.99US$ with Fane origin story
<br>And of course you bundle this all together in:
<br>- Divinity Original Sin 2: Gold Edition for 99.99US$ with all 6 origin stories
<br>4. DOS2 doesn&apos;t have a season pass. Will Larian just patch and add extra content for free?
<br>5. DOS2 makes you play and enjoy the game without cutting corners through microtransactions. If a character in your party dies, you must make sure you have a resurrection scroll to revive him/her or have enough gold to buy one from the NPC&apos;s in the game. There is no ingame store that let you buy ingame items or ingame gold for real money.
<br>
<br>Despite these 5 points of criticism DOS2 is a fantastic game. It&apos;s one of the best cRPG&apos;s ever made and playing this game you feel you&apos;re playing something special. This truly is a classic: 10/10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7573449">Expand</a></span>

Truly feels like a grand journey the whole way through with a phenomenal story and great characters. There are so many options available to you to play with and systems for you to figure out. Divinity Original Sin 2 also features the best turn based gameplay in a video game since Xcom 2 or quite frankly in video games in general. It&apos;s much more flexible, deep, smooth, and satisfying than it has ever been in the series tenfold. The game also features better graphics and a much improved art style that overall fits the feeling of the series much better. Gone are the cartooney locals and denizens of said locals, replaced with a much darker and grittier world to play in which Divinity 2 absolutely flourishes within. If that wasn&apos;t enough the game features a classic DnD tabletop creation mode of play, competetive vs and co-op modes for up to 4 players, and real choices that truly feel like they change your story to truly make it yours. There are a few minor setbacks being an almost unnecessary level of difficulty, lack of handholding, and a damn near useless journal at points. Unfortunately as quality of a game as this is it quite frankly is just not for everybody, if you haven&apos;t like crpg&apos;s before then Divinity 2 most likely will not be doing any favors to change your mind. Even despite these almost negligible flaws in the grand scheme of things this is one of the true greats of our era. Quite frankly it&apos;s just flat out one the greatest role playing games ever created. A true 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7582061">Expand</a></span>

<br>The freedom you are given on how to unfold the plot is amazing and the tactical combat, while obviously isn&apos;t going to suit everyone &apos;s tastes, is carefully thought over and enables for careful planning. Furthermore, in comparison to its predecessor, the game also features full, quality voice acting. Even during act I, which is supposed to be the prologue of the game, if someone searches more deeply through the initial location, he is bound to find a vast variety of content waiting to be explored, that he could easily just miss if he hadn&apos;t paid much attention.
<br>
<br>And that, in my opinion, is what makes the game so interesting, the fact that the less significant parts of the story could have shaped differently if the player decided to skip or didn&apos;t even  had knowledge of them, which in turn results in a different play-through each time someone starts a new campaign</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7569338">Expand</a></span>

This is probably the best cRPG since 2000. Everything is incredibly polished, the game is LONG without being boring, and quests make sense in the context of each environment (something sorely missing in, for instance, recent Bethesda games).
<br>
<br>The combat system is clearly defined and rewards clever gameplay, while at the same time not giving the computer an unfair advantage. That said, battles will DESTROY you the second you don&apos;t take them seriously.
<br>
<br>I wasn&apos;t really all that impressed by DOS 1, but part of that was that I felt that my characters didn&apos;t have much personality, and that made it difficult to immerse myself in the story. The brilliant inclusion of origins characters brings this missing component to the table nicely, and the characters themselves are varied and interesting - they may well put you into dangerous situations, close off quest options, or open doors to new ones.
<br>
<br>From a technical standpoint, the voice acting is well above industry standard - I don&apos;t believe I&apos;ve heard an awkward line in 70 hours. The graphics are highly polished, and most abilities and attacks work precisely as expected (a few occasional glitches aside). The story elements are well put together and flow nicely (even the &quot;silly&quot; quests), and include some morally ambiguous situations that you have to actually think about.
<br>
<br>Undoubtedly, this is a game that we&apos;re going to compare other RPGs against for years to come, a real lesson in maintaining old school mechanics without the old school baggage. A complete masterpiece, and if you don&apos;t think so, then cRPGs must not be for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7579853">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Well, **** me, sideways. I did not like the first Divinity (which I reviewed here I think) but never would have thought this game would become a MASTERPIECE one day. Oh the soundtrack, the fights, the dialogues, narration, story, characters... EVERYTHING clicks so well, I simply cannot describe it more than that. This game made me live my olden days, thank you so much developers. I will not nitpick anything because I would hate myself for doing that to this game.

I write this review after 70 hours of gameplay and I feel like I barely scratched the surface, I try to explore everything, do all the quests and enjoy every bit of this great game. It took me about 50 hours to finish only Act I and I still didn&apos;t do it all, left many things for my inevitable 2nd playthrough where I will make different choices and experience it from a different angle. This game has so much to offer. It&apos;s a &quot;good old&quot; isometric full-on RPG with rich characters, great dialog system, good story, many quests and the freedom to do them in many different ways, great combat system, lovely graphics, nice music, great voice overs, it has it all. I really love this game and I wish more games were like this. I would absolutely recommend this game.
<br>
<br>PS: I don&apos;t understand why some people complain that this game is &quot;too difficult&quot;, it is not. But you can&apos;t expect to charge into any sort of combat without any thought or preparation, this is not diablo. Yes in the very beginning it&apos;s better to even avoid combat until you scavenge some gear and even then the game can be challenging but certainly not unbeatable - you just can&apos;t charge in head on - use the terrain, use tactics, use proper spells/abilities/scrolls/potions/food and if you still can&apos;t win come back later when you level up (you can&apos;t expect to beat enemies 3 levels higher than you). It&apos;s really not that hard once you realize that you&apos;re not supposed to kill everything right away, use your brain! Also a lot of combat can even be avoided or made much easier by thinking outside of the box or talking/questing. Again, this is not diablo but a proper RPG. Also later in the game you can get certain abilities that I would perhaps even consider actually a bit OP, especially when you construct your party properly, so no, the game is certainly not &quot;too difficult&quot; if you think about it and prepare yourself correctly. But that&apos;s what I consider a good combat system - it&apos;s not completely casualized like is the trend today. It is challenging but rewarding and it allows you to think about what you&apos;re doing and approach the combat in many different ways. Also I very much like that it&apos;s turn-based and not an action click fest or real-time chaos like BG-based RPGs (heresy, I know, but I do not much like the real-time/pause style combat of BG games tbh, I much prefer turn-based combat).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7575633">Expand</a></span>

One, the writing is better (while still retaining some of Larian&apos;s trademark silliness) and while the plot doesn&apos;t melt genre tropes, it&apos;s solid. Two, I can&apos;t fully describe the feeling I get when my imaginary characters pick up a digital weapon that just fits their build. Love it. While there are annoying bits of tedium in the loot system and thus character progression (as well as the wish I had of finding gloves of teleportation with better armor stats...) any flaws aren&apos;t enough to impede one&apos;s enjoyment. Three, the atmosphere/graphics. The original already had impressive enough environments and design but this one just amps it up a bit. I also find myself not being as stumped as I was in the first one though this could be due to my becoming more familiar with how Larian does things. Four, and finally, combat. Challenging, almost puzzle like in execution, it&apos;s frustrating yet bloody brilliant. There are also some world encounters that are flat out hilarious, too. I still have so much left to play (only a bit into Act 2)...but I&apos;ve thoroughly enjoyed cheesing and making my way through this world.
<br>
<br>One final note, and others have noted this as well, but Larian as developers are awesome and deserve as much love as we can give them. They put everything into this game and you can tell. People talk about nostalgia &amp; these isometric games, but there&apos;s another level to it--I feel like a kid again when I play this game, able to believe there is magic and good in this world. If I could make a video game (or, when I do make a video game of my own)...Larian has provided an excellent model to follow and I hope to one day bring as much love and passion to video games as they do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7567975">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Every aspect is of such high quality: the dialogue, the voice acting, the music, the excellent UI, the art style, the graphics, the amazing combat mechanics, the sense of exploration and adventure, the level design, the encounter design, the pacing... it&apos;s all super well done, way above what you normally get in an rpg.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s rare to see a game get 1-2 of these so right, I&apos;ve never seen a game that gets ALL of them right.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m 60 hours in and it has not gotten tedious or started to feel formulaic or repetitive, which is something that I&apos;ve never seen happen in a long single player game either.
<br>The side stories, environments and things you do are varied enough to feel fresh after 60  hours, the sense of exploration and adventure never goes away.
<br>
<br>Every time you level up or progress further in the story you are rewarded with new spells and abilities that keep expanding on the combat and allowing you to experiment and try new builds and tactics, which keeps you from falling into familiar combat patterns/habits and keeps you entertained.
<br>
<br>Since I&apos;ve never seen a game with such attention paid to every single aspect of it, nor one that makes such a good impression then follows through to keep that initial feeling of awe going for 60+ hours I can&apos;t recommend this enough.
<br>
<br>Full mod support, dungeon master mode with level design tools included, being drm free and being 45 euros are just cherries on top of the cake.

It appeals to my love of tabletop-level freedom, and of course - my love of the skyrim-level murderhobo playstyle.
<br>
<br>Now, on to the meat and potatoes of this review.
<br>
<br>Divinity: Original Sin II takes it&apos;s predecessors success, and markedly improves upon every aspect of that game, you have more freedom, more customization, much better story, and much more content. The AI of the game has been beefed up, so it&apos;s no longer just &quot;Throw more HP at the enemies to make them tough&quot; - It actually feels like you&apos;re playing against other players most of the time, and yes - as other reviewers have pointed out, on classic difficulty and above, there are fights where you will get your ass handed to you within the first two turns of the fight if you&apos;re not aware of every aspect of your current tactical situation.
<br>
<br>However, rather than complain that these fights are &quot;Unfair&quot; or &quot;Imbalanced&quot;, I posit that they are balanced fine, but you have to make sure that you are positioned well, and that you are of the appropriate level for tackling a boss or creature, or you could figure out a non-combat way of solving the situation.
<br>
<br>The game also has much to be proud of when it comes to storytelling, they do an excellent job of ensuring that all NPC&apos;s in the game have a personality, and it shows through in your first few interactions.
<br>
<br>If you enjoy games that actually require you to put thought and effort into your combat decisions, rather than just auto-piloting most of the fights, and if you enjoy depth, personality, and flexibility in your story, recommend you pick this one up - It won&apos;t fail you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7529858">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is a game for people who like to be challenged and immersed in a fantasy world. For this genre of players frustrated newbee reviews are a piece of cake that makes you buy games for sure.
<br>And imho infact this is a masterpiece, best rpg, even best than baldurs gate 2.
<br>
<br>The features are original such the unique combat or the fun thieveryvsystem than dont let you exploit too much and cheat.
<br>I am playing tactician (hard) and just reached act2. Reloaded just a fair times not Tot&#xF2; much and it is normal since it is the first pt. easy games are not hardcore.
<br>
<br>Go buy it and then score 10 well deserved to this superb and heroic (indie) sh name larian. The first dos has been improved in every area. Great work and thanks. I backed dos1 and not This but i ll l&apos;ok forward for larian&apos;s next project.
<br>
<br>At the moment the metascore says it is best rpg pc game ever!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7555520">Expand</a></span>

<br>&gt;Also, the game has no preorder **** no day one dlc&apos;s, no season pass which costs more than the base game and doesn&apos;t have any kind of microtransactions despite having pretty decent online pvp and pve modes.
<br>&gt;It is priced at 45$, which is just right if you ask me. (It cost lesser in my region on steam and I love Larian for it)
<br>&gt;I have played this game solo and played it coop, both are super fun but I seriously can&apos;t convey just how much fun I have had playing this with my band of three friends. If you are into rpgs and don&apos;t have anything against turn based combat, you owe it to yourself and to the games industry to buy and play this game...!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7530825">Expand</a></span>

It takes all the wonderful elements of DnD and transforms it into a graphical and narrative masterpiece.
<br>
<br>The learning curve can be slightly steep, but with the player&apos;s choice to commit, do, act however they want, the scenarios become endless. It will be quite difficult to play the same game twice.
<br>
<br>All i can save is Quicksave becomes my best friend in the piece and even later on, a must have tool in the arsenal.  For the die hards, you can be punished for exploring an area without the appropriate &quot;items&quot; or perhaps jump a story or tow in the queue.  Whilst the user is not hindered overall by one poor decision, it can definitely have a significant impact on how the story pans out or even the affinity (how much people like you) between one faction and another.  this can also be dictated by what character you select to engage in the conversation.
<br>
<br>Combat is a very long process.  The environment is highly interactive and you are presented with a lot of options.  not only that, but where you are in the environment (high ground, low ground, in water, fire etc.) can also help or deter the outcome of the battle.
<br>
<br>The environment is highly interactive.  There is lots to see and explore. lots of items to loot, lots of books to read that provide endless recipes for crafting or hidden quest logs etc.
<br>
<br>You can easily get lost in the character creation module.  With so many choices  for both race and class, options to define your character and associates, the choices are endless.
<br>
<br>Combat is highly intuitive and outcomes are varied depending on how you proceed, engage, etc.
<br>
<br>And the best part of all, the entire campaign/story is CO-OP! i&apos;m playing with two other friends and the non-stop interaction is brilliant.
<br>
<br>I would rate this game as the best RPG of 2017.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7553160">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Been eagerly waiting for this game for months and it doesn&#x2019;t fail me in a single point. Almost perfect in every aspect and way better than its already amazing prequel (except that I feel I prefer the voice and atmosphere of the female narrator in DOS:EE than that of this male narrator.)
<br>
<br>Special reference must be made to the music for it is so astoundingly composed that I feel I can just sit there listening to the main theme for hours. Last time a game&#x2019;s BGM would give me such immersion and pleasure should be playing Skyrim.
<br>
<br>Larian Studios now officially tops my favorite developer list and this honor should only be shared by CD Projekt Red. These two great studios earn their greatness not only because they make great games, but because the enthusiasm and true love they showed to their works: they try wholeheartedly to polish and perfect their games in every possible way and they always take the players seriously.
<br>
<br>I sincerely hope DOS2 will be a great success and cement Larian Studios&#x2019; ascension to an AAA studio (if it is not already in that list). For this reason I feel real sad for some recklessly given negative ratings: it&#x2019;s a shame not to show your respect and kindness to such a devoted developer that does not care only about profit maximization as many others do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7553048">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game IS the epitome of RPG games, the role-playing experience I&apos;ve always wanted to have. And I&apos;ve played Skyrim, Witcher series, Fallout series, Dragon Age series, you name it.  But this game is different.
<br>
<br>When I play the Original Sin 2, I can&apos;t help but feel the amount of love and passion that goes into this game. You will truly feel, when playing this game, that the developers must have been RPG enthusiasts as well.  And that&apos;s already putting it lightly.
<br>
<br>There are so many moments where I think &quot;I&apos;m glad they didn&apos;t compromise and decided to go ahead with it&quot;.  Full voice-acting is a great example.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m the type of person who would play a game for 20-30 hours, and I would eventually get bored and would only keep playing to finish it. But having already put 60 hours into it, I still want more!  Combat is fantastic, story is dark but intriguing, choices are meaningful.
<br>
<br>If they charge $100 USD, I would still buy it and then a copy for my wife.  That&apos;s how good this game is!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-original-sin-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=7555383">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is a masterpiece every RPG lover should try.
<br>The scope is massive and the polish rarely matched.
<br>I don&apos;t remember an RPG that gave you so much freedom and to do it while allowing for co-op gameplay, it has to be my game of the year.
<br>Simply vast and enjoyable every step of the way.</span>

<br>PS: Mentioning Witcher 3 or any reference to what does and does not belong in the 90s will receive an instant downvote. I have my limits. Some people, like myself, detest Witcher 3 and the watered down slop that passes for RPG these days. You and your console loving, instant gratification cult of morons can return to Witcher 3 and shut up. An actual RPG has been released. I know that this upsets you greatly for some peculiar reason. But shut up and stop trying to turn every game into the kind of mindless crap that you enjoy. You&apos;re not supposed to be proud of being stupid and with the attention span of a gnat. You&apos;re supposed to feel ashamed and to develop an urge to better yourself. Better yourself.
