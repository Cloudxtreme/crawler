Many of the inventory objects can only be seen by the hotspot indicator, even after turning the monitor brightness up and examining the screen closely. The hotspot indicators are often touchy, imprecise, or just wrong. The game is extremely linear. Few of the puzzles are natural consequences of the plot - in fact, you will spend much of the time looking for a puzzle to solve, rather than pursuing a goal. I found Sherlock&apos;s comments to vary from off the wall to annoying - he seems to like to hear himself talk, but seldom provides any information. The background music is okay, but there are only a few short pieces that are repeated incessantly. There are a number of ways to die in the game, and often they are so obscure that you can&apos;t tell why you are dead. The &apos;death&apos; cutscene is canned and doesn&apos;t explain anything - we had to &apos;die&apos; three times before figuring out that we had been bitten by a scorpion! All in all, a very weak game. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sherlock-holmes-the-mystery-of-the-mummy/user-reviews?user_review_id=365489">Expand</a></span>
