This top-down shooter constantly fills the screen with enemies charging full speed at you while others sit back and take shots. You learn to weave in and out of fire while utilizing the dash to move through enemies unharmed. Predicting and being aware of visuals is key in this game. Each enemy has a different style of movement and different pattern of attack. One will lunge at you at a certain distance, one enemy continues to spin while shooting a constant stream of lasers, and another one completely disregards you to kill humans found on the map. Reading and learning firing patterns come innately as you continue playing the game. Each enemy will be seen multiple times through a stage and you learn their habits pretty quickly because if you don&#x2019;t, you die. While you do this, there are specific side objectives available to help boost your score. There are a set amount of humans on each level of a stage. This mechanic is reminiscent of Resogun&#x2019;s saving human mechanic. Saving the humans will increase your multiplier and thus increase your score. At the end of each stage, the game awards you with points based on how many humans you&#x2019;ve saved along with bonus points from other secret objectives.
<br>
<br>There are different power-ups to pick up in the game. Enemies are known to drop them from time to time and they can also be found in the destructible environment in each level. These power-ups can be extremely useful from passive abilities like weapon spread and weapon range to rechargeable active abilities such as rockets. They are extremely helpful and make you feel powerful, but the biggest downside is how they are handled when you die.
<br>
<br>The music has to fit with the overall aesthetic of this kind of game and the soundtrack in Nex Machina does everything I could hope for. It&apos;s a blend between techno and trance music. The music keeps with the pace of the game well; there was never a moment when the music slowed down and neither did the game. I&apos;m a fan of alternative rock and yet I couldn&apos;t help bob my head with the music. It does well to keep the player entranced to the screen while creating a rhythm that you can follow that helps you focus on the dodging the rain of bullets.
<br>
<br>Housemarque&#x2019;s Nex Machina, takes a futuristic setting and makes exploding voxels exciting again. The game makes my palms sweat as my focus never wavers from the moment the game starts. With no time to think, the game continues fluidly from level to level and stage to stage. Visually, the game is another masterpiece in terms of what it does well. Bright visual colors and cues make it so that even when you are focused on the mayhem around you, you never miss what&#x2019;s happening on another part of the level. Power-ups make the game easier as you progress through levels, but the overly punishing continue screen makes all your effort for naught. The variety of enemies per stage add more nuances and challenges that make each stage completely different from the one before. The game is only several hours long in a single playthrough of arcade mode, but the different challenges shown from the menu screen will provide many more hours of play. Go forth and watch as visuals bring you in and the gameplay keeps you playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nex-machina-death-machine/user-reviews?user_review_id=7523396">Expand</a></span>
