At first, it appears to be some sort of weird text adventure thing, though in a &#x201C;game within a game&#x201D; sort of environment, as you are playing the game on a computer on a desk inside your computer.
<br>
<br>The game has a very 1980s vibe to it, which isn&#x2019;t surprising, because it is set in 1986. It reminds me somewhat of the 1980s Twilight Zone, or similar shows; the first story immediately makes you realize that the game is going to be rather meta, but the game has a number of additional twists in store as you go through its four episodes.
<br>
<br>That being said, I use the term &#x201C;game&#x201D; somewhat loosely here; this is a strictly linear storytelling experience, and is almost entirely concerned with following directions rather than solving puzzles or interacting with the environment in any sort of meaningful way. Rather, this is more like an interactive made-for-TV movie, or perhaps miniseries &#x2013; and it is about as long as one, too, clocking in at about 2 hours and 15 minutes to complete.
<br>
<br>While this seems to be a horror game at first, it is not the &#x201C;random monster jumps out and scares you&#x201D; kind of horror, and while the first episode does a reasonable job of messing with you, the later ones become much less creepy, though all of them have at least somewhat worrisome aesthetics to them.
<br>
<br>As the game goes on, increasingly more gameplay mechanics are added, and while the game never becomes complex, and you never really do much more than follow directions, the extremely limited adventure game interface is actually limited to only a couple portions of the game.
<br>
<br>All that being said, this is a very, very simple game. While this is not a walking simulator, this is still a very narrative-focused game with very little actual gameplay, perhaps more like a visual novel than anything else, though its interface is, if anything, most reminiscent of Don&#x2019;t Touch Anything in terms of being in a very narrowly confined space most of the time, with just one or two screens of actual &#x201C;content&#x201D; per episode (though the finale is more complicated).
<br>
<br>Sadly, said interface is also clunky at times; the text adventure sections are particularly frustrating at times due to the fact that the interface is not always very smart about what you&#x2019;re telling it to do, and there were a couple points where I struggled to do what I was trying to do due to needing to find the &#x201C;magic words&#x201D; so to speak.
<br>
<br>The only other major problem with the game is the fact that, in the end, the story as it ultimately pans out isn&#x2019;t really nearly as twisty as you would have hoped based on all the other twists in the game. In fact, I was rather disappointed with the ending, as I was hoping that there was going to be one more twist, or rather, that what you were being pushed towards was not what had really happened, but was yet another lie. Alas, it was missing that extra layer, which I think might have added something more to the experience.
<br>
<br>If you&#x2019;re looking for gameplay, this is probably not the place to go looking. And if you aren&#x2019;t super enamored with dark stories with dark twist endings, this isn&#x2019;t likely to be up your alley either. If you like a 1980s vibe, though, and a darker sort of vibe, this might be something you&#x2019;d be interested in. It is certainly a different sort of game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stories-untold/user-reviews?user_review_id=7492752">Expand</a></span>

<br>Word of initial advice: This is not a horror / survival-type game, it barely even has what most people expect from a &apos;game&apos;. It&apos;s little stylized riddles with an overlying story that unfolds the more you progress. Someone here complained that the story was done before, sure, ALL stories have been told already (-maybe he/she expected something else because of the games title, which has to do with something in the story itself). It&apos;s the first thing you learn when you write stories. They have all been done. The question is HOW will you tell yours? And this is where this game gets really rewarding. I&apos;m not that much of a fan of text adventures, but these bits are short and fun and only make up a fourth of the game. The atmosphere is fantastic, I really liked the presentation and the way the stories were connected. It has a great amount of abstract thinking behind it, parabels. They all make sense in the end. When you&apos;re done with it you&apos;ll know you&apos;ve got served a variation of a known plot, but you won&apos;t have gotten it served this way. I think this is a little masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stories-untold/user-reviews?user_review_id=7643041">Expand</a></span>

My only complaint (SPOILERS) is that the first three stories were so fascinating that I wish they had come up with something other than the old drunk driving thing to tie them all together. Maybe don&apos;t even tie them completely, but let them have a little mystery left over? Anyway, I really enjoyed the stories and the puzzles. I have no idea why others are rating it so low given that they aren&apos;t bothering to write reviews.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stories-untold/user-reviews?user_review_id=7099212">Expand</a></span>
