<br>chapters looks great, has a great soundtrack and feels very good.

Some characters and their interactions are also well-written and keep be coming back here. However, the game itself is poor. There&apos;s a lot of running involved, and although the maps aren&apos;t that big, you will find yourself running in circles looking for a specific person with very vague instructions how to find them. At times certain tasks just seem like padding out the playtime of the game. The same goes for the child intermissions - a set of frustrating tasks that seem totally pointless. Furthermore, thy rely on you having played the previous games recently, and, for example, remembering the plot outline. I played TLJ over 10 years ago - how the heck am I supposed to remember which of to characters did I meet first?
<br>All these side tasks are frustrating, repetitive and do not bring the story forward. I have nothing against interactive movies (I love Heavy Rain), but this one plays like a chore, to the point that even the story does not seem rewarding enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=7251679">Expand</a></span>

<br>Parts that involve Kian are particularly unbearable and his storyline is just ridiculous. He joined a rebel movement that consisted solely of women, children and older people. He ran some errands for them which any retard could do, but for some reason he got praised as if they were some glorious deeds. I simply can&apos;t buy his character. He is supposed to be some sort of a killing machine but he looks and talks like a 23 y.o. mama&apos;s boy. His plotline is a total failure.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_6764265"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">When I first played Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, I had no way of preparing for what I was in for. At first I was a little astounded at some of the seemingly meaningless tasks Zoe had to complete, but then the plot quickly grew treacherous. The world grew more and more astounding and rewarding and then it feels like the creator of the game could just reach out and touch you. Characters would die that you wouldn&#x2019;t think should die, the story knows how to immerse itself in realism and then wonderment. It had an effect like no other.
<br>
<br>I don&#x2019;t play games often. Most aren&#x2019;t worth the time it costs to play them. But when I saw Dreamfall Chapters, I knew I had to play this game and fulfill a promise to myself: that if they ever made another game in that world, I would play it.
<br>
<br>I&#x2019;m glad I played Dreamfall Chapters. Mostly. The story sprawled, dragged and then waved its hand vaguely over its most rewarding parts. (Who the heck are Saga&#x2019;s parents? What are Songlines? What the h#$% is the Bloodless King? And who the fark came up with this prophecy that just saved the day?)
<br>
<br>Deus Ex Machina. That&#x2019;s a big story no-no.
<br>
<br>I didn&#x2019;t take the bad guys seriously. They all seem a bit vapid especially since the story sets you up to see the real bad guys. (Spoiler: it&#x2019;s us. Society. And our human capacity to want things to be easy, to create lines between ourselves and to create a system where we or others can be exploited.)
<br>
<br>And most of what the game does is story, not gaming. The puzzles feel forced and not intuitive, they don&#x2019;t write their way back into the plot. The skill they force you to hone is not resourcefulness but wandering around the screen with your cursor until something responds.
<br>
<br>That&#x2019;s some bullsh*t.
<br>
<br>There are a lot of choices, and then the sense that there really isn&#x2019;t any choice. The story goes much the same way in the end with a few broken eggs along the way.
<br>
<br>It&#x2019;s unfun. There are moments that it&#x2019;s brilliant and beautiful. But those are the exception, not the rule.
<br>
<br>Much of my enjoyment of this game came from the good rapport established with the previous game. If you&#x2019;re a person who likes to complete things for the sake of completing them, enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=6764265">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Malheureusement en d&#xE9;pit ce cette performance, &#xE7;a reste un ind&#xE9; programm&#xE9; avec le fion qui tourne la plupart du temps comme une patate y compris avec une R9 380 qui fait pourtant tourner la peinture vivante The Witcher 3 en &#xE9;lev&#xE9; &#xE0; 60 trames dans ta face. Putain, on croit r&#xEA;ver.
<br>
<br>En outre, si on retrouve l&apos;ambiance agr&#xE9;able du pr&#xE9;c&#xE9;dent Dreamfall dont il est logiquement la suite, ce Chapters devient rapidement tr&#xE8;s confus niveau sc&#xE9;nario : on pige que dalle !
<br>
<br>Enfin, trop d&apos;objectifs deviennent de plus en plus vagues, des objectifs qui obligent &#xE0; trottiner (j&apos;aime bien la regarder trottiner mais quand m&#xEA;me) d&apos;un bout de la ville &#xE0; l&apos;autre, ce qui finit par gaver. Je ne suis pas motiv&#xE9; pour suivre une solution afin de terminer ce jeu trop d&#xE9;sordonn&#xE9;, alors j&apos;arr&#xEA;te les frais : le temps c&apos;est de l&apos;argent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=6909649">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Too bad the main plot is buried by the liberal PC agenda, with childish and questionable representation of politics, liberal values and equality. Almost every antagonist in the game is white/male or heterosexual that turns out to be fascist, power possesed maniac, pedophile or literally Hitler. Kian came out as homosexual, Zoe can literally cheat on her boyfriend and that&apos;s okay, Hanna and Abby are like 14 year old lesbians. It&apos;s a shame that it took 10 years to see how one of the most favorite game series ended this way. Though Saga sequenses saved a game a little for me.
<br>
<br>I suggest Ragnar Tornquist stay out of the politics in his further games and leave his polically correct liberal views for his twitter account, because the way they were shoehorned in this game, they don&apos;t solve any real problems of real people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=7199009">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s just sad that they felt the need to put their political agenda first.
<br>
<br>Maybe I&apos;m a nazi sexist myself, but I couldn&apos;t help but notice that men largely played a secondary role in every single way possible throughout the game - by making the deity of the Azadi a &quot;goddess&quot;, the leader of the resistance being a woman, the main protagonist being a woman, the mole being a woman, women largely being the leaders of the azadi, women as the two &quot;good&quot; politicians in europolis, Hannah and queenie as two other important female leads, the list goes on. I also couldnt help but notice that the rebel army consisted of men and women, while the azadi soldiers were only men. I mean come on, throw me a bone here. I don&apos;t have a problem with female leads by any means, don&apos;t get me wrong, but when they go to such lengths it just feels forced.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t even think I can name one female character that played the village idiot or token dimwit - no, those roles were all left for the male characters lmao. Actually, I don&apos;t even think I can name a single male character that seemed remotely wise to me except for maybe blind bob, and he was more of a buffoon.
<br>
<br>Again, it&apos;s so sad to me that they were willing to alienate probably a good chunk of their audience for the sake of their moral signalling and politics. The messages of girl power, anti-racism and pro-marxism completely spoiled this for me. If I wanted to see more liberal politics, I&apos;d just log onto facebook</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=6661757">Expand</a></span>

<br>That&#x2019;s my question to Ragnar T&#xF8;rnquist. That&#x2019;s also Zoe&#x2019;s question about people who created Dream machine in Dreamfall Chapters.

<br>
<br>That&#x2019;s my question to Ragnar T&#xF8;rnquist. That&#x2019;s also Zoe&#x2019;s question about people who created Dream machine in Dreamfall Chapters.
<br>
<br>I, much like others, was happy and I appreciated the game until Europolis. When I clicked on &#x2018;J&#x2019; and started reading Zoe&#x2019;s journal entries, it seemed like I was reading someone&#x2019;s Tumblr. I chuckled a little bit when Zoe made a comment &#x2018;Boring Old White Dude&#x2019; when passing by some politician&#x2019;s poster. Glad you checked your own privilege, Zoe.
<br>
<br>Much of Europolis is inspired by Blade Runner. You&#x2019;d think this could be a good idea, yet it is too much. It just seems like a world full of hateful, grumpy people. Each of them has their own opinion on this or that political. It should work, right? Here&#x2019;s a futuristic European city yet there&#x2019;s nothing hopeful or creative about it. In fact, this world seems too heavy, too hateful, depressed.
<br>
<br>Newport from TLJ seems much more futuristic and forward-thinking compared to Europolis.
<br>
<br>Why create a city in future where there&#x2019;s no hope or nothing new and interesting?
<br>
<br>Why would you choose to create a world which is basically a reflection of today&#x2019;s social media? Why would you create a world that&#x2019;s ugly and hateful and nasty when creating point and click adventure game?
<br>
<br>I used to like Zoe in a previous installation.  I used to like April even more. It&#x2019;s good when a game has a character you enjoy spending time with. Being a little na&#xEF;ve also means being hopeful and adventurous &#x2013; which is a good thing for an adventure game.  I never liked Kian but I guess Kian gets a hall-pass because Kian is black, even though, as many others have said, Kian seems to have no personality. Zoe seemed more like a parody of today&#x2019;s Tumblr-infested world by endlessly musing and thinking about herself. We viewed things from her lens, and that lens was of &#x2018;Spooki&#x2019; by Ikea and &#x2018;How Very Hero&#x2019;s Journey&#x2019;.
<br>
<br>Who wants to watch a movie or play a game where the main character obsesses, in a very narcissistic way, about Herself/Himself All the Time? Where does that leave actual people who PLAY the game? Where&#x2019;s room for us? Did anyone think about leaving some space for our thoughts and dreams?
<br>
<br>Ragnar T&#xF8;rnquist is a human being just like the rest of us, and I wouldn&#x2019;t use &#x2018;Typical Boring Old White Dude from Norway&#x2019; to describe him because:
<br>
<br>there&#x2019;s one thing about Dreamfall Chapters that&#x2019;s brave, and that is bringing up Dream Machine as an addictive machine that&#x2019;s shaping Stark which is very much so what Facebook, Tumblr, Skype, Whatsapp, Instagram and Google Plus are doing.Ragnar T&#xF8;rnquist knows that the world we live in today&#x2019;s is toxic, full of hate and anger and that is doing us more harm than good and disconnecting us all.   Perhaps the world was always full of hate, fear and anger. Social media is just good at making us asocial and spreading fear, hate and anger very quickly and efficiently.
<br>
<br>Just, why do we have to put up with this in our games? Is there no escape from other people&#x2019;s opinions and depression and negativity and anger and hate?
<br>
<br>It&#x2019;s very brave, even to hint how social media might be changing the world for the worse, when you&#x2019;re such a well-known man on the top.
<br>
<br>And for that, which is very important and valuable, this game gets massive points.
<br>
<br>I just didn&#x2019;t have much fun, hope, inspiration or joy when playing it so I stopped. Last I heard, games were supposed to be fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=6046894">Expand</a></span>

<br>And the game play is utterly boring and tedious. Right off the first episode bores you out with ridiculous puzzles, tedious slow walking sections and stretched mini games. The dialogue is so poor, a waste for the generally good voice acting.
<br>Of course there are important and exciting moments, but far too few and your choices don&apos;t really matter.
<br>
<br>The graphics suffer from horrible performance and aliasing, despite anti-aliasing. And everything that isn&apos;t in a 10 m radius looks very blurry. Maybe a try for fake DoF, but it is very exhausting for the eyes.
<br>The controls will let you suffer, too, especially in certain sections of the game, which you have to do over and over again.
<br>

<br>
<br>Dreamfall Chapters is such a thing - it&apos;s a fanboy magnet.
<br>
<br>I may have enjoyed the predecessor games a lot, and I may have helped crowd funding Dreamfall Chapters hoping for an enjoyable continuation to the franchise. But I was let down. More than anything else, Chapters is a snorefest.
<br>
<br>It does take a long time to play, but that time is mostly spent running around endlessly in the same few dull environments. Sorry, I meant *walking* around, because the developer seems afraid we might hurt ourselves if we were allowed to move from point A to point B without watching our steps carefully. You can shift to a very leisurely jogging speed most of the time, but even this is denied in certain places.
<br>
<br>The environments are graphically pretty though. Sure the game is pretty in a two-generations-behind-the-curve kind of way, but that&apos;s not so bad. What&apos;s bad, is that there is so very little to *interact* with. There is practically nothing more than the bare minimum clickable content here. Even when you&apos;re solving puzzles, you sometimes just can&apos;t find ANYTHING nearby that even responds to your touch!
<br>
<br>Yes, the hardest part of the &quot;puzzle solving&quot; is walking around all over the map scanning the environment with your mouse cursor until you find an item that actually acknowledges its own existence in the game world and lets you interact with it. Grab that item, and you half solved the puzzle already. All that remains, is finding a spot where the item will do something. More walking around, and more random mouse exploration.
<br>
<br>A *good* puzzle solving game has entertaining and quirky puzzles that makes you use your creativity, and rewards you with a satisfying &quot;of course, why didn&apos;t I think of that!&quot; feeling when you finally figure it out. A good game also makes sure to keep you well entertained with quirky humor while you&apos;re futzing about trying to solve the puzzles.
<br>
<br>Dreamfall Chapters is not that kind of game - it is stiff and dull and unimaginative. If you want a *fun and enjoyable* puzzle solving adventure game, go play The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 or something.
<br>
<br>I just said Chapters is &quot;unimaginative&quot;, and for a fantasy adventure game that&apos;s about the worst possible sin to commit. And yet it is true. Most of it is trivial, banal, and focused on just the kind of boring everyday minutia you play fantasy adventure games to get away from for a while. Where is the sense of *adventure*? Where is the sense of moving to another world that works by different rules?
<br>
<br>Even in the supposedly magical world of Arcadia, the &quot;fantasy&quot; is just a thin veneer for a carbon copy of our everyday world. It&apos;s a world of magic, but no-one seems to ever *use* magic. And it is steeped in the exact same ideological mold as our world today, in the most uninteresting way.
<br>
<br>Do you really want to travel to a magical land, only to be preached to about the evils of racism and prejudice? Isn&apos;t that experience available to you pretty much 24/7 in the real world just by turning on the TV or opening a random page of a newspaper? Isn&apos;t it kind of boring and lame to drag boring and lame crap like that into a fantasy setting?
<br>
<br>The game is *preachy*. It has a clear social justice warrior agenda, and never misses an opportunity to tell you what&apos;s The Right Way To Think. Just in case you didn&apos;t know, *pedophilia is bad*. This game makes sure to tell you, because it just can&apos;t leave depressing real-world issues like this alone and tell a compelling story about something fresh and inspiring. As a fantasy game should.
<br>
<br>Sorry, that&apos;s not &quot;Arcadia&quot;. That&apos;s the modern PC-infested world anno 2015, where you can&apos;t swing a cat without hitting something that nags about how swinging a cat is animal cruelty, and somehow at the same time a blatant expression of White Male Privilege.
<br>
<br>And that&apos;s why you must play as a young Nazi who figures out being a Nazi is bad in this game. Sure, this is &quot;fantasy&quot;, so they changed the name a little - &quot;Nazi&quot; became &quot;Azadi&quot;. But it&apos;s still the same thing. You&apos;re a Nazi, and your task is to realize that Nazis are bad and you must make amends. That&apos;s the story.
<br>
<br>If you already figured out for yourself being a Nazi is bad, then this game leaves a sour taste. Preachiness is annoying even when you need to hear it, and it&apos;s even more annoying when you don&apos;t, so it&apos;s really not the way to go when you wish to spread your favorite religion. The first religion that figures this out will dominate the world! :-D
<br>
<br>My last pet peave is that the game yells *THIS WILL HAVE CONSEQUENCES!!!* in your face when you do stuff, and then it shouts *THIS WAS A CONSEQUENCE!!!* when something happens.
<br>
<br>Face. Palm.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=5244147">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m a great fan of The Longest Journey, and I think Dreamfall: The Longest Journey wasn&apos;t that bad. I mean the gameplay was &quot;experimental&quot; at best, still it delivered a nice story.
<br>
<br>Now what do we have here?
<br>
<br>The gameplay is way below average. 80% of the game is walking from A to B, most of the time it lets you &quot;run&quot; which must be in bullet time, because it doesn&apos;t make a difference at all. The puzzles are mostly fetch quests and trial and error labyrinths. So there are no real puzzles the ingame time is artificially lengthened. The dialogue system is good, they have at least that going. Yet you can&apos;t skip most of the animations and text.
<br>
<br>The music is good at least.
<br>
<br>The controls haven&apos;t changed much. Inventory is much the same. At this point after Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Telltale games, Indigo Prophecy and HeayRain it is safe to consider them garbage.
<br>
<br>The graphics are behind a generation and the optimization is poor.
<br>
<br>So there are only a few things left that can save this game: characters  and the game world, the story or mindless fanboys. Dear reader you can guess which one will save the day.
<br>
<br>The game world is dystopian cliche in Stark. All the necessary police state elements, political corruption and syndicate influence. But this rabbit hole goes even deeper.
<br>The city is called &quot;Europolis&quot;. So it is natural that half of the women wears burka and 70% of the people are Arab and Chinese. It is not a coincidence. Later you meet underage lesbians connected to the plot, because why not?
<br>
<br>At the beginning the another protagonist in Arcadia not only had all of this personality sandblasted off during his training, but his sexual identity as well. Later after a specific set of decisions he starts a SWAG movement with his mortal enemy. Just like that. Then you find yourself in a middle age nazi deathcamp with extra added cruelty distilled form the Soviet Gulag and Khmer Rouge, bottled by childworkers. And biological warfare because they had to compete with Call of Duty Black Ops.
<br>
<br>And this is just the tip of the iceberg. There is a book to go and I wasn&apos;t really paid attention.
<br>
<br>Here you have the game world, a tasteless, politically correct pile of crap. No soul, no creativity, complete lack of common sense and dignity. Plus they want to shove it down your throat. A real magical experience.
<br>
<br>At last the story: without spoilers the game is about Zoe have to do things that she couldn&apos;t possibly do, then the writer appears as a deus ex machina and everything sorts  itself out. End of story. We have Wizard of Oz level of writing here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=5875296">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The puzzles were confusing or not fun at all.I just finished book four and I had to link memories, I had to listen to 40 second sound clips again and again, to choose the right ones. The story dosen&apos;t go anywhere, the game presents tons of characters that have cool designs but no personnality.
<br>
<br>Magic is banned in this game and instead of visiting a magical world, you discover a world full of themes like rape, sexism, racism that are all treated very very lightly. The concentration camp wasn&apos;t scary. The rebels and azadi aren&apos;t interesting and we spend too much time with them. Death scenes are not well handled at all.
<br>
<br>The environments are beautiful but too big! Way too big, I kept getting lost in the streets, looking for something to do.
<br>And some places were really cool to visit but i only spent 10 minuites there.
<br>Actually if the cities were smaller it would probably have been more fun!
<br>
<br>I did a positive review here after book one came out, because i thought the game would get better, but the quality hasn&apos;t gone up since then. Too bad, this game is a real downer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=4634747">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now for the bad parts. Optimization is not as good as other AAA games, but based on the fact they used Unity, just managing to get this quality out of that crappy engine is very good. The part I liked the less are the choices offered. Unlike the previous games, this time NONE of the choices represented what I would have said. Zoe passed from a logical thinking being to a girl with crazy (stupid) thoughts. Also did not like that &quot;choice have consequence&quot; aspect stolen from The Walking Dead, especially when it prevent you from seeing everything the game have to offers in one playthrough. Now you have to play the game twice to see all zones.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=4683617">Expand</a></span>

Sure, because they are aiming so high, there are some technical issues - occasional stiff animations, lip-synching issues and performance problems, especially on higher graphical settings (which Red Thread have already promised to fix in future updates).
<br>
<br>But these are all because of the no-compromise approach they have to immersing you in a real, breathing environment you can relate to and freely roam in - full with actual people, stories, and events. Finally a story-heavy game which tells its narrative through live, interesting and meticulously scripted conversations in a living, breathing world. I&apos;m tired of the  supposedly &quot;story-heavy&quot; indies that feature nothing but an empty world and a set of letters to read, or ones that feature only closed underground corridors, just to have good performance. Sure, these other games&apos; approach is cheap and &quot;technically perfect&quot;, but misses out so much on the potential of the gaming medium.
<br>
<br>So if you, like me, have been waiting on a game that strives to fully immerse you in its world, and makes no compromise in representing that actual living world, inhabited by actual relatable people, just to look superficially perfect, you can totally look beyond issues like imperfect lip-synching and admire the good time you&apos;ll actually spend discovering Europolis&apos;s locations, characters and secrets - and they&apos;re all pretty admirable in their own right and are so obviously a work of love and passion.
<br>
<br>Now, if you&apos;re not familiar with the Dreamfall/Longest Journey universe, does Book One work as a good introduction to the series? Probably not, I&apos;d advise either starting at one of the previous full-length games or waiting for the full 5 episodes to be available. While Dreamfall Chapters is setting out to look like it will be a fully self-contained package in the end, just one episode (regardless of it being relatively long in running time for an episode) is just too small of a dip in this complex and highly political universe to be able to fully appreciate it on its own.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617635">Expand</a></span>

<br>So why is this relevant? You can find some great low budget adventure games, but they don&apos;t attract a mass audience like they once did because they lack the quality of high budget productions.
<br>And that&apos;s where Dreamfall Chapters comes in. It&#xB4;s not up to the quality of $40 Million  AAA titles, but it is a much bigger production then other recent adventure games.
<br>Great music, great voice acting. Nice visuals that can take advantage of newer tech. A cinematic look that reminds you of the time when big companies invested in adventure games. And above all, great storytelling. Yes, characters could be a bit more detailed. Facial capture could be better. But these are the few areas that remind you that this game was limited by budget. I can only imagine what the developer would be able to do if they had the budget of major AAA titles.
<br>I admit. I was skeptic. But once I started playing the game, I quickly felt immersed in the world. And that only happens when you&#xB4;re playing a great game.
<br>Dreamfall Chapters continues the story of the previous games and it reminds you once again why you loved them.

As a lover of the TLJ franchise, a lot of questions made in the previous games have gone on unanswered. This will be the conclusion of the story and the answer to all the unsolved riddles. The talking animations, as per usual in the TLJ franchise, need a little bit of work. In my opinion, solving the lip animations is the biggest problem. However, I seem to have been blinded by the previous games so much so that I almost expect (and therefore do not notice) it in this game.
<br>
<br>The graphical quality in this game is astounding yet I&apos;m having a bit of trouble getting this game to run at an appropriate frame rate. Granted, my computer&apos;s GPU is a year and a half behind its&apos; time, yet running this game at a lower quality does not produce at least 60 fps. This is a problem as I know this game is capable of doing that. Other than that, I enjoy the fresh new take on Stark and Arcadia... including the shoulder cam. If you have problems operating this view (after the first two hours of play), you have some issues.
<br>
<br>The puzzle solving is intuitive (what other reviewers here call &quot;childish&quot;), more intuitive than the other TLJ franchise games which helps a little bit because I am not decimated to literally sniffing out every possibility. There are some of those annoying &quot;get all these things in this area&quot; parts, but after the acquisition of the items, the puzzles follow sound logic (not video game logic, which for the most part doesn&apos;t make a whole lot of sense).
<br>
<br>Story wise, well, it&apos;s The F*%@$^  Longest Journey! What did you expect? Some sort of &quot;Ramirez Do Everything&quot; plot? Also, mayhaps some of the early reviews (I&apos;m looking at you, people who wrote before the third book release, and Kotaku) forgot one important thing about this franchise: it leads you in with a few hours of build and exposition before it slaps you in the face with development. THIS IS WHAT MAKES THIS SERIES SO GOOD. Not just because of what the twist was (WatiCorp was weird as hell in Dreamfall), but because of how satisfying the twists were. Now that I know that all our questions will be answered, it only makes me wonder more what that body-jarring reveal is going to be.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve addressed the haters a couple times in this review, but now I speak to them directly:
<br>
<br>Look, I understand that you are not pleased with parts of the game. Yes the game can be buggy, yes the saves don&apos;t exactly work right and are unhelpful in overcoming glitches. Yes, this game has some graphical issues, and yes these changes might be just a little bit much for some TLJ fans. However, think about what you are saying for a moment... you are judging this game as if it were a AAA title. However, it most certainly is not. It&apos;s an indie game that has been funded by its&apos; fans, and combined with a donation from the Norwegian Film Institute, Red Thread Games only has 1.25 million dollars to fund this game. Compare this to Triple-A game developers such as Warner Brothers and their recent Batman game which they couldn&apos;t even port to the PC properly. Not only are Arkham&apos;s problems worse than Dreamfall&apos;s, Arkham had a budget of tens of millions of dollars. Saying that you are judging them on the same scale as a Triple-A game developer is proof enough that this game is more than just an Indie Title, it&apos;s a piece of art and a huge step forward in populace-controlled culture. If you can&apos;t appreciate that, if you aren&apos;t patient enough to wait for a solid release and a promise of a quality product at the finish line, then you obviously just don&apos;t understand: this game was not made for you. This game was made for people who want to make a difference in the poisoned and weak video game industry and to open their hearts to something new. Fitting as well, seeing that this is one of the main underlying principles in the games: the fact that people as a whole are not willing to put up with something different.
<br>
<br>As for the episodic releases, well, everyone who&apos;s a fan of TLJ wanted to know that it was at least happening, right? It was in limbo for such a long period of time, it&apos;s pretty much been The Longest Journey waiting for this frickin game! But it&apos;s here, and I personally prefer the episodic releases as I just want to ensure that there are other real people on the other end and that they do care about their fans. Finally, someone actually cares.
<br>
<br>9/10 only because of some minor issues. With issues resolved, 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=5393937">Expand</a></span>

<br>But still I HIGHLY recommend this game to any adventure games fans. Or deep story fans, cuz the story is goooooood! And the sense of humour? Oh God! Absolutely amazing. This game is not for people with no patience tho, or shooter fans.

While it&apos;s not perfect, it definitely manages to recapture the magic in TLJ since it has more references to TLJ rather than its successor Dreamfall: The Longest Journey.
<br>
<br>The catch here is that in order to fully enjoy and understand everything that happens in Dreamfall Chapters, you should have already played the original TLJ and that&apos;s probably a letdown for most people since you have to play a 1999 point and click game with terrible graphics (but awesome art) and although this game is a landmark masterpiece for its time, most people will easily be put off by its age. However, if you haven&apos;t played it yet and you&apos;re up to the task, this will definitely make your Dreamfall Chapters experience 10x better.
<br>
<br>Now to be honest, the first few books are really slow paced and boring. If I wasn&apos;t a huge fan of the series I would have never touched the next books. The story doesn&apos;t really get interesting until somewhere in the middle in my opinion, but oh boy is it worth the wait. I could explain more on this but I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ll be getting into the spoilerish side of things so let&apos;s leave it at that. Keep going, you won&apos;t be dissappointed.
<br>
<br>So overall, great game, I would&apos;ve given it a 10 if it wasn&apos;t for the first books but the last books make it worth it and the whole TLJ saga tells an awesome story that will stay with you forever, I would easily recommend the whole series to adventure rpg fans any day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=6545104">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I really wanted to like Dreamfall Chapters so I tried playing it 5 different times but it just didn&apos;t work. When I got to Baba Yaga part I was literally depressed and I had to stop.
<br>
<br>Zo&#xEB; Maya Castillo discovered cynicism. I found it hard to believe that it was the same voice-actress that I loved in Dreamfall. She has these monologues that go on and on and on and on, and omg, it just never ends, incessant naval-gazing, and how she looks at the world around her through some Intellectual **** lens.
<br>
<br>Zo&#xEB; Maya Castillo acts like she&apos;s seen it all. Like she&apos;s too good for any of that &quot;world exploration&quot; and her character never FEELS anything. Even when she meets a gargoyle she comments &quot;This is just like that one time I went to France&quot; (French people are snotty, rude and frowning like Gargoyles, get it?).
<br>
<br>There&apos;s not one moment where she&apos;s fresh or in love or excited or just EXPERIENCING without some sort of bleak &apos;know-it-all&apos;commentary. And I don&apos;t blame the actress because her work in Dreamfall was really good. And also, didn&apos;t April Ryan start off fresh and then ended up cynical and then dead?
<br>Why do these characters end up used and botched?
<br>
<br>Also is future just about &quot;I went holidaying near that Nano-factory in Mozambique&quot;? I felt like Dreamfall Chapters tried to be edgy but came off as uninspiring and still clinging to its old days of glory. Thank god Twitter didn&apos;t exist when first TLJ came out.
<br>
<br>So the guy who created the game called Ragnar T&#xF8;rnquist discovered Social Justice Warriors or people who are hateful on Twitter and decided it would be ~edgy~ to have MORE of *THAT* in Dreamfall. I also read how he himself wrote on his website how &quot;Most players who criticize the game come from either France, Russia or Poland&quot; wow really -- well, Ragnar T&#xF8;rnquist why don&apos;t you go and burn ALL those damn French, Soviets and Poles with a flamethrower. How dare they voice out their opinion when they buy YOUR game? Put them back in their place on your own pathetic little website. Who are you, Madonna?
<br>
<br>The overall feel of TLJ and Dreamfall was gone but maybe the person who created those games is gone as well only to be replaced by an aging SJW Scandi-man who these days hides on Twitter.
<br>
<br>T&#xF8;rnquist always blatantly ripped of the Ring, Blade Runner and Resident Evil and &quot;culturally appropriated&quot; Japan and Russia to ignorant stereotypes but it didn&apos;t matter so much because we never had to hear Nordic racism and stereotypes and discrimination.
<br>
<br>I still enjoy games. There are still games (Broken Age Chapter 1) out there that are warm and fuzzy. And honestly I didn&apos;t even know who Ragnar T&#xF8;rnquist was when I played the first two games probably because his younger version didn&apos;t &quot;create&quot; bleak, cynical and politically correct and SJW (hateful liberals) worlds. Those games were more about the fantasy world than his ego.
<br>
<br>Ragnar T&#xF8;rnquist if Norway is such an &quot;enlightened&quot; country why aren&apos;t you more creative? Why are you a hypocrite? Why are you even on Twitter? Very inspirational environment?
<br>
<br>I wanted to like the game but I will never support this particular European brand of racism where it&apos;s okay to treat entire European countries like they are &quot;less&quot; and disposable.
<br>
<br>I never would have thought a guy who created Dreamfall and TLJ to be such a hateful and xenophobic person.
<br>
<br>Shame on you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=7413796">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What they&apos;ve done with this game is literally 1:1 copy the Telltale formula (complete with &quot;XXXXX will remember that&quot; and decisions that will affect later episodes as they&apos;re released, and it WORKS really well for this type of game. It&apos;s a little annoying that the game is episodic as my 10 could easily become a 2 depending on how the final episodes go as the game pans out, but as long as they can keep this standard, we&apos;re set for one of the best adventure games in years.
<br>
<br>Only thing I have to say is that you NEED to play The Longest Journey, or you&apos;ll be totally lost. This is NOT standalone, it is a sequel through-and-through and as such requires knowledge of what happened before. Not exactly a bad thing though, TLJ is available digital on Steam and still holds up to this day (go buy it, you won&apos;t regret it)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=4619488">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>To be fair, this game SORELY lacks a tutorial (not speaking for myself so much, but I can&apos;t let it slide when it will alienate many new or old players). Next, it&apos;s too bad the frame rate drops are present on my admittedly PS3 Era machine in most of Propast, but the rest of the game ran flawlessly and what was there was gorgeous and imaginative.
<br>
<br>What gets me about this game, is just how good these guys are and how sad it is that story, characters, and narratives have taken a back seat to spectacle and outside of games that really try to do both like most Bioware games, the AAA adventure and console RPG have died a slow death.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m bias and this game is near my heart, but if you can overlook these flaws, run, don&apos;t walk to grab a copy. The developers DESERVE it and I have confidence the full arc will be satisfying. It is too bad this one is episodic, but we&apos;ve all waited so long for more Stark and Arcadia that I can deal with it.
<br>
<br>This is easily my favorite kickstarter. I was a sucker for Tex, because I love him, but this is a different beast. This could truly be a good modern game that isn&apos;t just for the fans. I guess it&apos;s time to hope and wait.
<br>
<br>Thanks kickstarter.

<br>
<br>As it has been said the voice acting is great. Beyond that Dreamfall Chapters has a dull story, uninteresting with cliched characters. It advances very very slowly and the activities you are doing are boring as hell.
<br>The gameplay is clunky and slow, moving around takes forever in a boring city with no auto-run function (need to keep pressing shift all the time).
<br>
<br>Animations are mediocre at best. The graphics are so-so even on max settings, character models look terrible and faces are ugly. I&apos;m playing on dual 560ti&apos;s and had to disable sli and lower the graphics quality because the game is VERY badly optimized, so you&apos;ll get fps dumps all the time even on a good pc.
<br>
<br>All my trust on the makers has been shattered. This game feels like it was made in 2006 by an amateur studio.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=4618977">Expand</a></span>

<br>As a Longest Journey fan I found this, by far, not good. They&apos;re a lot of bugs in the game, the first installment shows very little conflict, bad &quot;Puzzles&quot; and extremely short with a very poor story. I didn&apos;t realize this game was episodic until I actually beat the first ep, and became really put off. Currently, I do not recommend this game, but I hope it pans out great.</span>

Being third installment of great adventure series it has so much potential of being fantastic game. And it ends up being mediocre at best.
<br>
<br>To sum it up:
<br>
<br>1) Nothing of consequence happens story-wise in Books 1 &amp; 2. Most characters are uninteresting, dialog is mediocre, themes and story arc from original Dreamfall are not touched at all. Too much pointless running around with no apparent reason. Very little any real content.
<br>
<br>2) The facial and other character animations are just bad. Even when the narrative tries to convey some kind of emotion, the characters just stand still with blank expression on their face. The original Dreamfall had better animations 10 years ago. Also very little humor. No jokes, no witty dialog, nothing. The overall tone of this game is very monotone.
<br>
<br>3) Point &amp; click problems. It&apos;s very easy to miss objects you can interact with. Often you know what you&apos;re supposed to do, but just can&apos;t figure the where to click or the correct order of clicking things.
<br>
<br>4) Slow graphics. Except the animations, the game actually looks quite nice. Unfortunately it has some performance issues. Even in high-end system it can have framerate issues and in many older systems it might be pretty much unplayable. This might be alleviated in future, if they decide to change to newer Unity version.
<br>
<br>To be fair, the Kian story arc has some interesting parts even in Books 1  &amp; 2. Also, while Book 3 mostly has the same problems as the previous two books, the story starts to pick up some speed. The game starts to address the story arc from original Dreamfall and even the dialog seems the get better (and wittier) at times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=5090698">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is wonderfully written - great story, great characters, excellent dialogue and voice acting - and beautifully designed. With two books out, Dreamfall Chapters is quickly earning its place as one of the most interesting games of 2015.
<br>Highly recommended.</span>

The wonderful story of The Longest Journey and Dreamfall are maintained, the graphical improvement is amazing and captures the beauty of the Storytime and Stark alike. The characters are as detailed and engaging as they have ever been and I feel more subtle and mature as well in a way that reflects Ragnar&apos;s growth as a storyteller.  The game is not perfect, the segment in Arcadia which was developed first is a little graphically rough, but not too distractingly so. Also this is the first episode and like the preceding games it&apos;s largely interested in grounding you in the life of the main character... so it IS a little slow. But for me that pace just gave me time to savor the world and drink in all of the loving detail.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=4633580">Expand</a></span>

<br>So, why this low score? Easy said: shoulder camera. It&apos;s sort of a new trend in gaming that I can&apos;t tolerate. It makes me feel unbalanced and ill, I have problems moving around and going straight with it. Even zooming out, the camera stays (although less) on the side of the character... and it often gets back to a more zoomed in position, adding the annoyance of zooming it out again quite often.
<br>The first Dreamfall had a perfectly fine and functional centered camera. I wish developers would have just sticked with that (or at least gave us the option to choose). It would have worked way better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=4614647">Expand</a></span>

The message, the story and all, not just the graphics. There is a heart beating within. A wonderful philosophy all around. ...and of course great atmosphere. Superb, and cruelly long-awaited sequel of TLJ. I&apos;m glad that such deeply spiritual and original games still exist.</span>

<br>Artdesign and story are amazing 10/10 (especially book 4,5).
<br>Since Story and Characters are the most importent thing for me in this Game(Saga), the game is

As usual, with Ragnar Tornquist at the helm, the writing is top notch and is a great narrative driven game.  The voice acting is well done and the visuals are decent to great.  Character models are a bit stiff and movement is a bit wonky at times.  There is not much in the way of game play and  there is a section with searching for Saga&apos;s pictures that was infuriatingly unnecessary.  So much so that I quit playing for a couple of weeks and then just slogged through that section to get on with the story.
<br>
<br>All in all its a deep and rich story and worth playing to experience.  Having been a huge fan of Ragnar&apos;s work in the past, this does not disappoint if you go into it understanding that its more narrative than game.  For me its an excellent game but not as good as The Longest Journey, Dreamfall.  I happen to also really enjoy The Secret World - and wish Ragnar and Martin Bruusgard were still a part of that team.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=6471911">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But that being said. It&apos;s very short. I took my time and it only took 4.5 hours to finish. I... must have missed something... I must have. I will still recommend this game, giving the history of this game. But 4.5 hours is a little disappointing. It will potentially have great replay value. Once you get the complete game. I might give it another go, to explore the other options, but I can&apos;t seem to put my original run in a separate save file. So I&apos;d probably have to rerun it 2 times to get everything set for book 2. Which seems like a waste of time.
<br>
<br>I hope they can make the funding last... for now this get a 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=4729070">Expand</a></span>

The game is littered with a variety of technical issues, which are overshadowed by the lack of optimization. I imagine Red Thread will eventually release a patch that increases performance on a wide spectrum of hardware. The good news is, the game is not unplayable. At medium and low settings, the game still looks quite aesthetically pleasing.
<br>
<br>The length of Book one leaves a lot to be desired, and being an adventure game where story takes precedence, it&#x2019;s a bittersweet experience. Just as book one was becoming interesting, it ends. This is reminiscent of Dreamfall: The Longest Journey. However, book one builds up to a strong foundation which I suspect will lead to a story as grand and interesting as The Longest Journey and Dreamfall.
<br>
<br>The addition of choices which change the story, is meaningful to a series that has always had a strong, but linear narrative. This allows for a diversity that only recent adventure games have introduced, and increases the replayability of the game.  I was disappointed that none of the choices you made had much of an immediate impact, however I am also appreciative of this. It allows the creative team at Red Thread to really think how the decisions we make might impact the story, and it only increases my anticipation for the next book to be released.
<br>
<br>Be warned, that the game gives almost no context to the world around you, and only gives little snippets to past events. This seems to fit with the main character, although it leaves a bit to be desired as a player. As someone who has spent a lot of time with the previous games, I didn&#x2019;t experience any issue with immediately getting immersed in the world. For other players, this might be an issue. I would highly recommend playing the previous iterations before trying this game out.
<br>
<br>If you are an adventure fan, who primarily wants an involving and impactful narrative to immerse yourself in, Dreamfall chapters will give you that. However, with four books still left to be released, be prepared to have a gap every couple of months.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=4625122">Expand</a></span>

First of all the graphics are fine, but has its fps drops, the game&apos;s pacing is super slow, didnt find the character interactions too intresting, you roam through a city endlessly using the same routes again and again and again. Ull have sort of an escrot mission with a robot which is plain boring. ull be running from point a to point b and back, running takes forever by the way. nothing  intresting to keep me on toes happens. the beginning of the game had promise more. at the end theres not much to keeo me wanting to get back for more despite the fact i loved the previous games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=4652924">Expand</a></span>

<br>+Story is well crafted and of high quality
<br>+Good voice acting
<br>+Good world, atmosphere, graphics, old locations revisited and new ones are wonderfully presented
<br>+Good soundtrack
<br>+You&apos;re choices affect the storyline
<br>+Powerful conclusion
<br>
<br>+/- Game might not really fit to players which are not fans of the series and haven&apos;t played the now very old previous installments
<br>+/- Music is a bit recycled throughout the game
<br>+/- A good conclusion to Dreamfall, and to the entire saga, but not a very good one to its own story
<br>
<br>- Story, although good, feels half-baked at times, and doesn&apos;t get to the peaks and levels of depth that TLJ and DF managed to get to.
<br>- Supporting characters are simply not as good or as significant as in the past
<br>- Your choices affect some stuff, but in the end &apos;story is already written and we can&apos;t change it&apos;
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve written a longer (much longer) review on Steam and wanted to post it here as well but I simply wrote too much!
<br>
<br>Although I do have some complaints and hard feelings towards chapters, It is a honorable closure to Dreamfall and The Longest Journey.
<br>It simply didn&apos;t feel to me as good as those previous games, but the ending really made up for it, at least for me, and was really moving and powerful.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a fan of the series you should play it, for the very least to learn and get the answers for the questions from the last game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=4805725">Expand</a></span>

<br>The balance between exploration and exposition isn&apos;t always perfect, and especially in book 1 and 2 you have plenty of (boring) walking/running to do to find out tiny bits of informations needed to further the story.
<br>Luckly it picks up the pace on book 3 and 4, leaving book 5 as a grand finale where you watch more than you play, but after having gotten there you wont mind, as you&apos;ll crave answers.
<br>
<br>Answers that are a tad too reliant on deus ex machina and inconsistent explaination, on par with the otherwise intriguing balance between fate, casuality and choices. Perfect? Surely not, but satisfying enough and with plenty of swerves.
<br>Some twists are rather easy to foresee, but others are well-done and surprising. And it all ties up in a rather satisfying way, with a final touch that closes the trilogy.
<br>
<br>The &quot;choices and consequences&quot; system works well, and it really makes you (over)think some of the key decisions. Big news is, those choices DO MATTER, even though the journey has one end, the paths and the ways to get there are indeed different depending on what you choose.
<br>
<br>The cast of characters, old and new, is simply stellar, with plenty of memorable and endearing personas (seriously, Enu is simply adorable). Zoe, much like April in TLJ, is quirky enough to be interesting, but realistic enough to be a believable &quot;average-special girl&quot;. Even Kian shows a better personality compared to the somewhat dull showing in Dreamfall.
<br>
<br>As a minor annoyance, the socio-political message is too heavy-handed at times, especially the elections in Europolis and the prison camps in Arcadia. Not to mention same-sex relationships.
<br>Odd how a generally well-crafted piece of fiction like the TLJ trilogy resorted to unnecessary exaggeration, while subtlety would have conveyed the same message in a classier way.
<br>
<br>All in all, an enjoyable adventure, more than a game, but not entirely a game. TLJ-aficionados will find it good or even great, while its flaws and its atypical playing mechanics will frustrate, or bore, those more used to action-packed games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=7188045">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Cons :
<br>
<br>- point and click gameplay I don&apos;t like much
<br>- technically average : animations are rigid, environments and characters textures can be excellent or ugly, bad optimized (a GTX 1080 TI SLI is required to play in 4K, everything maxed without AA)
<br>- 5 books launched months after months : not tailored to video games because it breaks the immersion
<br>- too much time between this one and the 2 previous games : a brief recap is given but is insufficient.
<br>
<br>In spite of a few defaults, this saga is one of the best video games stories. What a pity that the 3 games The Longest Journey, Dreamfall the longest journey and Dreamfall Chapters were not launched as a single one : the immersion would have been far increased.
<br>
<br>It is strongly advised to play the 2 previous games before this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dreamfall-chapters/user-reviews?user_review_id=7427434">Expand</a></span>
