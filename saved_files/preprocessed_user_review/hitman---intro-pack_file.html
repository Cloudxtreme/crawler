<br>BAD:
<br>
<br>- Scripted events, triggered by player proximity. Stupid, stupid mechanic! Huge step back from Blood Money.
<br>- Performance is abysmal. On Gtx 980 Ti doesn&apos;t run 60 fps, can dip down to 30-40 range in big crowds.
<br>- Only one map. The tutorial levels are nothing worth mentioning
<br>- No human shield, keyhole peeking, newspaper report, manual fighting (they are quicktime events)
<br>
<br>GOOD:
<br>
<br>- Nice graphics if you have monster PC. On low systems high graphics can&apos;t be even selected. Nothing as good as Witcher 3, which runs a lot better too
<br>- Loadout selection. No weapon customization though, but you can choose gear and unlock more as you go
<br>- The 1 level is huge and tons of things to do / routes to go. But key events are still scripted
<br>- HUD handholding and instinct can be turned off
<br>
<br>But this player proximity triggered script crap is a HUGE flaw. It detracts so much from the otherwise open level. It feels fake and spoonfeeds information. It&apos;s not like Blood Money where ppl would mind their own business, and things happened on &quot;universal clock&quot;. In this game NPC is waiting until you show up, then starts to talk so you can get the spoon fed info about what to do next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6184794">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s one mission and some training tutorials, so if you want the full thing you need to wait until December when the game is fully released. It is quite possibly one of the strangest video game release decisions I have ever witnessed, because it literally makes no sense. Why are you releasing the game one mission at a time? I would rather just wait and have a complete game free of bugs than have it released in pieces. Regardless, the game itself, from what I played, is not that bad. It definitely goes back to its Blood Money routes, the location is gorgeous and there are lots of fun ways to kill your targets. So why the low rating?
<br>
<br>- Always online DRM. Yes, after the whole SimCity debacle, companies are still implementing this **** useless feature that punishes the actual people who by the game legally and not the pirates. Absolutely awful idea, mainly because as of right now you can be kicked out of your game very often and have to reload from your last save point. What a stupid feature.
<br>
<br>- Locked graphics options. If you don&apos;t have a 4 GB video card, you will not be able to play at certain resolutions or use higher resolution textures. I mean, the game doesn&apos;t work or run very well anyways, so I&apos;m not sure why they are punishing PC players here. Another stupid decision.
<br>
<br>- Poor performance overall. Another awful PC port with terrible frame rate drops, especially in crowds.
<br>
<br>- No blood. Yeah, in a game where you kill people you would think that there would actually be blood decals, which they actually implemented in Blood Money, but for some reason that&apos;s too much work 10 years later. Killing people is like shooting a bag of sand. Also, people&apos;s bodies still collapse into ridiculously unnatural positions once they are killed.
<br>
<br>Overall, I would wait until the game is fully released, and then I would only buy it once the punitive measure against PC players have been removed completely. As for now, the game is a mess on release, because AAA developers don&apos;t really seem to care anymore. The game itself is okay, but it is not complete, so I am not going to give it a score based on one mission alone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6187777">Expand</a></span>

<br>Don&apos;t believe reviews saying it has anything to do with blood money. It&apos;s just professional reviewers being pushers. Sadly, even Rock Paper Shotgun has joined the websites you can not trust anymore despite the talent full writers.
<br>
<br>Besides the always online requirement, the technical port to PC is as is now a tradition to SE a shame with limited resolution and arbitrary restrictions imposed to the user. But who cares about users anyways when you leave people with dumb ideas in position to impose stupid functionalities to the game in your managerial organisation.
<br>
<br>Speaking of ... yes this is just one level. And you may see another one in 6 months from now.
<br>What a joke.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_6192427"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I wonder whether this episodic release thingie is some sort of an experiment, or whether they were forced to do it this way, as I cannot think of really convincing reasons otherwise why this wasn&apos;t released as a complete product.
<br>Let&apos;s look at the pros:
<br>The game looks great, and performance was decent on my system (i4790, 16 gigs RAM, GTX960 with 4 gigs, Windows 7). Controls are not bad, I played this with an Xbox controller for Windows.
<br>The mission (this &quot;intro pack&quot; comes with two tutorial missions, one of them you are required to play twice in different ways). For the actual mission (Paris), it&apos;s fun to walk around, explore, gather information that will help you to execute your assassinations etc.
<br>All that is nice, now for the cons:
<br>
<br>- The DRM requires you to be online at all times while you play. Now, I have a very fast and stable connection, and still, there were connection issues, which really leads me to believe these are problems on the side of the company, like thier server crashing or hiccuping or not being able to cope with all the connections. If you lose connection during a mission, your progress is lost.
<br>Now, I understand the need for DRM and support it. In some cases, players have themselves to blame for all the trading and ripping games or downloading them without paying. However, if the DRM causes so many issues, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the way to go, and it punishes pretty much everyone. The system simply is not stable enough.
<br>
<br>- I am not a hardcore fan of the franchise. I played previous Hitman games, and liked them, but I am not sure whether the average Hitman-player loves to replay missions over and over and over in order to actually find all methods of killing the target and getting all the achievements.
<br>if you prefer to do that, if you&apos;re a true completionist, the episodic release might be just great. You get plenty of time to do everything you possibly can in that first mission, get every achievement, find every secret.
<br>If you prefer to actually move on in the game, I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll enjoy the episode-system. I am by no means rushing through the games I play, I often take my sweet time with games, exploring and experimenting.
<br>but after doing the tutorial (the &quot;final test&quot;, which, I was told, was supposed to be a tougher mission than other hitmen have to accomplish, took me about 10-15 min. I snuck in, there were hints at some parachute-test, I found a plane, easily disguised myself as a tech, sabotaged the plane and finished the mission... not that it wasn&apos;t fun, but it was not that demanding at all, didn&apos;t fail once or got even close, and no, I didn&apos;t use the hint-system, which is supposed to make the game a bit easier if you&apos;d prefer that), I jumped into the Paris mission, killed the targets a few times in different ways, and then... I was puzzled at what to do next.
<br>
<br>Again, I am not sure whether I was playing the previous games all wrong. I did take my time with them, tried different approaches, but never tried to be a completionist about it.
<br>I reckon that you can get anything from 2-6 hours of playtime out of the tutorial and first mission. After that, oyu have two choices:
<br>- Play the same tutorials and mission over and over and over again, trying to get any challenge done, trying to find each and every method to kill a target.
<br>- Or wait a couple of weeks for the next level.
<br>
<br>A blogger said that he isn&apos;t sure gamers were willing to keep the game installed and return to it a couple of weeks later to play the next part, and I agree. By the time the next levels are ready, I probably will be into another game, and to go back and adjust every time... I dunno.

<br>So in MY case (your mileage may very much vary), the episodic release is not a good idea, I&apos;d very muich have preferred the whole game all at once.
<br>The game IS kinda open world, even though the challenges and opportunitites dictate the ways you can kill a target. So if open world, to you, is a level where, if disguided correctly and walk around pretty much the whole level to find one of the methods to complete the mission, then it is open world.
<br>
<br>So to sum it up: Performance and controls are nice. Story and voice-acting are nothing to write home about, and I&apos;d have preferred to experience the whole story, instead of having to wait for the next chapter.
<br>Missions are nice, great backdrops/settings, lots of details. AI is... ok. Nothing more, nothing less. The episodic release, to me, is a bad decision, and I doubt that I&apos;ll upgrade once the next parts are ready, as by then, I&apos;ll prolly have moved on to another game, and I don&apos;t see the fun in &quot;milking&quot; the one level we got just to pass the time until we get the next part of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6192427">Expand</a></span>

I have heard many friends say, &quot;Hitman games get worse with every one&quot; and they have been vindicated; this game is truly not good and their release strategy for it is horrible for the user; they&apos;ve essentially created a nine month beta before the game is complete.  I was able to play through the first two training missions and the one, regular one without incident.  When I came back to play the challenges where 47 starts in various rooms with different disguises, the game started crashing frequently (updated drivers did not change crash frequency).  Overall, I would not recommend anyone to purchase this until the complete game is out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6196725">Expand</a></span>

<br>Square Enix has apparently adopted a policy of punishing their customers. They can either buy the entire, yet-to-be-released game upfront and wait months for Square Enix to deliver it, or wait until there&apos;s an actual, consumable product that delivers the content that they paid for and pay more for it.
<br>
<br>Excuse me Square Enix, but I simply can&apos;t resist asking: Have you completely lost your god-da.mned mind?  This episodic bull-sh&#xA1;t is just another way of selling a game that&apos;s in pre-order status!  The only difference, is that you won&apos;t pay MORE for a pre-orderable game that you wait to buy until it goes gold!
<br>
<br>Couple this middle finger with another that basically requires all players to be online just to play, even though there&apos;s no multiplayer component or other legitimate reason to justify this (and no, leader boards DO NOT qualify as one).  Not only that, but there&apos;s apparently no fault tolerance WHATSOEVER, which means that if the game servers go down, the paying customers are the ones who suffer!
<br>
<br>Congratulations, you&apos;re all a bunch of focking idiots.  I hope all the people who pitched this episodic bullsh&#xA1;t and ridiculous online requirement find themselves OUT OF A JOB.  In any case however, my refund has been issued.
<br>
<br>The ONLY reason I gave a 2 instead of a 0 is because, surely, there were people who worked on this game whose efforts would have made it a great one if not for the egregious missteps above..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6201390">Expand</a></span>

<br>I can&apos;t say it&apos;s a reboot. They just took the best from Blood Money and Absolution and added some bullsh*t to it. First of all, DENUVO and MUST-BE-ONLINE-SERVICE. This Online service ruined this game completely. It took about 3 or 4 points from the whole Metacritic score. Next, one of the worst optimizations ever. Not even Ubisoft dare release such unfinished and unpolished product. And third, as I&apos;ve mentioned before.. episodes. Are they joking? Is this Telltale or what? How the hell do they imagine Hitman with an episodic release dates. It&apos;d be fine if there were like 6-10 missions per episode, but 3.. Sorry, but I refund.
<br>
<br>2/10. Worst Hitman ever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6216599">Expand</a></span>

Since when does the game company release a game part by part, and let the users be the beta tester, so that their later releases are more stable? An indi game? Sure. An AAA game? Go fk yerself!

<br>Step 2 : Use unfinished/buggy dx12, crappy dx11 engine

<br>
<br>They are releasing small chunks of this game every month. This means by the time the next chunk comes out I am already bored with Hitman anyway. This just makes me feel scummy supporting them. They should have marked this as early access.
<br>
<br>They lost a 15 year Hitman player in me because of their scummy release schedule. I can never trust them again.</span>

<br>Long review: This revival of the series could have been great.  The idea is there...a return to variety and diversity in mission-approach.  But the whole thing is ruined by an episodic format that completely wrecks any sense of &quot;epic&quot; gameplay.  It feels like you played a massively overpriced tutorial and warm-up mission....because that&apos;s exactly what happened.  It does not bode well for the future of the game, where a handful of scattered missions are planned for a lot of money, and you will already have paid tons of money for small-time, nickel-and-dime DLC before even knowing if the next missions will be awful.  Pay now, and wait for the game to be finished and hope it isn&apos;t terrible.  That is a horrible business model.  Give this game a pass until the actual release date....in a year or two.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6199453">Expand</a></span>

I may be in the minority when I say that I could stomach Absolution. It had its moments. And I was really anticipating this new Hitman, which seemed to combine the best of both previous games.
<br>I was willing to overlook the drip-fed level release because it seemed as though the maps would have enough to do, what with challenges and Contracts. And I was right - they do!
<br>But... There&apos;s that &apos;But&apos;. The requirement to be always online is effectively a dealbreaker. &quot;Sure&quot; they say, &quot;You can play offline, but you can&apos;t progress anywhere and we&apos;re going to lock out 90% of the game.&quot; Yes, yes, because the need to be online all the time is SOOO pressing in a single-player game. There is no kind of frustration quite like the one you feel after taking the (considerable) time to stalk your targets, set up a brilliantly-timed ambush, and making your way discreetly toward the exit when the game kicks you out 10 steps away from the door - losing all your progress as a result.
<br>IO, I love you guys, and I don&apos;t quite believe that the decision for always-online was your idea (because Square Enix is run by gamer-hating corporate morons, as we all know only too well). But I cannot play your lovely new game until this crisis is resolved.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6203138">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t abide by this one bit. That $15 intro pack carries with it a single mission, btw. The prologue is simply the beta tutorial. And if the one stage you get, which while lovely is still one map, is that short, the remaining cities 47 is scheduled to visit already seem like not enough for (more than) $60. It&apos;s like they said &quot;you wanted Blood Money, well, here&apos;s half of that and we&apos;ll charge you more for it as we roll out segments.&quot; Despicable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6180872">Expand</a></span>

<br>Looking at the Intro pack in a game play standpoint, It&apos;s an improvement from Absolution and they&apos;ve seem to gone back with Blood Money&apos;s style of game play. But they have changed a bit. First they have sedating now, where 47 chokes someone unconscious instead of using the anesthetic which does make the game play a lot easier because you don&apos;t have to worry about running out of anesthetic which is disappointing but not too much of a downer and they added all these extra features each level which gives a level some replay value. Overall I really enjoy the game play and I look forward to the rest of the game.
<br>
<br>But the problem that everyone complains about the game is the marketing that Square Enix tried to pull off. &quot;Releasing the game by episodes&quot; and &quot;Full release by 2017&quot;. And you know what... everyone is right to get pissed off. Because some people actually paid the full 60 or 70 bucks to play this game, and if Square Enix decides to scrap the entire game before the game is finished then those people are screwed. I&apos;m not risking myself and my wallet to buy anymore episodes. I&apos;ve tried the intro pack for my friends and seeing that it&apos;s 15 dollars is a slap in the face.
<br>
<br>So I&apos;m going to wait till the full game is released. I was hyped for the gameplay until I saw the pricetag. What a f**king joke Square Enix.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6219991">Expand</a></span>

Then I heard of the the ridiculous always-online DRM and that&apos;s what totally ruined it for me. Look devs, you created what could &apos;ve been the greatest game of 2016 but smashed your own product with this overkill DRM as it is a punishement for your true fans, your honest customers! Realise that this is extremely repulsive to show such distrust an disrespect by implementing always-online DRM. A mechanic that adds nothing to the game-experience besides issues with servers and such. That is what we get as a thank you for being an honest customer! Why cannot you see this devs?! Look at this poor userscore on Metacritic! Cannot you see this is a major error you are making? Why not go for a retry and get rid of that always-online-sh*t instead of annoying the true fan? Sorry guys, but I can only show my deepest disenchantment with a massive zero score! And out of both dissapointment and protest I will not buy your game as long as this cruel DRM pesists. Sorry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6338766">Expand</a></span>

<br>You&#x2019;re introduced with a prelude that introduces the story and agent 47 you&#x2019;re are sent through a brief tutorial with a final test to let you play with your skills.
<br>Much like the past hitman games, there are multiple ways to kill your targets, you can collect poison, add it to a food or drink, use explosives, mess with objects, and to get to various sections of a map you of course have to steal disguises&#x2026;
<br>This is where things get a little frustrating&#x2026;
<br>Disguises will almost always give you away if you&#x2019;re too close to npcs wearing the same outfit as you, which makes sense since  you would think they would recognize their coworkers, but the frustration comes in because in some locations only certain uniforms are allowed without you just getting shot at,
<br>which kind of defeats the purpose of a disguise,
<br>Either get shot at as soon as you trespass or power walk from someone who find you suspicious until they shoot you
<br>And you can&#x2019;t really turn this into a 3rd person shooter like you could in absolution, because 3 shots and you&#x2019;re dead&#x2026;
<br>if you raise any suspicion at all you&#x2019;re surrounded&#x2026;
<br>This could maybe be fixed if they only become suspicious if you stick around for a while rather than just stay in their line of sight...
<br>Which is another frustration...
<br>The first 2 maps are crawling with enemies, everyone has someone watching them&#x2026;.
<br>You can&#x2019;t really tell if you&#x2019;re in someone&#x2019;s line of sight until it&#x2019;s too late&#x2026;
<br>I&#x2019;m actually almost 100% sure that you&#x2019;re in someone&#x2019;s line of sight at all times
<br>enemies for the most part just stand there, which leaves your stealth combat options practically useless&#x2026;
<br>you&#x2019;re almost forced to use environmental opportunities
<br>I feel handcuffed to trying to beat the game the way it wants me to, rather than feeling like I&#x2019;m being dropped into an area with a few tools to do as I please&#x2026;.
<br>And when I say area, I mean area&#x2026;
<br>You can buy the game upfront for $60, buy the first pat for $15 and every episode afterwards for $10
<br>And for that $15 initially you get to create contracts to challenge the online community (fair warning though, a crappy internet connection isn&#x2019;t going to cut it), 2 story contract missions and a tutorial.
<br>That&#x2019;s right, hitman Paris is One. Single. Mission.
<br>This game relies on replay value.
<br>The tutorial makes this clear by actually making you replay the tutorial a different way.
<br>And the trophies make this clear by asking you to try and complete all of the different opportunities.
<br>This is what they want you to do.
<br>Take this one map and take out your targets in as many ways as you can.
<br>I will say though that the map is crawling with life, it is really cool to explore the massive event going on that is this Paris fashion show, and figuring out how you&#x2019;re going to pull off assassinating 2 targets and escaping without being killed yourself&#x2026;.
<br>Especially with how difficult and annoying the enemies in and around every corner can make it
<br>You&#x2019;re up for a stealthy challenge here&#x2026;
<br>While I personally don&#x2019;t find myself replaying the same map to change my approach over and over..
<br>Or to even take out a different target
<br>I can see how fans of the stealth genre could enjoy such a thing
<br>I giver Hitman Paris a 7.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6191496">Expand</a></span>

If this is the standard the future chapters provide, I&apos;ve no doubt my money was well spent. A Hitman game is an experience not many games provide. The opening training area with its multi-tiered ways of assassination can compete with full priced games. Each to their own, but I&apos;m giving this a 10 for every aspect of content I&apos;ve seen. The music , graphics, gameplay, story, control, UI, and value for money are contained in this taster of a bigger pie coming later this year. I&apos;m saddened that so many people take great pride in giving a game like this zero. It&apos;s far from that offensive score and if you dislike it purely because it&apos;s online, give it a 5.

<br>
<br>4) Do not purchase the full pack. In fact.... If love hitman but have the strenght to wait. Don&apos;t even purchase the intro pack.
<br>
<br>I am giving it a score of 8/10 based on the quality of the content available alone... Which is very good, make no mistake... But.... They made the wrong call making the man episodic. Episodic releases might have worked perfectly in games like &quot;life is strange&quot; or any telltale games. But here? It makes absolutly no sense... and the game feel like a generous demo at best because of it.
<br>
<br>I have no doubt that the final product will be amazing at release.... But the business practice here is shamefull and should be pointed out.
<br>
<br>I asked for a refund on the game. Not because it&apos;s bad, but vecause I want to show squarenix that they made a very bad business decision here. One that I do not wish to support.
<br>
<br>Great game, stay excited for it... It will be amazing. But Don&apos;t buy a demo... Don&apos;t encourage them to make more games like this. Wait. And get the game when it&apos;s woth the full 60 buck tag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6185067">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now, even once you&apos;ve figured it out- and assuming you have put up with all the insane amount of bugs and glitches that overall, Hitman (2016) feels like a poor cash in attempt,  if you want a good hitman experience then go with the previous games like Hitman Blood Money as a prime example of a superior game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=7095311">Expand</a></span>

You can run away from guards, they&apos;ll see you go into a bathroom and you can just quickly hide in a locker and they&apos;ll say &quot; where did he go&quot; and they NEVER will check the locker unless you go into one when you&apos;re right in front of them and even then sometimes they will say &quot; he disappeared out of thin air&quot;..
<br>
<br>The controls are okay, but the shooting feels a bit off. Sometimes when you shoot people it will not hit them even if your aim was perfect.. You can not punch or kick people manually, instead you will be greeted with a QTE sequence.
<br>
<br>The graphics are okay but nothing spectacular. I didn&apos;t have any technical issues with the game on a i7 6700k and R9 Fury X.
<br>
<br>You CAN have fun with this game but the fun will fade quickly when playing the same few levels over and over again.  If anything all this did was not make me want to play anymore of the game regardless of the future episodes..  If this was a full game I probably would of gave it a 7 but an incomplete game for full price deserves an incomplete score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6341536">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>After Deus Ex Human Revolution (Awesome Title and Series...  so far) i thought Thief (in its latest reincarnation) was a misfire.  Ok.  Happens.  Didn&apos;t shake the reputation of either Eidos or Square Enix for me.
<br>
<br>Now this &quot;masterpiece&quot; comes out.
<br>
<br>I was a fan of Hitman up to this abysmal sequel.
<br>I was a fan of Eidos and Sqaure Enix until their acidic greedy vomit was belched daringly into my face.
<br>And i was going to get Deus Ex Mankind Divided.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s all in the past - along with several other companies and game series you, Eidos, Square Enix, and Hitman - do not exist to me any longer.  Deus Ex?  I expect the same **** when it comes out in a few days.  I see where your abysmal avarice is taking you.
<br>
<br>Prey on the kids who never tasted the Quality of a Game Developed for a PC Gamer.  But my dollar - goes somewhere else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6651282">Expand</a></span>

AWFUL controls, just awful, buttons are all in weird places, sometimes you need to push X, sometimes T, which is quite impossible since you cannot move your fingers from WASD. As for story - dunno, I&apos;ve just completed first task several times and the game feels so unnatural - you cant jump, you cant go of the cliff - invisible border prevents it. Sometimes clues are so obvious that it makes no fun at all, sometimes is very hard to find. Well, I really don&apos;t feel a desire to continue.

<br>
<br>47 finds himself at the doorstep of a shadowy agency (the ICA) who are uneasy of 47&apos;s history, but are fascinated with 47&apos;s abilities to perform as a contract Hitman. However the agency begins to realise that agent 47 might be a little too dangerous for comfort.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Classic Hitman gameplay taken to the next level.
<br>Nice graphics if you can run high end.
<br>Good Story (so far)
<br>Replayability with different challanges and ways to approach the contracts.
<br>Random contracts where you only have one chance to complete.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Some may find the episodic content model frustrating.
<br>Special treatment for those that pay full price seems alienating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hitman---intro-pack/user-reviews?user_review_id=6662856">Expand</a></span>
