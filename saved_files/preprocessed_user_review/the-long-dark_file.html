It uses this kind of cell shading graphics yet it impresses for how much it feels real. The sense of clinging to life is always present when you constantly find new places, train tracks, trailers, a dam, makes you hold on to hope, for a better day tomorrow. It may sound easy, but believe me - it&apos;s not. There are a lot of different ways of dying and you never know what will kill you this time, so the game itself makes you feel nervous...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-long-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=4528639">Expand</a></span>

The story is fine, at least it seems. What has been done is remarkable. But....
<br>but....bugs, glitches, wolves popping out of nothing, invisible wolves, wolves running madly, stupid checkpoints, story vicious circles that force you to start over again...and above all, Italian language (a feature promised in early access) suddenly disappeared.
<br>
<br>I love this game, seriously, but this way of managing the game is by an amateur at best
<br>VOTE 3 to Hinterland, what the hell are you doing?
<br>
<br>********
<br>I played this game for 50 hours so far... and yet there is so much to be explored! the Game has huge potential, but now it is crucial to see toward which direction it will go.
<br>I have two different approaches to this game:
<br>
<br>1) Pure Survival Experience: in this aspect, the game is wonderful, no objective, no ultimate explanation of what happened, no ending. It&apos;s just you, alone, in the wilderness.
<br>Walking quietly in the snow, you look for animal tracks, collecting herbs and mushrooms, you hear, you see, you feel the environment.
<br>and while playing you start thinking: &quot;it&apos;s getting late, better turn back and my way home, a shelter, a cave, anything to protect you from wind and snow...and you light a campfire, the night is dark and cold, wolves are howling, minutes, hours passing, pure relaxation.
<br>
<br>2) Survival with a scope: after some days of survival and exploration, you start feeling there is something wrong in there, too many corpses, all human activity ceased, what happened here? Surviving isn&apos;t enough, you start feeling the urge to explore and understand, you have a scope, there is an end to the game (apart from dying of course).
<br>
<br>In the end, what can I say, I love Sandbox mode, no clue, no objective, just you and nature. Very mature and relaxing.
<br>On the other side, what will be the Story mode? will it be another among countless catastrophic survival game that ends to be meaningless and lose their appeal after few game hours?
<br>
<br>I hope the developers keep improving the first aspect of the game, Nature, its mechanics, the environment, everything that is moving around you. Story maybe an intriguing part of the game, but definitely, this game is great for the atmosphere and the amazing details of the environment, wind, tracks, sounds, calories, cold, dehydration...
<br>
<br>I hope the game will improve more and more on this side</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-long-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=5769367">Expand</a></span>

Whether you just feel like wandering and trying to survive the starvation and cold, or if you are ready to brave all that this harsh wilderness has to offer, The Long Dark has the perfect balance of this.

It&apos;s one of the most beautiful games you&apos;ll play and it&apos;s got a real minimalist hud.
<br>
<br>I would have given it a 10 but for two reasons. Firstly there&apos;s a lack of &apos;auto walk&apos; feature which is needed since you spend most of your time walking about the place, exploring or traveling. And secondly because there&apos;s a sort of lack of things to do in the late game when you&apos;re all set up, but they did address that somewhat with the latest patch which altered foraging, so you&apos;ll have to spend a lot more time foraging for firewood.
<br>
<br>The devs that are making this are also good devs, they don&apos;t mess about and they release updates regularly, so another reason to get it - it&apos;ll get regular updates, usually one per month.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-long-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=5404033">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Long Dark is</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Append: A few weeks ago, a tremendous story mode was released.

With this, I can overlook some minor bugs and UI issues at the moment. Because I think, The Long Dark will be a very sound and professional product in the end.
<br>
<br>The Long Dark is already on a very, very high level - even in early access.
<br>Why? Because of the incredible amount of realistic details, such as
<br>
<br>+ The weight you can wear depends on the fatigue of your character
<br>+ If you walk up the wind, you are slower and need more endurance
<br>+ The wind force has an influence on your felt temperature
<br>+ After a snowstorm, many new branches are available
<br>+ If you eat salt cracker, you get thirsty
<br>
<br>But that&apos;s not all. Further arguments:
<br>
<br>+ A convincing I am-completely-alone-atmosphere
<br>+ Well thought-out regions with many interesting areas
<br>+ Food is scarce, ammunition even scarcer (collect arrows!)
<br>+ Skill-system (you&apos;ll get better in making fire etc.)
<br>+ Highly incentive ( &quot;Do I survive the next day?&quot;)
<br>
<br>The graphics have their own comic-like style. Thanks to Unity Engine, it is very low on hardware resources.
<br>However, the setting is very impressing. If you are sitting in a hut and the winter wind blows outside, the fireplace flickers inside ... these are moments that only a few games can give you! I also like how the character expresses his emotions. He will integrate into what is happening, for example, when he groans from exhaustion.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: A very high-quality survival simulator with very realistic requirements. Although there are only bears and wolves as opponents, the game has quite its creepy moments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-long-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=6767897">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>With an emphasis on atmosphere and exploration, Hinterland have beautifully crafted a brilliant game, although at the moment still in beta, and with just a sandbox mode (Nov 2015).
<br>
<br>It is essentially a game of balance. You need to gather resources, and be able to defend yourself at all times, from wolves, bears, the extreme cold, starvation, dehydration, fatigue, dysentery, infection and falls.
<br>
<br>It taps into the innermost fears most have, fear of the dark, the unknown, vulnerability, loneliness  and, of course, death. It does so in the most innocuous ways, leaving you always thinking 2 steps ahead/behind, and always looking over your shoulder. But make no mistake, unless you get mauled by a bear while resting in your sleeping bag, this isn&apos;t a jump-scare fest. The scares are slow burning, realistic and ever-present.
<br>
<br>In sandbox mode, there are currently limited areas to explore, but any new game takes quite a while to succumb to the inevitable, long dark. My record life span is 177 (in-game) days ... but I am working on that. I normally put aside two weeks to play, a few hours each evening.
<br>
<br>What I love most about this game is the crisply defined atmosphere. The weather sound effects in particular are amazing, whether indoors or outdoors, it always feels real. The soundscape makes up for the lack of variety in visible fauna, as they are always there... in the background.
<br>
<br>There are some downsides and bugs, which will undoubtedly be fixed/improved in time, but the game, even in beta is incredibly stable, or fixed very quickly by the developers when problems are raised.
<br>
<br>This review will need to be deleted when the full game is released, because it will probably be a completely different experience than it is at present, with a story, characters and an end game. It could well be the best game of 2016, and will no doubt win huge acclaim and awards.
<br>
<br>For now, this is one of the best games I have played in a long time. In an age where gamers are ever increasingly taken for mugs, (day 1 DLC anyone?) this is a refreshing change, and a hugely entertaining experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-long-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=5835810">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Sandbox Mode is where this game shines, as you struggle to survive in the North Canadian wilderness to take care of your basic needs. There&apos;s four in this game: temperature, hunger, thirst and energy. Make fire to keep yourself warm in a raging blizzard, scavenge for plant and animal sustenance, boil water over aforementioned fire and find shelter to rest. All the while you scavenge for supplies, whether it is by shooting deer, fishing or looting cabins in the quiet apocalypse. Beware wolves that are attracted by the smell of blood and the sounds of a cold survivor struggling to find his next shelter.
<br>
<br>Played like this, the game is a roguelike-like in disguise. When you die in survival mode, the only option is to restart. As you play the game, you learn to navigate the five (number to be expanded) maps, conserve your resources and get a grasp on the crafting system.
<br>
<br>Very fun game. Right now have been alive for 32 days on the third difficulty setting, having explored 2 of the maps and ready to craft a wolf-pelt coat.
<br>
<br>The story mode... Well... Animation, cutscenes and music is beautiful. The writing is bad and linear gameplay goes against the spirit of the game for my taste. We&apos;ll see how it develops over the coming year.
<br>
<br>Buy this game. You will fade into the long dark when you mistakenly go to rest in your bedroll in a blizzard and freeze to death. Then you will fade into the long dark after being mauled by a wolf. Then you fade into the long dark as you enjoy a beautiful vista, make a misstep and fall 30 meters to your death. It&apos;s a beautiful and quiet apocalypse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-long-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=7451124">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-95%  really immersive
<br>-Really unique in comparrison to other games in its genre
<br>-Up difficulty, freeze 2 death almost right away cause im dumb :(
<br>-You have the option of going for more exploration and hunting, or barely raking by in some super intense survival situations like starving, fainting, getting mauled by a bear etc...
<br>-Crafting an inventory is easy to manage
<br>-The art style mostly fits the game
<br>-Super immersive Audio
<br>-Great stat tracking of your deaths and tons of other stats
<br>-Simple UI
<br>-They just throw you into the game without explaining which makes it super rewarding
<br>-Permadeath makes it super immersive because you care about your life for once in a game
<br>Cons-
<br>-Some really gross textures, although its a small game so w/e
<br>-Can be a bit hard to learn some things
<br>Some of the controls can be annoying but not really a big deal
<br>-The skill system has potential but could use some fleshing out...
<br>You can&apos;t craft a ton, and the diversity of items could be improved, although its already fine i guess..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-long-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=6842322">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The 4 stats in game in terms of survival are interesting, but on anything but the lowest difficulty they degrade way too fast. If I drink a bunch of water before going to sleep in real life, I wake up having to go to the bathroom, not on the verge of dehydration. This idea causes the game to devolve to a state of playing wac-a-mole with the time commitments you have to make to survive, while you&apos;re completely at the mercy of the spontaneous storms.
<br>
<br>I imagine the game will be better once it&apos;s out of alpha and is feature complete, but currently it becomes boring quite fast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-long-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=6506878">Expand</a></span>

<br>Great idea
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>Lazy development, lots of loading screens instead of animations.
<br>Unrealistic (even 2 kilo&apos;s of meat a day wont keep you from going hungry)
<br>Sooo much walking
<br>Dying of the cold with furniture and blankets al arround you (static items)
<br>Game feels verry arcade like, absolutly not a realistic survival game
<br>Verry repetitive</span>

Although from different developers, the art style and forest setting draws many similarities to me. I found that the dynamic weather system was quite intense and provided some interesting mechanics for survival. The Long Dark finally features a proper survival game. It draws the line between proper survival mechanics in a fictional world, while not overwhelming the player with ultra realistic mechanics that would be a burden to play. Beyond the survival aspect which can be tough to maintain, The Long Dark still feels like it is in early access. Some areas feel polished while others are still lacking. I will say though that Hinterland Studio is very much aware of the issues and actively releasing patches. Days apart or even weekly at best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-long-dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=7482079">Expand</a></span>
