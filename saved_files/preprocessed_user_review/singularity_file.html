Despite its obvious resemblance to Bioshock and Half-Life 2, it put in its series of innovation that made this game very funny and enjoyable to play. The Science-Fiction plot is really something, and game engine is very well-made; there are different upgradable weapons and lots of ways to crush your enemies, and you will actually need them at higher difficulty levels. The game offers alternate finals and lots of background information all around the game world. Multiplayer is not really innovative but it can be really fun. I believe that this was a game i always waited, and Activision gave us a beautiful game to play with.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=1391178">Expand</a></span>

Think Doom-Quake-Wolfenstein with the gameplay and graphic enigine of Bioshock doing Yuri&apos;s Revenge artwork, plus cutscenes from Modern Warfare 2. Sure it&apos;s a rehash, but it&apos;s a rehash of the nicest games I played. Besides, there really are some great, &apos;original&apos; ideas in the game. Highly recommended.</span>

They shamelessly stole all of the best elements from the best shooters and created a great gaming experience. I picked this game up for $10 and it turned out to be much more entertaining than the last two $60 games that I bought. Highly recommended for fans of fps!</span>

The atmospheric &quot;fake russian&quot; scenery is absolutely fitting, and the storyline is about as great as Sci-Fi/Realism hybrids go. It was too short however, and I feel that the game could be expanded into something that is even greater.</span>

The story and setting are interesting enough to pull you in and keep you interested for the  duration of the game (about 6 hours). The gameplay and time manipulation mechanics are where the game sets itself apart from other shooters. If the game was longer it would certainly score higher.</span>

The reason is that Raven Software finally decided to create something more original and not just a follow-up title like for example Quake 4 and Wolfenstein 2009 were. And when the game was released last year it received relatively positive reviews with scores ranging from 75 upwards. Those are the reasons I was excited about Singularity.
<br>
<br>The game takes place on an island of Katorga-12 where Soviets found huge amounts of Element 99. Element 99 is a radioactive chemical element that has some special characteristics never seen before. It can be for example used in a nuclear bomb or in a time manipulating device. The story actually isn&apos;t that bad but it&apos;s quite clich&#xE9;. It&apos;s certainly better than the one in Wolfenstein 2009 which was overcomplicated, stupid and even more clich&#xE9;. Singularity is a modern first person shooter that features some old-school elements for example there is no health regeneration and you have to use med packs, there is no universal ammo and there is no cover system. As strange as it may seem after all the Call of Duties those elements feel kind of refreshing. There&apos;s a lot of action in Singularity which consists mostly of shooting and using special time manipulating abilities. For the shooting part you can use a number of more or less interesting weapons like a shotgun, a sniper rifle etc. nothing we haven&apos;t seen before. More interesting are the time manipulating abilities that give you the power to age objects, age your enemies, turn enemy soldiers into monsters, stop time and power punch. The problem here is that you can only age a small amount of objects that are carefully placed exactly where you need them. You can&apos;t for example change time between 1950 and 2010 as you please which would be cool. Sorry, ain&apos;t there. Combat and action pacing are very well done in Singularity. It seems Raven Software learned something from their previous games after all.
<br>
<br>One of the problems Singularity has is that it&apos;s extremely linear. Wolfenstein 2009 introduced a non-linear mission progress which was actually pretty good and made things more interesting. Unfortunately, Raven decided to go back to Quake 4 kind of linearity so in Singularity you basically go from A to B to C to D, end of level. As if the linearity wouldn&apos;t be enough there are those invisible walls everywhere that make it impossible to jump over a super small wall. Singularity also looks very ugly for a 2010 game. It&apos;s probably one of the worst looking games ever made with Unreal Engine 3. Wolfentein 2009 which used the id Tech 4 engine looked a lot better. Enemies are a little uninspired since there are only around five different monsters (which are suspiciously similar to those in F.E.A.R. 2), two or three bosses and black ops soldiers (F.E.A.R. 2?) in the game. Mouse lag doesn&apos;t help the game towards the better score either. I also don&apos;t really like the way weapons are modeled. It&apos;s kind of too futuristic and not quite realistic. My last complaint is that the four characters you counteract through the game could have been more memorable. Like for example in Half Life 2.
<br>
<br>I have to admit that Singularity is not far from what I was hoping for or expecting. In terms of gameplay it&apos;s a step up from Wolfenstein 2009. Too bad the game is so extremely linear and looks so bad. If played on the hardest difficulty it is a fun experience, even though it&apos;s actually nothing we haven&apos;t seen before. Raven is on a right track, they&apos;re just gonna have to aim even higher next time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=6777674">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Game is really fun to play my only complaint for Single player game is that it wasn&apos;t long enough.  I shouldn&apos;t be able to beat the game in 2 days or about 9 hours.  Should take about a week.  This is my complaint about most new games but besides that, this is one of the most fun games to play in a long time.  I love everything about it.</span>

<br>This title is overshadowed by the COD series and it&apos;s clear activision prefers it this way. This game is only available in the retail package, no STEAM release that i&apos;m aware of, very silly if you ask me because this is a decent and solid FPS title and raven software would make some more cash from this title as it&apos;s probably out of print at this point.

<br>If you like FPS titles with some sci-fi elements and can handle giving money to activision without becoming sick to your stomach, then this title is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2876474">Expand</a></span>

I love this game for the gunfights, over-the-top powers, and to a moderate extent, the characters and story, but design flaws are aplenty. Firstly TRANSPARENT WALLS!? that&apos;s just plain lazy in level designing, secondly every level is closed ended and scripted, which I&apos;m not a fan of. I prefer the Crysis/Farcry kind of approach to an objective. Here&apos;s my biggest gripe, this game was very obviously made for the consoles and their low-end hardware, not only are the stock graphics outdated and unimpressive, there are no video options to kick the graphics up, and this game only runs on stereo, anything more(4.1/5.1/7.1) will yield absolutely NO SOUND. The port over for controls are unintuitive as well. However considering all the significant downsides, it&apos;s still a moderately decent shooter, and quite frankly Activision, you guys got no right to be disappointed with the sales.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=1405061">Expand</a></span>

Tries to steal all the best elements from recent releases but ends up feeling more like someone tried to glue together a jigsaw puzzle instead of solving it. There are some beautiful sets with great texture work &amp; models but the glaringly awful random bad textures cancel out most of them. Probably the most infuriating part is that even with multiple endings they are all BAD END. Multiplayer is consolified &quot;Quick Match&quot; matchmaking only with no lobby system or friends-only private games. There are upgrade systems for your weapons and character but if you are thorough (which it isn&apos;t hard to be in a corridor shooter) you will have everything maxed by the end of the game anyway. This game is the cancer killing the industry.

I figured they knew some awful truth about the game&apos;s quality and didn&apos;t want gamers to find out and &quot;accidentally&quot; buy it.  Well the texture issue was announced so I decided to wait for an official patch.  I purchased the PC version from D2D, applied the patch and I must admit I wasn&apos;t disappointed at all. The Graphics are absolutely top notch and beautiful and game play was very  smooth without a single glitch. The storyline started out interesting, the pacing was good which to me is important to keep my attention.  I really found the historical part of the story very well written. The developers took time to write a plausible story with memorable events and 3 dimensional characters, all the while taking careful pains to portray the Russian victims in a compassionate and sympathetic manner.  I really cared what happened to all those poor Russian workers whose dessicated remains littered the grounds.  You can tell they worked hard at getting the eye candy, audio and music just right, they all pace the storyline perfectly.  I&apos;ve found game music is used to the point of being over barring in other titles so Singularity was a pleasant surprise.  I&apos;ve heard some gamers grumble about having to listen to all the tape recorders in the game but I found them oddly poignant, they tended to slow game play down because you couldn&apos;t hear the message unless you stayed close but they really  helped move the story along and added a much needed human angle to an otherwise dismal place.   The designers hide journal pages written by the katorga victims all around the facility. I thought they contained game play hints or hidden E99 tech stashes to help move the storyline along.  The upgrade feature is functional, easy to use but not really original.  The idea is to collect E99 tech of various sizes that are either hidden or placed right in eye sight.  You then used them like currency at upgrade &amp; augmentation machines strategically scattered throughout the game.  Other items like weapons briefcases are used to upgrade aspects of your weapons, e.i (faster load times, increased damage etc.,). What would have been real cool is if Renko himself used some of the E99 tech he finds to somehow augment his own body into a bio morphed weapon.  Renko was already walking around camo deep in the most poisonous, radioactive place on earth, why not just have him mutate into something altogether different like the others?  Just a suggestion anyway. You&apos;ve seen this before in other games so I already know what to expect but there&apos;s always one weapon gamers find absolutely useless and in this game its the mini gun.  It dumps a ton of bullets at targets but they rarely hit anything or does any appreciable damage so I avoided it like the plague for the rest of the game.  My favorite weapon on the other hand has to be the seeker, it kills with one shot and is easy to target. The TMD was incredible nothing like reducing a monster or human to a pile of ashes in seconds and is one of the best conceived gaming devices ever!   I used it constantly in all types of battles and situations, the developers did a good job in balancing the TDM as a weapon and as a tool for puzzles.  The game appears to have a nice open world feel to it until you try to explore away from the beaten path.  It would have been nice look around and see more of the island just to satisfy curiousity.  I liked the way the levels were designed, you just didn&apos;t stumble through them by jumping from crate to stairs to ledge.  Some of the levels allow you to fully utilize the TDM&apos;s full potential and in some cases its the only way to continue forward.   A few of the AI enemies can be a little easy to kill, they just stand there  taken hit after hit until they fall down but that was rare.   Overall the game reminded my of Bioshock ( tape recorders, mysterious events happening in an inaccessible location) I really don&apos;t have any major complaints with the game except for one item, the young lady.  She seems like a superfluous add- on period.  Why would any paramilitary group send a young, attractive lady into an incredibility dangerous place like katorga-12 with no camo gear or protection what so ever. She offered very little background on her and her organization and acted more like a distraction than an asset to Renko.   The game was a little short but I&apos;m giving the game a 9.  Thanks Raven Soft for a great game, I&apos;m ready for Singularity 2!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=1361415">Expand</a></span>

I figured they knew some awful truth about the game&apos;s quality and didn&apos;t want gamers to find out and &quot;accidentally&quot; buy it. Well the texture issue was announced so I decided to wait for an official patch. I purchased the PC version from D2D, applied the patch and I must admit I wasn&apos;t disappointed at all. The Graphics are absolutely top notch and beautiful and game play was very smooth without a single glitch. The storyline started out interesting, the pacing was good which to me is important to keep my attention. I really found the historical part of the story very well written. The developers took time to write a plausible story with memorable events and 3 dimensional characters, all the while taking careful pains to portray the Russian victims in a compassionate and sympathetic manner. I really cared what happened to all those poor Russian workers whose dessicated remains littered the grounds. You can tell they worked hard at getting the eye candy, audio and music just right, they all pace the storyline perfectly. I&apos;ve found game music is used to the point of being over barring in other titles so Singularity was a pleasant surprise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=1401059">Expand</a></span>

The weapons were fun to use, especially the time-slowing-bullet rifle. The levels were interesting and the enemy AI was decent. Is the game worth full price? No way. Like other quality but generic FPS games, it&apos;s worth playing if you enjoy FPS games. Rent it or buy it for $10 or so.</span>

The game was awesome, but there&apos;s probably not going to be a sequel because Activision doesn&apos;t care to advertise games that have potential to be as great as Call of Duty. I don&apos;t even have a complaint about this game, everything was good if not great to me. Although I don&apos;t have a complaint, I still wouldn&apos;t put it above Fallout 3 or anything, but it is a really good game. Overall, if you want a good shooter game that isn&apos;t Call of Duty or Battlefield, play this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2110407">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a classical modern military shooter with a gimmicky powers that don&apos;t impact a gameplay at all. Well, they do, but for worse.
<br>
<br>It starts out ok. The introductory scenes and initial environment promised some kind of a slower survival shooter with horror elements. First few encounters were pretty fun, and although scripted, trying to get a headshot with your ass weak revolver was acceptable. But it fastly reveals as a boring Call of Duty/Medal of Honor clone. Most of the time you fight against Russians that speak some kind of rusglish (and the environmental use of russian language is just insulting, using &quot;&#x42F;&quot; as an latin &quot;R&quot; letter). Fights are not involving or challanging. You have virtually unlimited ammo supplies and you can swap between weapons almost without any hassle. Also, it doesn&apos;t matter which weapon you use at all, because everything will die no matter what do you do. A shotgun or a rocket launcher, it&apos;s all meh. You get to use a game breaking weapon (the Seeker) that lets you control bullets. Enemies don&apos;t use this weapon at all. In an every scene, where the game throws at you a huge number of enemies, that could pose a threat, it gives you the Seeker as well.
<br>Enemies are stupid, they don&apos;t really do much but standing and shooting, rarely trying to take cover (and it doesn&apos;t matter, because you have the Seeker). Also, an every enemy centers its eyes on you immediately after you start shooting, looking in your direction even through walls. You can see it clearly while using the Seeker - or more likely the Funbreaker.
<br>And then are time powers. No other enemy is able to use them. In the situation, where the game gives you a supreme advantage over enemies in weaponry alone, it also gives you built-in cheats. Killing enemies by simply clicking a single button, stopping time, throwing explosives. Your med-packs don&apos;t ever run out, you can purchase regenerating health, vampire perks, etc. etc. for a in-game currency (E99) that is lying around an every corner.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a rather quickly boring walk down the corridor shooter. Even the environmental puzzles are insulting, being mostly about putting a create under a vent so you can progress further.
<br>
<br>A story is terrible and a busted sound assets don&apos;t even allow you to keep in touch with it. The sound options are abysmal, you can&apos;t really hear anyone talking, and the game doesn&apos;t support subtitles.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s just a soulless, boring and unimaginative production. It could be a good shooter, sadly it turned out to be a just another shovelware. To add up, textures often lag terribly. I think this issue is even worse than in id&apos;s Rage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=5229123">Expand</a></span>

Making old goodie crates reappear with loot inside. Old worn out writings on teh wall, become crisp and new for you to read. The story isn&apos;t epic, but it&apos;s an enteraining one. i liked this game, and it was worth the few bucks i spent on sale.</span>

<br>
<br>Worse, this game is strongly anti-Russian, on a level of a cheap B-movie. Also, it&apos;s obvious that not a single Russian native speaker was in the dev team. There are many flags and banners and posters everywhere in the scenery with Russian sentences or words - all of them Google-translated from English. I mean, as a native speaker, I usually was confused by those sentences as they didn&apos;t make sense, but after I literally translated them backwards to English, then I understood what they meant. Even the name of the place, katOrga-12, with O stressed, is totally wrong! First, there is a Russian word &quot;kAtorga&quot; (A stressed!) which is obsolete and was mostly used until end of 19th century, and means &quot;imprisonment&quot; (the process of being in prison) or &quot;hard work&quot; and not &quot;prison&quot; itself as a place - I guess the devs meant to call this place a &quot;prison&quot; or &quot;labor camp&quot;. Even then, Russians would never name a secret military/sci installation a &quot;prison&quot; (&quot;turmA&quot;), instead it would be something like &quot;camp&quot; or &quot;base&quot; or just &quot;objekt 12345&quot; or something. I could provide tons of other examples.
<br>
<br>So that you could understand me, imagine you are playing a Chinese game where everything is in Chinese, and the Chinese devs make a game about the USA, so to make Chinese players feel it&apos;s about the USA they insert random broken English sentences which they Google-translated from Chinese in hope that no American will ever play the game, and Chinese don&apos;t know English anyway. Yes, it will feel like a nuthouse to you as an English native speaker, should you ever play this game. It will clearly show that devs are amateurs. You would think: are there so few Americans in China so that they couldn&apos;t hire a single guy for proofreading?
<br>
<br>If I were on the dev team, I&apos;d suggest writing every banner and every poster in Russian purely, as it should have been in reality in a Russian military base. But when the player looks at them, there would be subtitles shown with an English translation. Btw those sentences with mirrored R and N (to look like &#x42F; and &#x418;) are almost unreadable!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=5886183">Expand</a></span>

The game mixes old school and new school. Health pickups with stat/weapon upgrades.  Many weapons are redundant and simply exist because of the cool factor. On Normal difficulty you&apos;re way over powered. Ammo and health packs are plentiful. There really are very few hardcore combat scenarios. You mostly fight  a couple creatures or soldiers and then continue exploring on the linear path. For people who like secrets and picking up money (E99 and weapon upgrades) you will be somewhat satisfied. Overall they try to cram so many combat items and abilities into this game you never really get to master everything. I found myself just running around with the mini gun and accuracy tech upgrade for 70% of the game. The game is much more new school than old school so if you are looking for classic FPS action then you might be better of passing on this. The story is generic but not terrible and the characters are not horribly annoying. Overall its just a decent way to waste time but I would recommend you pick it up at whatever discount you can find because it had little replay value.

The TMD was extremely useful and the mix of human/mutants was well balanced.  The only negative thing I would site is the shortness of the game.  One other side note is that I thought the hardest boss of the game came in the middle of the story, not at the end.  Oh well.</span>

However, there was a distinct lack of enemy variety, not enough mutants, and the AI was nothing special. Weapon upgrades are generic, don&apos;t add anything interesting to the game, as well as the TMD perks and other upgrades, again, just make the game even easier, and really doesn&apos;t add a twist or anything special to the game. its okay, maybe worth 20 bucks IMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=1568282">Expand</a></span>

Quasi - Soviet decoration is okay and looks good but very artificial which is Okay for sci-fi.

Singularity is not an &quot;amazing&quot; game but has a lot of potential that wasn&apos;t used properly, and thus, we got a game with very interesting story and a pretty nice gameplay. Graphics are definitely not a strong factor in this game, Unreal Engine 3 is a limited, tired engine that his glory days already behind him. The story, though, is very interesting and was one of the factors that made me buy this game. You are an american army officer of some black-ops unit that infiltrates an base to take an old mysterious tech that can roll things back and forth in time (you will like this)., and as you progress in the game you see ghosts and &quot;people&quot; that were effected by the radiation that occurred during that experiments in this facility. Your weapon arsenal game be upgraded with &quot;weapon upgrade units&quot; that you find as you play and so as your &quot;TMD Tool&quot; that allows you to &quot;age&quot; materials and renew them - you can upgrade the tool as well. As for the gameplay itself, it sometimes gets really &quot;old&quot;, you can&apos;t shoot monsters unless they on the ground as you ( if they climbing the fence for example). Enemy attack trigger works only if you really close to them, or if you aim at the with sights. All an all, this game deserves more Exposure them he got.  Go get it, you will not regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2276755">Expand</a></span>

However, the much lower rated Wolfenstein is a much, much better game, in my opinion. Singularity is a mediocre FPS at best. Not worth my time, I uninstalled before I finished it. While the ingredients are similar to Wolfenstein (the magic time/power crystal from Wolfenstein is replaced by a time manipulation glove here), the biggest problem is that Singularity feels like a rail shooter most of the time. Almost everything is heavily scripted, nothing feels spontaneous. Game play is 100% linear, nothing feels like it can be explored, the environment (and the enemies) feel like they&apos;re puppets, and their design is bland. Story is not very good either, and the design, obviously inspired by Bioshock (audio logs tell the story), is much worse than the latter. In summary, the biggest problem is that the game feels too linear, because it guides you through everything &quot;on rails&quot;, which occasionally makes for a nice shocking moment, but gets stale very soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2534594">Expand</a></span>

An unknown game for me before, that started like a very mediocre shooter (taking graphics and gameplay in account) turned out to be pretty great sci-fi story-driven shooter in the end. If you gona play this, definitely use a savegame at the very end and try out all the three ends - they are wonderful!</span>

<br>It is obvious that the title borrows many ideas from predecessors, both in mechanics (Half Life), player progression (Dead Space) and setting (Bioshock, Metro 2033), the game manages to have its own identity and is very satisfying to play : once you got the Time Manipulator, it is possible for you to approach each encounter with a very distinct style, ranging from classical shooter up to combos like : deactivate barrel, carry barrel, lock enemies in time, reactivate barrel, throw barrel, shoot barrel - and wait until every single enemy is blasted off.
<br>The game features three endings, that you could just explore by reloading the last scene. Replaying the game is still interesting since the progression system allows you to use knowledge of Time Manipulator augments to adapt to your playstyle.
<br>So even if Singularity is not a &quot;great&quot; FPS, it is a decent one with a very good execution. Raven still got it !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=6680437">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s also fun to play and gets boring only near the end. But also Singularity has some really ugly graphics: five-year old textures, lighting is nonexistent. Only models and animation are more or less acceptable. Furthermore, TMD only interacts with very limited amount of  unscripted objects and therefore it&apos;s true potential is never used. Physics are also terrible and sometimes the fact, that you shoot a bottle and nothing happens, is very annoying and  makes you wonder, what developers where thinking. The story also has many plot holes and sometimes it&apos;s just plain stupid. Still it&apos;s fun to play, if you lower your expectations and accept it, as a cheaply made blockbuster about saving the world from evil Russians. What&apos;s more important , it ,at least, tries to bring something original in video game industry, unlike Call of Duty franchise, which is still stuck in 2003. My score is 6.7, but 7.0 by rounding it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=1592809">Expand</a></span>

Well, first off strangely enough the plotline is original. I don`t mean only traveling in time. It`s the way it has been executed. Not only you find yourself on a spooky, destroyed island, you also keep encountering those strange &quot;explosions&quot; which send you 50 years back. Lifeless, orange heaps of metal turn into living, good as new merchandise and facilities, with people doing exactly what they were doing before the catastrophy. There`s a scene where an entire ship is revived by time - it`s breathtaking. You also travel through portals. The very same idea makes you experience fighting humans AND alien abominations in the same game which negates any trace of boredom.  The levels and enemies are nicely varied. Sure, it`s the same linear thing you get in 99% todays fps games, but this particular game has this classic old school feeling to it (you get medi packs for example). The weapons are also very nicely made with cool animations and fire types AND they`re upgradeable. In the same way you can change your running speed, shield, health and the Time Manipulation Device which is the single best thing in a fps game I`ve seen in years. This all achieves a very important point - you can dispatch enemies in multiple ways, anytime you want and at the same type you are the inhuman type with special powers, making a simple soviet soldier suffer in agony if you decide that he deserves to get 200 years older in one second. An addicting game. Too bad it`s quite short and falls in 2007 in terms of graphics quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=1694337">Expand</a></span>

If we forget that this game was greatly inspired by Half-Life 2, Doom 3, and maybe also Bioshock, with a heart ripped off from Halo and Call of Duty.... this is a damn fun game from veteran developers at Raven Software.
<br>
<br>More accurate description of this game would be that it&apos;s a Call of Duty but set into the Doom universe, with Half-Life 2 physics gun, and Bioshock-like skill upgrade mechanics (and audio logs like the ones in System Shock).
<br>
<br>Technically Singularity doesn&apos;t bring anything new on the table with it&apos;s Unreal Engine. The Sigularity is a very easy game even on a high difficulty level. Upgrade mechanics are inconsistant and right out confusing at first. The Skill upgrades for player are not very well thought out and there&apos;s little to no reason to upgrade anything than just handful of skills out of a dozen options. There is also no need to upgrade weapons except for the sub-machine gun and sniper rifle. (Side note: I&apos;ve never seen such an useless shotgun in any other game than in this one.)
<br>
<br>This is clearly an FPS intended for Playstation and Xbox, but the Windows version works decently. I miss the FOV setting and lots of other things such as bind for an ability to walk in this game which causes problems with some level and enemy design I&apos;ll explain soon. Even thought this game has weird default binds, you can easily adjust to them. However I suggest moving the health pack from key h to key x. You can also only carry two weapons at time plus the TMD which is a kind of melee weapon/tool in this game.
<br>
<br>Level design has some issues. Like invisible walls everywhere, and levels are mostly just a straight pipe. Sigularity was clearly designed and intended to be played on a gamepad. It means that when you move with a gamepad you can push the stick just a little or completely all the way, and that dictates your walking running speed. On a keyboard it&apos;s either on or off switch between not moving or moving as fast as normally you can (sprint is a separate function).
<br>
<br>There are sections in this game you cannot play on Windows without the help of a gamepad as it was intended by the Singularity&apos;s developers. In that part you have to keep certain move speed and sneak or you&apos;ll attact attention of the opponents. With keyboard you&apos;ll end up wasting ammo. Which kind of sucks. But isn&apos;t a big problem since the game constantly keep supplying ammo to you.
<br>
<br>Now that out of the way, what&apos;s good about this game? Everything else. Atmosphere is fantastic, jumpscares are well done, music is good, characters are decent (even the ones copied from other games), and the black humour is hilarious.
<br>
<br>Time travelling thing in this game works flawlessly and while it&apos;s usage is limited, it&apos;s great fun. Levels offer minimal amout of exploring despite the pipe-stylish level design. There are things you can go look at and figure out how to get them (even if the solutions are very simple at most of the time). Graphics are decent. And sound design is well done (without counting few weird bits).
<br>
<br>Something this game has that lacks from so many other games is the kind of rhythm it has to it. Just when you think you&apos;ve seen it all, the game throws something new at you and keeps the interest up. Sigularity knows how to focus on what&apos;s important at the time too and adjusts accordingly. I strongly think that we need more games like these. This is a fun game. It sure has its issues but it is lots of fun. Check it out with a discounted price tag from Steam or something. It&apos;s worth every penny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=3163026">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story, the gameplay, enemies you encounter, the feels, it&apos;s all almost as good as Half-Life or better (in some ways).
<br>Graphically it&apos;s the peak of what 2010 had to offer. Gameplay is on par with modern titles, shooting and combat feels great. There are some intruging puzzles and no **** collectibles, everything hidden that you find helps your character in some way. Long (18-20 hours) story that makes sense.Three different endings.
<br>Flaws - cringeworthy voice acting, some hiccups in the story.
<br>It is a big shame this game hadn&apos;t have more recognition - maybe now that it&apos;s on steam and new gen consoles it will have the attention it fully deserves.

The storyline was good, with a nice twist which makes you wonder why this game wasn&apos;t polished a bit better. In the game there are a lot of notes that apparently tried to explain how things work in communist Russia, but to best put it they were childish and annoying. The artwork also seems somewhat mismatched in places, for example the crates and posters look like they came out of a cartoon, but everything else is done differently. Apart for that, everything is fine, you get to shoot a bunch of weapons, well, not really by any modern standard, but at least they are functional, well, at least two out of the five are, and you wield the time altering weapon whose name i forget right now. But, apart from this, the game has a good storyline,and once you finish it it will leave you thinking about the story and everything that happened. Trust me, I was surprised, and let&apos;s just say i have seen &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Oh yeah,and did I say there is plenty of ammo? This game should get extra points just for that. No more &quot;I have one bullet left&quot; moments here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=2316489">Expand</a></span>

<br>This little-known title is a cracker of a game which, even though it borrows from several other games, does so in it&#x2019;s own idiosyncratic and original way rather than simply ripping them off. There isn&#x2019;t a dull moment in its 10 or so hours of gameplay and the always enjoyable combat is backed by a solid story, good voice acting, some cool enemies, and a decent AI. There&#x2019;s a wide variety of weapons available and every one of them feels good to wield and most of them produce very satisfying results. However, it&#x2019;s the Time Manipulation Device that&#x2019;s the star of the show and this weapon/tool is impressively designed and implemented. It allows the player to manipulate both time and matter in a number of ways every one of which is great fun to use. Graphically the game is acceptable enough, although some of the textures leave a little to be desired (some people have experienced glitches but I had none), and you get to fight your way through a reasonably varied range of well-designed environments. As a story-driven, linear FPS SINGULARITY hits the nail on the head and does so with a refreshing streak of inventiveness and individuality. I just wish it had lasted a little longer, as I was having so much fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=6893214">Expand</a></span>

<br>Gameplay:  The game feels like it has the Call of Duty controls mixed with a Half-Life experience.  Singularity does have its own legs to stand on.  The game features a neat time travel mechanic using the singularity device attached to the players arm.  You can use it to manipulate objects, and enemies in the environment.  It&#x2019;s set on basic objects, and doesn&#x2019;t give you the freedom to mess with anything, but it&#x2019;s still something new brought to the table.  The game is linear and as the player progresses you run into flashbacks, and even end up time traveling.  The game does a good job mixing time periods together.  The boss battles are fun, but easy to figure out.   The enemies in the game consist of soldiers, and mutated creatures which are at times challenging to take down.   The game features a multiplayer mode which I could not test out because the game is dead.  I can&#x2019;t find much flaws with the game other than the fact that it needs a better variety of enemies, and the gameplay in general needs better guns, maybe melee weapons too, and environments that don&#x2019;t feel like you&#x2019;re just walking in a straight path, and puzzles that don&#x2019;t always consist of just manipulating one object just to get to the next objective.  There should have been puzzles which are challenging and use actual physics.  Singularity is still a new and fun experience that lasts as a thrill ride.  9.
<br>
<br>Story:  The story is actually really interesting.  Without giving much away, I&#x2019;ll just say that in the beginning you end up time traveling to a point where you save a man from a burning building who ends up being the main villain in the game.  Throughout the game you time travel uncovering more information about the Singularity, and the game leads to an ending which is in the hands of the player.  The game leaves on a strong note leaving fans in hope that Activision intends to take a break from Call of Duty and allows Raven to work on a sequel.  The story is pretty straight forward and does have a twist, but for some reason I already sort of knew what happened, and the game presents it as some crazy twist.  Other portions of the story can be read through notes, records found throughout the game and writings on the wall.  The game isn&#x2019;t the greatest video game story, but it is still a great experience.  9.
<br>
<br>Lasting Appeal:  Got the game for about 5-7 bucks from a Steam sale and I&#x2019;d say at that price it is worth it.  I think it&#x2019;s selling for 30 bucks right now, and due to the length of the game, I&#x2019;d recommend waiting on another sale.  The game lasts about 6-7 hours.  I&#x2019;d still recommend this game to be played through at least once.  9.5.
<br>
<br>Overall Score:  9 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=3773343">Expand</a></span>

<br>Total size on my hard drive: 7.7 GB.
<br>
<br>A large EMP pulse from an island blinds a United States satellite, so the US sends a team to investigate.   The pulse originated from Katorga-12 &#x2013; an old Soviet research settlement founded around the mines of a mysterious mineral, E-99. Even traversing the initial level, pulses occasionally appear, creating &#x201C;time spikes&#x201D; that suddenly take your character to a different time; then another &#x201C;spike&#x201D; sends you back to the present. The truth becomes clear: the Soviets were able to utilize E-99 to create a time-travel device (among other uses). The device and the two scientists who would control it become the centerpiece of a journey through multiple time-lines to prevent the alteration of history. Like in any good time-travel story, preventing one disaster makes other disasters possible. While the story is linear, there are multiple endings; none of them are specifically &#x201C;good,&#x201D; each requiring an element of sacrifice. A decent sense of closure, but it&#x2019;s bitter-sweet because there was clearly the possibility for a sequel (which has never materialized). Decent voice-acting character models only add to the experience. The soundtrack is serviceable, but not exceptional.
<br>
<br>If time-travel isn&#x2019;t something you care about, and you just want a cool first-person shooter, well, you&#x2019;ll get it. The fps part, anyway. The coolness isn&#x2019;t really there. The gameplay is linear.The combat mechanics work, there is a decent variety of weapons, and there are some upgrade choices to be made, too (remember to equip a perk, not just purchase it). The enemies comprise Soviet soldiers and strange creatures that mutated from all the E-99 radiation (contemporary timeline) &#x2013; some of which are truly gigantic beasts. But the character movement feels heavy and slow, there is no cover mechanic, and chaingun + sniper rifle means you can handle all situations with little need to bother with other weapons. Some of the other weapons are really good &#x2013; the grenade launcher which can launch a grenade that you then guide forward to the target was my other favorite &#x2013; and the E99 weapons (where available) are over-powered as hell, but except for specific situations, there is little call to use them. And these &#x201C;specific situations&#x201D; usually have a weapon locker nearby, so it&#x2019;s easy to switch to what is needed, then switch back when done. If you find yourself overwhelmed, pulse the wrist-mounted TMD (Time Manipulation Device). It&#x2019;s got decent knock-back that can give you a breather when you need it. Multiplayer is dead.
<br>
<br>But the primary attraction of Singularity is the atmosphere. It reeks with it. Every area is incredibly detailed, whether exploring an old Soviet barracks in the current timeline (rust, dirt, cracked glass, smoke) or traversing a laboratory in 1955 (bright, clean, apparatus everywhere). The graphics help in this department: though occasionally low-res, Singularity is one of the best uses of the Unreal 3 engine I have seen. And because it is Unreal 3 (and highly optimized), it runs great at maximum settings on moderate equipment (I easily hit 120fps @1080p on an R7 260X).
<br>
<br>Singularity is a fun ride, no question, but you&#x2019;ll have to really love the atmosphere and story to play it more than once, which hurts its overall value. Singularity rarely drops below $7.50 when on sale, but if it does, go ahead and get it.
<br>
<br>Notes:
<br>- A 3-button mouse is REQUIRED. Without the game-play mechanic tied to Mouse Button 3, some sections will be nearly (if not entirely) impossible to complete.
<br>- Frame-rate is capped at 120fps.
<br>- There are no subtitles for any language.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=6785263">Expand</a></span>

Graphics for a 2010 game look very dated, tho the atmosphere still is done pretty well and at times can be spooky. Story explores some interesting time travel and manipulation ideas that you also get to use in the game, but overall it its pretty bland. Gore is fairly good in this game. You get to fire a gun that has homing bullets and its decent fun to use. No matter how you play the game, in the finale youre presented with 3 choices which is bit of a bummer. They coulda made the game where your actions affect it adding more replay value.
<br>
<br>A solid FPS when it comes to campaign and it plays nearly identicly as CoD&apos;s from that era with same control scheme. If thats your thang then go ahead and try it, but dont excpect Bioshock qualities to which many people compare it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=6785082">Expand</a></span>

Here are some key points you should know before you purchase Singularity.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Fun and interesting abilities that let you manage every fight
<br>Various enemies
<br>Dismemberment
<br>Engaging story
<br>Upgrades to weapons and equipment
<br>Great voice acting
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Low replayability
<br>Linear level design
<br>Some textures look quite dated
<br>The PC version is a console port and has a very low FOV which takes a little getting used to or can be corrected with a mod. However, some mods don&apos;t work so you might need to search around to find which one works for you.
<br>
<br>Note: There is a post-credits scene! Don&apos;t worry, even if you skip the credits you will not skip the scene!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/singularity/user-reviews?user_review_id=6951651">Expand</a></span>
