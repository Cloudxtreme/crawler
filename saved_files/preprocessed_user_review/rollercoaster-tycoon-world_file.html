<br>
<br>The game is broken! The game crashes, lagging and freezes. The animation a weak and the coaster mechanics are stupid. The Developer doesnt  have the knowledge of Coasters. Look the stupid Spinning Coaster.
<br>
<br>0 Points for this bad broken game.</span>

<br>About the game : A buggy mess, no simulation at all (or alteast not one that makes sence). Horrible coaster physics. A coaster editor that&apos;s nice for making noodlesoup but a nightmare to work with if you want to make real world coasters. A total lack of art direction making this game look soooo dated. and BUGS BUGS BUGS. Stay away from this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rollercoaster-tycoon-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=6843033">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is a slightly upgraded RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 ... with less content but some nice comfort options in terms of coaster building. The visuals are nice and for the most part quite detailed ... but still do look sterile - which makes the amusement park always look like a model park rather than a simulation of real life.... meaning .. even a carefully contructed park will never really look organic.
<br>
<br>Building coasters is as much fun as it was in RCT 2 .. along with riding them - but after a while (a short while) i felt like it was missing a SUBSTANTIAL amount of substance. The game rates coasters in a very unintuitive way. Excitement rating for example depends mostly on the accumulation of cosmetics in the rides range of influence . not on the twists and turns you make so much. But at the same time the game does not quite distinguish between what fits where ... so you can pretty much pile a lot of cosmetic crap somewhere and gain rating.
<br>
<br>Then there is the lack of ride variety - compared to RTC 2+DLCs ... no water rides for example, no exciting underground contruction of coasters (not that i have manged it anyway) a VERY limited variety of &quot;attractions&quot; on a ride (like snapshot cameras, flashlights, REAL cosmetics like tunnels or mountains etc.) ... there is no split coaster that splits into two independent rides that gain excitement from twisting and turning around each other in a well timed manner - and the wild mouse (my favourite) does not have tight corners anymore (those tight 90 degree corners do not exist anymore)
<br>
<br>Well most of the above is myself ranting about missing featuers that may well be dilivered later (after all - RTC 2 needed 3 DLCs to be complete, too)
<br>
<br>However - then there is the unlocking part of the game - which forces me to play through fairly boring tutorials and challenges just so i can get to my favourite part - sandbox with economics. There is just no other way to unlock all the rides any other way.
<br>
<br>Also the game locks up (0% load freeze) or simply crashes every now and then (which means not commonly but certainly regularly)
<br>
<br>On my medium computer (which is well within the recommended requirements) - i can also not afford to build a full sized park. Building a somewhat complex park over like 2 expansions brings the game to a crawl.
<br>
<br>In terms of &quot;wishlist&quot; i would have also liked a better economy, more weather and weather that affects the customers, more customization of rides (especially flatrides, shops and stalls) and maybe more non attraction rides (like transport trains - because a fully expanded park is too big for a customer to travel on foot - and i cannot build a &quot;coaster&quot; with 2 stations)
<br>
<br>HOWEVER - the game is fun ... because it is essentially RTC 2 ... which is fun. And additional content can make it much better. Building coasters and riding them always is awesome.
<br>
<br>But for now - i would recommend to keep playing RTC 2+DLCs .. and wait for RTC3 to either come up as a budget deal or as a bundle with possible upcoming DLCs combined.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rollercoaster-tycoon-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=6829938">Expand</a></span>

What I did expect</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">First off. Don&apos;t take the insanely negative reviews seriously. They&apos;re just the knee jerk reviewers that do their best to bring a game to its knees simply because a game isn&apos;t exactly what they expected and isn&apos;t perfect immediately.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played MANY early access games before so I don&apos;t expect a bug free game nor do I expect all the features to be implemented yet.
<br>
<br>What I did expect was:
<br>
<br>To be able to build a theme park with fully functional custom rollercoasters.
<br>To have to manage park resources.
<br>To be able to watch the customers taking in the park.
<br>To be able to see the ride in 1st person.
<br>To be able to follow a customer around to see what they&apos;re up to.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m happy because I can do all that and more. It was money well spent and I&apos;m looking forward to an even better experience in the future.
<br>
<br>I hope the haters don&apos;t ruin the game by killing sales with their typical &quot;This early access game sucks because it&apos;s not perfect.&quot; stupidity. More than one promising game has been ruined by spoiled brats given overly negative reviews. Let&apos;s hope that doesn&apos;t happen here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rollercoaster-tycoon-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=6229990">Expand</a></span>

Its not as bad anymore like people want it to be. performance is sollid and i feel it feels like an original roler coaster tycoon game.

I figured since it stays updated, a lot of the bugs and stuff would be worked out. I was completely wrong. $20 is still too much for this. The new coaster building mechanic is great, but that is all I can say. I logged 72 minutes on and played a total of probably 5 or 10. Loading times are ridiculous and it kept crashing so I kept losing my progress. Even with sandbox mode, the parks are TINY. Remember in 3 how big sandbox mode was? Well, you&apos;re not getting that here. When it comes to thrill rides and &quot;flat rides&quot; as they call it, the selection is pretty good, encompassing some items that aren&apos;t in other games, but still lacks a lot that 3 had. When it comes to coaster selection, it&apos;s laughable. Sure they look better and more detailed, but there are only a handful. 3 had so much more. Despite having better graphics, I can&apos;t recommend this over 3. You&apos;d think in almost 13 years we&apos;d get a good RCT return.. but nope. Just bad. Really really bad. I figured the reviews were over-exaggerating, but they&apos;re not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rollercoaster-tycoon-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=7368951">Expand</a></span>
