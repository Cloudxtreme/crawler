<br>At least that&apos;s what it seems to me. I&apos;m not sure if I like where it is heading, but we&apos;ll see about that once episode 4 and 5 are out.
<br>
<br>I just hope it doesn&apos;t end up in some self-sacrifice crap to stop those natural catastrophes. That would kill it for me.</span>

Moreover, the goal of the game has always been to revolutionize the impact of choices which is something you could have already experienced by playing episodes 1-2. I have to say that the individual episodes are doing an amazing job at what they are supposed to (bringing to us a realistic story that we are capable of experiencing on our own and change the future by our choices) and I gave a 9 to both Episodes 1 and 2.
<br>
<br>Keeping that in mind, I have to say that Chaos Theory is nevertheless the best episode so far.
<br>
<br>It is really hard to describe any episode of this series without giving away any spoilers, but:
<br>- Supposing you have seen the sneak peak at the end of Ep 2, you should already know that a large part of this episode takes part at night. Because of that, a nice feeling of tension is added to the story, as you have to walk around in the darkness using only the light of your mobile phone. It is quite reminiscent of some horror games and a welcome addition overall.
<br>- Also, it feels more like an adventure game, as there are more parts this time around where you have to gather items. There is more interaction with people and the surroundings this time around.
<br>- The ending part is simply amazing and a great idea overall.
<br>
<br>I love the direction this series is going and I no longer have doubts that this series will be long remembered as the first one that tried to attempt something slightly different and managed to do it in such a great way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-3---chaos-theory/user-reviews?user_review_id=5264840">Expand</a></span>

It was little bit shorter than the episode 1 or 2, but the plot level it&apos;s very high. In this episode we can see that Max and Chloe are trying to enter in the principal office to find some clues about the Rachel&apos;s disappear and Kate&apos;s death, but they find something about Nathan too. I won&apos;t spoiler anymore, but the end of this episode, will blow your mind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-3---chaos-theory/user-reviews?user_review_id=5262259">Expand</a></span>

Rather than doting on plot twists and shocking character deaths, Episode 3 finds its strengths in the exploration of the relationship between Max and Chloe while not excellently lip synced, makes up for in the small moments, interactions, and dialogue. Once more the Life is Strange series boasts the impressive design of its world and the little details that populate. Stepping into the shoes of Max Caulfield, experiencing the world through her eyes and thoughts provided me with a sense of melancholy, in a world that I may never live in but continue to be fascinated by. The art style and music still bring that small town/Twin Peaks vibe with a dash of Juno while creating an identity of its own. Interacting with the world through point and click mechanics while serviceable, is carried by the young, charming nature that the game tries to set itself upon. And once you reach the jaw dropping conclusion in this tale, Episode 4 seems like thousands of years away. The little details, mood, and the relationship of the two main characters propel Life is Strange into a cult classic status despite its shortcomings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/life-is-strange-episode-3---chaos-theory/user-reviews?user_review_id=5371288">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s simple : I replayed this episode too, because the final scene was really really surprising. I wasn&apos;t expecting it ! Now, the 4th episode is out. I&apos;m wondering how all pieces will match and what will be the 4th episode final scene. Now, I&apos;m sure of it : it&apos;s a very good game.</span>

                                        <span>Life is Strange episode 3. You and your friend have to solve the mystery of the missing art students. In this episode the plot thickens and also it gets pretty gay. I really like how this game deals with a bunch of relevant themes like suicide, rape, mental illness, and positive relationships.My only complaint is why these teenagers didn&apos;t go to the police for help with a serial murderer.</span>
