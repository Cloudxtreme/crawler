<br>A game That brings a New Meaning to the word... ****
<br>
<br>The game looks like it was made in a factory by santas failed elves but got put into production by accident.
<br>
<br>Let me put it this way 4 girls finger painting is more visually appealing than this steaming turd.
<br>
<br>The game developers must be boys from the 1980&apos;s who haven&apos;t hit puberty yet and were like woooooooooo i made it look so realistic.
<br>
<br>The characters seem to change shape when you move around them.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t even get me started on the voice acting...
<br>
<br>WHAT EVEN IS THAT!!!!!!
<br>
<br>They sound like it was recorded on a speak and spell.
<br>
<br>The mechanic is the worst....
<br>
<br>He sounds like he was working on a ship one day and it fell straight on his head forever damaging his fragile mind.
<br>
<br>Oh and if you think that all you do is trade your wrong.
<br>
<br>Your also a bounty hunter.
<br>
<br>And don&apos;t think oh cool ill be like boba fett because you couldn&apos;t be more wrong.
<br>
<br>I was just starting the first bounty mission annnnnnnnnd there is a guy already killing me.
<br>
<br>They spawn you in front of a man shooting you if they weren&apos;t so **** it could be a problem.
<br>
<br>Its not all bad i guess i mean there is a lot of different weapons to try out just a shame you seem to only be able to kill the main bounty guy with a assault rifle or you don&apos;t have a hope in hell.
<br>
<br>Seriously you cant kill them with anything else.
<br>
<br>And when they die look at all the loot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br>
<br>Shame you only have 10 seconds to pick it all up but can only pick it up one piece at a time.
<br>
<br>With a good second between each pick up.
<br>
<br>I mean why have so much loot if you cant **** pick it up.
<br>
<br>And the melee Oh my good the melee.
<br>
<br>The most broken thing i have seen in a game.
<br>
<br>They flop to the floor like a magikarp if you hit them.
<br>
<br>You would think with all of this wrong things there cant possibly be more.

once again your wrong.

You see when trading you can walk around the planet and by planet i mean all 6 meters of it.

You can pick up creates of items why is this a problem you ask????

Well you pick up the items from behind the people who you sell them to.

Yep they literally have items you can pick up and sell to them like why did they not just walk over there and go oh look i can sell this.

Also some of the creates contain weapons which are illegal in the game but very easily obtainable anyway but my point is that you can pick up a create of weapons just laying around some next to officers of the law.

The opening of the game is so bad it literally does the credits to open.. seriously... the whole credits.

And i can see why no one can win this game let alone even want to.

Let me tell you an example the first mission has the objective of get 1.5 mill to pay off the ship

At the end i have way over 1.5 mill in items to sell on the moon and 49 hours to do it in.

It takes 25 hours to travel to the moon so i have 24 hours to sell my goods have a drink buy a penthouse and pay off the money... right

Wrong again as even tho i still have 24 hours left apparently I am out of time??????

How you ask I have no **** clue over 5 mill will be mine if i have 5 mins but i have 24 hours so its fine right.

And to add insult to injury as you close the game they show the **** credits again.

The only reason i read them was to know who to add to the list of people i hate.

All of the developers will fit nicely on the list below the person who thought it would be good to add cut scenes and speech into legend of Zelda.

In conclusion id rather get mounted by a horse than play anymore of this truly terrible game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-trader---merchant-marine/user-reviews?user_review_id=4357305">Expand</a></span>
