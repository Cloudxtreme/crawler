<br>All the collectable weapons are completely useless, none of them feel like a significant improvement over the basic weapons of each character, in fact, some of them are an obvious downgrade. This is a fatal mistake in a game where collecting guns is presented as a major attraction.
<br>
<br>The consumable items are extremely rare, and the powerup items are dull and uninsteresting. There are no exciting synergies that alter gameplay in a fun or novel way. In the end you just carry on and lose interest on equiping your character.
<br>
<br>Bosses range from completely easy to nearly unkillable, in both cases with a health bar that will test your patience if nothing else. What is more, bosses are one of the worst parts of the game, when it should be the opposite. Clearing the levels is much more fun than killing the bad guys at the end. Yet, the lack of variety in regular enemies also makes this boring after a while.
<br>
<br>To this add 5 levels that play pretty much the same, just a hint of roguelike elements, and not many surprises in the journey. Lots of potential here, but crucial balancing errors completely destroy what could have been a remarkable experience. Don&apos;t buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/enter-the-gungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=6266978">Expand</a></span>

So it definitely passes (fails?) the crack test.
<br>
<br>Though there are many dud guns and many guns that function more or less equivalently in battle, they are still all very flavorful and &apos;feel&apos; different from each other.  Finding and trying out a new gun is a pleasure, even if it turns out to be kind of sucky in the great scheme of things.
<br>
<br>Passive pickups are almost always useful.  I would have to ding the active items, as they almost universally have prohibitive cooldowns (like, &apos;twice per floor&apos; tops) and underwhelming effects, like a scant few seconds of invulnerability or a single explosion or AOE effect on the ground.
<br>
<br>Later in the game, you can choose to start from the third floor or further, and get to pick a gun out of the starting gates.  This feature honestly needs to be added to first-floor runs as well, maybe just with a more limited assortment of bottom-tier guns.  Or at least, maybe the first chest opened ought to guarantee a gun drop.  Because you can easily spend 15 minutes cruising Level 1 looking for guns, end up getting a crappy active and a Junk from your chests because you get screwed on keys, then have to fight the boss with your vanilla weapon, then finally, finally get rewarded with a crap gun like the Super Soaker or Trick Gun - enough to make you scream in frustration and suicide your character.  If you persevere, this pattern can repeat itself level by level if you&apos;re unlucky enough.  Just having one passable gun makes the whole run bearable, but the game withholds this basic necessity from you as often as it grants it.
<br>
<br>The game could have done a service by advertising itself better as a bullet hell roguelike, with emphasis of &apos;hell&apos;.  Most people, I think, expect a coarser and cozier shooting experience akin to BoI, instead of the sprawling enemy-and-bullet-overload insanity that Gungeon presents.  Even with a great arsenal of weapons at your disposel, Levels 4 (Hollow) and 5 (Forge) will still probably just register to you as a short, messy, frustrating, deadly bullet blur before you bite the dust.  There is little to do in most rooms down there other than hide behind pillars and take blind shots in between bullet waves and hope something connects - it&apos;s too deadly to venture out in the open, at least for plebs like me.
<br>
<br>I wouldn&apos;t want the game to be easier, but it could be a little more consistent, a little more readable (and dodgeable) in later levels, and a little more forthcoming with guns in early levels.  Oh, and it could do with a save function, but I hear that&apos;s already in the pipeline, ETA whenever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/enter-the-gungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=6315799">Expand</a></span>

<br>Looks great and is beautifully animated, there are some great enemy designs (particularly the bosses) and some not so great enemy designs.
<br>
<br>I always thought to myself it&apos;d be great to have a BOI with guns, but without the synergies it doesn&apos;t make for very interesting or unique builds - In BOI, a poor run could still be enjoyable simply because of how drastically a combination of items could force you to alter your play style. Here, it feels like you need to get lucky just to have a fun experience. It is brutally stingy with money and health which is fair enough, but it does mean that more often than not a 20 minute run can dissolve in a few seconds.
<br>
<br>Honestly though, one of the most irksome things for me about the game is that I think the first stage is just too big.
<br>
<br>&quot;That&apos;s ridiculous&quot; you say.
<br>
<br>Well, maybe I&apos;m just a crazy bastard, but hear me out. In a procedurally generated game such as this - it takes too long for a run to take shape and start feeling unique. For me it seems like you spend way too long with the default weapons and it can make starting a new run tedious, especially when the game hands you a dud weapon to fight the first boss with.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s hard not walk away from each game feeling  frustrated. In it&apos;s current form I think this is a good title marred by a couple of niggling flaws and maybe in the future this will be a 10/10 game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/enter-the-gungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=6297441">Expand</a></span>

The controls are tight and pixel perfect. The narrative is silly, and simply told through item descriptions and brief interactions with quirky NPCs, but it very apparent. The gameplay is VERY difficult but fair, and through trial and error, even someone with a small amount of skill can surmount the obstacles in this game, only to feel real achievement when they finally kill that boss (I am looking at you Chamber 4!) Each weapon takes new tactics and getting used to, and most of them offer a new gimmick or purpose that doesn&apos;t always seem clear at first glance.
<br>
<br>Long story short - It is a great action game that while light on story, makes up for it in character and tons of replayability. IF that is you are willing to Enter the Gungeon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/enter-the-gungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=6275700">Expand</a></span>

The controls are wonderful: they really perfected the dodge roll, which is fitting given the name of the studio. The sound design is great, as is the soundtrack. The character and enemy design and animation are top-notch stuff (and those bosses!!).
<br>
<br>The difficulty is proper Roguelike-hard. It&apos;s more like my playthrough of Dungeons of Dredmor than Nuclear Throne: you really need to get to know each enemy and what it does, along with which guns work the best on particular enemies with particular attack patterns. Secrets are all over the place and super-obscure, which I like, but your mileage may vary.
<br>
<br>The big downside: the RNG is really punishing on Floor 1. While the standard enemies are super easy, it&apos;s a huge spike when you hit the first boss. I&apos;ve never had a problem getting a good set of guns by the time I hit Floor 2 and up, but that first floor can be super difficult because you have either an underpowered new gun or the default weaker one. For chests to open, you need a key. Those keys appear at random. That&apos;s the big problem - there&apos;s chests everywhere, but sometimes you won&apos;t open a single one, and then you&apos;re up against a boss who laughs at your standard pistol. Keys need to appear more often. The Convict circumvents this whole problem because she starts with a sawed-off shotgun, by the way.
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;m returning to it, it&apos;s a ton of fun, and I hope they clean up just a bit of the infuriating RNG at the beginning of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/enter-the-gungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=6273190">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Equipping your character is rarely something you get to choose, there&apos;s so many items that you&apos;re at the mercy of RNG.
<br>
<br>I find all the bosses to be of roughly the same difficulty level that I&apos;ve encountered thus far and have been frustrated with exactly 0 of them. Everything they do is in a pattern you can predict, anticipate and dodge. If you screw up, it&apos;s on you. The game has not once felt like it cheated me. To top this off, there&apos;s an incredible variety in the enemies, it&apos;s simply spread out amongst the levels. I suspect greyback never made it past the first to 2nd level.
<br>
<br>This seems to be a case of someone who&apos;s bad at the game blaming the game rather than himself. I&apos;ve played my share of games that feel like they screw you over, this isn&apos;t one of them. The balance is great, the variety is great, the art is great. The only thing that I would point to as being shy of excellent is the soundtrack.
<br>
<br>I would urge anyone reading to check steam reviews where the general consensus is &quot;overwhelmingly positive&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/enter-the-gungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=6272676">Expand</a></span>

<br>I truly love this game, it has a certain charm that other games of this sort lack. I love the inclusion of local co-op, but my biggest complaint is no online multiplayer. While certainly a daunting task to engineer from an indy developer, it would absolutely be 100% worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/enter-the-gungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=6277056">Expand</a></span>

The game takes the rouge-light elements we&apos;ve come to know from games like Nuclear Throne and The Binding of Isaac and tries to mix it with the colourful and interesting weapons that you might find in an Insomniac game (Ratchet and Clank, Sunset Overdrive). It does the latter quite poorly however, in that while the weapons look interesting, they almost all feel similar to each other, and most if not all don&apos;t fit the goofy gun-loving nature of the music and art style of the game. It seems to rely heavily upon an aspect that wasn&apos;t fleshed out to its fullest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/enter-the-gungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=6336783">Expand</a></span>

As a passionate fan of the rouge-like genre and dungeon crawlers in general; these issues felt more prominent and were ultimately very difficult to overlook.
<br>
<br>The game looks great and runs very well for starters - Nuclear Throne&apos;s major problem was running at a very stuttery 30fps which was almost headache-inducing at times due to how blatant it was. Enter The Gungeon is smooth and fluid throughout. Despite this; the core gameplay is incredibly repetitive with samey enemies and copy and paste rooms albeit being generated. The combat is mediocre with bland and uninspiring weapons and the constant manual reloading of them really kills the flow. Each room is also littered with tables, cover and other aesthetics which actually get in the way and make the action more cumbersome and annoying. Enemies persistently fire at you or around your surroundings and you are forced into working with and against the cover or simply dodge-roll wherever you can. It&apos;s very messy to say the least and you can escape situations in which you should&apos;ve been hit and other times you can be unfairly hit. It doesn&apos;t balance itself out though which can be infuriating.
<br>
<br>The game is very challenging though but after a few hours; you&apos;ll probably feel too underwhelmed to even bother continuing. With a lack of novelty power-ups or unique enemies like The Binding of Issac contains; each run just feels more bland and tedious and you don&apos;t feel inspired or motivated to have another go. Seemingly RNG luck surrounding bosses and general layouts mean no matter how well you do early on; you could be left screwed over through no fault of your own just a few rooms later also.
<br>
<br>Overall; Enter The Gungeon promised so much and despite looking like a solid premise and welcome challenger to other games in the genre; it&apos;s weighed down by poor game design and bland gameplay. Having played around 15 hours so far; I have got my money&apos;s worth for sure but any prospective buyers should just stick to the other far better games already out there. This game has been highly rated on Steam, mostly from users with under 1 hour played and leaving a not funny &apos;10/10&apos; but the negative reviews on there speak volumes and it is those I wished I listened to. Not even worth the refund hassle just to experience it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/enter-the-gungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=6272750">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First of all, the second player is forced to take a certain empty character, can&apos;t select his abilities like the first player, that really suck.
<br>
<br>It start strangely, tell you to go talk to a guy about a book, but he redirect you to somewhere else that I never found, and ended up saying **** the tutorial and went in the dungeon. Then you have a kind of riddle on a statue plaque and we were stuck for 5minutes trying to find out what to do until we realized we had to try to open the door simultaneously for it to open (ok, that&apos;s us being stupid, but still not very user friendly).
<br>
<br>Game itself was fun, fluid control and great animations and enemy design. Up until we realized we only have 3hearths (giving 6hit points), and that there&apos;s basically no health to be found anywhere. This could be okay in other game, but with the amount of bullet hell to dodge it&apos;s just too hard.
<br>
<br>Then you die, and you realize you don&apos;t restart at the previous room you completed, neither at the previous dungeon level, but at the complete start of the game. And unless I missed something, you don&apos;t seems to unlock anything that would make the next run easier... That&apos;s kinda what I always hated about roguelike games, and why I deleted it and said **** it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/enter-the-gungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=6284056">Expand</a></span>

<br>The co-op is really fun with a partner too, lots of laughs. This is one of those few games my girlfriend and me enjoy playing together. Shes not a gamer so its nice to come across a game that is easy to jump into, but hard enough to keep playing.
<br>Absolutely would recommend it to any one like binding of issac and nuclear throne.</span>

Like, damn. You&apos;re notably not limited in how many you can carry, either, and you&apos;ll need them all. Its humor and particular focus on gun puns have consisently made me smile. Gungeon tickles my &quot;Oooh, whats in this box?!&quot; sense as well as any other rogueish game, and I play a lot of them, let me tell you. I also think the teleporters are a nice touch, and save you a lot of time. There seems to be a lot of the game locked away to find: new guns, new items, a couple of secret characters, various NPC shopkeepers... except whats also locked is the actual endings for each character, an odd design decision, If I&apos;m being honest.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s also notably lacking in online coop. This gets it&apos;s own paragraph because it&apos;s why I didn&apos;t buy the game at launch.
<br>
<br>The problem is, you&apos;d be hard pressed to actually reach those endings, given the game&apos;s incredibly unforgiving difficulty past like, the first floor. I actually didn&apos;t get a chance to be screwed over by the RNG because I was dead before that became a problem. Success relies on expert timing with the dodge move and knowledge of enemy behaviors and bullet patterns as much as what guns you have, at least, that&apos;s my impression. I suppose I should have known going in there&apos;d be problems considering it bills itself as a &quot;Bullet Hell&quot; game, a genre I usually pass over in favor of more relaxing experiences. There are games where you eventually succeed because you&apos;ve leveled up enough, and there are games were you MIGHT eventually succeed because you practiced the same stupid boss fight over and over and over again, nevermind the pauses you had to take because literally anything else started to sound like more fun. Enter the Gungeon is the latter. And consulting the Wiki will only get you so far.
<br>
<br>This does not make it a bad game. It doesn&apos;t make the Binding of Issac or Steredenn or Leap of Fate or any other game with this kind of &quot;progression&quot; bad, either, and it&apos;s a better game than Issac besides. It just makes them relentlessly frustrating, and they attract a certain kind of unhelpful crowd. If you were to ask for some kind of easy mode or what have you, you&apos;d be shouted down with cries of &quot;git gud&quot;, that most abjectly useless piece of &quot;advice.&quot;
<br>
<br>Gungeon is for the masochistic gamer who believes that a &quot;challenge&quot; is more important then having fun. If you were looking for something else, I recommend Rogue Legacy, Rogue Stormers, or Starward Rogue. Still, if you have patience, split-second reaction speeds, or a rudimentary grasp of cheat engine, it&apos;s absolutely worth your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/enter-the-gungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=7232768">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played about 20 hours and I can&apos;t confidently say that I&apos;ve gotten the same gun twice. The passives haven&apos;t seemed quite so impressive yet, but I&apos;m not incredibly far into it. Dodge roll keeps the movement fast and reloading adds a simple yet game-changing mechanic, requiring more skill and tactics. Bosses that seem downright impossible sometimes, this really is a great game. I&apos;ve played both TBOI and Nuclear Thrones extensively, and this beats them both out by a mile for me. More interesting level design and gameplay than TBOI, and more variation than Nuclear Throne. I felt I needed to make an account just to love on this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/enter-the-gungeon/user-reviews?user_review_id=6654986">Expand</a></span>
