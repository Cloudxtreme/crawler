<br>
<br>The game itself however is mediocre, a very forgettable story along with a very short campaign(beat it in co-op on hardcore in 5 hours) make for an incredibly forgettable experience. There is no real replay value since it&apos;s very linear and scripted meaning events will play out the same way every time. This has been the case for previous Gears games too, but this is 2016 and the series is in need of some refreshing ideas not just a retread of the same tired formula.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer is fine but is hurting already on PC due to a very low playerbase, cross-play does not work in versus multiplayer so as soon as the PC playerbase dies out this game will be worthless unless you&apos;re really into the 5 hour campaign.
<br>
<br>The game has insanely overpriced microtransactions too. The items inside are completely random and are most likely going to be worthless since they know idiots will keep paying money in hope they get a rare item. Microtransactions have no place in a full price triple A game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6743860">Expand</a></span>

Graphics and performance are fine, but I would rather have had a better story and missions instead of  only good graphics.</span>

Just when you think things were starting to get more interesting, the game just ends.
<br>
<br>Then we have the multiplayer, there are so many game modes and all of them are literally dead, i assume  because of the low playerbase, restricting a game to a single store, extremely overpriced in my region and the fact that the MP is full of P2W, it killed the MP on arrival. Had it been on Steam and Origin, the outcome on the MP would have been different.
<br>I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if it sold poorly.
<br>
<br>The horde mode is fun, but it gets tedious trying to complete 50 waves which it could take a few hours.
<br>
<br>All in all, a forgettable experience that is not worth it.
<br>So far, it has been a disappointment, but one thing though, this is an amazing port and it looks beautiful, but that&apos;s about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6740351">Expand</a></span>

So if I had a computer crash and I want to restore my game but they have removed it because it&apos;s &quot;too old&quot;, it seems you are out of luck. They have to drop the price on this drastically to make it worth a PC gamers time and effort to install.
<br>
<br>Overall great, that they have come out with Gears of War 4, terrible marketing push and restrictive buying options (No steam) for PC gamers. This should be generally available on disk or as a download through other vendors.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6764696">Expand</a></span>

<br>Using an xbox one controller and it feels responsive and tight.
<br>There are a tons of multiplayer modes and things to unlock.
<br>Overall it is a well optimized game, really fun, and action packed.
<br>Would recommend to new comers to this series.
<br>Not sure how it compares to other entries in this series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6740429">Expand</a></span>

<br>The problems lie in that the core gameplay is now looking to be the product of its&apos; age. It&apos;s a Gears game, for both good and bad - it does nothing surprising whatsoever and innovates in no area. But despite looking every bit the modern game, it&apos;s archaic in how it plays. In fact, in many ways it feels like a remaster of a previous GoW game rather than a new one - the similarities to past titles are that stark.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing if you simply love the formula it has (obvious cover based shooting etc.), so if you loved the past titles, you&apos;ll love this. But even if you DID love the older games, you&apos;ll start to get more than a little bit of deja vu about an hour in.
<br>
<br>If you haven&apos;t played a Gears title before? Well, you may be wondering why there was a load of fuss about a linear third person shooter with cover mechanics that you&apos;ve seen time and time again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6748420">Expand</a></span>

Everything is a bit smoother, a little more high res, but ultimately it looks dated, it&apos;s a far cry from the impact of the first game that&apos;s fore sure.
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise again it&apos;s exactly the same, you&apos;ll be doing all the same things, they&apos;ve not had any new ideas and they just go back to the well for the story as well, I was hoping for a new story completely, MF was done and his story is boring now.
<br>
<br>The Multiplayer fails to fix the shotgun heavy gameplay of old, it&apos;s boring as a result, Horde mode is Horde mode, it&apos;s only good if you have friends who want to play... I do not...
<br>
<br>It&apos;s just a slightly above average game, it&apos;s very polished, but it&apos;s &quot;meh&quot;..
<br>
<br>Also no SDK like what the first Gears had on PC, this instantly kills the longevity on PC, I was hoping for mods and custom maps.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6749276">Expand</a></span>

Another in the list of franchises Microsoft seems to be rebooting because they&apos;re either unable to think up something inspiring to help sell their console, or they&apos;re too afraid to push the boat out - in fear it may just be a wasted effort.  Well, I guess they&apos;re sticking with what they know.
<br>
<br>Sadly, they seem to have forgotten what Gears was really all about.  close quarters combat, inspired mostly by roadie running, wall bouncing and Gnasher fights.  How unfortunate that assault rifles (particularly the Hammerburst) is dominating the current weapon meta.  And that the maps seem to be designed with openness and visibility in mind...which really makes the glaring weapon damage (especially at range) a major issue, and easily noticeable.  That being said, the maps seem overly familiar and uninspired.  Lackluster, and don&apos;t really reflect the campaign, feel or theme of the game as a whole.
<br>
<br>Versus, however, is ridden with peer-to-peer connection, with the game feeling worse than the gameplay of GoW2 from 2008.  To those who remember the abysmal issue of host advantage, and severe lag and want to relive that sweet bit of nostalgia, then GoW4 is definitely for you!  Yes, the game advertises dedicated servers - yet I never played on one.  The game also advertised cross play for Versus (along side campaign, and horde - to which it does have) but, unfortunately, it does not support this.  Instead, online is riddled with issues where social is limited to 2 man teams, with difficulty finding lobbies.  And ranked, from my experience, just being the same 2 dozen players, day after day, slowly moving up the ranks as we were shuffled about.  That&apos;s when I could get a game - Ranked TDM was the only viable playlist, which took 5 minutes or more to find a match.  I waited 30 mins or more for every other playlist, and never got a game.  Which is a shame, because I&apos;m partial to some KotH myself.
<br>
<br>Now, moving onto Horde.  Horde is... boring.  It&apos;s repetitive, with the only change being bosses on boss waves.   This isn&apos;t helped by certain factors. Such as the maps. I can&apos;t really express my disdain for the games maps... but they just don&apos;t seem to work with the gameplay, the game types.  They&apos;re so out of place. Ofcourse, there are new weapons - but I feel there are less weapons.  Or atleast, noticeable weapons.  Some, such as the boomshot and torque bow return, but they don&apos;t feel the same - the boomshot in particular.  Some of the newer goodies, like the dropshot, or embar, seem &apos;too&apos; good.  Even in verses.  However, I do like the class system in GoW4.  Well, I like the idea of it... beside&apos;s TC&apos;s need for greed.
<br>
<br>Microtransactions.  No, really.  They&apos;re extortionate, and ridiculous.  You can get duplicate of drops.  The drop rates, especially for epics, has proven to be ridiculously low (Even on the &apos;better&apos; and more expensive dropboxes). The in-game currency just isn&apos;t dropped anywhere near enough.  TC and MS really dropped the ball on this one - the microtransactions are basically forced down your throat.
<br>
<br>They wouldn&apos;t be so bad.  I mean, bounties are nice but all but pointless (especially the ones that give you pathetically low credit rewards) the skins are basically all too flashy, misplaced, and lackluster.  No old-timey characters, or decent skins or current characters - most look like they were literally excreted on by a unicorn after it digested a rainbow.  And are easily noticeable a mile away.  Oh, and Horde skill cards are locked and can only be gained by these dropboxes.  And you have to upgrade said cards (you need 1 to unlock it and another 19 to level it to the max level, which is 5).  Some cards are even epic and rare.  And you need 1 to access it...before you even have the option to create it from scraps.  Scraps, which are a currency from breaking down cards, skins and bounties for less than a 1/5 of it&apos;s value.  And with how hard it is to obtain cards, because the drop boxes are overpriced... you&apos;re not maxing out your horde cards any time soon, especially the good stuff.
<br>
<br>Campaign I can&apos;t really comment on, I didn&apos;t complete it - I lost all incentive as there&apos;s no reward for effort anymore.  Everything is locked behind a large RNG grind wall / extortionately priced pay wall.  Not that I even picked up GoW4 for the campaign, I didn&apos;t really get far into it - it just didn&apos;t grip me at all, though I can say the characters have more personality this time around.  Even Old Man Marcus sprouted an ego at some point since GoW3.  See, they can write good characters if they try.
<br>
<br>Although, on a positive note.  The graphics look amazing, if you&apos;ve got a decent GPU.  Although that&apos;s mostly ruined by all the issues (see the forums for details).  Honestly, avoid this game.  This ain&apos;t my first rodeo with these XB1 exclusive ports, or the XB1 and it&apos;s quality in general.  They think good graphics make up for lack of content and an unfinished game.  They&apos;re wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6752158">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Honestly though my biggest praise is for how well it runs and functions on PC. This game has full 21:9 which is rare for some AAA developers. Not only does it support it but the UI and load screen fully support it as well which is hardly ever seen in some cases. The graphics are amazing as well! Gears has never looked so good and some of the special effects are amazing eye candy. Tons of fun set pieces from that campaign.  The 60fps or beyond is also great, super smooth. It doesn&apos;t support SLI yet. Which is fine since my 1 card is handling the game fine.
<br>
<br>So overall. The game runs amazing on PC. It&apos;s super fun and the multiplayer is great! Game needs SLI support and there are some minor bugs and what not that need patched in the future. Still loving the game though! If you are a Gears fan you will enjoy it for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6740979">Expand</a></span>

And even though I didn&apos;t fiddle with it much there is room for supersampling and get an even crispier image on my old rig.
<br>There are loads of pc options and I didn&apos;t feel I missed any option. You could turn motion blur completely off and you could increase the FOV up to 100, options that often are missing on **** ports.
<br>I think as far as the port goes MS should have cudos for finally releasing a good one.
<br>Using the windowsstore is what it is, not a fan tbh and It did take alot more time than I&apos;m used to, to download and install the game. And once done it didn&apos;t patch it, I had to start the game for it to realise that and then it gave me all kinds of error codes when trying to patch it. I quick restart and I managed to get the patch. But once all the windowstore crap was done it ran flawless on my rig.
<br>And the game looks very good with potential for looking even more stellar with a newer and better rig. It seems very well optimised on pc to be able to run in 4k at 60fps without requiring too much of a rig.
<br>
<br>As for the game itself it is a Gears game, no more no less. It doesn&apos;t surprise and innovate really but it doesn&apos;t disappoint either.
<br>The shooting and action is solid albeit a bit repetetive, the whole game is moving from one area to the next doing the exact same thing. The game does not reward exploration and it doesn&apos;t mix the formula or gameplay style for variety. But what is there is good.
<br>Story is okay but got an abrupt ending wich left alot unexplained. I feel they could have fleshed out some bits a bit more.
<br>The singleplayer took me around 8-9h to complete on normal. But there is replayability here. I will play the campaign again on a higher difficulty in coop once my friend gets the game. And then there is multiplayer VS or Horde mode to expand your playtime if you are into that.
<br>
<br>I would say that if you are a SP guy only and the multiplayer or coop does not interest you that much, then what this game offers might be a bit lacking and I&apos;d rate it at around a 7/10. But if you are into coop/multiplayer and because it was such a good solid pc port and the fact that it not only offers coop, it offers a full campaign coop to boot AND local coop even on the pc version... I will crank that score up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6747776">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s two-player campaign only unlike Gears 3 which allowed for four players, however you always have at least three characters in your squad and sometimes four, so this easily could&apos;ve had three player coop which would&apos;ve alleviated another major issue with the campaign: The absolutely abysmal squad AI. They said they wanted to focus on delivering the Gears 1 experience again but if that&apos;s the case why isn&apos;t it a Marcus and Dom type coop adventure where the other members are in the game only half the time? Reeks like they planned to do larger coop but cut it for some reason (my guess would be XB1 limitations with how hard they wanted to push graphics).

<br>Most of the boss fights are absolutely ruined by the AI doing really stupid things requiring you to babysit them and constantly reminding you why it&apos;s impossible to enjoy the game as you are chronically required to drop everything to pick them up so they can at least be distractions for the bosses, and then when they&apos;re up they don&apos;t do much more than act as bait for the bosses seemingly going out of the way to die again ASAP so you have to stop enjoying the game to pick them up and repeat the process endlessly throughout the entire campaign.
<br>
<br>The multiplayer is a F2P system in a AAA priced game, you collect cards through packs you can buy with in-game credits you earn at an abysmal rate, or you can buy them with real money. You do not unlock anything at all unless you are purchasing packs, Horde mode sees actual play benefit from having better cards, it&apos;s also how you unlock new characters, basically they are heavily milking unlocks for $$$ when it should&apos;ve been included in the base game for clearing the campaign, acquiring certain achievements, and if the card system had to be left in, having it credits only (no real money transactions) with a significantly buffed rate compared to current so it would be unlike the current system where you&apos;re essentially earning slave wages if you aren&apos;t spending money on them outright.
<br>
<br>My take is that they made this a well optimized PC port to get stubborn non-Win10 gamers onto Win10, threw together a half-baked campaign so they could tout it as a feature, then went the easy route of plopping in Horde and Versus modes they could milk with the pay system of card packs.
<br>
<br>Servers are supposedly dedis but there are still hit detection issues, players will be invincible to bullets at times, the Gnasher shoots out of the barrel sometimes and from the center of the screen others. I&apos;ve also, on my screen, been *behind* an enemy and then been gibbed when they fire in front of them on mine screen (this is only possible on peer-to-peer servers, it is literally *impossible* on dedis, so I doubt we are actually getting dedis like they advertised).
<br>
<br>Horde Mode lets you invite friends to join games in progress in case people drop but how often is that going to be used? Most people still drop around Wave 15 out of boredom or join and then stand there afking then altab in every now and then to wiggle their character to prevent being autokicked (you earn credits regardless of performance so this is an effective way of farming for packs).
<br>
<br>2/10 because it looks good runs good and is fun for campaign coop for about three hours. Beyond that everything about it falls apart. Gears is just a terrible, terrible franchise, and a proper PC release can&apos;t even save it from that truth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6742602">Expand</a></span>

<br>Also a great game with solid gameplay. Glad to be back on PC.

<br>And yeah as others have said, honestly the game is just about perfect. It runs great, it&apos;s fun as hell, and the multiplayer will keep you at it for awhile. Some people might find some dull points in the story but for me, it honestly is a great **** game.</span>

I have played a few hours of the campaign, it seems fun, it is very pretty! Not tried versus yet, but I did try the beta sometime ago so I do know what that is somewhat like.
<br>
<br>If you love the Gears of war games pick this up ASAP. If you are not really a fan or havn&apos;t tried it before, I would say this is the perfect time to hop on. This is a perfect restart for this franchise, doesn&apos;t hurt that they made a perfect PC version to! On the PC version when you go to settings it tells you what each and every setting effects on your PC (GPU or CPU!), there are also tons of settings to mess around with and get just how you want for you&apos;re build.
<br>
<br>I have a good i5, but my gpu is an older 660ti (3gb vram), I am still running the game with half the settings on high and half on medium and I havn&apos;t yet gone below 60fps.
<br>
<br>Well done Coalition and MS! After the issues that The Ultimate Edition of Gears Of war 1 had, it is great to see devs and a publisher that will LEARN from there mistakes and come back with one of the best PC version of a multiplat in awhile. One of 2016&apos;s best games imo, I now want every pc game to have these amount of graphics settings and also this amount of detail as to what parts of you&apos;re pc each settings effects (and how much).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6744277">Expand</a></span>

I really like this game. I was happy when i saw Unreal Engine 4 because i played PARAGON a Moba game from the same producer, the game is really smooth. So far i&apos;ve done 6hrs of playing, im enjoying it and can&apos;t wait to play online when I finish the campain.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6744792">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed the campaign plays similar to Gears 3 esp the multiplayer which could take some minor adjustments to several of the weapons which I think are overpowered. Like the Hammerburst, and Enforcer.   The graphics looks really good. Have it running on a 4GB RX 480 and get bout 80FPS on Ultra@1900X1200 @60HZ paired with an FX 8320 @4GHZ and 16GB of Ram. I wouldn&apos;t call this a port as they had PC in mind and seems like they took their time to get it right.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6757477">Expand</a></span>

I liked how I can play it on my PC and then switch over to the Xbox One under the same save file.  Some days I want to play it with all graphics maxed out in high resolution and other days I want to play it in a big comfy chair and a big screen.  If you liked Gears 1-3 and Judgement then this is for you.  If you didn&apos;t like the previous games then move along because you won&apos;t find a lot new here.  This is kind of like the Warcraft Movie, it was made for the fans of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6833123">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Installation and configuration was easy. Benchmark option is great. I had to do some configuring with my mic to work and it still doesn&apos;t quite channel audio like a console but who cares? I was able to join right up to a party and play! Please more cross platform games MS!!!</span>

<br>The horde 3.0 mode is awesome.
<br>If I have to give one reason to not buy this game, it could only be achievements being too hard. Seriously 4.0 is basically torturing gamers.</span>

The plot is interesting to watch, besides, the developers sometimes throw up interesting scenes (I was very pleased with lightning storms, they look great!). Many have complained that the robots are not fun to play, and I on the contrary - against locusts was less interesting. It is a pity that the game is over essentially nothing, and it turns out the whole game we were looking for the mother of our friend, and I would like more epic in plot, Yes, the ending is rather weak. But the game is beautiful, cheerful, and after I wanted to immediately replay from the beginning. Waiting for the continuation!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=7073775">Expand</a></span>

I have played it both on PC and Xbox One and the PC version is flawless in terms of optimisation, performance, graphics and even controls. I think the cross-play feature between Xbox and PC is something more games should do, which keeps the community alive. Gears of War 4 is one of the only games that has a truly seamless, balanced competitive and co-operative crossplay experience.
<br>
<br>Let me start off with the value proposition. You get campaign, Horde and Versus multiplayer. Plus, two maps every month for the first year, all free of charge. I can&apos;t stress enough how great of a job the develoeprs have done in actively supporting the game through continuous balancing improvements based on community feedback. Then umber of times the Gnasher alone has been tweaked is baffling. Similarly, the amount of content updates for horde, special events in multiplayer and additional cosmetic items has been far more than what you get in other games. And for those who complain about microtransactions: first of all, everything is cosmetic (skins) and secondly, all of it is obtainable using in-game credits which are extremely easy to earn, so I really question the sanity of people who spend really money on these. The cards and scrap system in this game is definitely controversial, especially since the skills and perks for Horde mode are based around cards, but it&apos;s just one of those RPG elements. You absolutely do not need to spend a penny in this game to get the most out of it. Even the season pass gives you pretty much nothing!
<br>
<br>Now to the main part: gameplay. Unlike other successful franchises, Gears of War 4 hasn&apos;t gone down the path of bloating its gameplay and mechanics with silly additions like killstreaks or perks in multiplayer. When it comes to Versus, it&apos;s the same as it&apos;s always been: 5 on 5, same starting weapons, more powerful weapons are pick-up based, gun on gun. That&apos;s it. It&apos;s still very much true to what makes Gears of War unique: the fast-paced movement and cover mechanics, the fight-or-flight instincts that kick in during elegant dances around the map in intense battles, the fight for power weapons, the ultimate satisfaction of beating your opponent to pulling the trigger of the Gnasher shotgun and of course, those never-tiring headshots! If you like the core mechanics of Gears, you&apos;ll be hard-pushed to find flaws in this. If you didn&apos;t like Gears before, you&apos;re not going to like it now. It&apos;s very much a unique take on shooter mechanics and design which is a love/hate thing. Mechanically, Gears is by far my favourite shooter, and I&apos;m so glad it&apos;s not been diluted or messed with. That&apos;s not to say this game doesn&apos;t innovate however. The new weapons are satisfying, different and well-suited to the game. Similarly, the modes and maps make for exciting gameplay every time.
<br>
<br>The Horde mode has been further enhanced from Gears of War 3. The 5 classes each have a unique role, making Horde a co-ordinated, co-operative team experience. In particular, the roles of Scout and Engineer are particularly noteworthy as being different from just shooting enemies. The additions to Horde 3.0 make it more complex and interesting but unlike, say, CoD Zombies, they&apos;re transparent. The game doesn&apos;t hide any of its intricacies, and makes the role of each class and all concepts clear from the start without having a tutorial. Furthermore, the cards and class levels make the roles more dynamic, so there is scope for slightly different tactics within each class. Furthermore, the choice of map has a huge impact on the experience. It&apos;s fair to say that some maps are far more enjoyable, easier, challenging or boring than others! But this is just a testament to their variety. The only issue with Horde mode, which after a year still hasn&apos;t been addressed, is that when playing online, upon a match being created there is no way to back out, no way to veto the map, no way to communicate with other players prior to the match starting and no way to see what level each player is, what cards they have, what level those cards are, what class level they are etc. - all you can see is what class and character they&apos;ve picked. Even then, most of my online Horde matches with randomers have been highly enjoyable, despite playing on the hardest difficulties.
<br>
<br>Finally, I&apos;d like to give the reason why I can&apos;t give it a 10/10. The campaign is a huge disappointment. After the epic finale of Gears 3, the awesome boss fights in both 2 and 3, the originality of the first game and even the alternative approach of Judgement, Gears 4 is by far the weakest campaign in the series! It falls short in all departments: shallow characters, no satisfying story, no awesome / funny / memorable moments, no emotion, no interesting boss fights, no variation in gameplay, nothing. Just a repetitive run-of-the-mill 5/10 corridor shooter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=7574732">Expand</a></span>

The graphic and animation compartments are of the highest quality, the gameplay is smooth, it is not necessary to stay behind protection walls or obstacles to survive, like it was in the first chapter. The movements are agile and it&apos;s possible to avoid damage fairly easily with good reflexes. The world itself is gorgeous, but unfortunately the maps are reduced to corridors and narrow rooms, exploration is still reduced to zero, just like the previous games of the series. In the campaign the story is fair: the prologue and first chapter are a little weak on the impact point of view, in fact the robot enemies are quite uninspired, and the flashbacks too short to be intersting or to ignite some emotions. Luckily from the second chapter of the game things fire up a lot, with the intro of old Marcus (and his rough ironic misfortunes) and  of the new locust/swarm enemies. As I said before the maps are really narrow, but they are masterfully designed and it&apos;s often possible to hold on for some moments to admire the beauties of the environment. Interaction with the surroundings is still fairly low, and unfortunately there is a lot of backtracking, so the player, as the story unfolds, is forced to return to his steps following the same rooms he met before. The new characters are cool enough to be able to replace the old generation, that is mostly present as spectators and only in the last part of the story. There is much variety of situations to keep the gameplay very interesting.
<br>Speaking of the multyplayer mode I&apos;ve tried mainly Horde and it is really fun to play, mainly if the player finds the right group of people to play with, otherwise it&apos;s a chore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gears-of-war-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=7601229">Expand</a></span>
