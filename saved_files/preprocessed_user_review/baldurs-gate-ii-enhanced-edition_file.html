Basically they&apos;ve been forgoing patching in favour of getting both BGEE and BG2EE on Android. I would recommend you instead buy BG2 from GoG (or anywhere that sells the original game) and use the BG2 fixpack on it. It will solve all of the major and the vast majority of the minor bugs in the original BG2 and you won&apos;t get the multitude of bugs (which can include everything from your weapon proficiencies getting wiped clean to not having access to your slayer form for more than one use, to your character getting stuck on the screen from a dragon&apos;s wing buffet) you get with the &quot;enhanced&quot; edition.
<br>
<br>The new characters they introduce are decent but nothing that is resoundingly different from the many mods already available for the game (a number of which aren&apos;t available with the &quot;enhanced&quot; edition). Also most of the new characters quest lines are bugged (and have been obviously for the last 7 months).
<br>
<br>Overall I would buy the game from GoG (or anywhere that sells the original game) for less than half the price of this release. Not only will you save money but between the fixpacks and all the available mods for BG2 you&apos;ll get far better value for your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3775199">Expand</a></span>

<br>When I was young, I bought it expecting something like Diablo...but BG2 is much bigger, and much deeper...the game is huge.
<br>
<br>Funny thing was I had no idea how the hell the AD&amp;D rule set worked when I bought the game. I didn&apos;t even know what numeric values like &quot;2D6+1&quot; meant because I had never played D&amp;D and never made the connection to &quot;2 six-sided dice plus 1 damage&quot; til much later. The whole game was a learning experience, but ultimately when you do get some understanding of how it works the D&amp;D rule set makes the game all the more enjoyable because of the sheer number of cool spells and items and character customization options that the D&amp;D rule set allows.
<br>
<br>This game was way ahead of it&apos;s time, too. The voice acting and writing are great, and the alignment system makes interacting with other characters interesting and adds replay value. Each party member is interesting, with the own personality, alignments, and side quests to perform. You can even establish a romance with a party member if you treat him/her right.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t really recommend this game enough. The one thing I would consider before buying it is the game&apos;s length and learning curve...which aren&apos;t that problematic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3790648">Expand</a></span>

<br>Beamdog is doing great work extending the long term viability of these classic titles. The enhanced version of Baldur&apos;s Gate was superior to the GOG version (which I also own). This version is a legitimate rebuild and extension of a great game that allows it to seamlessly function on new systems. Thanks for a great rebuild of a great game! If you at all have any love for this game, be sure to support all the honest efforts to extend its playability into the future. People who moan about $26 as &apos;too much&apos; for a game like this are losing perspective on the true value of work in this industry and perchance need spend less time playing games and more time working in the REAL world. You want the industry to support classic games? Support mods by all means, but also definitely BUY games like this so that the teams doing the work can continue to provide great games for all of us. Buy the GOG version. Mod your original version AND buy this. Then you will truly be in a position to give an honest (and constructive) review. I wonder how many &apos;fans&apos; ready to score bomb this are sitting on big libraries of torrent-stolen games.
<br>
<br>Most irritating thing is that if these butt-hurt moaners really can&apos;t afford it, they only have to wait a few months till they can get it for pennies on a Steam sale. How painful that is NOT!
<br>
<br>Get some bloody perspective!

As far as I can tell they have only remastered character sprites so all other artwork is just rescaled and blurry in high resolutions as a result. No doubt it&apos;s a classic RPG but this version is simply lazy, a waste of money and an obvious cash grab design to capitalise on nostalgia and a resurgence of the genre. If not having to spend 30 seconds googling &quot;baldur&apos;s gate II widescreen mod&quot; is worth $25 to you then knock yourself out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3792328">Expand</a></span>

<br>The new character Hexxat starts off as a good companion but gets quickly changed into a bland generic lesbian character that locks out all the male characters playing.. so everyone playing a Male char gets locked out of any extra romances in the new game.

This was nothing more than a cash grab by some morons that want to push their social agenda on everyone else. I think they should be sued for this by the IP owners because it spits on the original great work in every conceivable way.</span>

<br>
<br>The ironic thing is there is a Secret NPC called Wilson, a Giant Bear, who is actually fun and the sort of addition I would look for in an enhanced version of the game, but his inclusion is a &quot;secret&quot; and its not so easy to get him.
<br>
<br>Overall a very average game, however additional points must be deducted as the lack of professionalism by the &quot;community manager&quot; is unforgivable.

Overhaul&apos;s idea -- take a classic game, update the engine and add some content is brilliant.  After all, the era of yearly computer upgrades is over and only a small set of self-described gamers buy machines solely to play games.  Why not add content to a game that can run on an email and web browsing machine?  Again, brilliant, right?  Unfortunately, the idea is better than the execution.
<br>
<br>The good --
<br>
<br>The developers have added a nifty zoom function that allows the game to played on high resolution screens.  They also added a feature they call a &apos;quick loot bar&apos; that makes some of the game&apos;s mundane tasks go by quickly.  After ironing out some troublesome bugs the game now runs better than ever.
<br>
<br>The bad --
<br>
<br>The new content just isn&apos;t as good as the original and the developers have taken a heavy hand in quashing criticism.  The new NPC &apos;Hexxat&apos;,  a vampire thief and lesbian love interest, was panned by all but the hardcore defenders of the company --  but you won&apos;t find these negative reviews on the official forums; the critical threads have been deleted or locked and the critics have been banned.  I quickly became bored with Hexxat and never finished her storyline.  Another NPC character &apos;Dorn&apos;, an evil blackguard, was put in to please those who disliked the heroic narrative of the original game.  If your idea of fun is playing a protagonist that slaughters innocents at a wedding party then this NPC is for you -- he didn&apos;t do anything for me.
<br>
<br>In brief, good idea and poor execution.  If you liked the original game and would like to play it again I would recommend buying it.  If, however, you were hoping for a game with lots of new content you will be disappointed.
<br>
<br>Also note -- the developers have asked the hardcore fans to post positive reviews on this site.  I would read the mixed reviews before reading the 10 / 10 and 0 /10 reviews.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4440426">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The original content in its unchanged state is still wonderful and prizeworthy.
<br>I however will be reviewing the content added to it by Overhaul games. Not its original awesomeness.
<br>
<br>Lets talk about releasing a game. Whoever forced the deadline down the developers throats needs to be fired and blacklisted. The devs did not even have the time and resources to move over the new portraits and sounds from Baldur&apos;s Gate Enhanced Edition 1. There are soooo many bugs. I have had the golem in the very first scene not talk for 5 minutes till after he was suppose to do so, leaving Irenicus chattering to himself like a madman. It also left me trapped in the cage for 5 minutes, since Imoen can&apos;t break you free until the golem finishes talking.  Not much further down the road you run into another bug, the Genie doesn&apos;t appear to offer you the sword in the air elemental plane.
<br>
<br>On the same track.. The multiplayer is broken. Not just a little broken, like crashes on gamestart, timeouts abound, unable to rejoin unless host exits and restarts and in some cases all parties have to restart BG EE2 to be able to play together again if even one of them crashes.  It can even corrupt save game files on area changes. And tends to crash everyone but the host on chapter transitions   Beamdog.net /their multiplayer hosting is a wreck.There is a just a list of games. No filters. They could do filters by campaign, by location, by password or not. You don&apos;t even get alphabetical sorting. If there are 1000 games and your friend is hosting. You have to scroll down and read 1000 games until you reach your friend&apos;s game.
<br>
<br>Black Pits 2.  Well, there was some solid voice acting. Its actually funny at some points.The story line is better and more well developed than black pits 1. There are more people to interact with it does a much better job of creating the setting and feel. You can tell they put some real effort into it.  It is a little short, but not as short as blackpits 1, Or at least it doesn&apos;t feel like it. .But its very challenging. This can be good or bad depending on whether you are good or bad at making parties, it also challenges you greatly to manage your income.  Not a lot of new weapons and armor, mostly just reusing other stuff. If all aspects of the game were as well done as this, it would be amazing and I would give a shining stamp of approval.
<br>
<br>My overall thoughts are, if you are getting it for Singleplayer only, then its great. Personally I like having all of it nicely packaged together on a steam account so I don&apos;t have to keep track of all the disks. For me that has significant value. So no matter where I go or what computer I have, I will always have Baldur&apos;s Gate 2.  However, that praise really goes to Steam and Beamdog, not Overhaul games. They don&apos;t get credit for that.
<br>
<br>If you were getting it for multiplayer, my thoughts are to wait a few months and let them release some hot fixes and patches.  IF its still broken at that time then forget it. If not then buy and have some fun.
<br>
<br>I would also recommend getting it for addon content. Despite all of its flaws, it does have a very active modding community, with a wonderful set of support forums. If there is a bug, it is likely known and there could even be a work around. The devs got it right in creating a strong user community.
<br>
<br>So overall, 5/10 for the new content. For the original content 9.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3809522">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Improvements/stabilization: Beamdog worked hard to make BGII run properly on new machines, and in general, just work a whole lot better without performance varying overly much between different computers. They crushed a whole lot of bugs, and introduced some new ones. Not unexpected. They have done a fine job of squashing new bugs, and in general I&apos;ve found BGII:EE to contain minimal bugs. BG:EE had a horrible number of bugs on release, but thankfully as they are on the same engine, nearly all of the bug fixes that they worked on for the past year in BG:EE carry over to BGII:EE.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer works decently: Deal breaker. Baldur&apos;s Gate seems a perfect match for multiplayer, but in the original games it was incredibly buggy and prone to stop working at any given moment. Not only have they fixed most of the bugs with multiplayer, they also gave us a matchmaking feature so we don&apos;t have to manually hand out our IP addresses to people. That said, it&apos;s worth noting that they promised a matchmaking feature over a year ago, initially stating it would be in BG:EE upon release. They only recently got it working a few weeks ago. If you&apos;re jumping in now, then huzzah. But it&apos;s worth noting how slow these guys are.
<br>
<br>Mediocre additions: The areas in BGII:EE look great and pretty true-to-the-original, which is excellent since the new environments looked very much out of place in BG:EE. I find the characters very disappointing, however. While Baldur&apos;s Gate always blended the world of the Forgotten Realms with the rhetoric of today somewhat, Neera goes over the line. She very much feels like apart of our world and seems out of place in the Forgotten Realms setting. That said I do enjoy her personality, but it&apos;s worth noting she&apos;s terribly Western Hemisphere. Unfortunately her voice acting seems  uninspired, this time around. While she sounded very bubbly in BG:EE she sounds a little bored in BGII:EE. I&apos;m not sure why. Hexxat is game-breaking, a complete box of contradictions, basically existing purely to throw Evil Partiers a bone. Oh, and probably to convince iPad users (who will have to download the characters as DLC) to buy her once they Google her stats. She feels very much like one of the NPC add-ons that a modder added to the game, not like she was written by a professional. Dorn stands as wasted potential; what could&apos;ve been an incredibly interesting character is just a flat, one-dimensional character instead. According to his stats he has a 15 Wisdom, which is fairly high, and yet from his actions and words he seems to be one of the least wise characters in the game. Game director Trent Oster bragged that he was an &quot;unapologetically evil&quot; character, and I&apos;m sad to say that he was quite right. Dorn has absolutely no conscience, not semblance of honor or restraint in any situation. Not only is that gratuitous, but it is also bad characterization, boring, totally inhuman and unrealistic. I had high hopes for Dorn, perhaps too high. It would seem though that Beamdog is incapable of analyzing human nature and understanding the existence of evil, and as such, they will never be able to write a realistic and relatable evil character. A shame. If you have never played BGII before, I would say to instead seek out Viconia, Edwin, and a certain Throne of Bhaal exclusive NPC if you wish to witness genuinely interesting evil characters. Indeed, it would seem that the Sun Soul Monk Rasaad is the only character who actually fits in to the established universe in Baldur&apos;s Gate II.
<br>
<br>Reasonable price: The only people saying that the price is unreasonable is those that already own Baldur&apos;s Gate II. Yeah, of course you think it&apos;s overpriced at that point; all you&apos;re looking at in that case is an upgrade. For those who have never played however, $25 is a steal. Since there is no real way of deciphering between those who own the original and those who do not, it is $25 for us all. Besides, Beamdog needs the money so that they can expand and perhaps stop doing such slow and somewhat sloppy work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3795802">Expand</a></span>

Enhanced Edition is a half arsed, repackaged, joke of an &quot;update&quot;.
<br>
<br>The new content is trash.  This is low grade, modteam level stuff and not the good kind.  Other than obviously having a proper audio studio, the voice acting is even comically bad.  The writing on the new characters and the Black Pits 2 is just a joke.  The combat of the Black Pits 2 is effortless.  Effortless in that they basically put old mobs in the arena, changed the names, and said &quot;hmm just make them immune to everything, figure out a way to hack the engine so that this creature is not even effected by things that are not actually possible in the games rules, make that creature ignore AC/Saves/resistances, this creature just add a couple 0&apos;s to the HP number, and this other one lets just triple its damage and add instant kill abilities, oh and forget about QA its not important&quot;.  The Black Pits is actually really great in concept, and I wish Beamdog had been competent enough to execute it with even a modicum of quality.  It should also be noted that as of this writing, there is a pretty good chance that if you try to import your party from the EE of Baldurs Gate 1&apos;s Black Pits, it will probably crash the game and corrupt the file.  That right there is a good idea of the quality of the new content.
<br>
<br>They created a pittance of new content, and then didnt even QA it enough to make it functional.  The only redeemable bit of it has one of its best features (start a party in BG1 EE Black Pits, play through the BG2 EE Black Pits with the same party much like the original vanilla games) is about 50/50 on whether or not it will eat your party when you import.  Make a backup before you even try.
<br>
<br>The biggest problem overall is that QA is non existent.  Over the years fans have patched and improved these games to an impeccable state (these as in BG1, BG2, IWD and so on).  Beamdog basically threw all that out and just scaled up the art, and dorked around with the source code enough to break everything.  The game crashes and soft locks in the most exciting and unexpected ways.   Its amazing that a game with access to millions of dollars and professional game developers can utterly ruin something that a bunch of fans made perfect for free.  The entire EE re-release series is so buggy that its widely considered to be a practical joke, or possibly some sort of social experiment.  Its easy to see why if it wasnt for the fact that money was spent, and is charged, for this game.
<br>
<br>Baludurs Gate 1 and 2 are masterpieces.  Undisputed examples of &quot;video games as art&quot;.  Baldurs Gate 1 and 2 Enhanced edition are terrible, half arsed &quot;updates&quot; to games that were already perfected both technically and content wise long ago.  If you want to play these games for the first time or want digital copies, then just buy the pack avaialble with the original versions of all the Infiinte Engine games that has been avaialble for years and install the latest community updates and enjoy yourself.  Do not give Beamdog reward for trash, because the greatest danger is that they have said they wish to make Baldurs Gate 3 someday, if they make enough money on these re-releases.
<br>
<br>That would be a travesty, and if you contribute to that then I hate you.  And yes, I hate myself, because I have these stains in my Steam list too :(</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4441640">Expand</a></span>

Apart from the technical improvements, the game has diminished in quality. The new characters are mostly boring, especially the new to BG2- Hexxat. She is boring in her normal interactions but her romance is just ridiculously flat. A collection of single sentences pretending to be a dialogue. Dorn is unrealistic,  a terribly created evil character, that  does not even compare to the genius of Edwin, Viconia, Sarevok or even Korgan. Neera&apos;s story is predictable but at least has some depth to it, despite the ridiculous quests. I am told Rasaad is slightly more interesting, bu I haven&apos;t tried him.
<br>Overlooking the quality of the writing though, the game is so bugged it&apos;s just unpleasant to play. New content is terribly buggy- missing monsters, dialogue triggering out of nowhere making little sense, looping character comments, that break the game and so on.
<br>Buggy new content can be understandable though, however the whole game bugs really often now. Randomly added stats on character creation, missing dialogue, game getting stuck for no reason. It is just unpleasant to have to use the console and third party programs to fix the bugs or create work-arounds for glitches.
<br>
<br>If you are new to Baldur&apos;s Gate 2, do not buy this version. Get the original and download the resolution and widescreen mods. It might sounds hard, but the time you will spend in Enhanced Edition searching for console commands or ways to approach glitches will definitely be longer than installing the mods for the original BG2+ToB.
<br>If you are a veteran BG player, I&apos;d wait a year or so, before getting this. BG1:EE only became worth paying for after patch 1.2, which came out almost a year after release. In it&apos;s current state the game is just unpleasant.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3843967">Expand</a></span>

The game is overpriced because they are charging mostly for features that have been provided by the community for free for a decade now.. Spend 10 minutes on google and save your money.</span>

<br>The good news is the graphics are slightly improved.  Better inventory screens and paper dolls, and you can zoom in/out more.  There&apos;s also widescreen support.  Some new content, 4 NPCs come included with the PC version.
<br>
<br>The bad news: The game itself is buggy, and the new content is simply not worth the price.  This is a $25 game, and is not worth that value.  I found the game crashing periodically, which simply did not happen with the original.
<br>
<br>An example of the rather slipshod work, the import/export characters option is broken, every time I import my character, the game re-calculates the bonuses each character gets due to strength, dexterity, etc.  So if my character should start with +2 to hit, becomes +4 if I import it since the game re-does the calculations.  It becomes +8 if for some reason I need to import her again!  Unlike the original game, the Enhanced edition does not allow you to &quot;Pre-Generate&quot; characters and import them, I suspect that they knew that importing a character into an existing game was broken..
<br>
<br>The new NPCs are pretty atrocious and the dialogue that my character has been given sounds like a comedy routine.  When I was chatting with Hexxat, my character was given dialogue option A) &quot;I&quot;ll help you without question&quot; or option B) &quot;Some jerky 3-line comeback that was out of place in this game&quot; or option C) &quot;Too bad for you.  Goodbye&quot;.  Pathetic choices.  And the voice acting was amateurish for most of the new characters.
<br>
<br>Go get the GOG.com version, take some time to mod it if you want (you would have to do this anyway to the Exhanced version if you wanted tougher enemies or more challenge), and enjoy the game at a much lower price.  The GOG version is often on sale too, for 50-75% off, you can&apos;t go wrong!  And the original version is compatible with more mods, and with more custom portraits, that the enhanced is not able to use.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4043069">Expand</a></span>

Multiplayer is super buggy, lots of crashing (chapter transitions don&apos;t work in multiplayer, cutscenes crash, etc), major story events can get screwed up (certain characters may not leave the party when they&apos;re supposed to), the added Black Pits II was released in a state where they openly said on their forums that it&apos;s unstable in multiplayer and you shouldn&apos;t play it. Certain spells that worked fine in the original are completely broken (Harper&apos;s Call doesn&apos;t work at all).  They don&apos;t seem to be too concerned about fixing it either as there haven&apos;t been any patches in about 2 months.  It&apos;s rather embarrassing. I&apos;ve had way more issues on this brand new updated version than I ever had playing the original. Just get it the old one from gog and add some mods.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3875226">Expand</a></span>

<br>As to the storyline itself beamdog haven&apos;t changed it (thank god).. There are those who argue that the game should be cheaper, but considering the amount of replayability there are in this game it shouldn&apos;t be the price that holds u back.

<br>
<br>The glitchy old Infinity Engine has been overhauled by Beamdog so that it&apos;s now compatible with newer Intel chipsets. Previously, I had been unable to get the game to work on my computer despite digging through a bevvy of mods and forum-post fixes that were dated anywhere from circa 2005 to 2011. So when I heard of the Enhanced Edition I knew I would pony up whatever the asking price was regardless of what other &quot;extras&quot; they threw in.
<br>
<br>What I didn&apos;t realize was that the game would ultimately sell me on the legitimacy of its $25 price tag. Obviously with this being a decade old game and available on the cheap at GOG.com, the price tag is the enormous elephant in the room for any purchaser, and accordingly this review wouldn&apos;t be complete without a discussion on the bargain-value proposition. Are you getting your money&apos;s worth for the extra $20?
<br>
<br>In two words: hell yes.
<br>
<br>Once you see the quality and content of the new NPC&apos;s, their new personal quests, the Black Pits, the new areas, and the general overall graphic improvements (including the ability to zoom way out  praise the lord for this) you&apos;ll be sold. Not only those features, but the inclusion of altogether new classes like the Shadowdancer and Sun Soul Monk help keep the game fresh. Considering the going rate for DLC these days (as I look pensively at the $29.99 price tag for the new X-Com expansion on Steam) I can say that BG2EE is worth it.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re on a budget I would encourage anyone to pick up BG2 in any form that they can get it (well, assuming you can get the old version to work on your computer, at least). But, if you can spare the extra change, you&apos;ll be picking up the best version by a mile with BG2EE.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3804098">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I am having a blast playing this game again. It may be debatable if it is the greatest RPG ever, but it is in my mind. I feel the price is great, when I saw the game was out not once did I think &#x201C;Wow, I am not paying that much!&#x201D; I would have liked to see more refined enhancement in a few places, but it&#x2019;s still a must buy for any RPG lover and a wonderful improvement.
<br>
<br>I echo another reviewer that talked about the diehard fans that have been playing to this day with all sorts of mods and are upset by the price  If you are that hardcore about the game with mods then skip it, but the cost is cheap for those of us that don&#x2019;t want to mod the game and the hundreds of hours one could spend playing&#x2013; and beamdog&#x2019;s great forums takes input on what changes and patches people would like to see. That makes the game price seem like a real bargain to me!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3808017">Expand</a></span>

The new companions are very interesting and their storylines made me want to keep playing. The graphics are also slightly better and allow for more zooming in or out. There are also more interesting items and different class kits to spice things up. Definitely would recommend!</span>

For myself, the greater clarity, the widescreen resolution and the added content have proven very effective at revitalising this classic game. I thoroughly recommend this game to both old fans and new players alike! A special shout out to one of the new NPCs, Hexxat. A very cool story arc! Enjoy!</span>

A huge improvement over the original and the redesigned multiplayer is a huge plus, and like the first re-release of Baldurs Gate I can&apos;t wait for it to be released on the iPad so I can multiplayer across systems. I will continue to play this reminiscing for hours. Thanks beam dog </span>

How people give it a 0 because it is overpriced is truly stupid. Also compared to the priceof games today, you get one of the best games ever for 35$ cheaper than the standard 60$ price tag. Get this game and love it as much as I have!

Short sighted describes you perfectly.
<br>
<br>As for people genuinely interested in the gameplay aspects, this game is the same game, just enhanced...funny that. Widescreen, UI freshen up, new NPCs and in game content. It&apos;s not breaking any boundaries, it does exactly what the title suggests, it enhances one of the greatest RPG&apos;s of all time. One of the founding fathers of the Infinity Engine era of RPG greats. If you&apos;re an old fan, get in on it! If you&apos;re new and have always wondered what the hype was about, get in on it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3796340">Expand</a></span>

It is easier to install plus saves and loads  are much faster.  The backgrounds have been re-mastered which adds a little bit of improvement to the overall color of the image.  The sprites have not been reworked   I think one of the reviews I read had that backwards.
<br>
<br>Overall it looks a little better but it is nice because it works without any hassle and you don&apos;t have to mod the game to get it to support your setup.
<br>
<br>They have also added an expansion pack worth of new characters, items, and areas to explore (30+ new areas).
<br>
<br>Personally I am really happy to see this game get new content 15 years after it&apos;s release.  The content is up to the same standards as the original game and some of the characters they have added are more developed then the originals.
<br>
<br>Text is easier to read, small bugs that were never fixed are patched up now.  Over all it&apos;s not a huge improvement but it is a noticeably better experience and the extra content and support with possible future DLC options makes me give this a high score.  I won&apos;t be going back to the original that is for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3806237">Expand</a></span>

Along comes BG2:EE with some extra characters, zooming in/out, and TONS of bugfixes. I can&apos;t wait to see more from the Beamdog team and would happily recommend this to friends. Yes, it&apos;s 25$, but I also think of it as crowd-funding their next game, which could even be Baldur&apos;s Gate 3.</span>

<br>The game runs very well  haven&apos;t had any troubles at all after many hours of play. The new content is strong too  definitely more polished and interesting than the new content in BG1:EE.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s been many cases where I&apos;ve held up an old game in my head as wonderful and wished I could replay it, but then when given the chance it doesn&apos;t quite live up to those expectations anymore. Definitely not the case with BG2:EE....I&apos;m flat-out loving my return to that game.
<br>
<br>As a Mac user, I obviously prefer the Beamdog conversion vs. getting it from GOG.com and having to run it through Parallels. For that reason as well as the new content, I think the $25 price tag is well justified. I honestly don&apos;t get why someone would rate the game a 0 because of that. If $25 is too much, don&apos;t buy it.
<br>
<br>In short, if you loved BGII and have longed to play it again, this is a no-brainer....plus you get interesting new content.
<br>
<br>Awesome job, Beamdog.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3805480">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ve tried going back to BG2 and it looks quite primitive after experiencing BG2:EE. Once the modding community has fully wrapped it&apos;s collective head around the new version of the engine (and even now many mods are already compatible), the only reason anyone would have to play the original versions of BG2 will be pure nostalgia.
<br>
<br>The new NPCs are very interesting, I even find the story of one of them (Hexxat) to be one of the best plot twists in computer games. I like their abilities, their dialogs, their quests.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve only experienced a couple of bugs but it didn&apos;t stop me to play the game properly, they are minor and will be fixed soon.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m loving it soooooo much now:)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3800714">Expand</a></span>

<br>I feel it was well worth the cost for this game, especially as it will help promote this team to continue enhancing other titles. If you don&apos;t want the enhanced version then you can spend all your time trying to make the old game work on new systems and miss out on new content, however, that is no reason to give the game itself a bad review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3795824">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Right now, however, it&apos;s barely an 8, and that&apos;s solely due to bugs.  I can handle slightly odd behavior, but characters are falling into dialogue loops, spitting out completely out of sequence romance comments, and otherwise behaving in bizarre fashions too often to be ignored.  I waited some time to play BG:EE and had no problems, so I&apos;m confident the devs will have the issues fixed in relatively short order.  But for the game to be released in this state, I can&apos;t give it a 10 even if bug fixes were guaranteed.  So a nine it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3800795">Expand</a></span>

In the years that have passed there are few games that have rivalled the depth and involvement that  I felt when playing the original.  Although much has moved on since with improvement in nearly every area of computing and gaming, Baldurs Gate II remains a stand out title with peerless depth.
<br>
<br>Therefore I congratulate Beamdog and Overhaul Games for their labour of love bringing this (legacy) game to a new audience and making it easily available once more on modern systems and bringing it to new platforms.
<br>
<br>I have not owned a GOG version of this game (only the original), and can not comment on the patching needed to play this game, but for me to buy this game on steam for a tenner is a steal and by Easter it will probably be less than four pound.  Therefore not a lot of money then to play a hassle free version of a great game that will now have an extension on patching and support (particularly of new content).
<br>
<br>Additionally Beamdog and Overhaul Games have shown great respect for the original content by adding interesting content that does not include unbalanced NPC&apos;s and gameplay and drastically improving the (mainstream) access to multiplayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3898728">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s my third playthrough (after the first in 2000, my second in 2005 and the present one). So, since my last playthrough 9 years have passed and during that time, I have played tons of other RPGs (e.g. Dragonage, ME, Divinity, Drakensang, Witcher - just to name a few). And what do I realize in this very moment? Well, I expected that after all these &quot;modern RPGs&quot;, playing BG2 would be impossible (old graphics, static world, etc.), but JESUS CHRIST, how **** mistaken I have been!
<br>It&apos;s unbelievable, but BG2 is still a gem, even if you compare it to the newest games. In fact, it is a timeless piece of art. I simply love the graphics (the settings are so detailed and beautiful - almost as paintings that are great enough to be put on a wall...).
<br>Then, the NPCs are simply amazing: Minsc and his hamster - I do not remember a character as cool and funny in any of the following RPGs (&quot;Go for the eyes, Boo&quot;). And Aerie and Jaheira in the same group: when they fight for your attention and love, be prepared for one of the best written and most realistic dialogues in gaming history. Oh an Edwin, the most arrogant sorcerer ever - take him for an evil playthrough, it is SO well done.
<br>Besides well written NPCs and beatiful graphics, BG2 has an amazing game play and challenging fights. Gosh, the selection of arcane and divine spells is AMAZING - you basically have thousands of ways of shaping your mages and priests in a way you like it. Sorry to say, but Inquisition is a joke compared to what BG2 offered for RPG-lovers...
<br>Finally, BG2 has a great story. OK, I admit, it&apos;s no too original story, but it is still exciting and epic - and more importantly: the dialogues and all the writing is superb. Moreover, you play a huge part in this story and - more, more, more importantly - most of your quests somehow relate to the main story or add interesting side stories. It&apos;s really a complete difference to today&apos;s RPGs (e.g. Inquisition) where you have to kill 10 bears to complete a quest. In BG2 such quests do not exist - REALLY!!! I also didn&apos;t believe it at first, but now that I play it again, I value this old tradition of quest writing - how could game writing degrade so much over the past years??? It&apos;s unbelivable that a game from 2000 has set the standards in story- and dialogue-writing that almost all following games fail to meet (there are a few notable exceptions like ME1). Isn&apos;t this unbelievable?
<br>Anyway, I am going back to playing BG2 now :-) Cheers and praise to the old infinity enginge games, guys!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4782558">Expand</a></span>

<br>When i first played the game years ago i thought it was  for months, but for some reason i can&apos;t explain i stuck with it. To this day i would have never known what Role Playing Game means had i not played Baldur&apos;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn. I am giving this a 9/10 because there are some strange bugs still present in this version, but they are in no way game breaking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3803520">Expand</a></span>

I prefer to call it Baldur&apos;s Gate II: Bug Enchanced Edition. You know why? I used to play BG2 original version many years ago without any stupid game breaking bug that prevent me from further playing the game. I can say is NONE. In fact, the original game is truly a gem.
<br>
<br>At first when i heard about enhanced edition of bg2 i really looking forward to it. So i decided to give it a try. After 226 days in the game, i encounter a game breaking bug in Spellhold quest. Overhaul Games proudly introduced a new level of RPG gaming experience by forcing the player enter an eternal quest loop. Further more, overhaul Games decided to add another enjoyable special feature into the game: random CTD (crash to desktop) quest. This quest is a new quest where the game stop for god sake and the player will have to take a rest for good. Thank you Overhaul Games. During chapter 4, i&apos;m so excited when i finally get my hand on the new slayer ability(protagonist turn into a very powerful monster with +5 claw, 25 STR). After i use the ability to fight the monster and rest.... and guest what? The slayer ability button just disappeared. WOW!! This is the worst gaming experience i&apos;ve ever seen. Overhaul Games did a fantastic job by modifying a masterpiece and turn it into a rubbish. All hail to Overhaul Games!!
<br>
<br>Lets talk about the new features they introduce in the game? 4 additional party member? Are you kidding me? the original game already got so many party member available.
<br>
<br>This Baldur&apos;s Gate II: Bug Enhanced Edition proudly presented by BugOverhaul Games studio is a POS that any sane people would avoid it at all cost.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3888687">Expand</a></span>

Patience is required though, this is not a Diablo type hack and slash, its an extremely rich strategy game that rewards ideas just as much as weapons and speed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3983855">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Their is Fallout series and then Baldur&apos;s Gate... we&apos;ll now we have that great RPG series with a TON of updates.. Classes that weren&apos;t even available till later games.
<br>
<br>If only the models were redone or had an option to make them better would have been cool.</span>

The enhanced Edition for BG 1 and 2 and TOB. Nice job. Bringing out the best RPG ever, makes me feel a little boy again who spending to many hours behind my pc.
<br>I took me 12 years to finish BG II. Kinda sad huh... Lost save games, had to start all over again, computer crash, lost save games, hd to start all over again. Finally I made it. The only thing that&apos;s on the list is to finish TOB and then I can live happily further. Conclusion: No matter how long it takes, the game is worth the play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3964813">Expand</a></span>

No headaches with installing,. bugs are getting squashed all the time , works magnificently on any of my computers(whereas my disc based version requires me to set aside a day to install, mod then test usually with a reinstall or two when things go sour.)
<br>
<br>The extra characters and content are great and could easily have been regular content on original release and fixes my original issue of feeling that the character choices were a bit limited. Included are 4 extra characters, 2 evil, 1 good and 1 neutral which is a great inclusion in the good heavy characters of the game.
<br>
<br>If you are sitting with the modded BG II thinking this is pointless then I would think again. Multilayer support for instance. Being able to actually find a game without the ancient TCP settings etc, the headache of a reinstall, I&apos;ve had computers corrupt and the worst part of it all was losing BG, BG II and Icewind Dales because I knew the amount of effort I would have to put in to reinstall them and thirdly  the added content that doesn&apos;t feel like mod level of cheese adding in hundreds of uber weapons and fan made characters with terribly writing. The new content feels like it belongs very neatly and the characters are awesome.
<br>
<br>For those new to BG II, without a doubt this is your copy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4438368">Expand</a></span>

The Enhanced Edition has patched the game to near perfection and the enhanced graphics are just icing on the cake. Regular price at Steam is 19.99 and still a bargain for many hours of enjoyment.</span>

I find it well worth the investment to avoid being forced to mod in the basic functionality I would require just to run the game, and the new NPCs have added fun elements to my game (thumbs up for Hexxat).  The fixes that impress me most are the ones I never have to notice, because they have quietly taken care of them behind the scenes.  I look forward to future DLCs and enhanced editions of other titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4438335">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>While mods already does fix some of these issues it&apos;s nice to have it all in one package and not having to read up on what works with which mod, google for updates to mods etc. This is usually some hours of work when you install the game after a few years (i tend to install BG1-2 maye 4-5 years apart). Also mods have a tendency to  be abandoned (with bugs and whatnot), Beamdog shows that they are willing to continue to support the game.
<br>
<br>The new characters are really great btw, they blend in very well. Neera is wonderful and charming, love her voice!
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t listen to the haters. These are just a small, but very loud, bunch of people who havent done nothing except for playing BG1-2 and maybe Fallout for the last 15 years, still living at home in their parents basement. A rather miserable crowd for sure. This is their Qu ran, no one is allowed to change it except themselves, and god / Allah forbid someone else is doing money on it - oh the horror!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4897622">Expand</a></span>

So many areas to visit, tons of quest, characters and npcs to interact with. The areas with all the background noises and npcs really come to life, giving the whole world an immersive feeling. After playing for weeks i kept thinking surely this game cant have more? it did. I honestly spent weeks playing it, loved it and playing the enhanced editions has brought back all those memories. Im still finding little subquests and dialogue choices that i never made before that send you on more subquests. It is no doubt one of the best rpgs out  there, and beamdog have done a great job enhancing this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6243941">Expand</a></span>

<br>As for dlc, Throne of Baal:
<br>The whole story is very interesting and immersive but lack of any rest from boss fights makes this dlc tiring. Too many hard areas that require you to focus all the time, I wanted to play dlc for Shadows of Amn, not a game for hardcore crpg gamers (that I considered myself to be till now). Beside that, it&apos;s very decent piece of old style game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7328031">Expand</a></span>
