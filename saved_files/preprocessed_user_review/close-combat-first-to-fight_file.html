But I did install it, and when it rebooted my computer for me, my Windows login profile WAS DELETED! Even though my profile was gone, I tried to launch the game and it would not run. Told me it &quot;encountered an error and needed to close&quot;. I called their Tech Support hotline, which from their accents seems to be in Australia, and they told me &quot;It is just an unfortunate coincidence and there is nothing we can do. We recommend taking it to a repair shop and have it thouroughly looked at.&quot; When I asked them if they were going to foot the bill for this, they told me it was not their responsibility. I replied that it was their responsibility to develop a game that ultimately caused my computer to malfunction, so why were they not responsible for fixing it? My next question referred to a refund of the game purchase price. &quot;Take it back&quot;....... Anyone knows that opened software CANNOT be returned. 
<br>
Bottom line: Do not buy this game, and do not patronize Destineer Studios, the developer, and 2K Games, the publisher.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/close-combat-first-to-fight/user-reviews?user_review_id=55924">Expand</a></span>
