You would expect much more for a game that costs only about $15 but you will be in for disappointment so save your money and don&apos;t buy this game. This game is basically a very bad version of Contra mixed with The Walking Dead theme mixed in a combination with an even worse version of Pitfall/Prince of Persia style with short puzzles. Controls are not the best because when you try to jump over certain areas you either (A.) Over-jump or (B.) Under-jump and fall to your doom. The weapons are very limited and in the end you only get a fire axe, a .38 Revolver, and a shotgun. Konami&apos;s 1987 release of Contra had more guns than that which makes you think where the developers had gone wrong. With limited weapon choices the replay-ability of the game is poor since Nightmare mode is unlocked after completing the game in normal. Nightmare mode is only available on the PC version. Upon the limited choices the worst part is that the zombies are extremely tough to take down using the fire axe. The fastest way to kill any zombie is using either the .38 revolver or the shotgun with limited ammo. This game was rushed as you can tell because there wasn&apos;t enough testing involved. In certain parts of the games if you didn&apos;t solve the puzzle fast enough you get swarmed by the infinite zombies and it would lag your PC out so bad because there were too many zombies on the screen. I would also have to agree that the voice acting is bad or not congruent with the theme they&apos;re trying to pull off. The main character sounds more like an old school Max Payne narrating the story which doesn&apos;t really fit into the theme of a Zombie Apocalypse. Voice acting overall was terrible and unbelievable.

<br>
<br>Cons: Some of the cutscenes are lacking sound, while others have it. Probably a bug, however since it didn&apos;t directly affect the gameplay I never looked into it. Voice acting varies between cheesy and downright bad. I got really tired of &quot;The Rat&quot; referring to himself in third person. Prior to playing Deadlight, I had just finished Tomb Raider 2013, and controlling Lara was flawless which really made the horrible controls in this game stand out. The controls are so bad that your character will die repeatedly, even though you know what to do to get past the screen you are on. Then you have go back and replay a good 5-10 minutes of game just to get back to where you died. Sometimes you will die 10 times just trying to get your character to do what you want. Game is also obviously a console port, as the graphic adjustments for PC are VERY limited. Not being able to turn on Anti-Aliasing made for lots of jaggies when playing at 2560x1440.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3496826">Expand</a></span>

I love the zombie/post-apocalyptic genre and have been looking for a game that isn&apos;t an FPS. I&apos;ve been gaming for a long time  and this thing just really let me down. The graphics and atmosphere/environment are top notch. But the control scheme and &quot;puzzles&quot; are just too frustrating. There are plenty of times where it just is not clear what you are supposed to be doing, so you end up doing a bunch of trial and error as your character falls into pits/spikes or gets swarmed by zombies. It&apos;s hard to tell when zombies come from the background onto your &quot;plane&quot; so you can attack them  this is by far the most frustrating since you can&apos;t plan attacks. Just lots and lots of &quot;WTF do I do here?&quot; deaths and repeats of sections until you figure out what you are supposed to be doing. That and crappy controls for combat and fast movement really ruin it. Trying to run away from something but having to quickly get over a fence  the control scheme doesn&apos;t allow for fluid continuation, you have to execute the proper unintuitive commands... Anyway, if the Prince of Persia style platform puzzles were better executive and the control interface were better, this game could easily be a 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3054925">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is killed by a horrible control scheme that is inconsistent at best and downright unresponsive, no matter if using keyboard/mouse, gamepad, or even an Xbox 360 controller (that the game was originally designed for). For example, if you want to jump vertically (which is very necessary in parts), it is not enough to simply let go of the control stick/stop pressing movement keys. No, you have to do that AND wait for your character run/walk animation to completely halt before pressing the jump key, else you&apos;ll make a forward leap that would make a track and field star proud. Trying to climb a ledge immediately after making a sprinting leap? Better let go of the control stick completely, because if it&apos;s even a single degree toward the ground, you&apos;ll just climb down from the ledge you just jumped onto instead. It&apos;s pretty clear the development team of this game didn&apos;t do much/any testing prior to the release of their PC port, and not just due to the controls.
<br>
<br>This game is so terribly optimized for PC that even the pause menu has issues. I&apos;m running a gaming PC that I built with mid-to-top-end hardware (as of a year ago, anyway) that has no problems running current-gen games of any kind, I&apos;ve got an ASUS gaming notebook that&apos;s only 3 months old, and my girlfriend has a run-of-the-mill Toshiba laptop. After spending a combined total of 4 hours playing the game across all 3 machines, I feel like I need to call Terminix. The game crashes to desktop upon the first time running it (except, ironically, on my girlfriend&apos;s Toshiba). It&apos;ll freeze randomly after loading into a new zone. If you alt+tab or ctrl+alt+delete, the game will steal focus back unless you&apos;re quick enough to end the process before it does. You can&apos;t even pause the game without it freezing for about 30-45 seconds before the pause menu even comes up. I&apos;m also not entirely sure if the cutscenes are supposed to have audio, as there was none, but that&apos;s also the only place where subtitles appeared, despite there being plenty of spoken dialogue during actual gameplay that wasn&apos;t subtitled.
<br>
<br>Final verdict? Tequila Works, S.L. must&apos;ve been trying to live up to their name a bit too much, as it&apos;s pretty clear that they were way past the Ballmer peak when putting this game together. It&apos;s not even worth the $3.74 I paid for it during the Steam Summer Sale, and especially not the $14.99 that is normally charged. Avoid this game altogether.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3290304">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Unfortunately for me, the &quot;platform&quot; part of the game became too hard during the underground survival tutorial, where I couldn&apos;t manage to execute properly an (apparently) simple roll action to avoid blade traps on walls. It&apos;s a little sad because previously the game was really challenging  and forced me to retry many times until the rewarding &quot;eureka&quot; moment.

The gameplay however isn&apos;t all that good. The platforming works alright and the game shines when you are running away from  horde of monster in an open street. The visual design however can make it hard to tell the difference between stuff you can grab and stuff you cant which can be a bit annoying in a tight spot to say the least. The combat in the game is quite bad. The melee weapons in the game feels clunky and the firearms are annoying to control. Throw in some endlessly respawning enemies and some annoying checkpoints and you are in for a nasty treat. Some levels works better than others but the gameplay is average as best when everything works. I should also mention that the games campaign is rather short (around 3 hours). The games story and atmosphere manages to pull the score up to an average five but know that the gameplay could be improved to say the least.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2864623">Expand</a></span>

<br>However,  as the difficulty increases so does frustration. Gimmicky placement of objects and enemies keeps you on your toes as well as slamming your fist into your desk attempt after attempt after attempt. Sometimes you&apos;ll be right on the verge of a new checkpoint during a chase moment only to get to the end and have seconds to figure out how to progress.

I am giving this a 6 however for the level of unfairness involved in some of the platforming and the control scheme for mouse and keyboard.  Not having the ability to toggle crouching and sprinting make certain sections, such as crossing the roofs while being chased by the helicopter not only completely unrealistic (like I would stop sprinting in real life  having to hold down shift is moronic) and the lack of response in the controls for climbing fences which means you continually get killed by that damn helicopter only to rerun it again and again and die again and again with no effective cover and A LONG DISTANCE between checkpoints where just earlier they were only a couple of feet apart  makes finishing this game not a joy but an exercise in futility and frustration.  When and if Tequila Works makes another game I truly hope they will rethink some of this.  The art and the sound are wonderful  the game play mechanics are not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2933477">Expand</a></span>

I wouldn&apos;t call the game hard as the puzzles aren&apos;t challenging, only thing making them difficult is the limited time for a lot.

<br>Worth a look if you can get it cheap.</span>

Other than that, though, Deadlight exudes failure.  Game mechanics frequently work together to unfairly kill you.  As an example, early on in the game i was walking through waist high water and there was a zombie behind me.  The zombie started sprinting, which is a random chance occurrence, but I quickly found out that the main character can&apos;t sprint in waist high water and died.  There was nothing I could have done to live there, and I just had to reload, repeat some of the game, and hope the zombie didn&apos;t sprint this time.
<br>
<br>The games controls and mechanics are frequently hit or miss.  What&apos;s the difference between a door that has to be knocked down by kicking, with a fire axe, or by sprinting through and tackling it? Visually there&apos;s often nothing to go on, but eventually some kind of helper contextual action will let you know.  Even then, it doesn&apos;t tell you what to press, just provides some abstract image of the action; I&apos;m like 3 hours into the game and how no idea how to kick down a door; i just spam buttons until it works (they told me once, so it&apos;s partly the fault of alcohol, but w/e).  In the same vein, you&apos;ll find a number of occasions where obvious scripting kicks in so you can make a jump of a distance that you&apos;ll find impossible later, where your character will frequently refuse to reach the extra .008 inches to make the grab onto a ledge, forcing you to solve some puzzle that seems unnecessary.
<br>
<br>To top it off, zombies aren&apos;t really threatening at all.  If I had to guess I&apos;d say that 90% of my deaths were to the environment, and maybe 10% to zombies.  This is exacerbated by an extremely boring sequence in a trap ridden labyrinth where there are no zombies, just environmental hazards and trial and error gameplay.  Enjoy re-spawning 20 or 30 times until you can get back outside to the actual fun part of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2862271">Expand</a></span>

While i was impressed with the game&apos;s graphics and ominous backdrops, I was not impressed with the sluggish and extremely imprecise control the player has over Randal, the protagonist. This fact is all too evident at times where you (the player) are forced to make fast, &quot;Parkour-like&quot; actions to escape certain death. The harshest of these examples being the collapsing building that you barely (and i really do mean barely) have time to escape from before being crushed to death. To proceed beyond that point you are forced to retry countless times until you have &quot;perfected&quot; your technique. Much frustration and disappointment could have been easily avoided if grand oversights, such as the ridiculous obstacle course constructed by a hobo (not joking), the needless rooftop escape from the helicopter, or of course the collapsing building. With such a strong start to the game, I was quite disappointed when I finally made to the end and I won&apos;t be the only one. Because of decent graphics, setting, and occasional combat (although combat is NOT the focus of the game), I am forced to give this game a 2.

The gameplay at first seems fine, but the longer u get the more trial and error  puzzle it becomes.
<br>
<br>Some parts of the game feels more like a QTE than an action platformer and will have you die again and again just to repeat a section that begins with an unskippable cutscene, just to progress a bit further each time.
<br>
<br>One part was so bad that I went to check how to get through it. Turns out I did everything exactly as I should had, but I had vsync turned off, making it impossible for me to progress, so I had to go back to the main menu just to turn it off,  thereby resetting all of my progress on that level. Yes if you stop playing the game you lose ALL progress you&apos;ve made since the last loading screen.
<br>
<br>All in all it&apos;s an ok game with gorgeus graphics and design that suffers from gamebreaking bugs and trial and error events that are way harder than needed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3860966">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unfortunately this game is one of the most frustrating titles I own and for all the wrong reasons. At heart, this game is a very aesthetically pleasing 2D Puzzle Platformer. It could have been one of the best on the market if it wasn&apos;t for one thing. The jumping. Why have a platformer with jumping as bad as this? It defies all belief. It is a massive shame. He will launch himself forwards when you press jump even if you&apos;re standing perfectly still and not touching any directional button. I will give them credit for trying to implement a nice wall jump mechanic but unfortunately it only works when and if it wants to.
<br>
<br>I have also had numerous problems with the game not working properly. Pausing the game will take about 60 seconds to load and has even crashed the game before. Objectives sometimes will not show up until I&apos;ve died and tried it again. I&apos;m not entirely sure why these things happen but it is truly remarkable.
<br>
<br>These things disappoint me most because it is actually a promising game. The graphics are incredible and it is something that we&apos;ve not seen much of in the past. The story is a bit lacking but that&apos;s not usually that important in a game like this. The melee combat is dreadful but I actually found myself enjoying the shooting mechanic. It fit the style the game was going for perfectly and I wish there was more of it.
<br>
<br>The puzzles in the game are very very basic puzzles and shouldn&apos;t tax your brain too hard if you&apos;re used to this type of game. However the game does utilise the use of beginners traps which is kind of a shame. They are to platforming and jump scares are to horror games. They just feel cheap and unnecessary.
<br>
<br>Overall this game isn&apos;t the most horrible thing ever but it&apos;s such a shame that it let itself down so badly. Jumping is vital in a platformer and they failed to even get remotely close, especially in tandem with the dodgy running mechanic. This game could be worth picking up cheaply in a sale but it definitely doesn&apos;t deserve to be high on your wishlist. If ever they decide to make another game like this though, honestly look out for it. If they get it right then it will be a masterpiece.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4427730">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>-Repetitive
<br>-Controls suck, with controller or keyboard, take your pick
<br>-The combat sucks
<br>-The story and the voice acting... ugh...
<br>-Too short
<br>-Almost zero replay value
<br>-Nightmare mode is a joke
<br>
<br>Deadlight it&apos;s a game that is better to look and than play. The visuals are really engaging, and the cutscenes have that Saturday morning cartoon feel to it, and that&apos;s a nice touch.
<br>
<br>Some platform sections feel pretty solid, but some of the jumps must be super accurate -but the controls don&apos;t help at all. Both the keyboard and the controller suck at this game. And the combat sections... yeah, I get it, the focus is to escape, not to fight back, but the combat (especially the melee combat) should not be so clunky.
<br>
<br>Also, people praising the story and the characters... Is this a joke? The story is clich&#xE9;d in a bad way, and the characters feel so... bland. And the protagonist, Randall Wayne, is just a typical, stereotyped hero, that tries so hard to be deep and have cool dialogue lines, but it all just falls flat. The game tries to have some kind of commentary on human behavior, but it&apos;s more laughable than anything.
<br>
<br>And the game could have some replay value if the nightmare mode wasn&apos;t such a joke. For those who don&apos;t know, nightmare mode is the regular game without saves. If you die, you respawn from the beginning. I can see this work in a much better game, but with flawed platforming and bad controls, it will just piss you off. Oh, yeah, and it unlocks an alternative ending that makes no sense. Go figure.
<br>
<br>The collectibles are a nice touch, but they&apos;re not something that will keep you interested at the game for more than 5 minutes.
<br>
<br>Sure, it&apos;s a really cheap game, but it could have been so much more. If the platforming was a little bit more solid, and there were some more levels, this review would be really different. Even with its story being all over the place, the game would have scored much higher. But, to me, it&apos;s just a really mediocre title, barely passable, and you should only play it if it&apos;s on sale, or if you like zombies and platformers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4796706">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It lacks in a few areas: controls, writing, and loading.
<br>
<br>The controls feel loose and there are strange inconsistencies. For example when you hold down SHIFT to sprint, the character takes off at a slow lope and gets to full speed after a few steps. A problem starting out is that when you need to sprint and jump off a ledge, it looks like you don&apos;t have the speed you need. You actually do, it&apos;s just that the animation is out of sync with the physics. Fighting has dramatic pauses and a pulsing visual when the character is low on stamina. These sound great but the tricks get really old really fast.
<br>
<br>The writing is quite bad. The lines are cliche and the character has no depth to speak of. It wouldn&apos;t have taken much to create a good script for the game and I suspect it was done by game developers who fancied themselves writers. On the plus side, moving it from English to any other language would be quite easy: melodrama is a universal language.
<br>
<br>Loading: When your character falls of a ledge, or gets eaten, or suffers another grisly fate the game prompts you to hit a button. Once you do that you have to wait anywhere from a few seconds to several for the game to pull up the last auto-save. Why this design choice? If auto-saves are so common and the character is not in the middle of a scripted scene why not just place them back on the ledge? Perhaps it&apos;s an attempt to make the player feel something over the character&apos;s doom. Problem is this game suffers from same challenge to a lot of video games - how do you make players feel the death of a character when all you have to do is hit a button to revive them?
<br>
<br>I digress. Overall, if you&apos;re into side scrollers this may be picking up some day when it&apos;s on a deep discount but for $15 it just isn&apos;t worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=4987319">Expand</a></span>

The controls are floaty and often unresponsive. The collision detection is similarly spotty, with zombies regularly phasing right through your fire axe and barrels seemingly reaching out to trip you as you try to jump over them. The plot is weak and nonsensical to the point of irritation, with characters doing inexplicably stupid things for no real reason. For example, one character takes your weapons because he&apos;s not sure if he trusts you. He soon becomes an ally, but your weapons are never seen or mentioned again. Another example is a radio that the hero decides must be stopped. His solution? Hit the off switch. He has a fire axe and two guns, but rather than destroy it, he simply turns it off and walks away. I don&apos;t consider it much of a spoiler to say that, lo and behold, bad guys come along and turn it back on almost immediately. All in all, this game is an excellent example of both wasted potential and the dangers of writing a script without actual writers present.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3048629">Expand</a></span>

Deadlight is one of those games that you find irritating not because it is a complete failure, but because some of its elements were executed so well while others fall flat on their face. The 2.5D scrolling environment works well most of the time, although it&apos;s irritating that enemies approach from outside your plane and you can&apos;t attack them until they enter into it. The jump mechanic is irritating (straight up, 8 ft leap and maybe 16 foot leap with nothing in-between). Weapon switching is sloppy and slow. Many &apos;puzzles&apos; will kill you the first time you approach them, rather than presenting intriguing situations that can be solved with skills that have been encouraged to develop. Many sections involve infinitely spawning enemies, but extremely limited ammunition. Checkpoints often precede narration, meaning that if you find a section difficult, you&apos;ll be hearing the same monologue several times.

The gameplay mechanics are very simple, conventional and sometimes frustrating. I guess the game needed some more testing. The story is so basic it&apos;s almost a trope, so are the stereotypical characters. The voice acting wasn&apos;t very good, for every character. I didn&apos;t play it twice since it would bring nothing new and I know all the &quot;puzzles&quot;. As you would have guessed it is quite short too. What makes this game playable are the atmosphere and the settings which are of the same tone as The Walking Dead, which I am found of. This is amplified by the satisfying graphics the Unreal engine brings out. Although I&apos;m not sure it can run well on lower-end PCs. In conclusion, Deadlight is somewhat fun but in no way a must-play. If you like this type of game or just zombie-apocalypse then I suggest you buy it on sales on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3430430">Expand</a></span>

The puzzles are both obvious and slow making them an all-round chore.  Checkpoints are occasionally badly placed.  The game works best when you&apos;re running and jumping (the sense of movement is well done when the controls are not hampering you) or killing zombies, however the experience overall is one of frustration and I wouldn&apos;t recommend this game to anyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2880016">Expand</a></span>

The game completely glitched in rendering an area where I promptly died due to nothing being on the screen. Another time it didnt render and I fell into an abyss that wouldnt kill me, so I had to resume from the last checkpoint. There are a lot more glitches than this and its really a major turn off. The next thing is the plot and writing. They are both completely trash. The voice acting is pretty good but the characters say the most ridiculous things. The game really had potential and I which that they would have spent a little more time on the game and actually polished it a little.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2945506">Expand</a></span>

<br>But it is way to hard. You have no chance to complete riddles in one pass. You have to die several times (4 to 8 times) to understand what you have to do and to do it afterwards. The jump and run parts are also much too difficult. Mainly because the controls are imprecise and slow.
<br>What a pity. Could have been a great game. Play limbo instead.</span>

<br>
<br>The game features small puzzles which are mediocre, i.e. nothing special.
<br>
<br>The weapons of choice are a shotgun, a handgun, and a slingshot. However you don&apos;t get to use the weapons through the entire game, and the shotgun doesn&apos;t appear until very late in the game.
<br>
<br>I wish the game was a little longer, felt like i finished it in under 2 hours at most. Such a pity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3288952">Expand</a></span>

Deadlight is no Triple A title, but these two features say different. This is one of those few games that truly is an emotional experience, even for how simple this game really is. This game does have minor flaws when it comes to the melee combat system, but the platforming system works well. Aside from a view frustrating parts, its a fairly easy game. I can only say, let yourself get lost in this games atmosphere. Its dreary, saddenning, and melancholy, and it all works together with a sad story that has a sad twist you may not see coming. When I purchased this on Steam, I really had no knowledge of how this game was put together, but this game surprised me in so many ways that I can only hope Tequila Studios (Microsoft Studios published this game) goes on to produce more games of this quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2722269">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m a huge Shadow Complex fan, and simply wishing for it to come out on Steam wasn&apos;t working, so when I saw Deadlight I was hyped to have a similar experience.
<br>
<br>The graphics, atmosphere, effects, control are pretty amazing. The level design and environment could rival any top-notch platformer. The haze and atmosphere gave it a fantastic ambience. Much of the art was certainly inspired by The Walking Dead.
<br>
<br>Things that are incredibly horrible that made me think it may deserve an 8 are the following. The voice acting is absolutely garbage. The hick character pronunciated every word for instance. It was as if everyone was reading off a cue card. This is the worst voice acting I&apos;ve ever heard, and whoever is responsible should be fired.
<br>
<br>The cut scenes that weren&apos;t using the game engine were horrible as well. If the cut scenes were completely in-game engine, this game would receive a 10 (keep in mind my high score is due to the fact that I really enjoy platformers and 2D games, although this is 3D). Sometimes the game did use the game engine to tell the story, and when this happened it was awesome.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a leve called Rat Trap... and in my opinion it happens too early in the game... and it was a turn off. The level is cheap in parts and gives the impression that the remainder of the game will be a platformer miss-a-jump and you&apos;re dead. Also I found this one area that if you don&apos;t jump a spike correctly you die, after many attempts I found I had to actually walk touch the beginning of the spike then jump to avoid a trap after the jump (something that is NOT obvious, maybe I had a buggy version?).

<br>A few oddities: You can&apos;t kill zombies with an axe that you get. In the cut scene he does kill the zombie with the axe. Falling in water that clearly has a bottom about the depth of your character causes death. You can call-out in front of non-zombie enemies and they don&apos;t see you.
<br>
<br>The one part of the game that blew my mind was running from house-to-house dodging zombies and just barely making it. Game portions like this were so amazing. The levels and vastness seem endless, like when running from hordes of zombies through a town. Also you can call to zombies and have them fall off ledges. Just fun stuff. I wish I was able to get more weapons... or have the story show more characters to play... and more dealing with humans since they&apos;re more dangerous than zombies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3199832">Expand</a></span>

You get through the game by luck of the controls rather than the game. The helicopter chase scene is all but impossible as the there is no room for error and he will do silly things like move back over the fence for no apparent reason.</span>

So creators of Deadlight decided to make their own. Poor clone in zombie setting. Atmosphere is good enough. But everything else is painful waste of ideas. Voice acting is emotionless. Storyline made me say &quot;How stupid it is.&quot; every 3 to 5 minutes. Not the storyline itself, but various actions of characters. Complete absence of logic. Ok, storyline is not platformer&apos;s best friend. But gameplay is completely ruined by controls. Is very unresponsive. You have to mash buttons to achieve what you want. Very annoying during quick jump sequences. First you die several times to figure out what you need to do. But after that you continue dying because you miss a wall jump or hit crouch one millisecond earlier or later. Or you hit the button and nothing happens. One more annoying thing is &quot;Press any key to load&quot;. Why did they do that, I wonder. Like you have any other choice. Or may be there are checkpoints in the middle of zombie hoard? I&apos;ve started to play it after completing Mark of the Ninja. Better one more run through Ninja-masterpiece of platformers than Deadlight. Waste of money. Especially if you ever played Shadow Complex.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3387371">Expand</a></span>

I enjoyed using guns to dispatch zombies, although I can almost guarantee that less than half of the zombies you kill will be killed with guns. Even less with the shotgun, which is only acquired after you&apos;re more than halfway through the game.
<br>The biggest downside to this game is the level design. There are so many chase scenes that will spontaneously kill you if you don&apos;t perform all the moves that the game wants you to perform at just the right time. For example, you knock down a door to a warehouse. For some reason, that starts off a chain reaction that leads to the whole building collapsing, and the game will randomly kill you if you don&apos;t make all the right moves. Fortunately, the game is fairly forgiving with its checkpoints, but not necessarily with it&apos;s save points, if that makes sense. Whenever I quit the game and came back, I found myself much further behind where i thought I had left myself. I presumed that cutscenes would cue autosaves- this is not the case. So the game is unforgiving in how much of it you find yourself replaying over and over. Also, the story is very tripe and generic. Other than that, the game is positive; it&apos;s just far from epic. I can&apos;t think of a single person I would go out of my way to recommend this game to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3979650">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is currently on offer on steam (23/3/13) and I can not encourage you enough to give this game a try.

<br>Having read some review below I can only assume the &apos;physics&apos; and &apos;horrible controls&apos; where due to the xbox version of this title as the pc version looks and plays amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3051710">Expand</a></span>

Deadlight is a nice update to the genre with some great visuals and action.  The lighting is gorgeous and the level designs are clever and balanced well in terms of dimensionality. It has a lot of technical innovations but none of the creativity that it should pair with .  The story is tired and corny with some truly horrendous dialogue and terrible voice-acting.  It slows down the game with its adequate comicbook artwork instead of adding more gameplay.  The controls are fine but cannot be remapped and are clunky at the most inopportune moments. The game is very short and very easy.  It&apos;s all a matter of trial-and-error, repeating whatever problem-solving needed for obstacles.  I finished it in a few hours and was let down by the ending.  After finishing it unlocks the &quot;nightmare mode&quot; which makes the zombies/infected (or &quot;shadows&quot; as the game story calls it for some reason)  tougher I guess.  The replay value is nil.  Visuals are great, gameplay is fun but the game is cheesy and short.

<br>Generally, the gripes I see about Deadlight are:
<br>
<br>1) It is a basic side-scroller. Someone compared it to &quot;Contra&quot; from the NES.  True, but not so much; yes, it is a side-scroller, but the 3D depth adds great atmosphere and makes the game beautiful and immersive; the levels are well-designed; and the controls and game play are, for the most part, very smooth (except I had a little difficulty with switching directions accidentally when clinging to tops of obstacles, costing me my life on more than one occasion.
<br>
<br>Also, I would say it is more like Prince of Persia than Contra.  It&apos;s not a run-and-gun  some have complained about the lack of guns/ammo, but like any good zombie game, limited resources and how you manage them are part of the package here, and pretty nicely balanced.
<br>
<br>2) The length. True, it&apos;s only about 5 hours long (I finished in 4.5, I believe, and I was trying to explore everywhere I could and pick up all the little tokens and items), but that&apos;s 2-3x your average movie length, and far more engaging and entertaining, so when you look at it that way...
<br>
<br>3) The pricetag. Okay, I think $15 might be a little steep, and I don&apos;t know that I would be willing to spend that, considering the game reminded me a lot of Limbo, a $5 indie game (which was only a little bit shorter in length.)  But at the $2.99 I spent for it in a Steam sale, I feel like I more than got my money&apos;s worth...
<br>
<br>The graphics and atmosphere are great. The character and zombie movements and animations are smooth and fluid. The music is excellent. The attention to detail really adds that special touch, with things like the lengthy journal/backstory, the dream/flashback sequences, and even the death screen all done very well (I love the color tint  contrast-push effect on dying, for example. Very smooth.)
<br>
<br>This review would be a 9, but I have to take off one point for a glitch/bug I encountered in the game, which killed the mood and the immersion a bit: all sound/music would cut out during most of the cut-scene animations. It would be working perfectly fine, and then as soon as a cut-scene (animated comic-book style sequence) would show up, the audio would completely go mute about 70-80% of the time, then come back to normal when the cut-scene was over...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3845503">Expand</a></span>

<br>Excellent atmosphere, creepy and beautiful at the same time.
<br>Good old platforming done right with a good mix of jumping, puzzles, and combat.
<br>Clever plot devices, while tired, keep the gamer interested to see what is next.
<br>
<br>Cons: Very short.
<br>Nightmare mode  Your character doesn&apos;t respond to the controls as much as you would like in a game mode with only one life and no saves. No NG+ for speedruns and no real reason to find the collectibles.
<br>
<br>Final Judgment:
<br>A bit pricey at its original price tag for a 3 hour game that doesn&apos;t offer much in the form of replayability. It would be great at a $3-5 price tag for an afternoon, or evening of fun. Still, it has been one of the best games of 2012 from the indie developers and maybe even a top 15 of all games from that year.

If, in your **** platformer, you have to put arrows over every **** platform just so the player knows where they are, maybe your visuals could use a bit of refining.  None of the rest of my comments about this game are as complicated, the controls are **** the platforming is **** the combat is **** the ambiance would be pretty good if everything else wasn&apos;t so **** that it ruins the immersion, the story is clich&#xE9;, the voice acting is (and this is not hyperbole) quite possibly the worst I&apos;ve ever heard.  This game tries, and fails so hard, to be Limbo with zombies.

The gameplay is great and very similar - in a more modern way - and the atmosphere is just as wonderful. Definitely a worthy buy. If you read reviews of people complaining that zombies are hard to kill, it&apos;s just because they didn&apos;t understand the game. Zombies are hard to kill on purpose: you need to use your wits and the environment to dispose of them, and it&apos;s a mechanic that works perfectly, and is very forgiving (maybe even a little too much). There are also some obvious cons, mainly concerning the story, which kind of ruins the otherwise fantastic atmosphere: voice acting is quite clumsy, writing and characters are too over-the-top and stereotyped, and the finale is quite obvious since the beginning. But that said, the gameplay and graphics are so good that you won&apos;t care as long as the game goes on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2855817">Expand</a></span>

There were obvious puzzles that were difficult because of the clunky controls, but with practice they are all completable. The graphics for this style of game is also very refreshing since most are 2d instead of 3d games. Doing some scenes over and over because of redundant objectives that take a while to figure out since a mere second wasted during these events will lead to a restart. Though i really enjoyed this game, I feel is only deserves a 7/10. Reason being there are bugs, such as my character getting stuck inside cars and objects, clunky controls, and the limited amounts of game modes/ possibly co-op/zombie survival and the limited amount of weapons. In the game there are more weapons that are used by NPCs and in the environment that you cannot use which is disappointing. I also found the ending of this game to be expected, but at the same time very typical and disappointing. Another but I found to be very terrible is there is a warehouse full of unending zombie respawns. To complete this task you need to shoot a window. In order to shoot out with window there is a 1x1 pixel sized area you must hit to break it this took me an hour of restarting shooting 30+ bullets into this window to find that sweet spot. This game is VERY short, i completed this in 4 hours(1hour stuck on window bug.) Also this game is a obvious console port. With that said I will once again say I really enjoyed this game. A few problem here and there, but it is completely playable. If you enjoy zombie games or any zombie themed game. This is a must buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2863462">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Great game! Great atmosphere! I never liked 2d platform games, but this one is really well made! The graphics are amazing, so is the sound. The negatives are the weak voice acting of some characters and I wished the game had better cut scenes! But overall, a great game!</span>

<br>
<br>The BAD: Even with that small amount, this game is a ssshooorrrttt 4 hours. For the most part I play games pretty slow and try to collect and complete everything, problem is this game forces speed so it is almost impossible to stop at times. There are also missions where it feels trial and error, where the answer isn&apos;t obvious and you have to die to figure it out (especially the end). Some of the voice acting is horrible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3153846">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This is essentially a point and click game. There is certainly a side scrolling platformer aspect, but there are a couple of spots where you have to power through a broken scenario. I got to the falling debris after the helicopter crash and I&apos;m done. There is an interesting story but, after the 2nd session of ~ 15 attempts, I&apos;ve given up on this game. It&apos;s not worth it.</span>

<br>I really enjoyed not only playing it but also getting the items from every level up to 100% and watching the videos of the making of that were unlocked after you were playing.
<br>
<br>Definitely a recommended game to get and play. Pros: Story, Scenery, Puzzles, Short (yes for me is a pro), Making of
<br>Cons: Controls, Nightmare difficulty is not good.
<br>
<br>Definitely congrats to the developers!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=2870688">Expand</a></span>

The game play is catchy, moderately difficult in general but a little bit repetitive at times. Although it has some minor glitches/bugs, it seems to have a solid technical background.
<br>However, the plot of the game is not well tailored. The ending is stupid, the main character prefers to let the &#x201C;shadows&#x201D; eat him alive instead of opening a bigger hole in the ground with his axe to escape (survival instinct is everything in a zombie apocalypse!). The &#x201C;evil soldiers&#x201D; plot is an already heard script. The same happens with the &#x201C;damsel in distress&#x201D; pattern. The game depicts female characters as unable to defend themselves, begging the main character for &#x201C;piety&#x201D; when it comes to commit suicide (again, lack of survival instinct, breaks atmosphere). An unexpected gem was the &quot;hidden secret&quot; where the game explicitly blames JFK for being weak against the communists, who, provided their evil plans are not countered, are responsible for the zombie apocalypse...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3317986">Expand</a></span>

While the whole zombie Armageddon theme is getting tired, the fact that this one places it in the middle of the cold war adds a cool dimension. However there are some major flaws with this game that keep me from rating it higher.
<br>
<br>First is length and consequently value. The game is $15 although I got it on sale for $4, it&apos;s literally 4 hours long. That&apos;s pretty poor value as far as video games are concerned these days, just not enough content.
<br>
<br>Second the controls are not precise. You&apos;ll be trying to climb a fence before a zombie eats you and end up jumping into it and bouncing off by accident and dying. Or you&apos;ll be trying to jump straight up to grab a ledge but jump into a wall instead. Really poor. The combat also quite frankly sucks. Either make this a full out combat game or a full out evade zombies game. Instead it tries to mix both styles, making zombies hard to kill since there&apos;s like zero ammo in this game and they&apos;re impossible to kill with your fireaxe, but also frustrating to avoid due to the poor controls.
<br>
<br>Third the voice acting is really, really bad. I thought the story was fine, the cutscences are presented in comic book style which I thought was cool, and the writing wasn&apos;t awful, but the acting is bad. It feels like a foreign game they had to translate and dub over. The story is extremely predictable and cliche but I like zombie tales so I didn&apos;t mind.
<br>
<br>Finally my last critique is the game itself is just kind of dull. It&apos;s like old school pitfall, jump from platform to platform over a bunch of spikes and zombies, just not that interesting. It probably wasn&apos;t more than 4 hours cus they couldn&apos;t design any more unique levels.
<br>
<br>So again, tons of potential, great atmosphere and concept, poor execution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3904171">Expand</a></span>

A lot of complaints have been made there before and sadly most of them are true. But for me it&apos;s not bugs, awkward controls or bad acting which is the most disappointing thing about Deadlight. The story is.
<br>
<br>Since there&apos;s no background given, I felt a bit lost from the very beginning: who&apos;s this guy Randal? who he has just shot? who are those others? why they had to separate their paths? And then he started to talk about family. Uh? And those guys at the beginning just some friends or neighbors maybe? Too many names, too little explanations. And if you expect to get the whole picture at the end, you&apos;ll be disappointed for sure. It&apos;s getting even more ridiculous.
<br>
<br>The design team has clearly drawn inspiration from Remedy&apos;s games Max Payne and especially Alan Wake. As well as from some noticeable movies like 28 Days Later (zombie epidemic, ex-armymen luring survivors into a trap by a radio signal, etc.) and maybe even Shutter Island. These are good ingredients for sure, but it seems to me that the cook just not experienced enough to make something delicious out of them. Maybe if he has had more time...
<br>
<br>Apart from that, there&apos;s often no logic in Randal&apos;s decisions during the game. For example, The Rat takes away his possessions including an axe and a revolver. That&apos;s a very convenient excuse to make us run through several levels without being able to deal with the shadows. But seriously, the old man is right there all the time! I can&apos;t think of reasons not to take the stuff back and continue on the mission. Instead Randal decides to play madman&apos;s dangerous game and finally comes up with a realization that he has to find The Rat&apos;s son. OMG! Or take the episode after rescuing Ben. Randal needs something to patch up a wounded friend and heads to the hospital nearby. Soon he stumbles upon a medikit. But his reaction is usual: I&apos;m perfectly healthy and don&apos;t need this at the moment. Oh, really? That&apos;s frustrating.
<br>
<br>If there&apos;s a sequel I hope developers will have enough time to spend on it. &#x2018;Deadlight&#x2019; and &#x2018;deadline&#x2019; sounds similar for a reason.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3281707">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_3741573"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The atmosphere of this game is just plane awesome! The creators took a little time on creating realistic 80th zombie apocalypse settings with crazy animations and sounds. The story telling is kept in a monologue of the protagonist and done well for the most. Sometimes though it is getting to be a little pain because of repetitions and this hard voice always summing in your ears  nevertheless it has been done very well. In addition to that the &quot;climbing&quot; system is pretty neat: Sprinting long distances, throwing yourself out of a window, rolling around on the floor through obstacles, jumping and just being super trim and fast!
<br>But also the game mechanics is the point where you could curse all over and over again: Accidentally pressing &quot;E&quot; in certain situations will cause your character to kneel down without any chance to abort this so you get eaten by &quot;Shadows&quot;, aiming is hard to manage because you first have to control your characters direction (left or right) with you arrow buttons and then aim (causing death multiple times) but sometimes enemies just are behind you and you might not realize that you should have just clicked LMB to push them away, the overall neat graphics design sometimes lets you down in finding the right path ending in numerous deaths; so does the helicopter scene!
<br>This game really has potential which unfortunately is crushed by lacking realization  6/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3741573">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>While playing the game, there is an impressive sense of depth and attention to detail that manages to not feel repetitive or reused like you would expect. For example, when breaking into what used to be someone&apos;s home, it convincingly looks and feels like a home. The use of motion comics for cutscenes, which were simple but well-drawn in a style crossed between The Walking Dead and 30 Days of Night, was very effective.

<br>Unfortunately, that&#x2019;s about it in Deadlight&#x2019;s win column. The story is not bad but the dialogue often is. Your character is a former park ranger (complete with Rick Grimes hat in some flashbacks and in Nightmare mode) who is attempting to find his wife and kid after a flu outbreak turns people into flesh-eating &#x201C;shadows&#x201D;. That&#x2019;s really all you need to know, but should you want to suffer through 60 pages of overly-dramatic diary entries, it&#x2019;s an option.
<br>
<br>In short, this game doesn&#x2019;t have a great deal more to offer than how great it looks and feels, and that can be perfectly fine. Games like Hotline Miami and Limbo have shown us you can also have great games with little or no story at all. Unfortunately, Deadlight insists on trying to say a lot when all we really need it to do is be quiet and look pretty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3897749">Expand</a></span>

I have a notebook with an Intel HD 1st gen graphics so you can imagine I can&apos;t really play modern games, so I miss a lot of great looking games. But this one, even with low resolution and the lowest graphical setting, is simply gorgeous. The animations look solid, the cutscenes have a comic kind of drawing that looks quite good for the setting,the characters are greatly done.
<br>The music is solid though I cant recall a lot of times I heard it instead of focusing on the visuals or what I had to do or the voice acting, which is quite good IMO. The sound effects department is very nice as well.
<br>
<br>You have to know I&apos;m a fan of the Walking Dead  from Telltale Games, so i find the gameplay of Deadlight be quite frankly, good and refreshing. It reminds me of old games like the ones I played on Sega Genesis, and that was the developers intention so kudos for them in that sense. It has things similar to Prince of Persia or &quot;2D Assassin&apos;s Creed&quot; for younger people. Players looking for non stop frenetic action won&apos;t find this game to their tastes, even if you have access to a few weapons, the main point of the game isn&apos;t fighting the zombies but surviving them, and that usually involves running past a large horde or avoiding them somehow. Again, for what the gameplay is, I really liked it.
<br>You have a lot of collectables, secret items, and mini games to find. The main character carries a journal which has several missing pages, also collectable across the game. This journal gives you an insight to the character&apos;s past before the game, and it pretty awesome.
<br>
<br>The only thing a can honestly say I dislike is a certain achievement which requires you simply to have a friend who also ownes the game. Without that achievement you can get 100% completion. Also, the campain is somewhat short, 2-4 hours depending the player, plus repetition if you go for the unlockable Nightmare mode (the same campaing but with no checkpoints in between chapters). but, I&apos;m used to short games, besides Deadlight isn&apos;t 60 dollares but around 15, so IMHO it&apos;s a worth investment, which you will enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deadlight/user-reviews?user_review_id=3900614">Expand</a></span>

Nice game, nice graphics and sound, generally good design level (the Rat one being the worst one), nice atmosphere and story. Gameplay is generally decent beside a few useless complications (some moves could have been automatic). The lenght of the game is really short (a few hours) so I don&apos;t recommend it at more than 5, maybe 10, euros.</span>
