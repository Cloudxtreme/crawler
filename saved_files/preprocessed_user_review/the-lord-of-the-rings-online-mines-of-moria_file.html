From the incredibly slow update procedure (does Turbine use snails to power it&apos;s servers?) to the &quot;instancing&quot; of small building (yes, you have a screen freeze to just walk into The Prancing Pony Inn)... MoM continues an already weak MMORPG framework. Yes, the terrain is pretty but the expansion doesn&apos;t augment this. The new races are nice to have, but the overall combat system, player customization, and &quot;horsey-ness&quot; remain a fatal flaw. For players who are used to the sophisticated tech trees and tremendously varied dungeon challenges of WoW, this is a step backwards. Having played MoM for several months know, it&apos;s clear why there are so few players, so few servers -- and why WoW continues to steamroll LOTRO as a game: it&apos;s just sluggish implementation from install to movement inside the world. Painful at times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-online-mines-of-moria/user-reviews?user_review_id=744116">Expand</a></span>

The problem, for me, is that moria itself is bland. There are a few shining spots that are different from the norm, and that&apos;s nice, but it&apos;s not enough. Ultimately you&apos;re walking through cavernous stone halls over and over again, with not enough changes to feel like you&apos;ve been anywhere new. It just gets boring if there&apos;s no change in mobs/scenery, and doing quests is a real pain since it&apos;s difficult to navigate moria (because everything looks the same).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-online-mines-of-moria/user-reviews?user_review_id=420018">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not boring to me because the mobs and scenery definitely is different. It&apos;s fun when you get to inspect these new things and learn how to really adapt to the location and how to defeat these mobs. Moria is definitely a pain to navigate though, but that&apos;s what makes a mine, a &quot;Mine&quot;. (Plus, you get a goat when you finally reach the reputation needed to purchase one). Moria deserves a 9 for an absolutely great work and launch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-online-mines-of-moria/user-reviews?user_review_id=421213">Expand</a></span>

I have played many games over 25 years of computer gaming but I have never had a game hold my interest like Lotro and the expansion Mines of Moria. To me a good MMO should be more than questing or ultimate treasure seeking. It should captivate me by making me be part of a compelling story, challenge me to make careful tactical and strategic decisions, awe me with its graphics, and leave me inspired to play more. Mines of Moria is a beautiful additional to that already inspiring game. The ability to level and modify legendary weapons and the new level caps with the new skills are rewards enough to but this game if you enjoyed the first installment of Lotro. There is also a new tier to crafting and crafting guilds for reputation so unique items can be more easily be made. If you are new to the game you will enjoy the environments and storyline which will make you feel part of Tolkien&apos;s universe. Mines of Moria also inherits a strong, helpful community. I can&apos;t wait to retire my rift armour and don my new armour set to do battle in the new 12 man watcher raid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-online-mines-of-moria/user-reviews?user_review_id=420237">Expand</a></span>

This game is incredible, great graphics, good sound, immersive storyline, no-grind and fun quests. More casual MMO than WoW. The community is great so far, very mature and helpfull. Any LotR fan should give it a try at least!</span>

The different zone of Moria change in just th right ways as you move through it. Youre going through mines and just when you think youre bored, you find a little black cave with some fungua and crystal lights, when you get through this you end up in a dwarven building and when you come out the other side, youre behind a waterfall in the waterworks! Half the fun is exploring Also legendary items and class sets allow you to further specialize your class. You will forge in the mines your own weapon which you can name and improve over time. The two new classes are interesting and add very different gameplay styles to the game. All in all this is a GREAT expansion to an already good game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-lord-of-the-rings-online-mines-of-moria/user-reviews?user_review_id=420692">Expand</a></span>

For a first expansion Turbine hit the ground running, with a smooth launch, wonderful quests ( and engaging). They made a very lore heavy/friendly recreation from Tolkien&apos;s books, but I already expected that much.</span>

There are 3 tiers to this game F2P - get the fewest perks and over all will most likely be looking for a new game in a few months. Premium players - get a few more perks but only by purchasing some turbine points
<br>Pay to play players - get the most perks how ever they still need to purchase expansions.
<br>
<br>So you may be thinking to your self Why should I even try yo play this game? First off the story line is very good and well worth going through. All the epic quests that take you through the game is open to all players, side quests are the ones you may have to purchase. While you play you can gain Turbine points that allow you to purchase stuff from the store such as quests that you may want to get however this is a very long and drawn out process.
<br>
<br>The graphics are very good and can be very stunning. Over all this game is great for players that do not mind grinding.

The quests and deeds are mixed with rewards (turbine points, title , traits)  that probably gives excitement to the playing experience because there is a lot to achieve here an its very rewarding that you finished them. Another thing is that the game engine used here is very flexible that even my old dual core laptop with onboard gpu can run this game and at the same time my gaming pc fully utilizes the full graphic quality of this game.

<br>
<br>The quests are so much better here than they are in the base game, the team at Turbine have certainly learnt from their mistakes there, the PvM is classed as some of the best in LOTROs history and the same can be said for the PvE which is further improved with AI changes.
