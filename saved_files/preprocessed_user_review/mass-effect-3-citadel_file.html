First part plays out as a combat mission similar to Omega, though much better for a variety of reasons. The story of that part is rather odd (but I certainly wouldn&apos;t call it predictable), but I like it because the moral its telling is very fitting. However, after finishing the well done mission section, you have a secondary, more relaxed &quot;party&quot; element which can take just as long (if not longer), which allows you to spend meaningful time with all surviving members of your squad (and even some of those who haven&apos;t survived). This part is surprisingly fleshed out and a helluva lot of fun, especially given it takes place in a single apartment. What made ME2 so great was its focus on your squad, and this DLC delivers what ME3 was sorely lacking. You come away from this DLC feeling melancholy, but satisfied. The last line in particular was very moving, because it really folds up the entire trilogy as a whole.
<br>I was one of those who was sorely disappointed with ME3&apos;s ending and not entirely satisfied with the Extended Cut, but for a final DLC, this doesn&apos;t disappointed. This is easy ME3&apos;s best DLC and worth every penny to a Mass Effect fan. Even if you feel like you want to boycott EA, I would consider this. Unlike Omega or Leviathan, you really can&apos;t get everything out of this DLC without playing as your own Shepard.
<br>
<br>Enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=2991322">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a $15 dollar &quot;fan service&quot; pack catered to people who have stuck with the franchise from the beginning. It contains a cliched &quot;mission&quot; where you have to fight your clone (yawn) which merely exists in order to provide a combat mission in which most of the fan favorites participate simultaneously. However, that &quot;mission&quot; only makes up a third of the entire pack. The other two-thirds involves Shepard throwing a party, talking to all the characters four or five times, and playing poorly designed minigames at the &quot;arcade&quot; and &quot;casino&quot;. While there&apos;s legitimate moments of laughter (drunk Grunt and Tali, embarrassed Traynor, Kasumi caught going through Shepard&apos;s underwear, Wrex declaring Joker a &quot;man emergency&quot;), it ultimately feels contrived and pushed out as a cash grab. The last 5 minutes are fairly poignant in terms of the overall Mass Effect 3 storyline, yet it ripped open an old wound namely the fact that the game&apos;s ending, even with the added &quot;Extended Cut&quot;, is outright terrible and the franchise, despite being great for over half a decade, will likely always be remembered for dropping the ball when it mattered most. Although I&apos;m the target demographic for this fan service (played all the games, read all the books, have an N7 hoodie and replica Normandy model, et cetera), I walked away from it shaking my head. Fan service that reads like forum fan fiction is the best BioWare can do these days? It sounds silly but I was both saddened and angry as I reached the end of this latest installment. Saddened because it&apos;s the last time we&apos;ll see this cast of characters ever again (this was  the last single player, story driven, DLC for the game) and angry because they deserved better, both in terms of this DLC and how the entire franchise ended. Since the vast majority of this DLC is simply standing around listening to your crew, my advice is to go to YouTube and search for a video playthrough that is close to your own game experiences. You&apos;ll see everything you would be &quot;playing&quot;, hear the same humor, and save yourself $15 (and as an added bonus, deprive EA of money).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3028116">Expand</a></span>

In the DLC you have too many memes for humor in it, it is as if the writers ran out of ideas of what to do to make the players of the DLC laugh in a intelligent manor. Much like  mass effect 3 the core gameplay is a cover shooter, which is boring to say the least although game play is never one of my main concerns.  I had many questions concerning it as well, such as where is C-SEC in this entire DLC, and why is Shepard going the moronic route of going a vigilante path? Brooks was to obvious from the beginning as a double agent, if you believed her any bit to be alliance you deserved to be back-stabbed. Then there was the poor introduction of Wrex  into this DLC. Why would he be arguing about expansion on the ward section or even at all in a time of war? You got the bad advertising for the N7 clothes before that as well, as if they are trying to find some excuse for you to buy their products that are not their games.The clone was overall a bad idea since if Cerberus was to create this why would they just leave him to die instead of using him as to make the people of the galaxy not trust Shepard? Then we got the party which is more like bad fan service as the party consists of memes and bad jokes all around. Overall a customer&apos;s money would be better used saved for something else that he or she was waiting for. So a final verdict of the DLC 4.5/10 a below average piece of work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3174009">Expand</a></span>

Its story look a little bit like parody to me, but still. The Armax Arena is a great idea for me, because it allows player to &quot;taste&quot; multiplayer gaming. It&apos;s very similar, so.  it has some funny quotes, older characters and enemies (Arena)...

The new storyline was short and a bit strange (not really a bad thing) but it was not the main focus of this DLC. Also the soundtrack was really awesome  everything from club music to piano tracks. Voice acting is even better than before (and I didn&apos;t think it could get any better)  especially during the party. I really liked the fact that there was so much humor. Because of this people also shouldn&apos;t take this DLC too seriously  ME3 had a really dark storyline so this brings something fresh and new. Of course it may seem stupid that the Galaxy is burning and everyone is chilling out, but I think that is realistic &apos;cause anyone would go insane without any rest from the events that are happening in ME3. Maybe it is a bit like the Mass Effect version of Sims, but it was the perfect way to end this trilogy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3006773">Expand</a></span>

The humor was fantastic, the comments of my team on the missions was fantastic. The party was totally funny. One of the best parts was the story twist of my arch nemesis and Wrex and Grunt on my party. :D</span>

<br>
<br>The &quot;mission&quot; this game adds does not have the deepest of plot; it&apos;s nothing like Omega and Leviathan. And, yes, it&apos;s cheesy as hell. But it&apos;s *fun* cheesy. Remember those times in Mass Effect 2 where Garrus or some other squad member would say something, and then you&apos;d start laughing? The DLC is basically all those kind of moments squished together and rolled out non-stop.
<br>
<br>The fanservice on the DLC is amazing. I was a fan of Wrex, so extra-great for me, but after the main mission ends  which is all lovely and meta  pretty much every squadmate returns. You have a party, and that&apos;s pretty fun. But my main enjoyment lay in inviting them all individually to your apartment or speaking to them in a conversation out in the post-mission area.
<br>
<br>Personally, on the issue of when to play this DLC? If you&apos;re like me, you&apos;ve put down ME3 for a few weeks now, beaten in, and just loaded up your pre-Cerberus HQ and final mission save. That&apos;s a great place to play it, at least for me. Listen, I know some people are still aggravating because of the ending; that&apos;s understandable. But, this should be viewed as separate to that. Citadel&apos;s not another new chapter of ME3 so much as... sort of like that rare 100th anniversary of Christmas special that&apos;s actually good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3004477">Expand</a></span>

One particular scene had me laughing out loud last night in that it poked fun at the gameplay itself but worked in the moment.
<br>
<br>The enemies are new and require specific skills to handle effectively, and the action elements are handled well, it is the idea that you will share the adventure with most of the &quot;friends&quot; who have joined you over the span of 3 long games that makes this worth playing. The post-modern, self referential, light-hearted aspects may not fit into the main game&apos;s story arc as well as the other DLC for this series, but it feels like more of a fond farewell to companions the player has come to know and care for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3040008">Expand</a></span>

After the depressing, deflating ending of the entire series Bioware vehemently defended ME3 as completely intentional, explaining to fans how they wanted a &quot;dark&quot; feel to the whole trilogy. They then jam this piece of self-congratulatory crap in the middle of that story. Similar to how they originally claimed they intended for Shepard NOT to be a homosexual option in the first Mass Effect in order to duck questions why it wasn&apos;t included (http://www.bit-tech.net/news/gaming/2010/02/08/bioware-shepherd-is-heterosexual-by-choice/1), they then spring that option out of the blue in the third installment. Well, which way do they want to spin things this time? They wanted Mass Effect 3 to be dark, but the final DLC should have been sold with a laugh-track. Shepard decides to throw a party in his disgustingly high-end apartment sometime between his long, dark dreams about the slaughter of his home planet (and by that point the rest of the galaxy) and worrying about refugees on the Citadel having a terrible plight. But wait, if you hold off long enough you can do this right before confronting one of the most nonsensical computers in story-telling history and getting FREE multi-tint picture endings that don&apos;t talk about Shepard at all! This company thinks people pay no attention and don&apos;t mind how incongruous a story is. They want to sell content, not tell a good story. There is no more integrity to be found with their statements or their products. Ironically enough, if an ending that actually showed Shepard defeating the reapers and surviving existed, this content would have made perfect sense afterward (minus a few flaws I thought existed with how various characters acted within this DLC). There would likely be plenty of fans left around to purchase it, too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3106449">Expand</a></span>

Leviathan, even better, clearly NOT worth $10. But Citadel was different. Perhaps it helps that I am playing the game through for the first time, and am completely ignorant of this ending that seems to have everyone so cheesed off...but I really, thoroughly enjoyed the hell out of my self with this DLC. Was it fan-servicey? Absolutely, and that is the point. This was fan service in the great tradition of franchises like Farscape and especially Stargate SG-1; Citadel came off as a &quot;100th episode special&quot; written by Joss Whedon, where the writers are allowed to let their hair down and have fun with the characters. The banter was quick and witty, everyone gets some amazing lines (although Shepherd takes the cake) and even the &quot;Big Bad Boss&quot; was a highly amusing take on a classic sci-fi trope (although it made sense on the surface). With riffs on everything from &quot;Oceans 11&quot; to &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, Citadel may make the humorless player angry, but those of us who have fallen in love with this cast of characters and want one last time to really interact with them in a casual &quot;fun&quot; setting, before getting back to the gritty darkness of the Galactic War should rush out and buy this immediately.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3004566">Expand</a></span>

I get that the goal was to give us something different, but in this case, &quot;different&quot; means taking away your weapons and preferred squadmates, and that&apos;s a dick move, plain and simple (protip: when Wrex shows up randomly and starts kicking ass, be sure to pause and level him up, because the game doesn&apos;t do that). The biggest problem, however, is the cringeworthy humor. Not only is it corny in itself, it absolutely does not fit the tone of the game. The Reapers are attacking, everyone is dying, huge sacrifices had to be made, but suddenly there&apos;s this forced shore leave and everyone starts cracking one-liners. It&apos;s positively offensive. It would have made more sense as a separate story (like FC3: Blood Dragon), but plugging into the main game right after the events of Tuchanka, it&apos;s inexcusable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3169419">Expand</a></span>

Hearing that this was the closure DLC to the Shepard storyline I was pumped and going. And as I cruised through this I felt right at home all the time. Spending some time with everyone of the crew members was amazing because of the obvious effort seen in the dialogue. When spending your first night at your *SPOILERS!* new apartment and hearing all of Captain Andersons logs you couldn&#xB4;t help but smile and get all emotionaly full. And of course hearing the crew interact with each other between missions (especially the last one) was awesome and sometimes hilarious. Speaking of hilarious this DLC is surprisingly packed with funny moments including most times character dialogue. (Look up for pizza scene and especially the thing with the hamster buddy almost at the end haha)
<br>Next the story: at first it seemed like a generic Shepard adventure, somebody sends some hitmen to kill this dude and he and his crew have to figure out who. But when they show who the evil guy is you start to get more into this story and actually think of how it will turn out and resolve itself! Including an amazing James Bondy casino level the levels in this game a sometimes surprising and totally cool. A highlight is the final battle which includes all of your team members at one point and an awesome finale scenery. Not to mention a nice partnership message that the end scene delivers. :D
<br>So in the end this DLC is a fine crafted end to the Shepard lore and a fun time to get to know the characters better and to give you a chance to see their chill comical side. I give it a 9 outta 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3427480">Expand</a></span>

Mass Effect 3, in my opinion, was plagued with the constant feeling of doubt and dread but this DLC brings another side to the Mass effect series that we haven&apos;t really seen in quite some time: Joviality and Relaxation, even if cleverly portrayed as having this air of apprehension and guilt at what their doing. It contains some of the best lines heard by any of the characters in some time and brings back old classics that didn&apos;t have much screen-time in the main campaign. It is sad to think that this was missing in the main game as it really does add to the game in a way that&apos;s different, rather than just adding more of the same as seen in other DLC&apos;s such as Omega.    If you take your time out to get every scrap of lore, dialogue and witty line, as well as taking time out to do the side activities with crew members and minigames alike, this could stretch out past 5 hours like it did for me. This DLC will make you laugh certainly, but I can say it will put you close to tears at times too. A rollercoaster of a DLC that is well worth the money in comparison to its fellow DLCs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3013981">Expand</a></span>

It took me about 5-6 hours (definitely not 2 hours) to complete  not skipping anything (because this DLC is mainly about dialogues and interactions with characters and the new story is just a small part). I will admit that the new story was a bit odd, but it was still really enjoyable. And as I said it is not the main point of this DLC. Also I really liked the fact that it served as a comic relief to the dark ME3 storyline. All in all, if people didn&apos;t relate to the characters of the franchise then this DLC is definitely not for them (and to be blunt  Mass Effect itself is not for them). In my opinion this DLC is a perfect finale to the Mass Effect trilogy that provides real closure for all the characters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=2999477">Expand</a></span>

I particularly liked the combat simulation. Very funny. The story of the DLC? Entertaining, very entertaining. As I said before, a little usually comic style. The dialogues and situations are the most fun. the saga. Special mention to hesitate with the famous &quot;I Should Go&quot; Shepard says at the end of many conversations. I laughed a lot with that. There are a whole host of tributes and references to the whole saga. Just do not expect a deep plot affects the main plot style leviathan or anything. It has nothing to do with the principal. I would consider it a mini spinn-off. Also tell them that there is a pretty big sorpres&#xF3;n. Now the important thing is it worth it for the  15 worth? If you are a big fan and I loved the series as is my case worth. Two glasses you&apos;ll need to save but I assure you will not regret. History more entertaining and humorous situations more innovative extras that I keep quiet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=2998473">Expand</a></span>

Minigames and Combat Simulator are enjoyable add-ons. The party is a nice touch and the locations are great. This is by far the best DLC of ME3.</span>

But there was something out there, something called the Indoctrination Theory...  It was brilliant, awesome and I hoped...  I hoped even more when Bioware refused to confirm or deny it...  I though the fact spoke from themselved...  My hopes got even  higher when in the Leviathan DLC, Sheppard mentionned a curious headache at the end of the DLC.  I was wrong...  It was all false hopes and delusion (unless it was the plan and EA didn&apos;t want to put the money to go on this way...  I wished they had deny it from the start, I wouldn&apos;t feel like a fool today.  And I am very pissed off about EA, or Bioware call it as you wish it is the same thing now.
<br>
<br>Then why am I rating this DLC so high?  Because it was simply fun to play, fun to interact whit those characters I love sooo much, fun to play whit something that does not have anything to do whit all this  about the ending...  It gave me hope about mass effect 4...  Like in real life, sometime you don&apos;t have a thing to say about how things end...  And even though the fight was finally about something as stupid as a circular logic bull**** about AI versus Organics, we deffeated the enemy, and life goes on (exept for sheppard).
<br>
<br>I am done hating about what we certainely should have got, and I still think what we got overall was awesome, all about you and your team and some kick ass universe...  My score is 9 because my hate for the ending should not impact my judgment, and it is so much better than omega who deserved an average 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3015330">Expand</a></span>

I wished for a quick exit the whole time, but if you want to continue the real game, you have to play through the complete DLC. What a waste of time  I seriously regret I bought this crap. If you haven&apos;t yet, don&apos;t. Just don&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3453172">Expand</a></span>

The story part of DLC is maybe short but it is very nice parody. The main part of this DLC is part with team mates and party. Esp. Grunt and Miranda have really great scenes.</span>

But if you arent, dont bother buying it, just classic ME3 experience with epic fun. Overally, its one of the better DLCs for games.</span>

                                        <span>This was so fun that I started to laugh out loud at times. Imagine, I was playing at 2 am  The amount of humor was welcome and also the &quot;care&quot; you show to your squad was perfect. At times I changed from laughing to almost crying, as it was a &quot;good bye&quot; to the squad.
<br>The party idea is very good. I would like to see it in other titles also.
<br>Thank you, Bioware!</span>

<br>Es un DLC bastante simp&#xE1;tico y al que se le pueden sacar horas de entretenimiento si se aprovechan todas sus caracter&#xED;sticas, adem&#xE1;s de que permite interactuar un poco m&#xE1;s con todos los miembros del grupo (y de los grupos de los juegos anteriores, si a&#xFA;n viven) y ofrece algunas nuevas perspectivas sobre ellos. Adem&#xE1;s, tiene bastantes referencias y di&#xE1;logos divertidos que permiten que el jugador se olvide un rato del tema de la invasi&#xF3;n segadora (que, aunque es l&#xF3;gicamente el tema principal del juego y pr&#xE1;cticamente de toda la saga, lo cierto es que acaba cansando un poco).
<br>
<br>En definitiva, le doy un 8 de nota (he puesto un 10 para compensar un poco la mala leche de algunos).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4034384">Expand</a></span>

This is 100% fan service, so if you&apos;re lukewarm to the series you may not find it as satisfying as I did, but there&apos;s still plenty to enjoy. It ties up some lose ends, explains others in more depth.  After 5 years you really felt an attachment to these characters, and it was interesting to see them outside of their combat roles. Citadel augments the ending to the Mass Effect trilogy very well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3854471">Expand</a></span>

Do NOT buy it if you&apos;re not one. That being sad, Citadel is one of the best parts of the series, and a testament of how we came to love the characters and the ME galaxy.
<br>It consists of two &quot;halfs&quot;: the mission, in which you fight a new threat (and different kinds of enemies too); and the conversations. The action goes as you expect, as does the conversations. The twist is that everybody is actually having fun, and enjoying their time together. The first time you fight with all your squadmates in the same room is a moment you&apos;ll never forget. You will have a warm felling when you see Wrex and Tali and Garrus and everyone mock their enemies, or make jokes about the way Shepard talks. The conversations are also great, with new moments with your love interest, funny situations with some of your friends, and a big party where every single character (alive) from the entire series will atend to.
<br>But there is some flaws. Some of the conversations are not as memorable as others. Also, the level design is not great, and the enemies behave fairly equal to the ones in the main game. Nevertheless, the wrongs should not bother you during the playthrough. There also a lot of jokes  A LOT), but I believe this was intentional, not sloppy writing.
<br>You can see that there was more love and care put into this DLC than in the entire ME3. Every detail, every little piece of dialogue, is about these characters and the travels we made, about honoring the dozens of hours we put on each game. It&apos;s Bioware saying &quot;Don&apos;t forget about this journey&quot;. I for sure won&apos;t.
<br>This is the real ending to the ME series, it&apos;s a last goodbye to all the friends we made along the way. It offers everything a fan would want, from great combat, unforgettable dialogue, and even an awesome moment with Garrus (come on, everyone loves Garrus!!!). If you care even a little bit about the ME universe and all its characters, you owe to yourself to play this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=3901308">Expand</a></span>

Or perhaps the entire series. In fact it could be the best dlc I&apos;ve ever played in while (lair of the shadow broker, Mario kart 8 pack 2 and broken steel for fallout 3 are close to the list as well)
<br>
<br>But why is it the best dlc? Because for mass effect fans I would say it&apos;s the true ending to the entire series. Or the final goodbye as I would call it. Bioware has done very well with the missions, the story, and the extra content for this dlc. It brings everyone from mass effect 1-3 for a huge party thus you can talk to them. Have a few laughs and enjoy what the dlc has to offer.
<br>
<br>The dlc starts itself off with a small 2 hour or so mission of your clone taking over your identity and taking everything away from you. It&apos;s a lame story... I&apos;m not gonna lie. but sparing you the details of the mission, Probably the best parts are the dialogue within the mission are from all of your team from the Normandy. The cheesy lines are cringing at a few times but there are sometimes where the lines are funny as hell. (Especially after you meet the clone and everyone is trash talking the mercenaries and your clone as you are fighting and shepard complaining how he should say &quot;I should go&quot;.) but I do understand why people gave this dlc a bad review. (Mostly because of the story) although the the story was enjoyable and interesting on my part. The story doesn&apos;t take up the entire mission which makes for at least a 1/3 of the dlc and plus wrex is the only temporary squadmate that actually joins you on this mission.
<br>
<br>The extra stuff after the mission is the best Part about the dlc. You are getting really for the party but before grabbing the party stuff from the store you can explore the wards, go to a combat sim and just hang out with your teammates. And after all that to top it all off. You get a huge party (like the parties you would get in prom night) and that party moment is probably the best moment of all the mass effect series.
<br>
<br>So should you get this 15$ dlc? Hell yes! It is much better than the other 15$ dlc (omega was awful) and better than leviathan. So overall, anyone who is a big fan of mass effect should get this dlc. It is a nice way to end the series and I&apos;ve enjoyed every moment from it. If you like cheesy lines then every single bit of this dlc will make you laugh and have a great time playing the mission and the party as well. But if you hate cheesy lines... Then plow through the missions. Try to finish the story ASAP. And enjoy the rest of the citadel dlc. Trust me... This is worth playing, it really is such a shame that this isn&apos;t on the wii u version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=5338667">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Original et tr&#xE8;s bien men&#xE9;, ce DLC-hommage est souvent tr&#xE8;s dr&#xF4;le mais aussi &#xE9;mouvant. Je l&apos;ai trouv&#xE9; en fait meilleur que la premi&#xE8;re fois sur 360 (cette f&#xEA;te est si parfaitement r&#xE9;alis&#xE9;e et si diff&#xE9;rente selon les personnages que l&apos;on a pr&#xE9;serv&#xE9;s... ou pas ! c&apos;est du g&#xE9;nie).
<br>
<br>A noter que la version PC ne souffre pas des quelques hoquets dans la fluidit&#xE9; qui affectaient la version Xbox 360, la faute &#xE0; un environnement plus charg&#xE9; que d&apos;habitude (sp&#xE9;cifique &#xE0; Citadelle) et d&#xE9;cid&#xE9;ment magnifique. Pas de support manette h&#xE9;las, mais avec Bioware on commence &#xE0; &#xEA;tre habitu&#xE9;s. Nonobstant, si les DLC sont chers en g&#xE9;n&#xE9;ral, celui-ci m&#xE9;rite amplement son prix, superbe travail.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=7233047">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Story
<br>The story arc in mass effect citadel is quite out there, to say the least. However that doesn&#x2019;t make it not enjoyable, it simply creates an atmosphere that gives your more than what you expected. As the story arc begins you are given an email on shore leave. All good, however not everything appears as it seems as you are invited to a restaurant for some good ol&#x2019; yum yum time. However something happens and once again its Commander Shepard to take solve it.
<br>
<br>Apart from that, the story is in itself rather hollow in some parts while becoming puddle deep in others. You can&#x2019;t help but to feel slightly disconnected from the game&apos;s, atmosphere for a moment while playing the DLC. Getting no sense at all that you&#x2019;re in fact at war.
<br>
<br>Features.
<br>So to be absolutely blunt here, we get &#x201C;housing customization&#x201D; that frankly is as hollow as it can be, no doubt this was done simply because they had spare time on their hands at the time or rather couldn&#x2019;t decide what the apartment was ideally supposed to look like. Making more to be wished, but an appetizer for what could become.
<br>
<br>What I enjoy feature wise of this DLC was in fact that we got a few interesting fun side games. From Casino games, to more arcade ones, while you can&#x2019;t help to say &#x201C;hell yeah!&#x201D; to the arena games which in all honestly are simple but fun. As well as a great way to test out new equipment and possible builds if you&apos;re into that sort of thing.
<br>
<br>Impact
<br>The impact this dlc gives you is that of companion comradery, everything leads to a good ol&#x2019; party with drinking and possible dancing. Where you play as host, it&apos;s a fun little way of showing a more human side of each companion as they relax in a group like setting.
<br>
<br>So the strengths are simple, companion sided dlc worth it if you&#x2019;re into getting to enjoy more time with your fellow mates. If you&#x2019;re however into the more shoot shoot bang bang side of things, this one might be a miss, unless you&#x2019;re into the equipment testing as I mentioned before.
<br>
<br>Overall rating of this DLC would be a generous 7.
<br>Above average dlc, giving you fun enough features and a story to go with it. A good dlc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-citadel/user-reviews?user_review_id=7291864">Expand</a></span>
