<br>
<br>&quot;I wish this DLC was better, longer, harder, or at least $5 cheaper, but none of those are true.&quot;
<br>
<br>Dark Souls III is pretty darn fun. At least half the bosses are interesting, a few enemy designs are, the lore is deeper than ever, and the PvP is still pretty garbage. Well, at least it&apos;s not Dark Souls II garbage.
<br>
<br>Ashes of Ariandel is plagued by a lack of playability. You go to the place, you do one thing, go across a bridge, talk to an albino chick, break the bridge, drop down, kill a boss, go around, kill a different mini-boss, go further, talk to some weird suicidal bald birds, go further, talk to an albino chick who says some weird stuff, go further, fight big things that have dumb hitboxes, go further, go down, turn a crank, go back to start, final boss with 3 health bars.
<br>
<br>Sure it&apos;s cool and all, but that took me around 3 hours to get through. There are about 9 new enemies but they&apos;re just kind of rehashes of what you&apos;ve seen before.
<br>
<br>Speaking of what you&apos;ve seen before, I&apos;ve already played through Irithyll, Ariamis in Dark Souls 1, and Eleum Loyce in Dark Souls 2. Hey look, an icy cold place that&apos;s full of snow! An occasional bloody pustule doesn&apos;t really change the scenery that much. I love the candle-tree enemies, but once you kill two of them, the mystery is over. Nothing&apos;s all that new in the DLC after the first few minutes.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s still got the awful Dark Souls III level design; they didn&apos;t dare try and shake it off. Hey look, item! Ambush. Hey look, an isolated unmoving enemy! Ambush. Hey look, a path that looks like a shortcut, but drops down so you can&apos;t run back! Ambush. Whoa, some corpses over there that are definitely not alive! Ambush. It gets SO old, SO friggin fast, just like it did in the main game.
<br>
<br>The peak fun is at the end of the DLC. You fight an actually difficult Fluffy Tail, but without no tail, so that&apos;s how you know she means business. She gets stunlocked fairly easily, so with a Black Knight Straight Sword +5 and 40 strength, I could get about 1500 damage in before having to back off, dodge, or heal. In other words, this boss is &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; easy and you can beat her as long as you don&apos;t use your toes to play. Then Scarecrow pulls himself off of his chair-crucifix and revives his daughter by lighting her on fire. What?
<br>
<br>This is where it gets interesting. You now have to micro-manage Fluffy Tail sending constant streams of Frostbite at you, while attacking Scarecrow, while rolling through his attacks, while attempting to avoid the trail of Frostbite he leaves behind himself. This is a poor man&apos;s Ornstein and Smough. Cool, but loses its luster after a few failed attempts. Strangely enough the fire in the arena never burns you.
<br>
<br>You slay Scarecrow even if you spend the whole fight wailing on Fluffy Tail. He dies but revives her again by lighting her on fire-- this time with BLACK fire. And as we all know, the Amaterasu is the most powerful Dark Souls pyromancy there is.
<br>
<br>This is probably one of my favorite boss fights in the entire game, probably due to its clear difficulty cap. It&apos;s a fight straight out of Bloodborne. You&apos;re no longer micro-managing or backing off in order to heal or re-buff. You smash, stab, and slash until you run out of stamina, panic-roll until you have a few inches, roll under an attack, heal, and then resume your flurry of blows until one of you is dead. I found myself legitimately respecting a fictional character for her sheer skill and furiosity displayed in battle.
<br>
<br>Then you see a guy pretending to be asleep inside of an old snake Halloween costume he hastily put on at the last second, and warp back to the Cathedral. Albino&apos;s chilling there now, talking about finishing a painting for other weird people. The End.
<br>
<br>To reveiw:
<br>Pros:
<br>- final fight is super challenging and great
<br>- some gear is cool and interesting to find
<br>- more lore than you can shake your White Birch stick at
<br>- Waifu Souls
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- same old Dark Souls III level design
<br>- only a few hours
<br>- very bland overall, little replayability
<br>- very forgettable landscape, setting, and enemies
<br>- out of 3 bosses, only 2 are actual bosses, and only 1 fight is challenging
<br>- $15, it should cost $10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-iii-ashes-of-ariandel/user-reviews?user_review_id=6777290">Expand</a></span>

The only real good thing about this DLC is that it has a PvP arena and a dozen cool new weapons so if you like the PvP (which you most likely don&apos;t cause&apos; it&apos;s still pretty bad) then this might be worth the price.
<br>As a whole though, Ashes of Ariandel is pathetic.

<br>
<br>There are some cool new enemies and weapons but nothing can really top your current equipment if you have already finished the game.
<br>
<br>The bosses are good. Do not watch the trailers or any gameplays of it or it will kinda spoil the experience. There is one that really stands out than the other but both fights were entertaining. OST wise it&apos;s awesome, just what you expect from any DS OST!
<br>
<br>PVP feature is a cool side feature....
<br>
<br>As a DS fan from playing all the games, it&apos;s definitely disappointing if you compare it to the other dlcs.
<br>The scale of this dlc just feels &quot;small&quot; and compare to the other dlcs, it can&apos;t get the theme of it right.
<br>Even the crowns dlc from ds2 got the theme and scale right.
<br>I took it more as something from the base game than a actual expansion.
<br>
<br>Now triple A games now a days are just not doing too great with expansions except for like Witcher 3. I feel like it definitely meets what we call DLC in these years. I didn&apos;t expect too much from reading the reviews of other people but I think this DLC is good.
<br>
<br>As a souls fan I would give this more like a 7/10
<br>But if you just turn your brain off and let it be just a dlc then its more like 7.5
<br>I hope expansion 2 will deliver the single player experience we truly wanted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-iii-ashes-of-ariandel/user-reviews?user_review_id=6775812">Expand</a></span>

It is a good game but its hard to explain how the third chapter(despite a few good moments) had no soul and just seem like a big fan service without much purpose, without originality.
<br>The problem with this DLC it is one and only: It is too short. Once you accept that it should be a bigger experience believe me, it is far more original and exciting than the base game. I can only imagine how much better( at least for me) the main game would be if every area of the game had the kind of sense of exploration and ambience this DLC delivered.
<br>As a pvp addicted I was very disappointed  with the weapons on base game: you had 14 straight swords, for example, and almost the same move set/skill for every single one: &quot;Of course I&apos;m gonna use the one with ridiculous damage and life regen!&quot;
<br>A lot were just impossible to play with, like daggers (Brigand twindaggers, yes I&apos;ll spam parry you after the first attack for sure) and almost all katanas. But I can assure you of this: each single weapon of this DLC its original and unique. Something that should have been done to every weapon on base game and probably wasn&apos;t done because of how hard would be game balancing (let&apos;s get this right, this is not an excuse for not doing it so ok?Just work it out FROM).
<br>The pvp arena, if you play a lot of pvp like me, works pretty well and there&apos;s not much to be said.
<br>I just wish I could give this a ten, it got so many good things going for it, things that I was missing from the base game but, for now, I stand in hope that the next DLC will deliver a bigger experience with the same care for level design and originality I see here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-iii-ashes-of-ariandel/user-reviews?user_review_id=6776197">Expand</a></span>
