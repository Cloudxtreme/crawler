It is, in my opinion, the best ARPG I have played.
<br>
<br>About me: I have played and beaten every ARPG known to man since Diablo. Diablo 2 was my favorite of the genre, and I spent the next decade+ searching for a game that would evoke even more fun and joy while playing. I played all the mainstream games, all the indie games, and even some foreign titles in languages I could not understand in the hopes of finding a game with satisfying combat, interesting loot, great atmosphere, and amazing build diversity. I even ended up playing a bunch of short Flash based ARPG&apos;s in my darkest hours of desperation. I&apos;ve beta-tested plenty of games, and even impacted a few. I haven&apos;t reviewed a game since Torchlight 2 (I regret giving it a 10, it&apos;s more like an 8 in comparison to Grim Dawn, as it&apos;s itemization lacked flavor and it&apos;s diversity was shallower than I realized) So Grim dawn is the first game I&apos;ll be reviewing in 2.5 years, as it has earned it.
<br>
<br>When I stumbled upon Grim Dawn I was intrigued, especially when I saw it&apos;s lead designer, Arthur Bruno, was also a leader in the development of Titan Quest (which fell short in a lot of ways but was the closest I had gotten, I loved the variety of items in that game and the dual class system). As I read up on him, and his posts, it occurred to me that he was the most articulate and intelligent mind I&apos;ve ever come across when it came to designing ARPG&apos;s, and what made them so fun, and so difficult to get right. I originally pirated a version of the beta (build 13), then caved and bought early access around build 17. Each build was so significantly better than the last that I was floored by how such a small team could make such efficient progress. Slowly and slowly the feeling got better until around B21 when I realized it happened: I felt the drug-like Diablo 2 cravings become satiated for the first time in over a decade. Needless to say, they&apos;ve made a fan of me. As for the review:
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s go over the basics:
<br>Music: 9 - Atmospheric, moody, grim. Fits the theme of the game, and at no times is tiresome. I only wish they had more songs in their soundtrack.
<br>Sound: 8 - Usually satisfying and fitting, but there are some spells and attacks that get annoying to hear. Forgivable as we all have our opinions, and they&apos;re a small team.
<br>General Combat: 10 - Meaty, corpses flying, enemies flinching and wailing as they die. Tons of variety and ways to make your foes cease to exist.
<br>Gameplay: 10 - Will go into this below
<br>Fun: 10 - Ditto
<br>
<br>I cannot summarize why I love Grim Dawn, as I love so many parts of it, but before I try to consider that this is a game originally made by like 2 full time employees and a few part-timers (eventually expanded to a full-time team of 10 people). It was kick-started by people who saw the potential of what Titan Quest could have been, and who were tired of Diablo-Clones failing to live up to the originals. Medierra (lead designer) and his team have on all accounts succeeded.
<br>
<br>An hack and slash that actually has a combat system with depth. It is a game with someone to offer every ARPG player. Whether you want to be a summoner, a massive area of effect spell caster, a dual wielder, a tank, a supporter, a ranged dps, or any combo of the above, you can do so in Grim Dawn... with style!
<br>
<br>Every skill in the game feels distinct in it&apos;s flavor, and with a devotion tree reminiscent of Path of Exile, yet very different, and items that can enhance an insane variety of your combat abilities, let alone grant you new skills and procs that you could build around. The higher difficulties you unlock are challenging but fair, and instead of just having a damned stat-wall (a numerical value your character must reach in it&apos;s stats before being able to reasonably progress) as many ARPG&apos;s opt for, Grim Dawn actual has some mechanical difficulty in it&apos;s fights, especially bosses. You will do best once you learn their abilities and how to play around them.
<br>
<br>The game is addictive to say the least. If there was anything it had that might put players off, it would be that there is so much going on in the combat formulas and stats available, that it might overwhelm less experience players.
<br>
<br>Do NOT let this stop you from trying this title. The best thing you can do to learn what means what, is jump in and experiment, and the players on the forum are more than happy to explain features and stats to you. Get past level 30 (out of 85) and you will see the game open up unlike any other you&apos;ve played previously, and truly start to understand the scope of build customization available.

<br>My name is also adoomgod on steam, please feel free to add me to ask questions about GD, ARPG&apos;s in general, or for help building your character(s). GD is a game you will want to beat more than once, see you soon. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6125001">Expand</a></span>

I was (still am) a long-time Titan Quest: Immortal Throne fiend. So when I heard some of the developers from that game were developing a new aRPG I was immediately on-board.
<br>
<br>I was an early backer (2010), then Kickstarter backer, and have purchased the game for a few friends. It has more than lived up to the hype and exceeded all expectations. I played nearly 400 hours while it was in beta alone, and can&apos;t wait to actually, really start playing the game now that it is in full release.
<br>
<br>It has all the best elements of an old-school aRPG game, with some new mechanics to keep it fresh. The environment/climate is interesting, the classes are fairly archetypal but with a fresh spin, and the hunt for loot keeps you hungry for progression.
<br>
<br>The story is interesting and there is enough to keep those interested immersed. The graphics are very good - not amazing, but authentic for the type of game. Not cartoonish at all. The pace is great and there&apos;s enough play diversity to offer plenty of replayability. It&apos;s a great mix of challenge and depth.
<br>
<br>I recommend this game highly. I&apos;ve only played as single player, but the game does offer co-op mulitplayer via local server connections (like Titan Quest - no online servers, yay)!
<br>
<br>PS - really looking forward to expansion AND the modding community once the game settles in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6123764">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m big fan of aRPG (diablo-like) - I love Path of Exile, liked Torchlight series, Diablo 2, even Diablo 3 is fairly decent, tho too much casual nonsense. So I had hopes for this, but it&apos;s simply snooze fest, yes it&apos;s boring as hell. 1h 50minutes was even too much for me.
<br>
<br>Main complaints about the the game: first of all it feels dated, it doesn&apos;t bring anything fresh to the genre. Animations are terrible all combat feels clunky, monsters are not interesting, already spam of MMO-ish fetch quests (no, I don&apos;t expect Witcher 3 level quests in such game). This game is not unique in any way, it&apos;s basically Titan Quest reskin.
<br>
<br>It also lacks global multiplayer, only p2p co-op which is quite disappointing. Anyway, if this game was released 5years ago then maybe, but in 2016 it&apos;s lackluster.
<br>
<br>So cannot recommend it for more demanding people, it&apos;s just dated and boring game for very casual experience, it&apos;s not fun at all..
<br>
<br>Better play Path of Exile, which costs absolutely nothing, it;s mechanically better aRPG, has great global online servers with trading, seasons, ladders, etc. I truly expected more that I got, hugely disappointed.
<br>
<br>I would rate it worse, but I saw there are some decent amount of customization options, but that doesn&apos;t make gameplay any more interesting. My final verdict 4/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6131221">Expand</a></span>

All I do is clicking and repeat the same hotkeys for my abilities over and over and over. I gave it 7 because it is a well polished game.</span>

The only serious drawback is that difficulty is a bit too low at Normal-Elite, especially on 2nd+ playthrough, when you have a lot of good gear from previous characters.</span>

<br>This Game is what people were wishing for when Diablo 3 came out, this game is a instant classic in the area where aRPG&apos;s have kind of suffered in an era of half finished games pushing the remaining portion as DLC.
<br>
<br>The environment is dark and twisted starting from the beginning area where the roads are littered with bodies and blood to later on when much of the effects are similar in the dark category, the enemies are not original but they are not over done at the same time ie zombies of different types, different types of hounds and things of that nature but as I said before it is not over done.
<br>
<br>Similar to Diablo this game is a quest for gear as you roam and kill everything in sight your constantly waiting for that better weapon to drop, its also (similar to diablo) a dungeon crawler which isn&apos;t a bad thing after Diablo 3 aRPG fans needed something that wasn&apos;t diablo but played similar but managed to still be new and fun and Grim Dawn is just that.
<br>
<br>Grim Dawn also has full controller support and its actually not horrible however it is a little different than what may be expected and have the need for a quick Google and familiarization with, if you want to know how to fully operate every aspect of the game from the controller support. however none the less the controller support is nice.

<br>Summary; Grim Dawn is an aRPG that classic and new fans of the genre will love all the same. the environment is awesome and the enemies while recycled still feel new or just don&apos;t feel old, make that decision for yourself, the controller support while it can be kinda strange for the first 5 minutes is really nice I give Grim Dawn a 10/10 when it comes to an aRPG.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6139618">Expand</a></span>

Been watching and playing it as it was developed, it is everything i wanted Diablo 3 to be and more. Played every ARPG since the original Diablo and only Grin Dawn gets it right.

I enjoyed Diablo 3 and sunk a ton of hours into it, but man does Grim Dawn feel like what Diablo 3 should have been. It&apos;s that good. It&apos;s like everything Titan Quest and Diablo 2 did well had a baby and this is our result.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve been a supporter since 2012 and playing on and off since well before the game ever hit Steam Early Access and man... it&apos;s incredible how far this game has come.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a Diablo fan of any sort and wasted away who knows how many hours of your youth on Diablo 1 and 2, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. Even at the full price of $25 it&apos;s an absolute steal.

<br>
<br>There is possibly little &quot;endgame&quot;, but I never was a fan of that. As soon as I feel that I have no real challenge I roll a new char. Problem solved. Plus, there will be survival mode, coming shortly after release, that will give even the most overgeared characters decent challenge.
<br>
<br>My advice &#x2014; if you love the &quot;diablo-like&quot; arpg genre, nay, if you even remotely like it &#x2014; try GD out. You will very likely not be disappointed. Especially considering quite low asking price.
<br>
<br>Also, to be fair, I never tried multiplayer, so I can say nothing on that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6123498">Expand</a></span>

<br>While the classes were pretty free and loot had unique abilities that actually impacted did not feel any real desire towards any particular path none of them appealed to me, best i found was a kind of AoE DOT build
<br>but even that bored me to death.
<br>
<br>Like D1 and D2 and was very inlove with TQ so in theory this should be my type of quest but it did nothing for me could not stand it.
<br>Maybe ive just played to many diablo clones and a decent clone just does nothing for me anymore or else it lacks a certain charm hard to tell.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6518526">Expand</a></span>

No FTP **** Just the game, go get it!  Its soulful and so full of flavor, its like an everlasting stick of juciy fruit.

What apparently these people don&apos;t realize is how small the team is and how far the game really has come and will continue to improve.
<br>
<br>Theory crafting different builds in Grim Dawn is probably where the true allure lies, as the loot is some of the most diverse and interesting loot in aRPG&apos;s. On top of combining two classes  and complimenting your build with loot. You have the entire devotion system that gives you even further customization.  What the game may lack in flashy skills (diablo 3) it makes up for with heart, soul, and a dedicated development team that regularly interacts with the community.
<br>
<br>This game is worth well more than the $25.00 price tag they are asking, I mean compare that to what you got on Diablo 3&apos;s release at $60.00. Do yourself a favor and support this small indie team! you won&apos;t regret it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6131290">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is the successor of titan quest, but it does everything better :). I can say that i enjoy it more than Poe and at same level as I enjoyed Diablo 2. It surpasses all others listed above.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6134266">Expand</a></span>

There is never a slow, dull, or boring moment with plenty of content from the the Main Quest Line to numerous side quests. The Main Story line will immediately immerse you into the Grim Dawn world, the quests are well developed and fun. In addition to the main and side questing there is a wonderful faction system. There are several factions with their own interests in the Grim Dawn world as you develop reputation with them they will offer special faction related bounty quests. The character class customization is one of the best, the system allows for dual classing which creates a hybrid class, this allows for a multitude of build designs, and the recently introduced devotion system adds yet another level of customization by way of 82 constellations each with 3 to 8 stars (a total of 434) which you can devote and attune to. Each star has its own attributes, benefits and some have special skills that are granted. The game has a robust crafting system and it is always a rush when you discover a rare blueprint for an item. The lore in this game is deep and immersive, if you like discovering notes in remote places that explain the history of the world and the events that led up to the Grim Dawn you will love this game. Crate has already announced they will continue to support the game and are already working on a future expansion.  It also appears there will be Mod&apos;ing options available in the future. Overall great game designed by a great indie developer that listens and cares about their community. Oh, and there are a lot of intelligent human Mobs to kill in Grim Dawn (wink wink Crate).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6143006">Expand</a></span>

You know what, I bet we could make something out of them.&quot; So they hauled them back to work shed, where they were carefully looked over and disassembled, then they began to draft new designs and tinker with the parts. As time passed, what began as sort of a hobby turned into a real undertaking. And then a work of passion. Now, 6 years later, we are looking at the end result of that work, all new paint, polished up and ready to drive.
<br>
<br>So was the wait worth it? Hell yes it was. This game is a masterpiece. If you&apos;re a fan of ARPG&apos;s and don&apos;t have this yet. Buy it.
<br>
<br>Thank you Crate Entertainment. You have given us something truly special.

What is GD NOT, that it knows it</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">What&apos;s really admirable about GD is that it knows exactly what it is, and doesn&apos;t make a fool of itself pretending to be anything it knows it isn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>What is GD, that it knows it is?
<br>
<br>-GD is the rightful inheritor of the throne of loot-, stat-, and skill-rich grindy ARPGs previously tenanted by heavyweights like DII, Dungeon Siege and Titan Quest.
<br>
<br>What is GD NOT, that it knows it isn&apos;t?
<br>
<br>-GD is not your bestest friend, delivering buckets of loot tailored to your character&apos;s needs at the press of a button.
<br>-GD isn&apos;t a telescoping clowngasm arms race where your damage goes up a magnitude every 3 levels and the endboss has fleventy hundred billion HP.
<br>-GD is not a masterpiece of narrative and characterization.
<br>-GD is not the next generation of HD graphical brilliance.
<br>-GD is not a social phenomenon. GD does not come with the built-in ability to tweet your loot.
<br>-GD doesn&apos;t need your love. It doesn&apos;t care if you play 10 hours or 1000 hours. It doesn&apos;t desperately coerce you with dailies and promotional hats.
<br>-GD is not a moral agent. Cheat if you want. It might enhance your fun, it might ruin your fun. It&apos;s your risk to take.
<br>
<br>You might notice that the first list is a lot shorter than the second. That&apos;s because GD toes the line. It&apos;s got the formula down, it&apos;s got the chops. It&apos;s a terrific formula. This is the same formula that had me go sleepless for 3 night in a row at age 14 just giddily grinding to max level in DII so I could finally equip my Buriza and go nuts on the cow level. It&apos;s the same formula that compelled me to put in over 300 hours in Dungeon Siege and its sequel, hunting obscure loot just for sake of hunting it. This formula is solid. It&apos;s timeless.
<br>
<br>Either the formula speaks to you, or it doesn&apos;t. If it does, this is the game. It takes the torch last held by Titan Quest, polishes the everliving buttery daylights out of it, and takes off sprinting with it. You won&apos;t be disappointed.
<br>
<br>If the formula doesn&apos;t speak to you, that&apos;s fine. There are other games out there eager to hold your hand, give you presents, and sing and dance for you. You can even live tweet about it. Go crazy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6124131">Expand</a></span>

The game is really good. It&apos;s quite a bit more indepth than D3 and PoE. Better crafting (though heavily dependent on RNG to a fault), better build options and more fun gameplay, though Diablo 3 has far better character animations than both PoE and GD. The performance is solid and the game runs well on even lower end machines with some quality downward adjustments.  My biggest complaint about the game is how the difficulty ramps up far too quickly on Ultimate difficulty.  The amount of farming for gear can lower morale for many who want to continue, and if your build isn&apos;t at the peak top of the hill list of best builds, you won&apos;t progress on Ultimate. Some balancing issues need to be taken care of, but the community is extremely friendly and helpful, and for the most part, so are the Devs. They are EXTREMELY responsive and attentive to the needs of the community, with the exception of a few acerbic and crass attitudes displayed towards paying customers.  The community has a tight clique of players who tend to circle the wagons against what would be good feedback from players on occasion.  If you like an excellent ARPG that harkens back to the old days of Diablo 2&apos;s playstyle and mehcanics, this is the game for you. I have logged over 1000 hours playing the game and for the most part, it has been rewarding.

<br>
<br>I also have to give special mention to the dev team who are incredibly involved with the community and love to play the game they are making which is a rarity nowadays.  The forums are incredible as well, with a great sense of community.
<br>
<br>Cthulu + Zombies + Post Apocalyptic World = Epic ARPG.  This game is an absolute steal at 24.99 - do yourself a favor and but it now!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6123586">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Its different from PoE ( Path of Exile,other exeptional arpg) enough to convive with it, they offer different thing. PoE is more for closed server features (ladders, leguague, economy/trading and so on). This one is more single player approach with modding capability, big open world, many dungeons and mobs, and so on.
<br>Different mecanics also but both very depth (maybe grim dawn in the mecanicas departament is a little better but its subjective, dont know).
<br>
<br>There &apos;is also Diablo 3, nice game, but dont have the depth of these two others arpg, just fluid combat and a short burst of fun, thats it. I dont consider it at the same level of GD and PoE. Too much arcade style.
<br>
<br>and..24 euros fot this? just 24 euros? joking? Its a robbery that we make to these developer i think, rise the price please (ehehe:D)
<br>
<br>Buy it, now, if you like real arpgs, nothing to add, really nothing to add:)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6134779">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But this game is different, its a true hardcore ARPG, has tons of features and complexity. So lets talk about the most important aspects of the game.
<br>
<br>Class System:
<br>Six classes in total and every character can pick two at the same time giving you a variety of gameplay, but it doesnt stop there, even though the game does not explain it to you every class can be sub-divided into specific roles.
<br>I consider every single one of the 6 total classes to have 3 sub-divisions, that gives us a total of 18 classes and an absurd number of possible combinations.
<br>Lets talk a bit about the Shaman class. Shaman, at its core, is a two-hand lightning damage melee character, calm down, it gets even more complex. The top of the Shaman skill tree is all about supporting his melee abilities, special moves while using two-hand weapons and a way to heal yourself in battle. The middle of the skill tree is where his mage-style abilities are, call for lightning strikes, a wind devil (hurricane), a totem that casts chain lightning, swarm of insects that eat your foes alive and vines to difficult their movement. The bottom of the tree are abilities that help you and your coops partners as well as a summon pet skill.
<br>You can clearly see the complexity of this system, and every class is like that, even the ones you could think are more straight foward, like the Soldier, with the Soldier class you also have the same type of: attacks, defenses, utility and magic. I cant even begin to describe the possible number of combinations. Even if 4 different people pick the same 2 classes they can end up being complete opposites not only on skills but also on play style.
<br>
<br>Devotions:
<br>If you thought the class system was complex enough you should think again. The Devotion system is a constellation/star maze attached to the skill system, every constellation has a set number of stars that gives you a variety of bonuses going from passive damage or defense to completely unique skills. You have a total of 50 points, thats no where near the total amount of places that you can invest in. Those devotions have a requirement and completion status that gives you points toward a certain affinity (Order, Chaos, etc) and more that you invest into a single affinity more powerful constellations you can unlock, but worry not, a well planned star path makes possible to pick a fair number of very interesting extras.
<br>The skills from this Devotions can be attached to any class skill, so imagine that you as a Shaman can call upon the lightning God and there is a chance that when the lightning hits the ground it will summon stone spikes imbue with poison. Yes, that is possible.
<br>The Devotions are a way to make you even more powerful and unique, covering the weaknesses of your character or enhancing your strong points even furthur, turning you into the ultimate tank or a true glass cannon.
<br>
<br>Factions:
<br>The game has 11 factions related to the lore of the world, 4 of those are enemies and 7 allies.
<br>As you kill monsters around the world your standing with enemy factions will become worst and worst, to the point they will start sending Nemesis to kill you. Nemesis are random bosses that can be encountered as you explore the world, they are very powerful but have a high Legendary or Epic loot drop chance. Also the enemy factions will increase the number of monster on the region, you will end up fighting armies of fiends.
<br>On the other hand the allied factions can be pleased by helping them dealing with situations, quest, doing bounty hunter and killing Hero enemies. As you favor with them increase you will gain access to exclusive loot, blueprints, and augments as well as discount on the shops of the place that the respective faction controls.
<br>
<br>Thats only a bit of what the game offers, I won&apos;t stretch myself too long talking about the multiplayer, blueprints, crafting, components, roguelike dungeons, world secrets, hidden locations and character attribute points. Everything that I tried to explain should give you a fairly good idea of what this game is about. Grim Dawn brings back the old ARPG style of gameplay where planning is necessary and the most powerful weapons are rare and exciting.
<br>
<br>I have absolute certainty that this game is worth the full price for bringing back the essence of a genre that was one day for the most strategic and smart players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6140954">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is probably in my top 3 games of all time. It&apos;s hard to describe without actually playing it. The two class system is amazing. Combat is fluid, and really rewarding. Can&apos;t wait for the expansion</span>

                                        <span>A really good ARPG. It reminds me a lot of D2 and I love the fact that it does not require an internet connection. I have spend already 173 hours on early access and now finally I can play it in full. A lot have change in the course of development and it really is one of the few EA games that really managed to pull it off. Congratulations Crate Entertainment ! Don&apos;t tun up into an evil corp. :D</span>

The game has seen many changes since then. We got the features they said we would plus more. There is real depth in the character customization with plenty of build options for all different play styles.
<br>
<br>Combine two of the currently available six classes to craft the character you want to play. Combine skills to create many synergies between any of the six.
<br>
<br>The Devotion system which was not something originally planned adds a really cool aspect of customization. Finding shrines in the world and restoring them grants points to devote to constellations with a huge variety of features; not just passive bonuses.
<br>
<br>Huge variety of gear in the way you would expect. In the true fashion of an ARPG you will find lots of bad gear. You will, however, find some gear you never want to get rid of, even though you eventually will. Some Rare, some Epic, and most Legendary gear will grant you new abilities to use; components, which you insert into gear, will allow you to double down on something or even out your weaknesses and some will grant you new abilities.
<br>
<br>The world has expanded immensely from what was originally planned. With additional acts and factions there is plenty more to do in the world of Cairn. Zones expanded and dungeons were added and every time it was very exciting. As more people joined Crate we got more art assets and the world really came to life.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t say it all here but Crate Entertainment has created a masterpiece. I think will endure the same way the previous great ARPGs have. From a cult following to a game with many fans Grim Dawn has come a long way.

<br>
<br>Take note that if you are looking for an MMO ARPG this might not be for you. It is mainly a single player game with MP on the side.  However 25$ is nothing compared to the amount of fun and enjoyment you will get from this game.

<br>
<br>grim dawn is not server based game. it&apos;s not online game. the save file is saved locally. mean it&apos;s moddable, hackable. so if you the kind who care about other who cheat their game but not your game yet feel disturbed/concerned, then by all mean, spare your worry and look else where.
<br>
<br>you will like grim dawn if you like below item:
<br>- loot with variety of affixes. and many many things to find with particularly fair drop rate.
<br>- story driven (but not so much like DS2 or diablo). i particularly love story of d2 and ds2 so GD kinda struck below both but if you takes time to walk thru the world slowly and read thru lore notes, i think its gonna drown you in its forsaken world.
<br>- many choice of skill for build. i have already tried several including poison bullet occultist, blade throwing rogue, dual wield rogue, 2-handed shockwave spam soldier, storm totem shaman. and i have yet to try some few other build i want to try.
<br>- love to replay many many times. 2nd difficulty, replay quest. 3rd difficulty, replay quest. replay replay replay.
<br>- multiplayer with option for individual loot. since it hard for me to set rule with my dope friends.
<br>- looking at gorgeous world, zooming in to look more.
<br>- don&apos;t mind graphics that is not like latest engine. it&apos;s TQ engine after all with improve effects and feature.
<br>- modding tools which will come later. meaning i will get to play community driven contents and more class to play in future.
<br>
<br>my only wish for drum beat when fight boss monster. it&apos;s a bit dull fighting boss without fighting drum and victory drum. some people say it&apos;s dumb reason to ponder but why there are people talking about immersion?
<br>
<br>tldr: the dream of mine 6-7 years ago become true and better. the feeling is like, a child getting a room full of candy. it&apos;s really exciting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6125165">Expand</a></span>

<br>For RPGs it will be hard to keep my attention for more than 40 hours, 60 at best.
<br>But as right now, I have more than 200 hours played on Grim Dawn and most of them were when the game was incomplete.
<br>How much more will I play now that it is done?
<br>They also have the decency to sell it at a very reasonable 25$

Grim Dawn is no stranger to that and it&apos;s a blast.
<br>
<br>I got the game in early access, so I had plenty of time to try out the classes, their flavor and several mix of them (a nice reminder of Titan Quest, that is still one of my favorite game).
<br>
<br>And once the game was finally released, it came with a new class, the Shaman, that just perfectly complement the Occultist to suit my shameless laid-back * style of play.
<br>
<br>So, if you want to give it a try, here are the foundations : start with the Occultist and develop the Familiar and Hellhound branches ; when you reach level 10, jump to the Shaman and go for the Briarthorn branch. You can complement these three with one or two other skills you might find useful or enjoyable. For the devotions, start with Shepherd&apos;s Crook.
<br>
<br>The balance between &quot;class&quot; and &quot;skill&quot; levels is up to you. On my own, I usually spend 2 points in the Class (for character stats) and 1 point a Skill ; and sometimes saving points for later. But with the Spirit Guide that can help you re-spec your skills, you can do as you please.
<br>
<br>What you will do most of the time is send your creatures to scout places and eventually attract or attack foes. So bind a key with Pet Attack and be sure that at least Hellhound then Briarthorn are set to Aggressive. What you choose to do with you character (close combat, ranged combat...) is up to you since it matters only 5 to 10% of the time ; you really can experiment here with any combination of weapons, armors and components.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless, since no &quot;build&quot; is made perfect, you might encounter some resistance with &quot;infuriated&quot; enemies than can steal a percentage of your pets&apos; health (thus creating a stasis in combat) ; and of course, champions and bosses - not mentioning, champions that can summon infuriated creatures.
<br>
<br>* Some might say that this style of play is not very ARPG-y since you don&apos;t have to frantically click your mouse to hit enemies like in the good old days, but merely give orders to your faithful minions to carry on the good word. Well, since I&apos;ve been playing ARPGs since Diablo, I consider this style of play a well deserved treat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6406602">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Five Word Review: Solid ARPG, not for me.
<br>Favorite Thing: The gameplay is pretty fun and chaotic.
<br>Least Favorite Thing: The story takes a back seat and it only functions to move things along. There&apos;s very little of it.
<br>
<br>Playtime: ~ 25h
<br>Enjoyment: 6/10
<br>Recommendation: If you&apos;re a fan of this type of ARPG, yes. If you&apos;re looking for a good story, no.</span>

A game from makers of titan quest and i must say Titan quest was great ARPG, grim dawn is better in every way. Not sure if this is best ARPG ever made (Diablo 2 is wery hard candidate even to day), but it is really close for sure if not even better.</span>

<br>I think the dual class thing is a cool idea but I would have appreciated a little more info going in etc and I wound up a &quot;trickster&quot; however I find myself almost completelty spending points in shaman currently. If theres a way to change my second class that would be great- I do like that you buy back your skillpoints at least.
<br>I am current playing on a 4k DCI display and my only gripe there is that I wish I could scale the UI just about 50% more. Still kinda hard to see-
<br>
<br>I am really digging the moody grim look and the way you can reclaim your death for an exp refund...  nice way to not feel as crummy when you die.
<br>I HIGHLY recommened playing on Veteran etc... on NOrm I was just way too overpowered and wasnt really feeling challenged, that being said I feel veteran is much more appropraite challenge wise.
<br>The Devs CLEARLY tried to make us an excellent game and the hard work in that regard is evident here.
<br>
<br>You cant go wrong with Grim Dawn, dont wait for a steam sale- buy it now if your looking for some satisfying Diablo-esque loot collecting fun.
<br>
<br>9/10 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br>
<br>*I avoided playing this game til its offical release so my opinion is based solely on the available game. I had some issues installing and graphic glitches but I was helped very swiftly by the steam community and dev responses.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6154499">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics for this game are fine and they are definitely enough to enjoy this game from a visual point of view. The atmosphere however is lacking because many areas lack proper background music and most narrative aspects are just plain text.
<br>
<br>~~~The narrative elements~~~
<br>I don&apos;t know, this is not really a point where this game scores. I like the fact that you can make decisions with consequences, but so far it does not really seem overwhelming influential. The story itself seems to be something purposive and is neither something ambitious nor interesting in general. If it wasn&apos;t there, I would not bother that much either.
<br>
<br>~~~Gameplay and user interface~~~
<br>It&apos;s okay but not outstanding, hacking and slaying feels solid and gives a proper feedback, but the creatures lack diversity. There is just plain attacking most of the time. The character customization and leveling in general makes fun, some animations could have been made better. The game crashes from time to time right after joining the world, when it runs, then fluid. Loot is fine and the game options offer enough to be satisfied. The core gameplay elements feel solid.
<br>
<br>~~~To the genre~~~
<br>It is an old-school classic Hack-and-Slay-action-RPG. There is not really something new to the genre, but it does it&apos;s job. The loot is fine, the character customization works out and the explorable area is appealing. You hack and slay, but that&apos;s it.
<br>
<br>~~~Conclusion~~~
<br>I do not know if it is worth the 25 euros, I mean it is a Hack-and-Slay, but only that. It has nothing special to offer, its charm seems to be limited. The creatures you face are more or less all the same, except they got a different visual layout. The story is something that would neither make or brake this game because it feels so irrelevant. If you only care about the absolute core elements of a classic Hack-and-Slay-game, this game might be for you. If you need something more to keep playing, then this game might be the wrong decision.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6531303">Expand</a></span>

<br>People always talk &apos;D2/3 and Path of Exile and Torchlight&apos; when speaking aRPGs but now Grim Dawn is easily to be included in the lists as games you must own or you are just missing out.

Now the large world is populated with multiple allied and enemy factions, and there is a huge variety of enemy types. A single playthrough takes 24 hours, easily twice as much, if you explore everything. The continuous, lush world is hand-crafted and pleasing to the eye. Often the lore is tied in to the gameplay mechanisms, which makes them much more meaningful.
<br>
<br>The game manages to keep the balance between rewarding you with equipment upgrades and keeping you hungry for further items. The dynamic and threatening combat system forces you to adapt to the ever increasing difficulty. The multilayered character building comprises socket-able equipment (partly with item skills), double-classing and celestial skills, which trigger off your regular skills. Creating exotic hybrid builds is fun, viable and worthwhile. For every character I play, I come up with another two builds, I would like to try. Good times.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6124047">Expand</a></span>

If you want a more actionified RPG experience then play something like Path of Exile, Diablo, Dark Souls. Better all round games worth some time put into them. If you want a proper RPG then go for Fallout, Arcanum, Infinity engine cRPGS etc. There does seem to be a little army of fanboys clamouring for this very average title who vote down anyone on Steam and sites like this one and seem to have some unwarranted elitism going on. Trust me guys, there is nothing elite about Grim Dawn. It&apos;s painfully mediocre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6433044">Expand</a></span>

<br>Quiero decir que estoy enamorado de este gran juego, para mi es ya el mejor ARPG de la historia y con diferencia. todo en el juego rezuma amor y cari&#xF1;o, se nota que los desarrolladores tienen amor por los juegos.
<br>
<br>para empezar quiero decir que con GD he tenido sensaciones que ya hab&#xED;a olvidado, por ejemplo llevarse mas de 25 minutos en tensi&#xF3;n luchando contra un boss final y acabar euf&#xF3;rico perdido jejejje
<br>
<br>bueno empiezo con el juego, para empezar gr&#xE1;ficamente me parece una joya, sarc&#xE1;sticamente es una delicia y se ve muy bien con todo al m&#xE1;ximo, la iluminaci&#xF3;n, las sombras, los cambios de clima, d&#xED;a noche, niebla, etc todo suma y es una belleza.
<br>
<br>jugablemente hablando no tengo quejas es un juego que engancha y de lo lindo, hacia tambien mucho mucho tiempo que no so&#xF1;aba con un juego o que siempre tenga ganas de volver a jugar un rato m&#xE1;s. es un juego en el que te pones a jugar y se te pasan las horas y no te das cuenta, dices un poco mas, hasta el pr&#xF3;ximo nivel, hasta el pr&#xF3;ximo portal, lo que sea pero seguro que cuando llegues all&#xED; algo te har&#xE1; continuar. tiene cosas incre&#xED;bles en cada rinc&#xF3;n, secretos, zonas ocultas, en cada rinc&#xF3;n puedes encontrar algo.
<br>
<br>el juego coge lo mejor de los antiguos y clasicos ARPGS y a&#xF1;ade cosas nuevas que redondean y completan el juego de forma genial, desde el sistema dual de clases heredado de Titan Quest, pasando por el nuevo sistema de Devoci&#xF3;n (unas constelaciones que desbloquearan poderes extras para tus personajes y adem&#xE1;s muy bien implementadas para ir desbloqueandolas durante el juego), siguiendo por los atributos,los contratos,las facciones,que tus decisiones tienen peso importante en el juego(no es gran cosa, pero est&#xE1; bien integrado), penalizaci&#xF3;n de XP por muertes, juego dif&#xED;cil, que supone un reto pero no imposible, un sistema de itemizaci&#xF3;n muy bueno, tantas cosas que seguro me dejo atr&#xE1;s algo.
<br>
<br>sobre la historia, personalmente me ha encantado, esta todo muy bien integrado en el mundo de Cairn, y cada nueva nota o libro que encuentres y leas te mostrara de una forma real y cruda lo que ocurre all&#xED;, no quiero spoilear, pero hay algunas, como viaje al sur, que son por decirlo de alguna manera, sublimes.
<br>
<br>en resumen para mi es un juego redondo, si te gustan los ARPGS, no lo dudes, sino, tampoco lo dudes, creo que es un juego que todo el mundo deber&#xED;a probar, y m&#xE1;s por el precio al que est&#xE1; disponible sin contar cuando est&#xE1; de oferta. te va a dar m&#xE1;s horas que uno de 60 o 90 euros seguro.
<br>
<br>Nota 12/10
<br>
<br>para mi va a ser el GOTY 2016, un juego tan bien hecho, con tanto cari&#xF1;o y dedicaci&#xF3;n, no merece menos, vale que es mi genero favorito, pero a&#xFA;n as&#xED;, sacar un parche el 23 de diciembre, y que el 24 te corrijan errores, no lo hace cualquiera. adem&#xE1;s escuchan a la comunidad en el foro como nunca antes habia ni imaginado que una compa&#xF1;ia podria hacerlo.
<br>
<br>Solo repetir que son tantas emociones en &#xE9;ste juego, que no me puedo quedar con una, aparte de las ya dichas, por decir alguna m&#xE1;s, por ejemplo, golpear esqueletos y ver como se despedazan y vuelan por los aires huesos, luchar debajo de un arco y ver como se derrumba la estructura al ser goleada, el movimiento de la vegetaci&#xF3;n a tu paso o por el viento, el movimiento de las aspas de los molinos en el viento, pasar poco a poco de la oscuridad de la noche a la tenue luz del amanecer y con bruma...... son tantas cosas.
<br>
<br>Y reci&#xE9;n sali&#xF3; del acceso anticipado y le queda mucha vida.
<br>
<br>ah! tambi&#xE9;n mencionar que tendr&#xE1; herramientas de mods y que est&#xE1; en perfecto espa&#xF1;ol gracias al gran equipo de personas que build tras build han trabajado y siguen trabajando para ponerlo en nuestro idioma.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6137819">Expand</a></span>

For the most part, it is indeed just Titan Quest with re-skinned graphics and the skill trees are just skills from Diablo 2 + Titan Quest re-shuffled but largely unchanged. There is simply nothing new here and I couldnt help but feel like I had already played my characters before even though I had never played them in this game. Because of this, I feel like the game needed something to propel it above being generic. Maybe cool new animations, or perhaps a class we have never seen before with new skills, or maybe a great story... something... but there is just nothing there hence why I call it a very &quot;safe&quot; game. They didnt try to improve anything.
<br>
<br>That said, it is nonetheless, an enjoyable aRPG game and the price is right, as it was released for less than $30. In terms of value, it deserves an extra point. This game does have official modding support so there is a chance that mods will help make this game become less bleh, but its still to early to say. If you have a few bucks to spare, you can get it for $25 on Steam and you will be much happier with this game than PoE or Diablo 3 (which sucked the big salami).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6451546">Expand</a></span>

I did not play much early access as I wanted to wait till full feature release, and began playing a few months before release. This game is honestly what Diablo 3 should have been, and I believe that D3 is a good game in it&apos;s own right, much more of an arcadey hack and slash with loot. It feels closer to Diablo 2 in atmosphere but since it is a unique IP, it has an interesting take on the genre. The story is just ok, bu the lore and characters really make the world immersive. Just clicking through dialog you can accidentally kill an NPC who could have helped you, or make a decision that effects the rest of the game, Grim Dawn delivers a true aRPG. The loot is great, and I really feel as though there are a large number of viable builds with the vast itemization. Dual classing at level 10 creates a new level of customization and it really fields like any two of the 8 classes can be combined to make an effective pairing. On release I ended up purchasing a few copies for my friends as I really felt it was worth supporting Crate for the product they have put out. There are some bugs, some potentially network issues in multiplayer, the graphics aren&apos;t the exactly the most up to date, but it is some seriously great entertainment and well worth it. I have already played over 100 hours and have just reach ultimate difficulty, I really can&apos;t wait for more!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6148643">Expand</a></span>

With 201 Games on Steam, it is my most-played and easily my favorite. Oh, you want a review? OK then...
<br>
<br>Grim Dawn presents a nitty-gritty world ravaged both my man&apos;s mistakes as much as otherworldly invasion. The feel of this world is perpetuated in every facet of the design of the game. Skills and attacks - player and enemy alike - are brutal and satisfying. The UI is precisely what it needs to be to get the points of its contents across to the player; it is no fancier than that. The quests have a purpose to them - &apos;We feel threatened by X, fix that for us by slaying him/her/it&apos; - but they do not go out of their way in their descriptions to make their completion any easier than a rough idea of where to go. This game is designed to be played solely by you, your inclinations, and you intuition, not to help you play it with omniscient developer input and assistance. But you get what you give, and then a little more. You&apos;ll hunt across beautiful hand-crafted landscapes for terrifyingly monstrous entities, read immersive and haunting texts scattered throughout the world, and develop a character of your own design, one of your own play-style and skill choices.
<br>
<br>OK, so that&apos;s all the RPG stuff out of the way. So how does Grim Dawn put the Action in Action-RPG? At the beginning of the game, it does not do so wildly. Nor should it; if you started a god then any godly things you did throughout the game would feel all the same. But eventually the combat of Grim Dawn becomes fast paced and as brutal as the world around you. Every enemy in Grim Dawn is designed to kill you with merciless potency, and you&apos;ll have in your arsenal an array of spells, skills, and items to decimate you foes with terrific effect. Rarely will you ever feel truly immortal; the world of Grim Dawn has foes tough enough to go toe-to-toe with the most dedicated players.
<br>
<br>Grim Dawn is a hack-and-slash ARPG that does everything it needs to and so much more. I&apos;ve spent around $150 on the game between gifts and pre-purchasing for myself, and I&apos;ve gotten more than five hours of enjoyment for every dollar spent. If you&apos;ve read this far, do yourself the favor and pick it up for $25.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6141163">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Game rewards exploring. There are many places to find and a lot of hidden locations and treasures. It is not time consuming like Path of Exile nor oversimplified like Diablo 3. It is more like old Titan Quest and it runs on its game engine (but enhanced) and uses its mechanics (Also enhanced)
<br>
<br>Even if it is very similiar to Titan Quest, there are many enhancements. For example devotion system. WIth it you can specialize your character and improve it even more. There this faction system and crafting system which both add posibilities to make your character stronger.
<br>
<br>PROS
<br>- Itemization, Equipment,
<br>- Crafting, Factions
<br>- Skills, Leveling
<br>- Devotion + Multiclass system
<br>- Graphics, Music
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>- Sometimes you say: Hey that model of monster is like it was in titan quest. Or something like that. But if you didnt played titan quest, then there is no problem.
<br>- Some things were better in old TItan Quest. For example music, story and overall adventure in Titan Quest were fantastic and epic. Grim dawn is not so good in these parts of game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6124116">Expand</a></span>

Its offers nothing new to this genre, its pretty much TQ in new setting. The same archaic mechanics, gameplay is slow and clunky compared to Diablo 3, production value (graphics/sound/animations) is much worse, and GD lacks this awesome combat feel D3 has. Game is too dark, i dont mind it (i think D3 was too colorful), but after a while these dark spaces become quite tiresome.
<br>But i can forgive these things, as devs of this game dont have resources Blizzard has. But what i cant forgive, and what is my greatest complain- is skill system and character progression. You progress by putting little points into skills, but the problem is that any viable build has 2-3 active skills (and some passives), and if you try out many skills, they will become weak in the end and your build will not be viable any more. And if you choose ony 2 or 3 of them- gameplay suffers, because you use these 2-3 skills over and over and over again ad nauseum. And leveling is slow in this game. So pretty much after a while this game becomes very boring and repetitive- you cant feel progress (the same skills only a little stronger), you cant experiment with skills and builds (like you can in D3). Of course you can respec some points, but prices become ridiculously high after a while, so its not meant to experiment on skills, but to change little flaws in your build.
<br>You may not like D3, but at least it wasnt just D2 with better graphics, it improved many mechanics, it tried to test different things in the genre. Skills you can change at any time and try out new combinations- that was brilliant idea.
<br>Grim dawn is very preservative and generic, its just more of the same boring and archaic formula. Quite disappointing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6188312">Expand</a></span>

I keep going, I keep pressing the few buttons I need to press in order slay yet another massive horde of monsters. I suppose Grim Dawn has the two most vital components of a good ARPG down really well; impactful and satisfying combat and just the right amount of loot to keep you hunting for more.
<br>
<br>As I said, I am aware that I&apos;m pressing the same buttons over and over again... but it&apos;s so satisfying and the numbers get progressively bigger! That&apos;s what makes a good ARPG.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6124335">Expand</a></span>

Better loot tooltips, better loot filters, P2P servers instead of Gamespy (you aren&apos;t going to be MLGing this game anyway), more build options, less filler, everything is streamlined for player convenience compared to TQ. There is absolutely no pay-to-win or paying for anything except the game for that matter, and there will be no &quot;auction house&quot; wherein people get twinked to oblivion with $10,000. The game was made by about 10-15 people and in my opinion it represents the terminal state of the path that Diablo 2 was on in terms of being a straightforward, mouse-based raiding, number-crunching character builder. I suspect this will be the end of this style of game with all future ARPGs taking the route of PoE/Diablo 3 (freemium or pay-to-win) or rollfests like Dark Souls and its clones. If Diablo 2 is one of your favorites, then it doesn&apos;t get much better than this except in production values.
<br>
<br>Some valid points of negative reviews I&apos;ll acknowledge:
<br>- Some animations are pretty naff, like the 2H attack animations, which look like you&apos;re swinging a cardboard tube
<br>- Much of this has been done before, but the point of the game is refinement of those mechanics
<br>- It will seem AWFULLY FAMILIAR if you have played Titan Quest before, but it is leagues ahead of Diablo 2
<br>- This is a mouse-heavy game, don&apos;t expect any fancy pants maneuvers, this is a real throwback to the clicky era
<br>
<br>The essence of Grim Dawn is basically perfecting the core gameplay of Diablo 2, as was attempted in TQ, and in my opinion it&apos;s made at least equivalent progress in that regard. I can&apos;t value the game for you (it&apos;s $25 presently) but I can recommend that you play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6141956">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Grim Dawn is changing my mind on that.  The skill system is great. It reminds me of Titan Quest. The graphics are nice considering it is a top down game. Grass moves when you go through it is a nice touch. The effects of your spells and abilities are very unique. Gameplay hasn&apos;t been repetitive and I have found that this is a title I can pick up and put down very easily.
<br>
<br>I give it a 9, could easily be a 10 but I haven&apos;t gotten far enough to warrant that rating. Endgame could be very different.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6150775">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Second, the devotion system is stupidly complicated for little benefit until you have a good handful of points.  I spent HOURS staring at the devotion screen, navigating sites to plan my points, and trying devotion skills in game.  If it weren&apos;t so punishing to refund the points, I wouldn&apos;t have worried so much about it.
<br>
<br>Lastly, late in your first playthrough, and from then on, the damage taken gets rather severe.  I was playing with another person, so maybe that was part of the problem, but even with points spent to increase health, some defensive/CC skills, defensive devotions, potion spamming, and years of ARPG experience, I felt like enemies hit a little too hard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6278382">Expand</a></span>

It exchanges the sword-and-sandal world of Greek, Egyptian and Chinese myth of its predecessor for a world of iron, blood and gunpowder where humanity sees itself trapped in a post-apocalypse wrought by two mighty armies as despicable as they are really damn old: the body-snatching Aetherials and the blood-happy Cthonians.
<br>
<br>Grim Dawn plays much like Titan Quest, but with a wealth of quality-of-life improvements that make it a much more enjoyable experience overall. It notably features a reusable portal spell in the vein of Diablo 3 that allows you to access any unlocked Rift in the world, as well as none of that stupid item durability business, so you never need to repair your gear (read: suffer an arbitrary drain on your wallet). The most you lose on death is a small amount of experience, which can be retrieved from the headstone that marks where you last died. However, I have only played on normal mode so far and this may change later, I do know that you suffer a 25% penalty to your elemental resistances on elite, and a whopping 50% on ultimate. In addition, there is an NPC in the very first town that you can purchase skill point refunds from for a flat price that quickly becomes inconsequential, at least on normal. However, you cannot refund points spent on your mastery level itself (more on that in a moment), which increases your base stats and unlocks new skills at certain thresholds. Grim Dawn also generally feels friendlier to play then Titan Quest or Diablo 2, and at least on normal I felt like I was not punished for experimenting with new skills, and I was consistently dealing very high damage to all enemies as early as a third of the way into the game, to the point of one-shotting most enemies at the endgame. However, the same is also true of normal difficulty in Path of Exile, which quickly kicks you in the balls on higher difficulties if you do not have a &quot;good&quot; build- but I&apos;ll enjoy it while it lasts.
<br>
<br>Grim Dawn retains Titan Quest&apos;s unique class system. You begin the game with no class at all, but are quickly given a choice of skill trees the first time you level. You are then able to pick a second tree not long thereafter, combining any two skill trees to create the hybrid class you want. I went with Demolitionist first, a primarily ranged tree dealing with explosives, flames, &#x201C;thorns&#x201D;-style defenses that burn attackers, and a bit of lightning, with a few points in the Soldier tree for defense, creating what the game calls a Commando. My basic attack was quickly replaced by the ever-useful Flame Strike, which in addition to adding massive fire damage to my attacks, can also be augmented with splash damage, lightning damage and ultimately bursts of magma shards for even more fun. The tree also includes grenades, molotovs, cluster bombs, mortars and mines- a respectable arsenal. Other trees include the spell-blasting Arcanist, demon-summoning Occultist, poisonous, sneaky Nightblade, and lightning-hurling Shaman trees. There is also a special &quot;Devotion&quot; skill web represented by constellations, which you put points into earned from reactivating special shrines found throughout the world. These devotion points earn you minor stat buffs useful to most builds, as well as special skills that can be attached to your normal abilities to enhance their effects. I got a skill called Twin Fang that added a chance for a life-stealing attack to my basic attack, for example. However, I do not currently know a way to respec Devotion points, and you cannot switch your choice of basic skill tree.
<br>
<br>Grim Dawn is respectably long and content-dense, especially for the price. I clocked in over thirty hours, and like most Diablolikes, you spend most of that knee-deep in the bad guys, and it never really gets old- the hallmark of a good game in a genre known for its repetitiveness. Sure, it&apos;s a little rough around the edges- the graphics aren&apos;t anything special, the voice acting is iffy, and the music, though good, is largely atmospheric, but its mechanically very solid. Crate Entertainment has created an excellent ARPG with much potential replay value that is well worth your time. If you&apos;ve played any other ARPG before, Grim Dawn will be right up your alley, and even if you haven&apos;t, it&apos;s a fine place to start.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507797">Expand</a></span>

Atmosphere and physics are addicting in this game, loved static world, plot is average but it&apos;s not really important in this game for me. Only wish that there was much more content than there is now, hope to see expansion soon and maybe new classes to try new builds.</span>

It aims for longevity both in terms of content updates and build and skill system depth, not the least from the innovative dual-mastery system reminding me of D&amp;D of years past, giving rise to no less than 15 (!) different classes. For example, a Nightblade/Soldier becomes a Blademaster. This doesn&apos;t overwhelm though. The developer has managed to create something deep and complex, yet with a welcoming surface to lure you into the wonders of theorycrafting.
<br>
<br>The style is a steampunk, gritty atmosphere that feels adult. Comparing this to the obvious game Diablo 3, Diablo 3 feels a bit like an action movie with huge explosions where this plays more like The Walking Dead as you step out to roam the abandoned towns in the post-apocalyptic surroundings, with rarely seen graphical detail. I read diaries to try to understand, I wade through zombies and worse, and I try to make the best out of of a grim situation indeed.
<br>
<br>There is also an air of roguelike gaming surrounding this game, made even more evident from developer posts directly referring roguelikes, and certain end-game content. I have never heard of such references from an Action RPG developer since Diablo 1! It&apos;s great to see the developer recognize the genre&apos;s roots and bring out the fun of those games in this grim packaging of metal, wood, occultism, sweat, and blood.
<br>
<br>Further making this game unique among its peers is that the single player mode can be paused! Unbeatable support for quick, urgent breaks if someone is calling for your attention in real life. It also comes with mod support to expand its longevity. Both features rarely seen today because they are incompatible with heavy online dependency, something this game supports but does not require. These special features completes this game&apos;s certain spirit. A spirit I have not felt since a long time indeed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6654622">Expand</a></span>

<br>I love the ability to customize your character ( but it doesn&apos;t go too far like POE).
<br>The graphics are great, better than any other ARPG imo. The world is exciting though perhaps a bit linear.  I take the time to read every document I can find in this game. Some of them are written very well. Gameplay is great... everything is great... BUY THIS GAME. I feel guilty for only paying the $25.
<br>
<br>My biggest complaint: The ending... its a whole lotta nothing but hopefully an expansion will fix that in the future. Not enough to bring this masterpiece down.  10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6352036">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For me, the most important indicator is always whether I can not stop playing the game. And Grim Dawn makes me an addict! Damn it...
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+ There are many similarities to Diablo2 (especially the music !!) as well as Titan Quest (which is made by the same team)
<br>+ Very well implemented spiral of leveling and grinding, you never get too many items (and especially no dull &quot;daily legendaries&quot; like D3)
<br>+ A variety of items to craft, a nice selection of talents and specializations
<br>+ Devotion (something like a &quot;religion&quot;) is a very cool skill element, especially since you can bound it to abilities (which you can then also level, similar to gemstones in PoE)
<br>+ The dual class system produces very interesting char builds
<br>+ The story is even more than just &quot;click-away textlines&quot;!
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- It sometimes has its longueurs and partially empty areas (maybe only on &quot;normal game mode&quot;)
<br>- Damage values &#x200B;&#x200B;are not fully optimized: Often you run through monster hordes without taking any damage, only to get a one-hit from the boss (IMO those &quot;final hits&quot; are not clearly predictable)
<br>- Hits, magic and other abilities are not quite as impressive as in Diablo3 (Blizzard still is leading in this category)
<br>
<br>Conclusion: Grim Dawn is a very good Hack-n-Slay game - one of the old school. I even liked it more than Age of Conan and Torchlight. For me, it is on a par with Path of Exile and Titan Quest.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6913147">Expand</a></span>

Its first and foremost error is assuming that Diablo 2 is some crowning achievement of the aRPG  genre and needs to be replicated and emulated as closely as possible. Yeah, Diablo 2 is a good game... if you happen to still live in 2001, in which case I&apos;d recommend you keep away from planes and tall buildings for the next few months.
<br>
<br>So what is Grim Dawn? It&apos;s a cargo-cult clone of Diablo 2 that does little to move the genre forward or stray from the beaten path. And make no mistake,  Diablo 2&apos;s style of gameplay has aged BADLY, especially in the single-player department which is Grim Dawn&apos;s main focus. The game is an endless grindfest, where you mow down hordes and hordes of uninteresting monsters, that drop uninteresting loot in order to move the uninteresting story forward. Rinse and repeat.
<br>
<br>The graphics and music are good, but the game suffers from serious optimization problems even though it runs on ancient Titan Quest engine. The engine is supposedly the main reason, why the game doesn&apos;t play nicely with multi-core cpus and suffers from serious framerate issues, even on high-end PCs.
<br>
<br>Is summary: if you suffer from a bad case of Diablo 2 nostalgia then go ahead and buy this game, though I&apos;m afraid that you&apos;ll soon find that your nostalgia is just that... a longing for a time when you were younger, more easily entertained and willing to put up with all sorts of grindy crap. If you don&apos;t care for Diablo 2 or any of its &quot;spiritual successors&quot; then STAY AWAY from this game. There&apos;s nothing for you here. 2001 was 15 years ago and this game is still stuck in that period.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6510235">Expand</a></span>

<br>everything besides those &quot;bads&quot;, are &quot;flawlessly good.&quot; you should definietly try this game. carefull with your playtime, if you dont like it, just refund it... but im still playing and enjoying this, so i think you will probably do the same and not refund it... most likely.
<br>
<br>one last thing: i agree on critics about innovation, i think aRPG genre may use some interesting ideas.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6133743">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t make a build and then have to rely on pots because you over emphasized offensive powers.  35 hours in so far and my main is a dual-wielding master of the occult.  So many choices.  That alone is a reason to play this if you love ARPG games.</span>

<br>
<br>Grim Dawn nails a lot of what&apos;s needed to make a good aRPG, but it does fail technically, with some performance issues still persisting after all these years in early access, all of which have been discussed to death on the official forums. It has become clear that these issues cannot be fixed due to the engine, which while heavily modified is still the same engine used by Titan Quest, a game released in 2006. Other than these hiccups the game still lacks some polish, for example the UI is very basic, as are the menus, and while not massively important it does cheapen the product as a whole. Controller support is also very bare right now, but what we do have works well enough considering it was designed by one dev in his spare time. You just can&apos;t compare it to say Victor Vran which feels amazing with a controller.
<br>
<br>Where the game shines is replay value and build diversity, there are countless builds and class combinations that make you want to level new character after new character. On top of the fairly deep talent system you also have the devotion system which aids you to further customise your character with strong spells and passives, you can tailor your character to play exactly how you like and it&apos;s definitely better than a lot of the competition in this regard.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is fine, it&apos;s not the best in the genre but it&apos;s far from the worst, it&apos;s definitely enjoyable to play but it does have room for improvement, especially when it comes to animations and audio, the bow/gun sound effect will start to grate on you after awhile, this sort of thing goes back to lack of polish which the game suffers from in almost every aspect. But don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s far from bad.
<br>
<br>Throughout early access there was no voice work at all, but right before release the devs added voice overs for the main story which was desperately needed and it has made a huge difference to the enjoyment of the first playthrough as you get a much better understanding of the story without having to read every single bit of text. But in doing I now miss voice work where it hasn&apos;t been added, it almost feels unfinished, and while I understand they most likely had a limited budget and full voice work didn&apos;t fit inside it, as I player I do miss it and wish it were there.
<br>
<br>Overall it&apos;s a good game that was made on a low budget with a small team, and that&apos;s exactly how it looks and feels when playing it. Don&apos;t go in expecting too much and you will be pleasantly surprised, if you enjoyed Diablo II you will most likely enjoy Grim Dawn, but if you enjoyed Diablo III you may find some of the limitations in Grim Dawn off putting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6158412">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Diablo3 even with all its flaws, is a game from 2012 with better graphics, immersion and a gameplay that totally destroys grim dawn.
<br>I don&apos;t care if this is an &quot;Indie&quot; game with 8 programmers, u gotta compare apples with apples: this is a game, so let&apos;s judge it for what it is.
<br>
<br>If u are an average gamer, there are tons of games better than this, especially in 2016. If u love arpgs and going crazy deep with all the calculations and builds, then I guess this is the game for you.
<br>Really regret having spent 30 USD for this game...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/grim-dawn/user-reviews?user_review_id=6717168">Expand</a></span>
