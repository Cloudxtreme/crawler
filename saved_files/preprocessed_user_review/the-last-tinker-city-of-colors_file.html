<br>
<br>Long Review: The Last Tinker: City of Colors is a 3d action-platformer similar to Banjo-Kazooie and Wind Waker (Zelda) with an unique art style (think DR. Seuss) set in the gorgeous world of Colortown. The color palette consists of reds, blues, greens, purples, oranges, yellows, and whites. The video settings are standard PC options- VSync, Texture Quality, etc. The game runs great on almost all PCs and looks great with any settings option. The Last Tinker runs on the Unity engine, showing us the versatility of the engine and how good games look on it. The engine and graphics are great and are NOT outdated by any stretch of the imagination.
<br>
<br>The Last Tinker&apos;s story is pretty straightforward and even sometimes &quot;childlike&quot; in it&apos;s presentation which is a downside, dealing with issues like racism, sadness, anger, and fear which is good for kids but doesn&apos;t feel the same for adults. But it makes up with funny and cute characters. The dialogue is cringe-worthy and some of the characters are really annoying and cliched to the &apos;T&apos;. But I absolutely LOVE the world and the lore of this universe. There are three spirits in The Last Tinker, each has a different punch, a different special move, and a different problem to solve. You will find them throughout the story. There is the Red Spirit- Anger, the Green Spirit- Fear, and the Blue Spirit- Sadness. Each spirit is in charge of their own districts. Red Lizards (Red District), Blue Bears (Blue District), and Green Turtle-things (Green District). Which has torn Colortown apart and it&apos;s your job, as a Tinker, to bring them back together and to defeat the Bleakness (White).
<br>
<br>Sound is top notch, music is phenomenal, and the voice acting is comprised of oohs, awws, chirps, and other noises. I don&apos;t like the VA but you can easily turn it off in the options menu and still have SFX and music on. The music is your typical PS2 platforming game OST with some groovy and immersive songs.
<br>
<br>Now to the gameplay! Platforming is done by pressing forward &apos;W&apos; and &apos;Space&apos; will allow you to automatically jump to a specific platform. Combat is really interesting. So you punch with &apos;LMB&apos;, &apos;MMB&apos; up, and &apos;MMB&apos; down and you dodge with &apos;RMB&apos;. (There are also combos and different moves to unlock; for ex: &apos;RMB&apos;+ &apos;LMB&apos;) The Red Punch (&apos;LMB&apos;) can defeat the enemies in game, the green punch (&apos;MMB&apos; up) can make enemies scared and run into deadly traps, and the blue punch (&apos;MMB&apos; down) can immobilize enemies and are weak from the back. The Red Power is a, for lack of a better word, &apos;Berserk&apos; mode where your DMG is up and your speed is up. The Green Power lets you freeze time to solve puzzles, platform across fast moving objects, and position yourself in a tough fight. The blue power gives you invincibility against anything including the snow-like bleakness. There are also light puzzles which can be solved with your powers/ punches or with Biggs and Bomber. Biggs and Bomber are mushroom folk that use abilities to solve puzzles and to get collectables. Using different punches shows off their different abilities. There are also amazing boss fights.
<br>
<br>Additional Notes: There are many collectables to get throughout Colortown. While some story levels are bigger, the majority are quite linear. The game is also really easy. And the rail sections of the game are completely annoying and are really blurry so you can&apos;t see obstacles up ahead. I finished the game in 10 hrs. and there is a total of 14 Steam achievements.
<br>
<br>Final Thoughts: I recommend this game to anyone looking for an old-school 3d platformer reminiscent of Banjo Kazooie and Sly Cooper. With that being said, the game suffers from childlike dialogue, story, and presentation. But overall it&apos;s a wonderful experience that&apos;s worth playing through a few times!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-last-tinker-city-of-colors/user-reviews?user_review_id=4192941">Expand</a></span>

<br>It might have small flaws but i can easily oversee them considering the joy i had playing through it.</span>

<br>It might not be the deepest game that you can spend hundreds of hours playing. But the beautiful design, hilarious characters (the mushroom fellas especially) and most importantly the political message make this a game EVERYONE should pick up.
<br>
<br>It really stands out from the 1.000.000 mediocre, gloomy, AAA action-games these days.</span>

But really wanted to add a review for it. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-last-tinker-city-of-colors/user-reviews?user_review_id=7049958">Expand</a></span>
