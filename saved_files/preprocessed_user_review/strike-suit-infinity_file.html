The game requires a few minutes to master its controls, which aren&apos;t really complicated in the end. Overall, an very good game, especially for its price. Go for it </span>

<br>Incredibly high production values and fun fast gameplay.
<br>Gameplay itself reminds me of the classic Starlancer.
<br>That said, don&apos;t expect any great depth here  it is a straight up wave based arcade shooter....
<br>A few great hours of gaming to be had.</span>

I had no idea what polished, fun, challenging game I was buying when I spent 3 euro on this, going to pick up main story too.
<br>In this mode you fight wave after wave of enemy ships, you unlock upgrades and earn credits to spend on better pilots or ships to aid you in your fighting. It&apos;s truly an amazing moment when you can buy the bigger ships to help in your fight, like the frigates. First time you encounter enemy frigates you&apos;re like &quot;whoa&quot;, it really feels like a boss fight, taking down all the weak spots, then the game throws 2 or 3 at you.
<br>In combat mode you&apos;re a space fighter taking down other ships with missiles, machineguns etc., but you can transform in this badass mecha for a limited time to take down everything with high tech weaponry (which changes based on what Strike Suit did you choose).
<br>The visuals are stunning, beautiful, I don&apos;t care about graphics but sometimes I look at the backgrounds with awe.
<br>The sound and music are great and very fitting, I like them very much.
<br>The combat is fast-paced and pretty difficult, even if there are 16 levels, you&apos;ll be probably stuck on level 5-6 or something.
<br>I would recommend this for everyone, the price is a joke compared to the quality of the product.
<br>The only downsides I can find are :
<br>- Lack of multiplayer (local or not);
<br>- More buying options for flavour.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-infinity/user-reviews?user_review_id=3231653">Expand</a></span>

No you can&apos;t swoop through clouds or terrain, but the game isn&apos;t about that. The music is awesome, done by a very popular Japanese singer by the way and most of the time, its just catchy techno music. The game is about surviving waves of enemies in space. It is about you being a powerful badass Gundam style ship who can bring his own reinforcements to bear against enemy waves like fighters, bombers, cruisers, and carriers. The space battles are a joy to watch, and being in the thick of it is great! It reminds of the Star Wars Space battles where you see frigates bombing enemy starships, fighters being chased by interceptors, and you are the most powerful thing on the field. The backgrounds are gorgeous and some space battles have environmental hazards. One space set has you in an asteroid field, another has you near several space stations that you could crash into if you are not careful. The final level is on the verge of a freaking black hole for god sakes. Plus this game is only $7. If this was a triple A title, it could be $50 but it isn&apos;t. This game is better then its counterpart Strike Suit Zero because it is much more replayable. You compete for the highest score on the leaderboards, fight in various beautiful places in space and you actually feel you are in an awesome space battle. When you get to the final levels, the space battles are GIGANTIC to say the least (and the framerate during those huge fights still are stable I might add). This game is a must have for anyone who likes space games, shooters, or just people who like surviving waves of countless foes. Yea the controls take getting used to and even though the soundtrack is great, it is somewhat small in terms of music selection but you wont be focusing on that. Instead, you will enjoy shooting up enemy ships, competing for high scores, and watching a beautiful space battle take place among the stars. Must buy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-suit-infinity/user-reviews?user_review_id=3146169">Expand</a></span>
