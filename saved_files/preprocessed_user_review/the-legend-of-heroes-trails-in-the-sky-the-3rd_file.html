<br>Despite the new formula, the narrative is still among the strongest in any JRPG/RPG, the gameplay is a step up from FC/SC, featuring the largest cast of playable characters. And as always, music by JDK never fails to impress.
<br>
<br>Do note that The 3rd does not seem to directly propel the overarching plot of the Trails series, because its main role is to wrap up the Sky chapters while getting the audience interested in what&apos;s to come. What it does deliver is the following:
<br>1. Kevin&apos;s personal story.
<br>2. Additional depth/detail to every main character in the Sky Trilogy.
<br>3. Additional depth/detail to the world of West Zemuria.
<br>4. A lot of foreshadowing to future installments (Zero, Azure, Cold Steel)
<br>
<br>You can think of it as a playable Collector&apos;s Databook for your favorite manga series, but with its own self contained story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky-the-3rd/user-reviews?user_review_id=7276384">Expand</a></span>

Usually this sort of game I don&apos;t care that much for, since it&apos;s mostly a dungeon crawler and going through old past zones but in an altered state. The entire game is a wrap-up. I actually consider it a long, drawn out epilogue to the first two games.
<br>
<br>If this was any other game or perhaps series, I&apos;d probably give this a lower score or I would stop playing this, but I may be a bit bias in this review because I am a fan of the series. Taking any biases away, the game has fantastic music, unique for the title, and amazing and drawn out narrative, which is always what the series is known for.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s side stories for each characters and mini games you can play, which adds more fun to the game.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m only 10 hours into the game, so I still might have a bit to go, but I&apos;m curious to see how each character&apos;s story ends and to see how the characters ended up in the one big dungeon-like place called Phantasama that they explore throughout the entire game.
<br>
<br>I knocked the game down a couple points because like I said, dungeon crawling isn&apos;t my preference and it doesn&apos;t really fit in the series whether I like it or not. I know the writers love to expand on the series and this universe, but I feel this game is a bit unnecessary at times, other than to please the fans. Otherwise, since we do have this game, it&apos;s enjoyable for what it is nonetheless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky-the-3rd/user-reviews?user_review_id=7283530">Expand</a></span>
