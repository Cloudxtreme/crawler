Brute force is often a poor choice, be helpful and you will be rewarded ! The spellcasting does not hamper you once you master the system, moreover it isn&apos;t a hack&apos;n slash game. You do have a hard time protecting the town against very though enemies once, but this seems to be part of the story, and succeeds in making you tense for the rests of the game. Every puzzle has its solution, if you look for it long enough, and if you need a higher level just come back later. The only really annoying thing is maybe the automap, not very useful because unclear. 10/10 just to make up for all this hate, it is really an engrossing RPG game which deserves your attention, a more suitable note would be 8.5/10. Compared to Morrowind (both 2002) it is shorter and a little bit less gorgeous, it offers less freedom but it has more various environments and places, NPC immediately idenfiable, humorous situations, and always a subtle solution to all the quests.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arx-fatalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=401003">Expand</a></span>

It is a bit slow though, but instead of one button spells, it actually feels you are doing the casting and even some skill is required.

Years have passed but I still can&apos;t find game so deeply inspiring my imagination with sound, graphics and tale as it was done in Arx Fatalis. I still can feel those water drops, falling of cave ceilings here and there, you could almost feel the humidity of dark caves while moving deep into the underground cities. I can&apos;t find any disadvantages, any things done wrong or just bad ideas in this game. The interface is easy, accurate and intuitive, magic system, done with an new idea was refreshing and interesting to master. Sound, minimalistic music, NPCs voices all fit to each other making the world real and alive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arx-fatalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=2971435">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game has a pretty alright story. It can be a LITTLE linear tho, as it isn&apos;t open world. The game takes place in 8 different levels ( excluding some areas like the bunker or crypts ). Overall tho, you won&apos;t be exploring it all at once.
<br>
<br>The game has a pretty nice atmosphere. It&apos;s not sad and depressing, but it has a dark feeling. Apart from when in the town or the tavern where there are people, the game will feel lonely, you will feel completely alone.
<br>
<br>In terms of interactivity, you can do quite alot. One of the reasons this game is awesome is because nothing is obvious. After many playthroughs, there are still some secrets and intractable objects I&apos;ve not found or only recently found. This is pretty good saying there is only 8 levels/floors in the entire game.
<br>
<br>There is also the casting system. You basically hold whatever the cast button is bound to down, and click, drag, and release to make shapes that look like runes you&apos;ve previously picked up. Casting several runes together casts a spell.
<br>
<br>The game however, has some major problems.
<br>
<br>For starters, balance isn&apos;t big. Playing a caster makes you extremely powerful. Playing a warrior will be fine for a while, but near the end of the game, you will struggle greatly unless you&apos;ve got hundreds of potions. Similar thing with a stealthy build ( stealth build can still work ).
<br>
<br>The major problem with this title though, the thing that sets most people off is the buggyness. On some older systems ( 2000, XP ) The game might run fine. On newer systems though, you will get some serious compatibility issues.
<br>
<br>Putting compatibility issues aside, the game in general is extremely buggy. You won&apos;t see bugs like let&apos;s say... Someone clipping through a wall. But instead bugs of, dropping an item on the wrong object will cause the game to freeze, lockup and crash. There are also some lag issues on some systems.
<br>
<br>Not everything, but most of the bugs including crashes can be fixed with &quot;Arx Liberatis&quot;, one of the few unofficial patches for the game.
<br>
<br>&quot;What version should I get?&quot;
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve not tried the CD version, only GOG and Steam. While they are both very similar, I&apos;d say GOG is the winner, as it&apos;s DRM free and mildly less buggy.
<br>
<br>Graphics are of course dated, but look quite nice for the time. It basically looks like morrowind, but slightly higher polygons, higher res textures, better shaders, minus the reflective water and shadows.
<br>
<br>Amazing game. Has flaws but in my opinion, the trade offs are worth it, and some/most of the bugs are easily fixed with a patch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arx-fatalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=4778041">Expand</a></span>

<br>I wanted to give this a 10 to overcome the poor souls that couldn&apos;t figure this game out and gave it less than a 5. But, my actual score is 9.

<br>
<br>Apparently the developers wanted to created Ultima Underworld 3 but were unable to get the license from you know who, which is a shame. With stronger resources this game could have been very special indeed. For an old game (2002), the graphics are pretty good and sound in some instances quite amazing, the game engine has aged well. I played the game of Steam and in Windows 7 and it was more or less playable apart from some memory crashes - I learned to save often using all the save slots - you need to do this too. Especially when you move between levels. It is best to play the game without any background noise on such as the TV or radio - believe that. Not only will you get immersed in the game world, beautifully crafted by the designers, you won&apos;t miss key information said aloud by your character and then never repeated!
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a first person RPG/adventure set in a world where the sun has died so all races of the world live in a huge underground complex - the world is called Arx.
<br>
<br>You begin the game in a prison cell and yep, you guessed right, no memory of who you are! Wow, not seen that in a video game before. There follows an escape from prison and a gradual understanding of where you are and of your destiny. You escape your dungeon and then move onwards to different levels of the underground world, such as mining caves, spooky crypts, ice cavern (dragon) and a strange snake world!  It takes a while to learn the mechanics of the game - give it a chance! Above all read and print off the manual so you have it with you. Yes ladies and gentlemen, this game was produced in the days where manuals actually were required reading and gave hints on how to traverse the game. Believe me it will answer about 75% of your questions.
<br>
<br>Your character has the normal ST,INT,DEX etc stats as well as skills to develop such as magic, technical skill, intuition. Combat is similar to that found in Morrowind where I often found myself moving in and out of combat and swinging whatever weapon I was using at the time. Not great but ok. The magic system is something else, it is rune based and you need to draw patterns on screen with your mouse. This is pretty amazing and at the beginning you learn a new PC gaming skill - let&apos;s face it - that is pretty unique. Runes can be found or purchased and your journal will update to show the new spells you can cast. Oh - you reckon it would be pretty damn impossible to cast a fireball as a giant evil looking spider is looking to bite your head off? READ IMPORTANT - you can pre-save three magic spells! Read the manual properly for goodness sake - just do it.
<br>
<br>Your journal shows your character stats, armour, inventory, magic book of spells and runes, map and some key information about the game interface and quests you need to complete. I stress &quot;some&quot;. In following the game story - the journal is next to useless. Exploration is encouraged and the game engine allows you to do some innovative stuff. The map is pretty useless too. Use a fishing rod to catch fish and then cook them next to a flame. Combine water with flower to create dough and then bake to create bread. I think you can combine it with apple to make apple pie. Oh - you need to eat and your character will moan when he is hungry. Apparently hunger was pretty common in earlier versions of this game but I think the latter patches made this less acute. Saying that, I did go through a stage where I was baking and cooking stuff a lot! Later in the game I stopped hoarding food and just munched down anything I found.
<br>
<br>Your inventory is grid based and cannot be sorted, despite what some have said. You can stack some items and expand it later in the game. This could be better as you spend too much time on inventory management. On the first play through you end up hoarding. As you learn all the tricks and want to do another play through, it will be less problematic.
<br>
<br>The storyline is quite interesting, you have no say on what needs to be done and there are no dialogue options. At certain points in the story a cut scene will update you. There a lot of hidden items and locations in the game and exploration is encouraged. The world is beautifully put together and there are some real unique places and characters to interact with. It is quite complex and therefore some things are not explained properly and you will need to do some internet research to help you progress. Some tips:
<br>
<br>Buy the key ring and combine all found keys with it.
<br>Learn how to pre cast spells - especially fireball.
<br>Read the manual and print it off.
<br>Learn how to make potions - especially heal. Learn it. City of Arx Castle alchemist allows you to distil potions.
<br>Don&apos;t worry about cash - I ended up with about &#xA3;35k.
<br>Some magic rings will disappear from your inventory after a while, these have a 12/20 or something. Ring of Regeneration.
<br>Read the &apos;Races of Arx&apos; book before going to find the dragon.
<br>Find the activate portal spell in game or online and write it down in the manual - for some reason this spell does not show in your spell book.
<br>Your character needs decent magic to progress end game due to very difficult melee warriors that will polish you off in two whacks.
<br>Don&apos;t worry about hoarding food - just eat stuff as and when you find it.
<br>Save often.
<br>Shops are not always open, progress the story line and come back.
<br>Check the control options to ensure you don&apos;t waste all your healing potions when trying to crawl or sneak!
<br>
<br>Really is a great and unique game if you like RPG or first person dungeon adventure. World is quite amazing. Some difficulty with the game engine which most can be sorted by READING THE MANUAL. 40 hours+ on first play through and a few side quests not completed.
<br>

This is a great RPG with dark fantasy atmosphere and an interesting magic system. I love the dungeon design, creepy and non linear. The prison atmosphere in the beginninggis probably the best prison atmosphere in all games I played.  10/10</span>

(btw, this is what I really miss from most of the recent games...) Because of its age, Arx Fatalis might not appear as *shiny* as the new releases, but it has a gripping story, a great atmosphere and one of the best magic systems I have ever seen. (FYI, it is not like a pressbutton1forafireball stuff... You have to understand the meaning of different runes and the system how to compose a spell from them. So if you want to be a wizard in the game, you must have some brain, and not just select the wizard character at the start. (if you understand the logic, you can invoke a few hidden spells on your own)) In sum: If you are to fully utilize your new video card&apos;s directx10 capabilities and/or looking for pointless massacre, this is not for you. If you are looking for a great RPG with unique magic system, great atmosphere and you are looking for gaming experience, this is a must have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arx-fatalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=401068">Expand</a></span>

It, the rest of the interface, and the levels themselves all feel like they weren&apos;t tested enough. I think if Arkane had spent more time polishing this game it could have become one of my favourites. The graphics are also dated, but the game fell (and would have risen) on the basis of the UI.</span>

I found that the controls were indeed quirky in a very annoying manner. Combat, normal point and click could have been combined into one system, but it wasn&apos;t. And managing your inventory? Just as annoying. Space is very limited even if you get two extra bags. The magic system? Terrible. Not only do you have to draw out the spells, you have to deal with a casting time as well. Granted you can memorize up to three spells for quick access, three is certainly not enough. My biggest complaint is that the monsters do not spawn fast enough. You can be litterally stuck waiting for monsters to spawn so you can *try* to gain a level so you can build up your skills just so you can pick a lock to advance in the game. And one of the side quests? Buggy as heck. It won&apos;t spawn the notes so I can finish it. The only real redeeming thing about this game is the voice acting. It was done fairly well and it shows. It&apos;s too bad that same level of quality wasn&apos;t put into the rest of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arx-fatalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=397215">Expand</a></span>

The game can change from play to play (and with so few full on RPG&apos;s being released - that is great!) The graphics, sharp and very lifelike in the gloom, the speech (everything is spoken not typed, like MW) is excellent with fine acting and correct Orc grunting(!) The story is v.good with lots of twists and turns and the puzzle elements in dealing with problems are spot on and keep the world quite real. As this game can be bought quite cheaply now, you should go out and get it straight away. It will easily keep you going until Oblivian comes along next year (yes, I do think it will be delayed!) - an easy 9/10 for me!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arx-fatalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=382633">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>On the minus side, the game offers a limited world and a claustrophobic atmosphere, a bit of a letdown at a time when dungeon crawls were being replaced by open worlds; and it&apos;s rather silly since the latter are of course a simple graphical illusion. Also contributing to the impression are the NPCs, who are static and strongly lacking in character.
<br>
<br>That still makes for a decent game however, worthy of a score of 6 or 7, until Arx Fatalis suddenly decides to alienate half its players by becoming an arcade game. An entire level becomes a linear platformer in which you have to run and jump, or die at the first mistake. That far into the game, I tried; of course I tried, them bastards; and cursed Jowood; and finally blacklisted them, because that&apos;s how it works, boys.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arx-fatalis/user-reviews?user_review_id=5916337">Expand</a></span>

The kingdom of darkness comes. Bowels of the earth became our home. We humans once lived on the surface. Hardly
<br>, however, remains the man to remember and to tell these days. Once large and shining star is warming with its magical rays surface of our land. Once people, trolls, goblins, dragons and demons lived together, ignoring each other, absolute peace and quiet. But suddenly the so-called sun began little by little to cool until he disappeared forever from the sky. Then came the eternal darkness, and the ground froze from chilling cold and eternal. Many died, while others sought refuge in the ancient dwarven mines and called them a new home.
<br>
<br>Over the years, things have calmed down and everyone found its place under the ground. However, our existence was unfortunate. I have forgotten the taste of real food grown under the rays of bright sunshine. But one thing I know for sure - it is far more tasty than that which we are forced to grow with the help of magic. Today the only people who come to the surface of the earth, are members of the guild of wandering. They walk the icy areas hoping to find any sign of life. But will hardly succeed ...&#x201C;

<br>(excerpt from the unofficial chronicle of the Kingdom Arcs)
<br>
<br>To everyone&apos;s joy Arx Fatalis
<br>is not just another nondescript and bland RPG, which was spawned in the market. Arcane Studios development team manages to carry us into a world reminiscent of the dark, illuminated only by the flames of the torches finally oxidize, dungeons of classic games like Ultimo Underworld and Stone Keep. World populated with creatures that exist only in fairy tales and legends. A place where the magic of honor and is considered an integral part of everyday life of each creature.
<br>The protagonist in Arx Fatalis , ie you suffering from total memory loss. At the outset of the game he wakes up in a prison cell.
<br>
<br>Prisoner in the kingdom of goblins and no memory of who he is and how he got here. Your task is to get him out and help him recover his lost memory. Contrary to his will, he will become a mercenary King Lanshaya
<br>r and little by little you will find that the whole world who knows, faces a huge threat - a powerful demon named Akba&apos;s  eating death, misery and sorrow of the people.
<br>
<br>Naturally, you are the one who has to prevent his desire to reign eternal chaos. The smell of stale It lies in the narrow, low and dark corridors. The only places at which air leaks are small and narrow shadowy tunnels associated with the surface of the earth. This game can definitely astound you with their mind-blowing setting. The very thought of life underground, the fact that you will not even see a single ray of sunlight more terrified me. Generally, the atmosphere in the game is very depressing. But after a half hour game these small, narrow, low and stinking of stale air corridors are starting to look comfortable and feeling of claustrophobia disappears completely.
<br>
<br>Perspective in Arx Fatalis is a first person and the management does not differ in anything from that of most role-playing games of this type. On the other hand, the more familiar with her world, the stronger will realize how rich and interactive it is. You can interact with almost everything Which you glimpse the sight. A small example of this is connected with the eating habits of our man.
<br>
<br>For example, your character will not want to eat raw fish, so it can not hurt to improvised a little fire and bake aquatic creature. And a plurality of possible combinations of food products. If mix water and flour to make the dough, which you bake. Then we will get bread. But there is another alternative. If your hand is rolling pin, you can roll out the mixture to add an apple and put the resulting slow fire. The end result will be apple pie. If you just starved to death and there is nothing more appropriate to eat, find simple rod and combine it with a rope. This will give you a hook to help you to sialic  little fish from the nearest stream.
<br>
<br>If you at a later stage of the game it turns out that you need a rope, just use the weapon and cut the cord imaginary - that you already have again rod and rope. I  think you convinced how amazing is interactivity, but these are just small examples of opportunities in this game.
<br>
<br>As gameplay Arx Fatalis remind briefly and Thief, because often you can choose whether to sneak quietly near his enemy or use brute force. At the outset of the game, while in prison, will overhear conversation between two goblins who discuss their dissatisfaction with dirty dishes.  To make them angry and set them against their other brother, quietly replace the clean dishes on the table beside them dirty, then enjoy what will follow. The system for doing magic It is a mix of Ultimo VIII and Black &amp; White. From the dungeons of Arx Fatalis are scattered dozens thoroughly well hidden runes.
<br>Their correct combination (unfortunately this happens automatically) leads to a different standard for role-playing games, but still useful magic spells. Each rune is triggered only when using the mouse redrawn typical of her character.
<br>
<br>At the very beginning it is interesting, but as the game becomes a bit tedious and even difficult. However, you can save once to three remade spells and use them quickly in the tense moments. Whether you scroll through the game as a brutal warrior, thief or subversive adept spell caster, depends entirely on you. Freedom of action and interactivity in Arx Fatalis, her catchy story line and claustrophobic atmosphere of a medieval type contribute to the overall, almost perfect image of the game. Adding to all this and more or less decent graphics and sound system, will receive one of
<br>the best RPG.
