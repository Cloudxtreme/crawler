<br>All jokes aside, I had so much hope for this game... It broke it all. So it&apos;s a &quot;skill-based scoring shooter&quot;. The game gives you grade for each fights then another grade for the level. Sadly the game comes with multiple issues.
<br>
<br>First of all, a lot of enemies are melee enemies. As expected for melee enemies, they&apos;re pretty powerful when it comes to hitting, to the point most of them will 3-4 shot you, and the most powerful will effectively one shot you. Problem is : they&apos;re fast. So they&apos;re fast, most of the time hard to kill (not insta kill at all, like 2-3 or more shotgun hits to kill the biggest bad guys that become common as early as in the second level), and they hit hard. You see the problem right : they have no weak point. You can&apos;t evade the average bad guys by strafing, only the dash will do it, but the intricacy of the arenas and the fact that most enemies will spawn all around the arena will often make you evade an attack only to dash into an enemy you didn&apos;t see or even hear.
<br>
<br>So you don&apos;t hear them, waves don&apos;t spawn in one point but at all corners of the arena, and the bad guys are absolute killing machine that would require having them grouped to evade them efficiently. But &quot;hey&quot;, the game tells me&quot;, look this thing you just picked up in the second level, it&apos;s a damage upgrade&quot;. Wait what ? A damage upgrade in a skill based FPS that gives me a rank for each fights ? Also the possibility to give some &quot;stylish actions&quot; a bonus effect, but ONLY after the second level ? Is this WoW or a skill based shooter ? Now, if I was at least able to get an A rank on the first levels without those features by playing more than decently ok, but I can&apos;t. No matter how hard I try the game clearly wants me to come back to those levels later with upgrades to get the rank, not with my skills, but with my new toys -_- Getting a 180 flick headshot on CS is easier than getting an A rank on the DESYNC&apos;s first level with no upgrades
<br>
<br>This is not proper game design. This is a promising idea flawed by an attempt at appealing to modern gamers. Only players who like shiny new toys ALL the time will like this in such a FPS. Those who were coming for the experience of a fast paced shooter where skill matters and is used to get the upper hand on the enemies can refrain from buying, for this game is essentially the opposite of it. DESYNC, you were supposed to save my faith in game designing a non-frustrating but hard indie game, you sinked it even further.
