Pros: - Nice changes in scenery. - Serviceable graphics. - Easy to move around/navigation. - Some puzzles are interesting I guess. - Puzzles aren&apos;t hard so the game can be finished without ever having to resort to a walk through. Cons: - Uninspired characters (mostly cheap stereotypes). Even the main character is &quot;normal&quot; - The mission is pretty boring (stopping a guy trying to control the tea market) - Missing cutscenes when solving parts of some puzzles that make one think, &quot;Wait a minute, that didn&apos;t make sense, how did that work&quot; (although these are kept to a relative minimum) - Uninspired dialog that at times tries to be funny, but I never once found myself laughing... the closest I came was &quot;Potato Face&quot;.. A lot of dialog is repetitive.. doesn&apos;t recognize you&apos;ve ask it before so you often hear the same boring stuff over and over which takes away the mood/atmosphere. After a while I just found myself skipping the dialog as I stopped caring. - Statue&apos;esqu characters during dialog or analyzing items (most notably that Amanda girl) - A bunch of small things. 1) Common sense things that should be able to be done during puzzles, but can&apos;t &quot;I can&apos;t reach that item&quot; yet there is a ladder or steps right there.. Climb up the F#$# ladder! Yet later as a 2ft kid you can reach something 10 feet high no problem. 2) Outdated avatars. &quot;Oh no they took my knife&quot; yet you play half the game with your character clearly still carrying his knife. 3) Outdated dialog. Quest related to a certain dialog remains and you start talking about stuff you already did like you haven&apos;t done it. 4) Encountered a nasty bug that froze during a cutscene and instead of re-doing 45 minutes of gameplay I quit and never finished the game (it was about 3/4ths of the way through in Dr. T&apos;s office near a meat-eating plant).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jack-keane/user-reviews?user_review_id=412906">Expand</a></span>

I downloaded the demo first and luckily i didn&apos;t buy it. It&apos;s a very bad game, the voice overs are so bad and the whole game is not worth $26 if i were to ever buy this game id never pay any more than $5, the whole click and point is very annoying.</span>

<br>There are some locations (the plane scene) that are interesting but overall this game is a mediocre adventure game that&apos;s too long. I think it&apos;s the main problem with it. It&apos;s too long that developers and designers didn&apos;t have time to focus on basic animations and make the game better. If it was half of what it is, I think it could be a much better game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jack-keane/user-reviews?user_review_id=7264151">Expand</a></span>
