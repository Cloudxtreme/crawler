The story is hardly interesting and barely fleshed out. The only new mechanic introduced is a fear system in which evil using a mix of hallucinogenic bombs, spikes, and the Indian version of iron knuckles to scare enemies into running away.There are &quot;new&quot;activities that are just reskins of the ones present in the main game. Gameplay is still fun but,strangely enough I experienced more glitches than in the main campaign. The screen would temporarily freeze while driving a coach and activities would reset for no reason at all. In the end I can&apos;t recommend this at its full asking price and give it a five out of ten. It&apos;s not terrible but it&apos;s not great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jack-the-ripper/user-reviews?user_review_id=5902098">Expand</a></span>
