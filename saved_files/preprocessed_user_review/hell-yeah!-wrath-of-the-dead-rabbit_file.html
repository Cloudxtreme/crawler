<br>If you haven&apos;t seen it, check out Totalbiscuit&apos;s WTF to see an example of the awesome graphic style and dark humor that kept me laughing still 3 hours in.  Addictive, fast-paced, with a killer rabbit and an art style that intensifies the humor, this is perhaps the only platformer I would recommend at $15 today.
<br>******
<br>My complaints for this game is that the UI does not work well for mouses with more than 3 buttons (which can be overlooked by not using the other buttons) and that the weapon switch system forces you to go through multiple weapons to find the one you want, which can be irritating in a fast-paced game like this. ******
<br>Those detractors, however, do not outweigh the fact that this game is in many way simply bad ass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hell-yeah!-wrath-of-the-dead-rabbit/user-reviews?user_review_id=2669926">Expand</a></span>

Great style and musical background, combined with hurricane gameplay and psychedelic humor. Definitely this game is a masterpiece, need more games such this.</span>

The game is a bit difficult in the beggining, mainly if you use mouse and keyboard,but with some deaths and retry you begin to learn the mechanics os the game.The gameplay flows and it turns challenging and great to play. A must have and a must buy for such a little price.</span>

<br>
<br>The game also feels to hold the player&apos;s hand too much. Every time you unlock a new path or anything, the game needs to s....l...o...w...l...y  move the camera to the place where something happens. You are forced to read the dialogue even after dying and unfortunely the dialogue also spoils too much about how to defeat the bosses most of the time.
<br>
<br>With less hand helding, more variety to mini-games and jokes, the game could be very good. Now it just falls into medicore tier, being remembered about something (Probably due to Total Biscuit&apos;s &quot;WTF is...&quot; video) but not something you will come back to. Still, it&apos;s a nice try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hell-yeah!-wrath-of-the-dead-rabbit/user-reviews?user_review_id=2730905">Expand</a></span>

Hell yeah have this one, but levels looks same and this kill the only thing I could enjoy. Third - music. Sometimes not bad, but in a whole - **** And from the platformer, like Hell yeah i expect bright humour. And this is terrible mistake Arkedo did. Every joke in the game you can find in another one, like Mortal Kombat, Sonic the Hedgehog, Duck Hunt and others. This scrappy blanket shows that developers have poor fantasy and the game is absolutely secondary. It can only make you cry, not fun. I regret I payed 250 rubles. If you want to play good platformer game - play Rayman Origins. You&apos;ll find there everything, you could expect from Hell Yeah, except maybe blood.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hell-yeah!-wrath-of-the-dead-rabbit/user-reviews?user_review_id=2687584">Expand</a></span>

<br>Everything that should have added depth fails to do so. &quot;The Island&quot; where all the defeated monsters end up seems pointless and I only ever once got a health boost from it. Not sure why it needed it&apos;s own section of the game when it doesn&apos;t have any purpose. Weapons are also useless, as none of them seem any better than the other for specific situations. I was using the Revolver for pretty much all of the game quite comfortably. including the last boss.
<br>
<br>Could have been quite a good game if it had more content and the existing content was more fleshed out.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d also like to point out, the controls are not great either. The human thumb cannot operate the right-analog stick AND the A button at the same time!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hell-yeah!-wrath-of-the-dead-rabbit/user-reviews?user_review_id=2678654">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pro&apos;s
<br>1.It&apos;s fun at the start, hell everything is fun AT the start.
<br>2.The graphics are pretty decent
<br>
<br>Con&apos;s
<br>1.Repetitive! So so repetitive! You do the same thing over and over and OVER! they try to mix it up with other things, like mini-games and having you pilot a sub and what not, but the game never changes.
<br>2.The writing, at first you think it&apos;s funny, but then you realize that it gets less and less funny, and as the repetitiveness lowers your 5th grade humor level you laugh less and less.
<br>3.The weapons, they give you about 8 or 9, but they really don&apos;t do anything new, the machine gun shoots lots of low end damage bullets, while the shot gun shoots a very large spread of bullets, I found my self using whatever I had at the moment most of the game.
<br>4.Clues, more then once I sat there questioning what I was supposed to do, and would get nothing, so I would have to check the net.
<br>5.Bugs, while I didn&apos;t find any but one, it was really an annoying one, when I would alt-tab out something would happen, and when I came back the music would die out, forcing me to restart the game.
<br>6.The design of the game, while it was supposed to be like metroid  it ended up feeling boring and just not creative, I found my self rushing through levels just so I could get to the end boss and finish the damn game.
<br>7.The combos, while at the start they seem really fun and cool, but there are about 10 that you do, and with over 100 boss&apos;s you see them over and over and you&apos;re unable to skip them, at the end of the game I couldn&apos;t stand watching them.
<br>8.Story, The start of the story is fun, but like everything else in this game it drags on with out any kind of up date and you end up not caring about anything at all.
<br>
<br>All in all I gave this game a 2/10 and not a 0 because it&apos;s cheap, and while I really didn&apos;t enjoy it someone else might., but I would suggest you wait tell it goes on sale because if you&apos;re like me after an hour of playing this you will question if it was even worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hell-yeah!-wrath-of-the-dead-rabbit/user-reviews?user_review_id=2877867">Expand</a></span>

The reason you continue to play through games is because they typically offer a series of rewards. While you can change hats, weapons, and skins for your &quot;Wheel of Death,&quot; it all falls flat because the main focus of this game is spectacle. Ok music coupled with a messy background and constant movement of EVERYTHING make what you can and can&apos;t interact with a nebulous area; while odd hit-boxes and unskippable dialogue make the game infuriating. It can&apos;t decide if it wants you to slog through it all with a vast reservoir of health, or just instantly kill you with a slight misstep. I found the game to be infuriating as you can&apos;t do really anything without it stopping to zoom in on something, starting a conversation that usually amounts to drivel, or forcing you into a minigame that gives you a second to figure out the rules or instantly fails you. There was a huge amount of care that went into the animation and characters, but reused &quot;boss&quot; death animations and aesthetic changes that yield no impact detracted even from that. The quirky style and the death animations are REALLY the only thing different about this game, but some of them are odd in that they have no connection to the minigame you played for the animation to play and then they start to repeat. The story might as well not exist and the writing is on par with any Saturday morning cartoon that&apos;s on before the show you really want to watch.
<br>If you&apos;re looking for a platformer, there are free ones that are better than this.
<br>If you&apos;re looking for flashy action, Bayonetta is great.
<br>If you&apos;re looking for something that might put you in a coma with how amazingly uninspired the game is, I wholeheartedly recommend Hell Yeah.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hell-yeah!-wrath-of-the-dead-rabbit/user-reviews?user_review_id=3546563">Expand</a></span>

There is no in-game volume slider, and settings are barebones to say the least. This wouldn&apos;t be that bad if it weren&apos;t for the sudden audio peaks throughout the levels. If you can look past the poor port, you may actually have a nice experience though.</span>

I spent a lot of money in many kind of digital rubbish or stuff, which is after less than half hour boring. But this game can be deadly without the blood-pressure pills. It&#xB4;s even not to hard for a guy over 40 yards (is the 150 now full?) At least the sound, music and graphics are really great to fantastic !</span>

One of the most funniest and coolest games out there.

The plot is simple, funny, and it&apos;s easy for people to understand. The graphics give a cartoony feel to the whole game and that soundtrack sounds really awesome.
<br>
<br>And now for the game play. It&apos;s very simple. You can drill, shoot, finish off enemies, and jump! The jump feature kind of feels like slow floating upward. Now let&apos;s talk about upgrades. Upgrades are THE MOST important thing in this game because you&apos;re going to be dying a lot. I mean A LOT. So you&apos;re gonna have to have a whole lot of money by your side. There&apos;s a lot of treasure in the certain worlds but as much as you kill the big monsters, you can also capture them and force them to do your bidding and command them to collect cash and rare items that can help you on your quest to destroy the pictures that have been leaked online. Lots and lots of upgrades also comes with lots and lots of skins for your blade and your head! You want to be a cowboy using a doughnut drill? Then you can be a cowboy using a doughnut drill! This game is really fun and I highly recommend it to everyone. Critics really give this game a bad name because it isn&apos;t Call of Duty and I feel like it needs more praise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hell-yeah!-wrath-of-the-dead-rabbit/user-reviews?user_review_id=6134767">Expand</a></span>

Wrath of the Dead Rabbit may look like an engaging platformer at first glance because of its cartoony art style and a promise of a crazy, adrenaline-fueled adventure but the actual product gives its players nothing more than a mediocre experience and unchallenging gameplay. Granted, the game starts off strong and sets its comedic tone in a mature yet quirky fashion but it quickly goes downhill once the lack of difficulty becomes apparent and the looming repetitiveness sets in. I&apos;m still giving this a recommended even though I didn&apos;t enjoy it that much because I can see the potential and it&apos;s hard not to see its appeal over a select audience. If it works out its kinks in a future update, I may change my opinion about it.
<br>
<br>Has a mature yet comedic tone though some jokes fall flat and may make one cringe, especially the pop culture and self-referential humor.
<br>Appealing art direction. What you see in the store page is what you get in the game: a cartoony version of hell that&apos;s oozing with style and gore.
<br>Metroidvania-style gameplay albeit at a much relaxed pace and with simpler mechanics. Too bad that the level design is so-so for a platformer and exploration doesn&apos;t yield rewards.
<br>Controls quickly change according to what peripheral you&apos;re using at the moment and can be rebinded. Also, KB+M can be used in the menus and UIs which is a really nice touch considering that most AAA ports don&apos;t do this stuff. The problem with the controls - which many players are experiencing - is that there&apos;s some sort of extra momentum with every action, making everything feel slippery.
<br>PC-exclusive options are very limited. Graphics options only consists of resolution and fullscreen toggle. Volume sliders are nowhere to be seen.
<br>I haven&apos;t experienced any crashes whatsoever but the game has a bug where it mutes the music indefinitely when alt+tabing for too long.
<br>Amazing soundtrack.
<br>
<br>And there you have it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hell-yeah!-wrath-of-the-dead-rabbit/user-reviews?user_review_id=6945566">Expand</a></span>
