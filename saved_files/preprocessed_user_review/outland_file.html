<br>I am sure every gamer does it from time to time. For instance, I always wonder what kind of a game would come out when we combined Devil May Cry franchise with Diablo franchise. As if you were playing Diablo, but you need to press right buttons at the right time to perform skills to keep your combo up. There is no pressing your skill buttons when cooldowns are up, you need to sweat to perform your skills and moves! I don&#x2019;t know, maybe there are already games like that.
<br>
<br>Anyway, I suppose some developers at Housemarque were wondering what would be the result if they wanted to mix Ikaruga with Super Metroid. The result is a whole new game; Outland! Outland is a 2D platformer game uses action and puzzle elements together. What Outland offers may not seem unique but every game is somewhat similar to some other game. I mean, from this perspective, every game is one way or another, a derivative of another game that was released before it. However, in terms of combining different elements in it, Outland is unique in my opinion.

- the energies idea is interesting; it works as platform (although, the large amount of life makes the hurdles a bit too forgiving)
- the bosses are great. I give one point just for them.

<br>First, the good:
<br>
<br>- the energies idea is interesting; it works as platform (although, the large amount of life makes the hurdles a bit too forgiving)
<br>- the bosses are great. I give one point just for them.
<br>- it&apos;s a stilish game - at least the first map, and the bosses, look really great
<br>
<br>The meh:
<br>
<br>- wall jumping has fixed trajectory; this is a missed chance for more skillful playing
<br>- the variety and strategy of the enemies are good enough; maybe not great, but good enough.
<br>- the story is not too good, but not too bad. summary: everybody on earth goes **** crazy; the player beats the crap out of everybody
<br>
<br>The negative:
<br>
<br>- the art style looks flat after a while; although individually taken, the environments are aesthetically interesting, they look somewhat the same as a whole
<br>- the upgrade system is bland - only life and charge energy
<br>- the upgrade system is fueled by money. after a while, colleting money becomes uninsteresting; in order to &quot;buy&quot; (offer money!?) the upgrade from the most obvious upgrade locations, it&apos;s enough to collect the accessible money.
<br>- WHY SHOWING A GUIDE!!! WHY!!! It completely ruins the metroidvania experience. completely!!!!
<br>
<br>All in all, it very much fails as metroidvania, because it lacks the depth, but it pleasantly succeeds as a platform.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/outland/user-reviews?user_review_id=6931490">Expand</a></span>
