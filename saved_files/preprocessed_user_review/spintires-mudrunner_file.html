I found this hard to believe. &apos;It&apos;s a trucking sim&apos; I thought. &apos;What can it have in common with these games?&apos; After about a hundred hours I finally understand. It has that fantastic eastern European thing going on that most games can only hope to emulate. Sure it&apos;s a bit wonky, but if you&apos;ve played any of the aforementioned games you&apos;ll get the idea. The atmosphere is bleak and amazing; the game itself a diamond in the rough. Essentially this is a physics engine pi&#xE8;ce de r&#xE9;sistance. If you have done any 4WDing you will appreciate that nothing has done mud, sand or water physics better.
<br>
<br>Ostensibly it&apos;s a game about transporting logs across a boggy map, but within this simple premise is one of the best sandbox games ever created. Playable solo or with a friend (or three if you&apos;ve got them), this game excels at making the mundane magnificent. Equipped with an arsenal or half a dozen trucks which can be outfitted in a multitude of ways, you will grind, bump, bash, winch and trawl your way through each of the six maps and within find transcendence.
<br>
<br>All the criticisms are legitimate: The camera is frustrating, the gear layout confusing and the interface barely passable. I raise these problems to highlight the fact that I still believe this game is worth a 10/10.
<br>
<br>If you think you may like a well executed sandbox where physics is everything then do yourself a favour. If you think the idea of problem-solving how to recover a trailer-full of lost logs that you&apos;ve dropped by getting too macho on a deserted, rocky beach in the moonlight is your cup of tea... pick up this game.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a quirky, brilliant masterpiece of bleak, lonely perfection. If you&apos;re not rolling your eyes yet then buy it, play it, delight in it and finally adore it for all its strange perfection.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spintires-mudrunner/user-reviews?user_review_id=7809306">Expand</a></span>
