It&apos;s storming, and you are driving your car through the Nebraska landscape on the way home while having a conversation on the cell phone w/ your parents and brother (conversation in text on the screen).  As you drive through the storm you get to know the family&apos;s problems and perhaps identify w/ a young adult who&apos;s trying to strike out in life for the first time.  Note, this is not a game as much as it is a multimedia presentation w/ a few user interface controls.  It&apos;s a good story, the art design is nice, and the visuals and sounds create a nice atmosphere, but there&apos;s not a lot beyond that.  If this story appeals to you go for it, but understand there&apos;s not really gameplay as much as reading the story and watching how the visuals interact w/ the story that&apos;s happening.  It&apos;s targeted to a specific audience.  I was curious about the title, and thought it was well done, but at the same time it won&apos;t leave me thinking about it after I&apos;ve seen it.  Overall a mixed review, but again if you&apos;re curious about it it&apos;s a good experience for what it is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/three-fourths-home/user-reviews?user_review_id=4558340">Expand</a></span>
