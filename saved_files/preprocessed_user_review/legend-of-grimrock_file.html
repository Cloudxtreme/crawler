It&apos;s just like a sequel to Dungeon Master 1, with a little bit of Lands of Lore mixed in? And the production quality (= graphics and such) is pretty high, especially when you know that the game was made by only 4 people!! It&apos;s just an old school dungeon crawled with hex-by-hex movement, real time combat, rune magic, easy and somehow intuitive character&apos;s stat system. I&apos;m having great fun with it, and with starting price about 12 dollars it&apos;s just a bargain! If you have ever played Dungeon Master, Lands of Lore, Ishar or Eye of the Beholder, this is a must have for you!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2297998">Expand</a></span>

Catlin, I feel you must either be too young to appreciate this type of game that would fill you with nostalgia, or you have a short attention span. While I won&apos;t quite give it a &apos;masterpiece&apos; title, I will give it a 10 because it is just that good. My ONLY complaint would be the lack of more character portraits to choose from, but that&apos;s pretty minor and can be added in later. I love the that the option is included to turn off auto-mapping and you can print out included graph paper to map it yourself. Old school D&amp;D players will love that! I&apos;m a bit too scared to try it...for now :-)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2295462">Expand</a></span>

I keep coming up to new enemies, and even when you run into old ones, there are so many different ways you can fight them with the whole real-time movement. The puzzles aren&apos;t too hard so far. Have spent around 10 minutes on a few areas, only to find the solution was so close all along. The environment is just awesome. Sure the tiles are repeated, but what do you expect in a dungeon game. Loot is pretty superb as well. Keep finding different armour with different trade-offs. Haven&apos;t even beaten the first dungeon of many to come and already I can say this game was worth the $15 it goes for when not on sale. And I didn&apos;t even have to spend that much with the pre-order! Great game! If you loved older dungeon crawlers or are just looking for a new game to play, this should be at the top of your to-get list! Very well made. Looking forward to the new dungeons and other things to come for this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2295375">Expand</a></span>

I played Dungeon Master plenty, Secret of the Silver Blades/Pools/etc old TSR D&amp;D PC fare, and I am a huge fan of the much maligned Wizards &amp; Warriors, so I should be overjoyed to be playing a resurrected high res romp into The Oldschool memories of yesteryore... but tis not to be, as this game just plain sucks. It&apos;s not that it&apos;s hard, as I play every game I own on the hardest mode available because I love challenging, thinking games, and I don&apos;t consider this game inherently hard as it&apos;s far too simple to be difficult. No, it&apos;s the maddening design flaws that marked those older dungeon crawler titles have been resurrected too, and in some cases they&apos;re even worse because this is 2012 and such poor design is unacceptable. Pixel hunts? Come now, this is 2012. Nobody wants to scan low res wall texture after low res floor texture (repeated 100 quadrillion times throughout the course of this bore) looking for a slightly different looking piece of rock that the developers want you to click on to continue.
<br>
<br>How about the utterly dull story, lack of characterization, lack of NPCs, lack of dialogue, lack of character customization, terrible art design, incredibly dull and repetitive dungeons, lack of ability to see your characters or their equipment, and not even a 2D paperdoll? What about the lack of essential hotkeys? I&apos;m sure everyone loves clicking 600 times a minute for a game that, had it been released in 1990, would not have had mouse support. Click to pick up the sandals, click to drop sandals on a character, press 1 or click on char face for inventory, click to pick up key, click to place key on character, click key on character to pick key back up, click key on keyhole to unlock door, click door to open. Why no hotkey for auto loot? Why not even allow doubleclicking an item to pick it up? Why make the interface excessively difficult and cumbersome? A staff of 4 isn&apos;t an excuse -- it only takes 1 person to design a workable interface, and you failed.
<br>
<br>How about pushing the user into dead ends that require a reload to continue, and entirely without warning? What about the player who saves after passing a dead end &quot;point of no return&quot; as I did twice within the first 30 minutes of the game, necessitating a total restart both times as the autosave was all the way back at the beginning of the level? Appallingly bad, frustrating, and stupid design.
<br>
<br>I was an idiot for not testing this game before I paid money for it. I bought it on the strength of metacritic user aggregate, the fact that I am a massive fan of oldschool strategic/puzzle dungeon crawlers, and the positive word of mouth, but I should have tried it for myself first. It&apos;s bland, frustrating, uninspired, full of design flaws, and desperately dull. At least it was cheap and easily forgotten.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2518307">Expand</a></span>

Grimrock has a great idea, but a flawed execution.  The worst of all is the painful way you&apos;re forced to spell cast by manually clicking on runes every time EVEN when you&apos;re just repeating the same spell.  This badly needs to get patched.  It&apos;s like a mini game testing your mouse dexterity and it will kill you over and over.  Also the game difficulty goes right off the charts by the time you&apos;re halfway through.  I&apos;m all for a challenge, but Grimrock&apos;s &quot;Normal&quot; difficulty would be &quot;Nightmare&quot; by the standards of any game I&apos;ve ever played, and there&apos;s no way to lower the difficulty without starting over.  Also, in the later half of the game, dodging becomes crucial, but the game&apos;s odd, chess-board like grid movement system makes this a frustrating crap shoot of random death. The game makes a fantastic first impression, but eventually turns into a frustrating reload-a-thon only the most OCD gamers will put up with.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2298536">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s definetly an old school RPG, with rooms and corridors and going into keeper and deeper levels of the dungeon. You get four characters in your party, four races to choose from, and the three classic classes, fighter, mage and rouge. You never get to see your characters, and you all only take up one space, so all of your guys are working together as a unit, though individuals can still die if you don&apos;t watch what you&apos;re doing.. You can also pick custom character portraits for them, which make it a lot of fun if you make up your team from your friends. The combat&apos;s pretty sweet and the puzzles are good enough to be fun and not frustrating, and some pretty interesting **** happens at around level 5, if you&apos;re paying attention. Pick this one up.
<br>
<br>Soon there&apos;s gonna be a map editor, so we can make our own sweet dungeons. I was also slightly surprised to see that levels aren&apos;t randomly generated, that would have been awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2520451">Expand</a></span>

Brings everything you expect from a dungeon crawler game - lots of monsters to beat, weapons to fight with, spells to cast, puzzles to solve. Those vary from easy ones to very hard to crack, however each puzzle is somewhat based on a common sense and you must think to crack it, with or without the help of ingame notes you find on your escape from Grimrock. The only drawbacks I have found is that the walls of the dungeon could be more variable and the spell casting system could be working on some user friendlier system - it is a bit annoying to select the same runes again in the heat of the battle. Also, the realtime fighting might not suit everyone. But despite of these drawbacks, every dungeon fan must have this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2338659">Expand</a></span>

Well, if you do and liked them, you are really going to love Legend of Grimrock. It&apos;s just like old times. If you are to &quot;young&quot; to remember this game, it is a classical old-fashioned dungeon crawler experience. Find a 2x2 square and start slashing at the monsters and never ever get cornered.</span>

The game is simple enough to start without too much introduction, and the early levels serve as active tutorials that doesn&apos;t seem like tutorials at all. But the game also offers a very wide range of customization in terms of your characters, classes, skill points and traits. The puzzles are challenging, but not hard. There are usually clues all around, and none of the puzzles are unrealisitcly difficult. The game can be very challenging at times, but its not unfair, so after a big fight, it will usually let you have a breather. Combat takes a while to get used to. If you stand still, you&apos;ll get pounded to the floor, but this new form of combat is a nice change from what we are used to.
<br>
<br>I would have liked it if there was an option to reset skill points without having to start the game over. After I had played the first 3-4 hours, I had gained some valuable knowledge about the game, and felt that I would be better off by starting over  and indeed, I was a lot more powerful when I made it to the same point of the game. I feel that being able to reset your points could negate this   I could have spent my skill points differently, without being as strong as my newly customized characters was, and I feel that new players shouldn&apos;t be penalized quite this much by making bad mistakes early on in the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2950145">Expand</a></span>

I generally don&apos;t like that kind of stuff, so that was very disappointing for me.
<br>It also seems that one doesn&apos;t get anything for collecting certain things throughout the dungeon. Nothing unlocked, no special artwork, not even a text mentioning how awesome you are. I guess they&apos;re just there for achievements.
<br>Aside from these things, I&apos;ve thoroughly enjoyed this adventure though. And at ~15 hours pretty lengthy too (especially considering the price).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2570090">Expand</a></span>

<br>Don&apos;t expect anything like Skyrim, or the likes of that, because this IS old school.
<br>Graphics, sound and athmosphere is above decent. Many hours of exploration to do, if you&apos;re into these kind of games.
<br>I don&apos;t regret buying it at full price.</span>

<br>
<br>They get most things very right. The graphics are attractive, the gameplay fits the old games but lacks most of the aggravations from any quality issues (it runs smoothly as you&apos;d want). The best thing about the game is the puzzles. There are many, they don&apos;t really repeat, just a few are pulled from old games, and they&apos;re hard - keep you from going further in the game - then just great when you solve them.
<br>
<br>There are a few minor things with them, such as not realizing things you shouldn&apos;t have to on earlier levels that can matter in later levels, in two situations I can think of.
<br>
<br>My over feeling of the game is that it&apos;s just wonderful for the things it gets right - but there are flaws.
<br>
<br>The parties are a bit simplistic, you don&apos;t get enough information to make good picks, the way magic works doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense in how you learn spells but the game&apos;s primary mechanic for learning new spells teaches some very late and some not at all; the party mechanics are not well balanced, you can make mistakes, there is inflexibility if you do. The story is pretty throwaway, a few seconds at the beginning to get you in the dungeon.
<br>
<br>But the game feels polished, and provides a large amount of entertainment, if you like the idea of a very fun old-design dungeon crawler with a lot of good puzzles.
<br>
<br>Name the best 10 games you have played, and I can find what I think are big flaws in each, while still agreeing they&apos;re deserving of &apos;best of all time&apos;. This is one of the best games in years IMO.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d really like to give it a 10 despite the minor flaws, but they&apos;re just big enough to make it a 9.5. I could be wrong. Oh heck, while writing I realize it deserves that 10, with the criticisms.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2511565">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s updated graphics and souund make it a pleasure to play, the format is old school, but the look is as moden as any out. I have seen some gripe about the combat for being too difficult. Personally I find it to be much easier to play then say many of the great Westwood Studio classics that pretty much are the model for this. I think it has more to do with kids being spoiled now. Every battle is tough, and you do have to prep your chars between battles....you will die from time to time, but as long as you use your brain, and prep your chars you&apos;ll do okay....and yes you do have to play the game of hit and run at times, I used to have to do that in those older games too....I think again, this game is going to be excellent for people nostalgic for those older games, and their difficulty level, but some newer gamers will not like the format. Th magic is a bit hard to do on the fly, but you learn. That&apos;s not an error on the development team&apos;s part, that&apos;s just different tastes.  Last thing I would say is  the puzzles are great! This is probably the best part of the game, every area has unique puzzles to solve....it&apos;s very satisfying, and I never thought I would get to play something like this again!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2554556">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve completed the game before, and nearly a second time trying to find all the secrets and everything I missed. The multitude of different roles that you can pick for the characters will have me going back for awhile, not to mention the special &apos;Toorum Mode&apos; that is one of the most creative secrets I have seen in awhile.
<br>
<br>Most of these people seem to be complaining about the combat system, the combat is very simple once you get the hang of it, some stuff can be tedious like picking up arrows or wondering around for a few seconds trying to find a stray crossbow bolt, however I feel that just makes the game more fun. Same goes with the spell casting, it makes it all that more addicting.
<br>
<br>Also another complaint I have been seeing a lot is the food system, its really not that bad and even with characters that require mass amounts of food you can still have excess. Item management is crucial, however you can use bags and boxes to help which is a nice addition. Overall the game relies greatly on the ability to think on your feet, something which many games do not do these days. The only bad thing about this game, is that it can get a little repetitive with its level designs, once you have figured all the puzzles out and were the secrets are there&apos;s really not that much more to do as you just run threw killing everything in your path.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2560333">Expand</a></span>

It features a skill system instead of the learn by use method in the original game which is a little different but still work fine. You also need ingredients now to create potions rather than just a spell filling a vial which limits the use of potions. Other than that most mechanics work just like in Dungeon Master which means lots of puzzles that require thinking, observation and timing, lots of tunnels to explore and secrets to find and figuring out different ways to deal with monsters. If you loved Dungeon Master 25 years ago then Legend of Grimrock will get you hooked once again, no question about that. Also available DRM free for both PC and Mac!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=4762581">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a very unique experience for me as there&apos;s no other game I&apos;ve played like it. There are dozens upon dozens of secrets hidden among the walls of Grimrock, some in which are extremely rewarding. Although the game can be very unforgiving, you can save at any time. Being able to spot a hidden button on a nearby wall, and be rewarded with good equipment is very satisfying. My biggest gripe with this game is how frustrating the dice roll system can be, kinda like in Pokemon where you miss your attack 10 times in a row.

<br>There&apos;s a sequel in the works, so pick this up sometime so you can look forward to it like me!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=3684958">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game gives you the old school feeling, including the toughness needed to beat the game, lol

<br>Lost 1 point due to the horrible battle system, there is this &quot;cool down&quot; system that makes you move around like a retard to avoid being hit while waiting for your attack to recharge.</span>

The story was good, I loved reading the notes and hints that prisoners before me left me. There are many secrets and puzzles. Most puzzles felt really rewarding to solve, others had me totally confused (especially some of the teleportpuzzles) but overall they were great. Playtime was 19 hours for me on my first playthrough while consulting a walkthrough 2 or 3 times. Replayability seems to be strong, i can&apos;t wait to start a new game and find all the missed treasures and secrets and try a totally different groupcombo with different skillsets and weapons. On the downsite, I didn&apos;t like the last level very much, it felt hectic and unnecessary. the bossfight felt unsatisfying and annoying with many monsters constantly blocking you. Overall it is a great title for an amazing price. 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2802528">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For those not familiar with the genre several &quot;user friendly&quot; additions made it into the game, like saving whenever and wherever you want to, or an automap which, unlike in the past where you had to work with paper &amp; pencil, can be accessed anytime in case you lost yourself in the latter dungeons of the game (given their size not an unlikely event).
<br>
<br>As far as im concerned i really enjoyed the graphics (!) and the puzzles of the game, which are plenty and more importantly unique in terms on how to solve them. (Heck, you can even use the dungeontraps to kill enemys with good timing :D)
<br>
<br>The Combat (which is also an essential part of the game) however left a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth.
<br>At the start of the game you can create a group of up to four prisoners which can be warriors, rogues or mages, all with their own, unique skilltrees. The latter however are fairly poorly balanced. Either you stick with one tree (say axes for warrior) every time you level up, to be really powerfull or you end up with a mediocre char, who is trained in say armors and a weapon of your choice. I could live with that, if the combat itself wouldnt feel so clunky (mashing in the runes for spells every time gets annoying after a while) or the AI would pose a greater challenge (Literally every single enemy in the game can be killed without much effort, as long you have a 2X2 square. Simply wait till it moves to an adjacent square, attack and move to the side, since enemys cant attack diagonally).
<br>
<br>Apart from that, the game does a pretty good job in terms of atmosphere and storytelling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2525585">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve got six hours so far and it&apos;s at least as entertaining as a lot of games I&apos;ve played.  I&apos;ve bought plenty of more expensive games that didn&apos;t even get five minutes before I deleted them.  I have a good feeling I&apos;ll play this one through.  It&apos;s Eye of the Beholder or EOB II, Legend of Darkmoon style gameplay.  The real time is the same but that particular detail might be hard to remember for those who played them.  You wait after each action while that action recharges.  It&apos;s cool.  You have to move around and dodge the pursuing enemy and pay enough attention so you don&apos;t get locked into a corner or get surrounded which can be a quick death.  Searching for secret doors is fun, the puzzles are fun and I hate puzzles, but I like the style of these.  All the high ratings for this game made me a little suspicious, but I&apos;d have to agree the game isn&apos;t bad.  I don&apos;t see quite how there are so many 10&apos;s though.  Even if I rated it for the period these games came out, which is pretty much what I did, it still could use a little more detail.  I think it just needs a little more creativity regarding character development.  More options.  The original Fallout is a great example of how a lot of options with skills, abilities, and creative detail helps escape that generic feel I think this game could use a bit more of.  But it&apos;s a solid dungeon crawler never the less.  I love old school stuff and I&apos;m glad I bought this game.  I just hope they make another one and throw in a little more.  If you&apos;re going to make an old school game, you might as well deck it out with endless detail.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2860069">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Another thing i loved about this game is customization. I usually spend like 30 mins putting my squad together perfectly. I suggest this game as a great Christmas gift (posted December 22nd)</span>

While it gets many things right it also has what in my mind is a major flaw, the combat system, which is one of the most important things in a game like this. But the good things first. Graphics are unusually good for a RPG of this kind, but still true to the oldschool origins of the game. Level design is in general good with some puzzles to solve, optional challenges to get powerful weapons and other goodies and traps where you can for example suddenly find you closed in inside a small room together with a couple of monsters.
<br>
<br>Sound effects and music are adequate but nothing special.
<br>
<br>The story of the game is nothing special, you have been thrown into a dungeon and you have to escape. You also have dreams giving hints about what is to come, but none of this is very interesting, the story is not the reason why you want to keep playing the game.

<br>The main weakness of the game is the combat system, which relies on fast reflexes more than anything else. Any combat against any enemy which can only use melee attacks can be won by attacking, moving away before the enemy can attack, waiting until the enemy moves in front of you, attacking again and so on. The strategy is simply to move around in a circle and attack at the right times and with this simple strategy, if well executed (i.e. if your reflexes are good enough) any enemy can be beaten without getting hurt no matter how strong the enemy or how weak your characters. If there is more than one enemy to fight at the same time, the enemy has ranged attacks or there is no room to move around in a circle things are slightly more complicated but it is still mainly about having good reflexes. This means that giving your characters good skills and making use of the right skills at the right time just makes battles shorter, not really easier, which makes leveling up less fun. This problem was to some extent already there in the classics that this game is based on, but it is more of a problem here becausse of the faster pace of the game.
<br>
<br>Also, the skills you can choose from are not very varied. In particular magic is almost all about doing damage from a distance and it does not matter much which elemental school you choose to specialise in since they all have basically equivalent spells. Still, even though this is as much an action game as it is an RPG it is still fun enough that I found it worth playing to the end. It just didn&apos;t appeal much to the oldschool RPG lover in me liked it promised to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=3498090">Expand</a></span>

The old-school puzzles are every bit as contrived as older gamers will remember from Eye of the Beholder and its like, but within that contrivance lies a really enjoyable challenge simply absent from most modern RPGs.  Combat is no cake-walk and my playthrough needed more than a couple of re-loads, especially after Level 6.   Loot is nicely balanced, however, with just the right amount of equipment progression to keep the hardened dungeoneer interested.   There isn&apos;t a great deal of role-playing per se in this RPG. Magic is a little bit shallow in this game, being almost entirely combat-orientated: my mage was little more than a flamethrower with a name.  The rooms and corridors are sparsely furnished, with only the occasional barrel or egg-sac to break up the endless grey corridors.  NPCs are notable for their absence.  But mysterious dreams and notes left by a previous prisoner who attempted to navigate the dungeon provide enough of a sense of story and atmosphere to keep the four prisoners going.   Ultimately, Grimrock is a loving tribute to a style of game whose day has passed and to that extent, it succeeds superbly.  Although it&apos;s targeted fairly and squarely at those who assaulted Myth Dranor in days of yore on much older machines, there is a salutary lesson for modern studios: tricky puzzles and challenging combat give the player something to do besides staring at the landscape between cut-scenes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2454758">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m a 1994-er whose gaming world was mostly made up of Pokemon, Pikmin and Legends of Zelda, so I never experienced those wonderful dungeon-crawling games every fan of this game seems to speak so fondly of. I was looking forward to this game a great deal, as it looked unlike anything I&apos;ve experienced before. And it is. It&apos;s a new and fresh, rather than nostalgic, experience for me. Choosing your own characters is a great feature, and it&apos;s even better that you get to choose their stats and traits. However, the bad thing is that if you choose the wrong stats you end up with a very unsuitable party to play the game all the way through, and it often amounts to starting over and over and over until you create the ideal setup, which is tedious. The game&apos;s also very hard - and I mean very very, old-school-nintendo-pop-in-another-token-and-try-again hard, so expect a lot of &quot;GAME OVER&quot;s being thrown in your face. Stylistically, the game&apos;s very strictly Traditional High Fantasy, and the game&apos;s name is so stereotypically geeky that I doubt anyone will be finding any girlfriends through playing it. This isn&apos;t exactly a bad thing, I guess I just sort of expected something more...subversive. Overall, I think this game tries to appeal a bit too much to the old &apos;90s gaming veterans and not to the younger set, who come from a completely different gaming background. It&apos;s old-fashioned and not very adaptable. I think it&apos;d benefit most from adding a difficulty setting that determined the challenge of the puzzles rather than just the toughness of the enemies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2458419">Expand</a></span>

The combat is satisfying, but challenging; spotted with brain-teasing puzzles, tons of secrets to unearth, strategic but simple leveling and inventory systems and huge underground levels to explore, LoG was a blast to complete in 22.3h. Being an avid gamer hardened my contention with poor interfaces, but others may not be as blessed: The lack of a &quot;cast last spell&quot; key/button meant combinations had to be punched in every few seconds in combat, spotting secret switches is a tedious chore, and the absence of a mini-map made frequent runs to the health crystal more tedious than it should. Last, some items do not stack which caused some unnecessary inventory clogs. Personally, these flaws added a certain old-school style of charm, since interfaces were not as refined in the 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s.  Overall, Legend of Grimrock is an amazing game for those who love a good old dungeon romp. Highly recommended due to its rich atmosphere, challenging combat and rewarding puzzles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2308579">Expand</a></span>

This is a beautifully done indie game, making very creative use of 3D, with a lot of fun and interesting combat. The _only_ modern nod that might have made to make spell casters more useful is a way to &quot;hotkey&quot; spells you&apos;ve discovered, but devils advocate to that is that - spell casting is powerful, therefore it should be a strategic move, so I&apos;m not docking any points for it. Just observing. Huge props to Almost Human. The team did an amazing job of bringing back one of my favorite games of all time (Dungeon Master) to life again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2296302">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve put in hours on this game since I got it and it&apos;s a blast, especially for an indie studio debut. The puzzles are challenging and fun and the combat is difficult, but never impossible. I like the advancement system, and picked two mages to go with my fighter and rogue since I knew I would be disappointed if I was missing out on spells. Can&apos;t wait to delve deeper into Mt. Grimrock! I highly recommend it to any fans of the dungeon crawl genre or any newer gamers who have enjoyed Portal but want a medieval twist on puzzle solving with some combat added in for flavor!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2297016">Expand</a></span>

Everything is well designed. Graphics are so good for a dungeon crawler and dont feel &quot;indie&quot; ( I shared a couple of screenshots in Facebook and EVERYBODY said they were so pretty). Thats what I can say about the appealing of this game. For the gameplay, I can say is wonderful, right click option is so beautiful, leveling system is simple but not dull, Spell casting system is a big hit for me. I love how it feels like a mage thing, not just a &quot;click&quot; thing, when you must remember and select correctly the runes for your spell, being under attack. Is not difficult (my mage killed more enemies than everyone else) and flavored. The only &quot;bad&quot; point about this game is the lack of NPCs interaction, like cities or shops, which could  be awesome, making it one of the top 10 games ever, but without this, it just gets the title of Best Game of 2012.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2796536">Expand</a></span>

The graphics and sound design are amazing considering the game is only 600mbs. Most of the music is ambience leading to a calm gameplay experience... until a skeleton rushes around a corner and makes you jump. Old style games like this have a terror of their own with the lighting and sound effects. When your torch goes out, it is pitch black until your characters &quot;eyes&quot; adjust and even then you can barely see. The only real complaint I have is the combat can be frustrating when you get body-blocked into a corner or are simply overpowered because of poor stat placement or equip. If you go into this expecting &quot;Amnesia with swords&quot; instead of &quot;Skyrim without towns&quot; you will have a great experience. Be prepared for a game that wants to beat you down; save often and take map notes because you will need all the help you can get.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822770">Expand</a></span>

Some folks might need time to acclimate to the real time UI, but eventually the realization will dawn that it simply adds tension and tension is the perfect emotion for dank dungeon crawls. If Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master make you shout in pleasure, pick this up immediately.

Unlike many modern games, Legend of Grimrock requires real skill, a sharp mind, a keen eye, and tactical thinking.  And there&apos;s room for much more, once Almost Human releases the tile set there will be plenty of user made content, not to mention more dungeons made by Almost Human themselves.</span>

Your four party members need to eat, rest and be in top condition in order to survive mount grimrock, they also need to be smart, traps and hidden treasures abound in this dungeon, and only a keen eye can keep the balance tipped in your favor. The game comes with a hardcore mode that eliminates the automap in favor of your own handcrafted map, which really says something about the intentions of the devs regarding player immersion.<br><br>One last thing, to the reviewer who whined about save points. You can save at any time during the gameplay from the ingame menu. So your point is moot, and only serves to show that you be trolling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2296129">Expand</a></span>

Good atmosphere, good graphic and good music , but I think, this game is not enough terrible. But it does not matter - game is realy good. Sorry for my English if it&apos;s bad - I am from Russia.</span>

<br>The game is easy to pick up and play, the controls are intuitive and game doesn&apos;t require an extensive tutorial or preamble. My favorite part of my time with Grimrock thus far is that it doesn&apos;t have that oh so familiar (to modern RPG&apos;s at least) &apos;this will be fun once you level up high enough&apos; feel. The game is about simple puzzles, character management and dungeon crawling. You are doing all three things within minutes of turning on the game. The character development seems a little simplistic and the puzzles/enemies seem to have a pretty low variation rate. That said this review is written with 2 hours of play time under my belt. Excited to go back for more  but not wowed by anything except the simplicity and comfortable aesthetics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=3036575">Expand</a></span>

It has gear, leveling (deep leveling in line with D&amp;D) and the combat is not just &quot;stand in front and attack&quot; it makes you juke left and right to avoid incoming damage. Spells are great, you have to put a sort of code in to execute a spell making memory very important. If you like crawling around and saying &quot;oooooo  what did i just pick up&quot; then youl love this game. Summer sale is going on also on steam, pick it up for sure. Most people know ahead of time if they will enjoy a game like this, if its up your ally, then its a game for you.
<br>
<br>For the more serious gamer, not so much for someone looking for a quick fix or lots of action. However combat is rewarding. I gave this game a 9 because it accomplishes what it seeks out to do. A great dungeon crawling experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=3295852">Expand</a></span>

The ability (or rather restriction) of moving from tile-to-tile rather than free roaming requires tactical decisions. The game manages to entertain you and it looks good while doing it.</span>

<br>
<br>I did nevertheless enjoyed it a lot, to my surprise, spending around 50 hours in the game, trying to get all the secrets, experimenting with different armors and learning the mechanics.
<br>
<br>Nevertheless the only reason I diminished my score from a 10 to 8 (I would rather give a 8.5) is:
<br>1. The last boss is quite boring.
<br>2. The game mechanics are a bit strange, specially how the attributes affect the playability and example being Overpowered Archers and  Underpowered Armors.
<br>3. Story is a bit lacking.
<br>
<br>Still this is an amazing game and I would definitely recommend it to RPG lovers!!!.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2927445">Expand</a></span>

A few interface issues (tedious spell casting, poor visual clues concerning which of your four characters are hitting or missing) and an over-reliance on puzzles in lieu of a plot (there are literally zero NPCs to speak to, only monsters to kill) hold it back a bit.  But for a first entry into what could become a great series (just needs more plot, character development, and RPG elements), Legend of Grimrock has promise.  Overall a fun and fairly-priced game.

Then the other night I started it up again and tried playing once more not expecting to get far or play to long. However I found myself playing for over an hour and was able to figure out what I couldn&apos;t before, so here is my review on a very awesome game.
<br>
<br>The Legend of Grimrock, a game I bought on Steam a couple years ago during the 2012 summer sale event made by Almost Human Games[www.grimrock.net].
<br>
<br>The game is an old school RPG that is not turn based but live action. In other words you are able to move, cast spells, select items from your inventory and rest without waiting for creatures to take their turn. As your trying to get your spell cast or looking for a throwing item in your inventory the creature will be attacking you and won&apos;t sit there and wait till your done.
<br>
<br>I really found this game to have that pen and paper D&amp;D feel to it and I like the idea of selecting the option to not have the game do the mapping as I explore and then I can map it out with graph paper and a pencil (I didn&apos;t do this of course).
<br>
<br>The character creation screen is very simple with 4 races and 3 classes to choose from. The inventory and character screen isn&apos;t complex or confusing but very intuitive and easy to figure out and understand.
<br>
<br>The spell&apos;s though are based on symbols and you have to select the right symbols or combination of to cast the spell. I found that you couldn&apos;t get the spell unless you found the scroll for the right spell but this could have been because I wasn&apos;t selecting the right symbol until I found the scroll.
<br>
<br>When venturing through the dungeon your characters will get hungry and there will be a symbol of food in there avatar picture indicating they need to eat. When you kill of creatures they will sometimes leave a meat chunk behind and you will want to get these to eat along with any food things you find along the way.
<br>
<br>During combat along the way some of your party member may die, take heart because they are not gone for good. You will be able to access their inventory while dead to. There will be these big blue floating crystals that when touched will restore your party to full health and energy and raid the dead. Remember where these ones are. Once they are used you will have to wait for a bit till it can be clicked on again.
<br>
<br>Now as for combat, where I originally had most of my troubles. To attack all you need simply do is right click on your hand under your avatar (wither their is a weapon in it or not). If your a spell caster you will want to keep at least one hand empty for right clicking to bring up the symbol window for spell casting.
<br>
<br>When you left click on a throwing weapon it will be attached to your mouse cursor and if you click with it again with your mouse pointer above the midline of the screen (the top half of the window) then it will be thrown. If you click below the midline (bottom half of the screen) then it get dropped on the floor.
<br>
<br>This is a keyboard and mouse type game and no controller support.
<br>
<br>Now that I have been able to find out something about the game and how combat works, along with the abilities to make your own dungeon&apos;s and storyline and the Steam Workshop to try some community based dungeons, The Legend of Grimrock is one game to have in your collection. Its worth a play!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=4387356">Expand</a></span>

I have never played these classics, but I now see why people did. This game is one of the best modern RPGs ever made, alongside others such as skyrim, Dark Souls and Mass Effect 2. The game is incredibly immersive and lonely, and doesn&apos;t hold your hand throughout.<br><br>The tactic known as &quot;chessing&quot; where you move arround a enemy before he can turn and hit you is incredibly effective, and the developer knew people would use it, so as you play, the dungeons make this tactic more and more dangerous and require more concentration, with exceptions such as when you fight your first ogre. To improve the immersion, you also cant tell how much health your enemy has or how injured they are.<br><br>The game then gives some of the well balanced puzzles ever made, perfectly balancing coolness with difficultly.<br><br>The game is filled with secrets, often these can be as simple as a secret button made to look like a brick, other times it can be a bit more complex, but never insane, for eg, one puzzle requires finding a secret button, running a fair distance over some trapdoors which are timed to stay up for but a few seconds after hitting the secret button, then you run over them, hit a button, run to a now open trapdoor trap and jump inside to find a key to put in another keyhole to open a door which gives an item.<br><br>The game gives a good steady progression without giving the chance to grind, only 1 point of the entire game do enemies respawn, and these enemies give little xp, and are required for a puzzle. The graphics are suburb for a indie game, although it would be nice if so many walls did not have exactly the same moss placement and if there were more hidden button areas in walls, insread of 2 for every floor type. The game as many enemies, from the lowly giant snail or flying...thing, to the ogre and magical fire guardian, the monsters never feel repetive. Before you buy this game, while it is not unfairly hard, and generally only unfair if you placed yourself in a strategicly bad position, the game is NOT easy, and it requires thinking in order to survive grimrock mountain. Last but not least, this game is at least 13+ hours as i have played for 10 and not seen a few of the monsters seen in the trailer yet, but eventually a level editor and more dungeons will be released.<br><br>This game is a must have game, and i hope the developer makes more games, because only the best developers can make a high grade rpg game when they are only 1 man.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2298795">Expand</a></span>

For such game there is nice customization, skills, spell combinations, alchemy and what&apos;s more important big dungeon full of monsters to explore. Graphic is great, sounds are great. Only that should be fixed is sound volume adjustment (missing in game). Everyhing else works perfectly.</span>

I&apos;m 12 hours in and I know I&apos;ll want to start it all over again once I&apos;m done my first playthrough.<br><br>Grimrock&apos;s gameplay is very simple. You are stuck in a dungeon and you need to get out through the bottom. Puzzles and combat are your main focuses during the game, and you have loot, inventories and skills to manage. The graphics are very good, the audio too. And the game is F-U-N. There are no bugs that I can tell, either. So, to sum up: A very fun game with no bugs that looks and plays great. Where&apos;s the downside? Right, there is none. It would get a 9.5 because of its un-innovative nature, but who cares, this game IS an old-style dungeon crawler. And possibly the best ever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=2304239">Expand</a></span>
