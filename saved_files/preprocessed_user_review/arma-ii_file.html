<br>
<br>Most of the actual fun of this game is theoretical, as you imagine what it could be like if it were fully realized.
<br>
<br>I wouldn&apos;t hold out much hope for Arma 3 either, as a vast number of the flaws from this game carry over into Bohemia Interactive&apos;s newest game.  They are either incapable or unwilling to address the problems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3977971">Expand</a></span>

<br>While Arma is a bit clunky, and it is slow paced at times (you can&apos;t play this game like battlefield 3 or cod. You need to think and move smartly), the game is still beautiful to look at even today, in 2013. The graphics aren&apos;t the best, but I&apos;ve found myself completely immersed and having to look twice since it looked so realistic (This is on full settings.).

Friendly units run into things and get lost, or are impossible to give effective commands to, especially in combat situations. NPCs are useless. &quot;hey helo pilot, there&apos;s a group of enemies down there. mind hovering a minute so i can shoot them with the minigun mounted on the side here?&quot; Nope, no command for that, just gonna drop you off in the middle of a bunch of **** shooting at you. Not to mention I just spent a hour reloading saves trying to sneak up on a group of enemies sitting around fires next to their tents, but as soon is I get anywhere near them they start shooting through the trees and bushes and kill all of my team before i can even get a good look at them, and this was once I resorted to putting the difficulty on recruit! WTF. I love the &quot;get shot once and you&apos;re injured or die&quot; aspect. I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s too hard, the AI just ruins it. You&apos;d think that these issues could be resolved considering the game came out years ago. I  too was hoping the negative reviews were just being too critical, but they&apos;re accurate. If your getting this for the campaign, DON&quot;T. I miss cold war crisis, arma 2 is somehow a big step backwards. If those asses are gonna turn out another arma like this let em stay in jail in greece</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822171">Expand</a></span>

There is a difference between complex controls, and overly complicated and messy controls. If the controls were all organized logically, then a player&apos;s first impressions and ability to get into the game would be vastly improved. However, not only will you be forced to constantly check your control settings, but you will simply have to learn how to do every single thing in the game by yourself, as the tutorials are extremely sloppy, slow, and unclear. Controls that make sense are even more important when the movement in the game is sloppy and to be honest, just complete **** There is a difference between realism and sloppy movement. You will never feel in control of your character, and will be constantly reminded that you are controlling a game character who can&apos;t seem to move properly, as if it has physical disabilities.
<br>
<br>Also sadly, in a game that prides itself on realism, physics in the game also feel sloppy, vehicles are sloopy, graphics are sloppy (could be justified by scale of world), firearms and weapons sound like paintball guns, AI troops seem to be complete idiots, the list goes on.
<br>
<br>This game truly is for the dedicated player who does not mind sinking hundreds of hours into the game, just to play a sloppy game with no real entertainment value other than as a bland and boring shooting gallery.

After poking through other reviews, it seems that the game was released too early, which is a shame because it could have become so much better than it is and could have had so many problems fixed.

<br>
<br>It&apos;s better than Arma 3... But what isn&apos;t? This is still made by Bohemia Interactive, a studio that is either profoundly lazy or terminally incompetent - pick one. Consequently, BIS produces software that can&apos;t ever be called &quot;finished&quot; and depends on legions of modders - not just to add content - but to actually FIX the game into a playable state. Arma 2 has a massive community which, over the years has turned Arma 2 into a unique and almost functional experience that, when it works,  can be really fun.
<br>
<br>BUT to get that good experience you will have to install a LOT of mods that (mostly) fix the AI and realism problems. Then you&apos;ll have to add any game expanding mods on top of the fixes and you&apos;ll end up with a massive directory set - all of which is going to have to work together with the native, bug-cursed half-as*ed crap code that Bohemia barfed onto the game disk. You will be spending HOURS just trying to troubleshoot an outdated poorly implemented code on an unoptimized game engine that was out of date the day this was released.
<br>
<br>This is a game that, if undertaken by a half-competent studio, would have been revolutionary and amazing. After years of being worked on by modders this game really does have some brilliant and incredible moments, but those are fleeting when compared to the fixes/bugs/crashes you will spend more time sorting out. BIS and the Arma series is so enraging because they are SO close to something that works and that would be totally revolutionary, but instead of finishing the job they did it half-way and left players to fix their work. And as talented as the modders are- there is just only so much you can do with mods laid on top of the core code and using the horrible markup language.
<br>
<br>If you are willing to put up with the constant troubleshooting between game errors, glitches and mod conflicts just to get this thing to run and work halfway decently. And if you can tolerate the numerous bugs, glitches and occasionally game-killing design flaws, then you WILL have some amazing experiences.
<br>
<br>Honestly, even though I&apos;ve put literally thousands of hours into this series, I can&apos;t really say that I recommend it. Especially since I&apos;m older now, and just don&apos;t want to spend the few weekend hours I&apos;ve got free to fix Bohemia&apos;s mistakes. If you&apos;ve got the hours to sink into it, or you&apos;re satisfied with building really simple missions then give it a shot- it&apos;s FAR better than Arma 3 (but that&apos;s not hard) and really cheap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4005128">Expand</a></span>

If you are looking for something similar to the travesties named &quot;Dragon Rising&quot; and &quot;Red River,&quot; stay away (and kill yourself shortly afterwards, for shame). ArmA 2 is none of these, and will disappoint you immensely. The simplest way to review ArmA 2 for the PC is to look at its long and distinguished heritage.<br><br>Bohemia Interactive Studios (BIS), the designer, made a name for themselves in 2001 with the ground-breaking Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis (hereafter referenced as &quot;the original Flashpoint&quot;). The original Flashpoint was a PC gaming triumph; it was a battlefield simulator of an unprecedented scale. No longer were players bounded by invisible walls and boundaries - if you saw it on the horizon, you could head there, if you saw a better position or approach to a target, you could use it. You could command or simply be a cog in the war machine. One enemy (or friendly, for that matter) bullet in the right place would end your brief career. Combined arms operations became a reality. You could fly, in fixed wing or rotary wing aircraft. You could drive tanks, cars, trucks, go-karts, mountain bikes and almost any conceivable type of vehicle. You could use an immense variety of weaponry. The revolutionary AI operated totally sans scripting, and would often prove (in the hands of a cunning mission designer) your undoing again and again. And this was simply the vanilla game.<br><br>The Crown Jewel in the original Flashpoint&apos;s crown was its &quot;modability.&quot; The game itself was ported with the most powerful mission editor seen at that point in gaming, allowing almost infinite replay value - want to create D-Day? Go for it. Paradrop yourself and your buddies behind enemy lines to whack some HVTs? Easy. Huge tank battle? No worries. This was compounded infinitely (again) with the advent of the Oxygen 3D tools, which allowed the burgeoning community to port their own models into the game.<br><br>The community work was small scale at first - a retexture here, config change there. However, merely a blink of an eye later, with logarithmic speed, a burgeoning source of creative output was realised. The most appreciable thing about the modding of the original Flashpoint was that it was ACCESSIBLE to ANYONE. Tutorials sprung up on basic modeling and texturing, which allowed even new players to put their dreams into the game. New vehicles, new weapons, entire armies, never-before-seen islands and terrains, unique scenarios, both PvP and coop (and all mixtures of the two!) and no less than entire modifications were spawned out of the minds of the community. There was a goddamn Lego Wars mod, and a ROFLcopter, for Christ&apos;s sake. Cold War Crisis became THE benchmark of what a game imbued with a passionate community could become. Mods are still being produced for the venerable engine of 2001 even today.<br><br>Apart from modding, another hallmark of the original Flashpoint (hah, there I go again) was the outstanding community support. BIS, an independent developer, maintain a professional stance with their products, and are renowned for supporting their games and listening to community suggestions. They do not suddenly fade away or abandon their works, unlike many a modern studio.<br><br>ArmA 2 was released in 2009. It is the spiritual successor to the original Flashpoint, and I don&apos;t refer to the abortions produced by Codemasters, who own the Operation Flashpoint name and nothing more. I don&apos;t mean &quot;spiritual successor&quot; in the way that Bioshock was to System Shock, and how the continual intellectual depredations and hardware limitations of the console crowd have degraded that franchise. ArmA 2 is the essence of Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis packaged for modern technology. The limitless potential remains potent; the mission editor more powerful than ever, the community immensely strong, still producing content of a quality that is second-to-none, the campaigns and scenarios fresh and engrossing. When PC Gamer stated that &quot;Only boring people get bored with the ever-evolving ArmA 2&quot;, they told a truth more profound than ever.<br><br>ArmA 2 is not a game - it is the latest iteration of a way of life. I bought the original Flashpoint when I was 14, and still played through the original campaign not a year ago. I am now 24, and the latest brainchild of BIS has yet to let me down.<br><br>For God&apos;s sake, if you are not in one of the unfortunate categories listed at the beginning of this spiel, and are remotely interested in military operations, do yourself a favour, and download ArmA 2 and its DLC packs today.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1600837">Expand</a></span>

This game is like a BF series game on steriods. Has a huge learning curve and is not for ADHD kids who just want to run around and FPS all day. This game takes patience and time to learn. But once you learn it you will have a total blast. The best part is the modding community which makes the game grow even more. This is not your typical military simulator where you play to your round ends. Arma2 has no rounds, it is just one massive war fought over a beatiful landscape. Take off from aircraft carriers and insert a sniper team up in the mountains or make an assault with armored tanks. You make the choice and the opitions are endless. You can&apos;t just run around and play this game BF style. You need to use tactics and think real life. You need to use cover and concealment constantly. You also need to play as a team.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=742747">Expand</a></span>

Prepare to fail a mission because something happened miles away which you have no idea about, or you didn&apos;t find an item or say the right thing to someone an hour earlier... W...T...!<br><br>Surely the worst thing is the interface. To call a helicopter to your location and get it to travel to where you want to go requires psychic powers. If you do get the helo to come to you, make sure all your squad get in, the AI aborts getting into vehicles if the person and the vehicle aren&apos;t in perfect sync. Finding out how to do it will require forum help or a youtube vid - unbelievable. Otherwise you&apos;ll find yourself sitting in the helo with your squad with no way to instruct the pilot where to take you.<br>Honestly, the interface is appalling and unintuitive, much like ARMA was and Op Flashpoint before that. The new flashpoint games didn&apos;t review so well, but I played one of those too and was so pleased that the menus work and the missions were actually interesting. It wasn&apos;t as ambitious as ARMA2, but I played it through... I&apos;ve tried that with ARMA2 a few times, but always got sick of the interface or stupid scripting. I went back with a much faster computer today, for a third go. Loaded up the old saves and it still looks great. Two hours of frustration later I&apos;m venting on the internet.

But the problem with this game is that there are too many controls. It is way to complicated compared to any other first person shooter out there. You have controls for flying a helicopter, plane, car, boat... anything. They need to separate all of the controls into separate columns. There are controls where you need to push 2-3 buttons just to do one action. Another thing is, when you fire the weapon, it is not very realistic at all... I have no idea if it is just my PC or what, because all the gun does is barely nudge when you fire it... like a little jolt. Above that... I would say this game is pretty realistic and fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1462477">Expand</a></span>

The modding community is massive and there are some terrific mods to tweak all aspects of the game. Really excels in multiplayer and the editor is very powerful. Has been patched by the developer, so no more excuses! Can&apos;t recommend it highly enough</span>

<br>This is one of the worst engines and platforms I have ever seen in the history of gaming.

<br>
<br>The sheer amount of controls is silly. There are much simpler ways to accomplish an experience that is just as dynamic as one that only gets there by making me use a hundred different controls to do everything.
<br>
<br>DayZ was the reason I bought this game, but it is unplayable because the designer decided to use the worst platform in FPS history. Huge waste of money.
<br>
<br>If someone tells you this game is good, take that with a sixty pound grain of salt. That person is most likely looking for a complex immersive experience and are grasping at the few straws that made this game unique.
<br>
<br>I tried playing single player, and it is even worse than multiplayer. Extremely boring and slow paced, 2003 graphics, choppy, error prone moving objects...just overall an incomplete game without really any shining qualities to make it worthwhile other than the potential of DayZ.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m running this at maximum maximum graphics on a fairly modern PC bought in August 2011. 16 gigs of ram, 1 gig GeForce 560, quad core 3.1 ghz intel i5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2511618">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> One of the best games ever existed. Only for true hardcore players and Bohemia fans. This is probably the best game ever, almost as good as Operation Flashpoint. Don&apos;t always whine about the bugs, try to live with them. They are easily fixed. I know i know, not for all players, but those who really need an realistic game to play. Fantastic.</span>

As a newcomer to Arma, albeit an experienced FPS gamer, I found the game to be very confusing at times. This was primarily due to the lack of information and guidance the game provided to enable the player to figure at what needed to be accomplished. This is readily apparent within the multiplayer arena where players seem to be poorly organised; lacking even a basic understanding of what their objectives/targets are. This creates a confused atmosphere where squads are not coordinated and no sense of teamwork exists. As many others have mentioned the game also appears to be extremely buggy in certain areas, negatively affecting the gamer&apos;s experience. The game has also been reported to run poorly on even very high spec PCs. Hence it seems that Arma 2 has been released before its ready with many significant patch updates still needing to be issued. In summary Arma 2 is an unpolished game that fails to provide sufficient guidance to those who are newcomers to the series. The numerous bugs and mediocre hardware performance adds to these issues. These problems add up to a large fundamental issue which severely affects the gameplay and ultimately the enjoyment of the game itself. A poor game in almost all departments: 4/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=82932">Expand</a></span>

If not for the horrible optimization in the engine and the terrible net code it would by all accounts be a brilliant game. As it is, the poor performance and terrible online performance make this shooter virtually unplayable. This is a game that I wanted to love but the actual game play is just frustrating with the bugs and poor performance on medium to high end machines built for gaming. The A.I. is simplistic but the true measure is playing against live opponents. Hopefully ARMA 3 does a better job of engine optimization.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2323121">Expand</a></span>

<br>Otherwise it&apos;s just too control complex to be fun, especially (plane) flight.  The beauty of a PC game vs a console game (among a long list of things) is that controls don&apos;t have to be limited to four - 8 buttons. But seriously.... you dont need to use all 116 keys and every part of the mouse for EACH control scheme (infantry, land vehicle, helicopter, multiple types of aircraft etc.)  It&apos;s near impossible to fly without a joystick.  imagine, if you will, the following:
<br>
<br>A + D = roll    W + S = pitch ...so far so good =) now add
<br>Q + Z = trottle up and down... ok so it&apos;s hard to bank left and use throttle, I can handle that... but wait there&apos;s more!
<br>X + C = Yaw.. so now that you&apos;re trying to make fine adjustments to properly lead and strafe you need to completely forget you&apos;re throttle because you&apos;re trying to maintain your bank to match your&apos;re adversary.  but wait... turning too hard makes you loose velocity.... so stop tuning with yaw, correct speed. return to  yaw.  But wait there&apos;s more!
<br>
<br>F = to select your weapons, which aren&apos;t quite clear what they even are at first.  until you accidentally fire one of the 2 only missles, 2 bombs, or 300 bullets you have (which you can empty in 4-5 seconds.)
<br>
<br>But wait!  There&apos;s more!  While you&apos;re trying to simply stay away from the ground and fumble in utter dumbfoundedness with you&apos;re weapons while trying to hit a peanut sized target with next to no ammo remaining, you moved you&apos;re mouse!  Oops it controls pitch and roll too, at the same time as the keyboard!  While trying to grasp all this at once you realise your landing gear is still down.... ok so now it&apos;s off the the scroll wheel menu to retract it (which is actually quite alien at first). Now you&apos;re distracted for a few seconds from the incoming ground with your upside down aircraft seemingly resisting all your movements by about 25%.  So on top of all this you now need to compensate for the resistance to your movement.  Oh and remember to close/retract/lower your flaps.  Whatever term the game uses is useless because you&apos;re scroll menu offers &quot;flaps up&quot; or &apos;flaps down&quot;.  Am i lowering them from the top of the aircraft to close them? Or was it bring the flaps from the bottom up to retract them... Oh hey, there&apos;s a note on the top right of the screen, something about using TAB to acquire targets... Wait... there were instructions there.... that&apos;s ok I&apos;ll restart again....  *reading* Welcome to the tuto... *switch* times up! new message!  In this excercise we will be going to *switch*.  There is litterally a 5 line message that is on screen for less than a second.
<br>
<br>Did I mention this is only the boot camp?
<br>
<br>Now lets clear something up.  I LOVE complex games.  From ROTK to Total War to Crusader Kings II to Europa Univeralis.  I enjoy a steep learning curve because the time invested usually nets a fantastic game that not every moron can just jump on to &quot;pWn HiS n0oBzoRs&quot; or whatever it is they do.  I have over 14 hours of play simply in the tutorials.  I have nearly given up on the main game.  But I&apos;m a stubborn type that will keep doing it till it&apos;s done.  But most people will have given up ages ago, which is a bit of a shame.  The game has a fantastic engine overall and is almost unerringly realistic.  If the tutorial gets a very extensive tune-up I could see many more positive reviews.  But too many people are kicked flat in the teeth with this (fun but) incredibly newbie unfriendly game.
<br>
<br>Ending on a positive note thought, glitches have been non-existant to me.  So I don&apos;t know if I&apos;m just missing them out of sheer dumb luck or they have been fixed by now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2701905">Expand</a></span>

Having a keybinding for every single type of action you can perform ingame only makes the interaction complex and sluggish. It has nothing to do with realism. Sure, after a while (of frustration) you might get used to it, but in the end it&apos;s a key bashing memory game. If that sounds like real life movement to you, I recommend seeing a neural doctor on a regular basis. Although it&apos;s not the most important factor in this type of game, the graphics quality is quite low and pretty unstable. Glitches are everywhere but it&apos;s not the worst part of the product. The overall engine performance is so bad that alot of people with highend hardware are complaining it&apos;s unplayable. Even if you&apos;ve got a zillion core grid computing system, the engine isn&apos;t making very good use of it. Unless they have taken quantum mechanics in consideration for the physics engine, Bohemia would be far better off licensing a working solution. Check the demo and experience the most realistic hangover.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=82878">Expand</a></span>

Keen point to stress though: Bohemia Interactive never abandone their games and their support is great. Arma 2s current state is very stable. However, this game is for those who enjoy realism and tactical combat. There is no progression system. This is not Battlefield nor Call of Duty. Try to use any of the tactics you use in most arcade games and arma will shovel a boot up your ass. The enemy AI is designed to kill you - not to amuse you. Controls are very complex. The environment is HUGE - 220km2. Missions are not scripted til death;  on the battlefield you&apos;ll often be confused in the heat of the combat because the battlefield is ever changing. With that said, the game isn&apos;t streamlined, its not a railshooter. Graphics is great on highest settings but the game requires a great computer. Mission editor is improved a lot. Huge of free user-made mods for this game. If you like games that actually CHALLANGE you, then arma is for you, because this game will for sure teach you a lesson! This is for the tactical gamer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2853442">Expand</a></span>

TOO COMPLICATED for such a simple command. It should be a one-click action, but Arma 3 requires three-clicks. Then they tell me drive over there to another shooting range. Again I get blamed for shooting my trainer. wth! Third try: I managed to blow up some wooden tanks cursing the complicated interface. How do I use the scope? I see my weapon has a scope but I can&apos;t seem to use it. unc00l. Okay the trainer didn&apos;t roll over and just died this time, but sends me at the other end of a field to prove myself. This time my toon just rolls over dies. Arma 3, do what you do best. Roll over and die.

But the massive bugs are only in the single player. The 5 goes to the multiplayer, there&apos;s a lot less bugs in the multiplayer. My only other complaints are the bad voice acting, the huge amount of pointless controls (Why would I want to sit and salute?), and the fact that this game is too real. I haven&apos;t played the 1st ARMA so maybe that&apos;s why I&apos;m not feeling it, but if you did play the 1st ARMA you&apos;ll love this, and If you you want extremely real warfare then, yea, get this.

My main issue with ArmA2 is that the net code is the worst I&apos;ve ever seen in an online FPS. I see jerky stuttered movement of other players of the worst kind. It&apos;s hard to even hit opponents they jerk around so much. I&apos;m playing on servers that show 20ms or 30ms ping. I don&apos;t know what the problem is. I have an OC&apos;d E8400 @4ghz w/1066mhz RAM and an ATI 4870/512 and have lowered my graphic settings a lot and am getting decent FPS (40~50fps). As far as I&apos;m concerned ArmA2 is not playable online on a server with more than 25 people on it. Also the user interface is so very clunky. Also, your soldier insists on going into a kneel position when crouched which gives it a very jerky sloppy feel. You can&apos;t smoothly stop &amp; start moving in this game except when your weapon is down. There needs to be a smooth way to keep it low when moving. Also, the game uses too many of the poor quality sounds from ArmA1 like the bigger explosions. There&apos;s a lot to like in ArmA2 but it&apos;s just not refined to a high degree. It&apos;s very rough. The game definitely sides on the realistic over fun factor. The game&apos;s setting gets redundant and boring. The urban settings pale in comparison to other PC FPS&apos;. There just isn&apos;t much small scale detail in them. Blocky.. Also the game is a huge CPU hog, poorly optimized and you&apos;ll need a very expensive PC to enjoy the highest settings at a smooth framerate. The game just feels... cheap. What the game gets right is it&apos;s modability and flexibility. It truely is a hardcore PC exclusive FPS and I commend BiS for trying. They just didn&apos;t succeed on enough fronts for me to love this game, and it is a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=85301">Expand</a></span>

But all the got is a completely unfinished game. The AI doesn&apos;t work, the mission scripts don&apos;t work...the performance is poor for those graphics...This is just cheating on the customer ! Let&apos;s hope it turns good as patches come up. At this state of the game...my advice, don&apos;t buy it. Wait till more patches are out. The good point is the atmosphere - and you feel like you are someone. You are not solder XY and the feeling of an ongoin war is definitely here. Also the huge terrain for exploring is pretty cool - for sure in multiplayer too. But as I said. I can&apos;t recommend Arma2 in this state. Lets cross fingers of patches fixing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=425785">Expand</a></span>

Tried to do basic training which involves teaching you how to play the game it was horrible, small, unnoticeable pop-ups in the top right corner tell you what keys do what, but they only show up for about 3 seconds.

They are, of course, rabidly fanatical in defending the developers, Bohemia Interactive, and the sadly broken state which they have become famous for releasing their games in - Arma 2 is no different. For those of you familiar to the Arma franchise, you will see much of the same features as Arma 1. The basic aspects are present, and some have been improved upon. Sadly, there is no overcoming the inherent flaws to both the game engine and game itself, which we can only hope future patches will address. First of all, the graphics have been given a new coat of paint and, if you can run them on high on your system, you will be impressed. As of this time, people with the highest end systems are complaining of inconsistent frames and laggy gameplay, even on low settings indicating a severe flaw in the game itself. This is nothing new, as mouse lag, stuttering and other annoyances have been around since Arma 1, and the developers have not repaired them, leading me to suspect that their game engine (a heavily modified version of the original 10 year old OFP engine) is simply on its last legs an no longer viable. The clunky voices and cumbersome AI are still there, event though BI Studios has told us the AI is more intuitive and better able to use cover, and follow orders. Not true. They still drive into walls, trees and seem to go out of their way to do so, they still do not take cover when under fire, and they are often responsible for fuskering up missions because of their lack of &quot;intuitiveness&quot;. Adding to this problem, is an incredibly poor design choice by BI to change the command system, by eliminating the simple spacebar - mousewheel system in favour of a spacebar - Function Key - Mouswheel regimen which actually makes it more difficult to command. Try the demo, you&apos;ll see what I mean. The Single Player campaign is essentially unplayable at this phase in the &quot;patch cycle&quot;, simply because the designers - in developing an open ended sandbox game - have implemented game triggers which often break the campaigns if you don&apos;t approach them the way they planned it out for you. So much for open ended. If you can get past this, and still drop your 50 bucks for it, Multiplayer is very fun, and the Editor is phenomenal with new tools added to make mission scripting incredibly easy. With the addition of various modules, and the ability to synchronize them to the players, you can create a basic mission in a matter of minutes, and include with it ambient warfare and a populated island. However, it feels as if most of these modules, and game design features, are simply the same Arma 1 mods that the community developed, and really should have been in the original game in the first place. It feels like BI just took them from the modders and put them into their new game. In retrospect, Arma 2 really just feels like Arma 1.5, with the same annoyances but now with prettier graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=82763">Expand</a></span>

But, no, the developers appear to have spent all their effort on the cosmetic aspects, and on making the interface less logical and more awkward and unnecessarily complicated and counter-intuitive, rather than fixing the aspects that so badly need fixing: a horrendous AI (vehicles drive into walls and get stuck on rocks and trees rather than following a straight road, your team-mates run into enemy fire), vehicles still drive in an unnatural &quot;gliding&quot; manner  and  dont hold your breath  it&apos;s still as bad in ARMA 3 alpha as well.  I consider OFP to be one of the most intelligent games ever made, and was prepared to accept the limitations of ARMA 2, but I can see that the game is being ruined by the questionable decisions of the apparently not very intelligent developers/management. OFP had a simple and logical interface that was easy to learn and fun to play. It&apos;s the only aspect that didn&apos;t need improving and the one that they&apos;ve wrecked with too much unnecessary tinkering. I personally don&apos;t need any cut-scenes and, to add insult to injury, the developers are trying to present some of these third-rate examples of bad animation and voice-acting as missions! The &quot;vanilla&quot; edition lists 6 missions but it&apos;s actually only 5! Do they seriously think that anyone is tricked by this and doesn&apos;t notice how poor the single-player experience has become? Each mission seems to have a new way of annoying the player  from the use of ULB&apos;s which I just find too boring and cumbersome to try to learn how to use to having to write down some silly made-up squiggles from a piece of paper to defuse a bomb. I do have a feeling that the small but vocal group of devotees are posting positive reviews en-masse  whereas normal people who haven&apos;t devoted their whole life to ARMA tend to become understandably  fed up very quickly and just give up. I&apos;m angry because I no longer have a game to play and it;s always sad to see idiots in charge make stupid decisions that affect us all. It&apos;s not a question of the developers &quot;not having enough time&quot; or players like me being too stupid for anything but COD, it&apos;s a question of stupid decisions and wasting time and effort on &quot;fixing&quot; only the parts of the game that didn&apos;t need fixing. On a positive note  the surfaces are now more shiny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3243246">Expand</a></span>

For some people, this will be the best game they have ever played, for others it will be the worst. If you want a game with constant action like Call of Duty, Battlefield, or Halo this probably isn&apos;t the game for you. If you want an ultra-realistic experience that requires strategy and tactics, this game will fit your needs. The game plays more as a simulation than a FPS. While there is a campaign mode that is non-linear, the story isn&apos;t anything special and the voice acting for the characters is laughable. For me, the best part of the game is the ability to create and play my own missions. The map is very large and you have quite a bit of flexibility with what you can do. Editing missions isn&apos;t difficult and you can learn how to use the most advanced features from some well made YouTube tutorials. This game became popular because of its mods, most notably DayZ, but the base game is fun as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2550189">Expand</a></span>

Instead, I have enjoyed it more intensely than any other shooter/simulator yet. With a good group of players, you can experience a shooter/flight sim/ all out war that is just pure tactical fun. Gorgeous gaming, precision tactics, ingame communcations are geniously laid out, flying and driving are a blast with a joystick, shooting and running are great with a mouse/keyboard (so keep both handy to switch between). Expect to practice with various vehicles for an hour or so in single player mode, then go online and find some fun. Just an awesome experience. I wish I could give it a 10, but occasional connectivity issues need to be ironed out, but so close to perfect now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=83544">Expand</a></span>

And the accuracy draws you in and makes you feel like the solider. You have real ballistics, the world is destroyable (you can run over trees in a tank, break fences with an APC, blow up buildings), you drag your wounded allies out of fire and then you can perform field medicine on them to get your guys back into the battle, you can hop over fences, dive into bushes, look around the battle with out changing where you aim and many other amazing thing I have always want to do in a game but I have never been given the option. On top of the wonderful infantry control system, you also have an enormous arsenal of vehicles to fly and drive. The controls on all these vehicles feel very authentic and they allow you to fly with relative ease or meticulously tweet all the detailed controls (From Farcry II to WWII fight simulator). In the tank you have your driver, gunner, and tank commander. As a tank commander you can issue orders to the ai drivers or your team mates. The AI driver and gunners are a great addition because you can set wave points for the driver to follow, targets for the gunner to shoot at and in the meantime you can continue to survey the battle field. As in games like Red Orchestra, you can pop your head out of the tank or stand safe inside.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=83345">Expand</a></span>

The mouse lag is awful too, some people said its was to simulated the weigh of the gun, c&apos;mon, this game really needed more work from Bohemia.</span>

This game you can just simply throw AI around and you got yourself an intense battle, now thats just the Vanilla part, this game is easy to mod and edit, its amazing.  Cant find a game around like it 10/10</span>

                                        <span> this game is a great game everything is near perfect but the problem is that you need to have a nasa computer to play this game with no lag/a little lag and the bugs are quite troublesome but bohemia is making patches soo i would give this a 10 if they fixed like everything.</span>
