There were some glitches in the game that I saw as being major pitfalls, but they were not impossible to get past, merely frustrating. I just beat the game and have since changed my opinion. It&apos;s not &quot;unplayable&quot;, as I had previously written, my completed play through was proof of that. The main difficulties are not from actual game difficulty level, but slow game response which causes deaths in quick scenes and sometimes the AI will run directly to their death. But aside from that, the game IS playable and very captivating. The characters are lovable and the art style is amazing. The story was also worth playing through.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/never-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=4860618">Expand</a></span>

I mostly played the co-op mode and often the game wouldn&apos;t pick up which player used keyboard vs controller the next time it is started. Sometimes I had to close and restart the game 4-5 times until the right order of plugging in the controller and pressing in-game buttons would work. One of the rare games that made me rage quit 3-4 times.

Then you are rewarded by a short native lore. That&apos;s it, that&apos;s the only connect between native culture and this game. I was attracted by the two main characters but they are the only thing appealing in this game. That isn&apos;t good enough. Don&apos;t play this.</span>

As a 2D platformer game, there is nothing special about it. While the dual character mechanic is vaguely interesting, other games have done it better (and many still weren&#x2019;t very fun). The actual platforming is okay but nothing particularly fun in terms of flow. The funnest parts of the game are the sequences where you run away from monsters or other things, which have a great sense of urgency to them, but many parts of the game are just you navigating various arctic environments which don&#x2019;t feel very special.
<br>
<br>Some folks have complained about the looseness of the controls, but in the end, they are serviceable and work for the game. The real issue is that the game just doesn&#x2019;t do anything very special gameplay wise.
<br>
<br>So what is hard about this game?
<br>
<br>Well, it is not just a game; it is meant to be an experience. The Inuit are trying to share a bit of their culture with the player, and they do this both via the story, which is an Inuit myth, and via these little &#x201C;cultural insight&#x201D; videos, little mini-documentaries spread throughout the game. The Inuit in the videos are very eager to share fragments of their life, culture, and mythology, and their integration into the flow of the game actually works quite well.
<br>
<br>The problem is that, ultimately, it just isn&#x2019;t all that interesting. The gameplay is meh and I doubt I would have watched the documentaries without the gameplay. Overall, it was an okay experience, but&#x2026; it just wasn&#x2019;t anything special anywhere.
<br>
<br>Clocking in at about 3 hours and 20 minutes for 100% completion of the base game (I haven&#x2019;t done the DLC yet), there&#x2019;s just not that much here.
<br>
<br>My advice? Don&#x2019;t buy this game. But if you already own it, it is a fairly harmless use of three hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/never-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=6120699">Expand</a></span>

<br>Mechanics are interesting, concept and story are inspired and enjoyable but there are two strong flaws in my opinion: graphics, which are ok but devs could have done much better with very little effort and the difficulty of the game.
<br>About this last one, if you make a game entirely story-driven everyone should be able to appreciate the story, even people that just like to relax and watch/listen while moving their characters on the screen. Towards the end I died 3,4 even five time per &quot;puzzle&quot; disrupting completely the flow of the plot.
<br>So, well, the game was too hard for a game with this concept; I don&apos;t know if it was done to reach the 3h average gameplay time or what (the game lasts from little less than 2h to little more than 3h total), but that in my opinion was a huge mistake, mostly because, again, it disrupted the pace of the story-telling.
<br>
<br>In the end the game is still nice and aside from the difficulty, everything else is very interesting, especially the (huge) section of cultural descriptions and insights.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/never-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=6502262">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Gameplay Bug Bears
<br>
<br>There are plenty of outlets that have gone into great detail on the shortcomings of this game. Namely, the gameplay. I don&apos;t really think I can say anything else than this game is a platformer: You jump, you solve simple puzzles with either the environment (mostly spirit guides) or some sort of tool (the projectile or a box or something).
<br>
<br>I have heard from people like Total Biscuit that the KB&amp;M controls are a pain to deal with, but I play these games with a controller all the time. Even on the controller, the gameplay can be stiff, especially when you are in a chase-sequence and you need to wind-up your projectile to knock an obstacle under stress. You have to hold the aim-stick back, wait a second to charge it up, then fling the stick in the other direction to launch it. All while running as fast as you can.
<br>
<br>As a side note, I played this game solo, and yes, the AI will get stuck or get itself killed regularly, though I have found the AI fares better in the main-game now (but the DLC has the same problem). Local cooperative play is perhaps your best way of experiencing this game.
<br>
<br>What might interest you about this game?
<br>
<br>Let me try to entice you to want to play this game.
<br>
<br>The main thing this game does excel in is its aesthetic. Not only do the models of the protagonists, the tundra landscape and other animals look beautiful but the mythical spirits and other supernatural elements fit so perfectly that even the natural landscapes almost seem dreamlike. And throughout the game the environments keep you yearning to continue forward.
<br>
<br>Despite how simple are the puzzles, the game does feel well-made. Not everything mechanical is flawless; bugs, glitches or the delay on the projectile are minor, legit problems. But if you appreciate both the pace of a good 50 hour RPGs and the no-extra-fluff of a 2 to 4 hour title, then I think you&apos;ll enjoy this game.
<br>
<br>Lastly, there is obviously a lot of devotion put into honoring the creators&apos; heritage, and it shows through the story and the art-style. I try to think ofthisgame as a game-adaptation of an ancient epic tale. Something you&apos;d read out of The Odyssey. You have a heroine relying on her own skills and her companion, the Fox, to overcome the challenges of nature and to save her family and friends over the selfish interests.
<br>
<br>The story isn&apos;t going to be groundbreaking to modern tastes, obviously, but the story they do have touches on timeless human nature themes: Altruistic communities, the error in selfish pursuits, the afterlife within our natural world, supernatural forces, etc.
<br>
<br>I think the way the game handles telling these stories with only the narrator explaining what the protagonists are pursuing and thinking makes for a wonderful tale for adults. There are some dark tones  that makes it feel very mature, yet nothing is too graphic for kids if you want to play this game with a younger sibling or child, unless death is too morbid of a topic.
<br>
<br>That is at least how I see the game, an interactive epic tale. At least that&apos;s how I&apos;ve sold the idea to friends. You might think otherwise, and that is fine if this game seems like another artsy platformer. I wouldn&apos;t blame you.
<br>
<br>Intrusive Commentary
<br>
<br>As much as I appreciate being given cultural context,, I wished the commentary didn&apos;t feel so shoehorned. You are not forced to watch them, but every menu screen will remind you of any unseen cultural insights. By the way,these are the only collectibles to be found, and you&apos;re likely to come across them on your first run.
<br>
<br>Some of these clips do a good job in explaining what some characters, like the Owl Man, mean/represent and what purpose do they serve in-game. Others I thought were too preachy or trying too hard to make the culture sound more original when they were using the same themes found in other cultures.
<br>
<br>Also, some of the subtly is lost in the commentary, and sometimes they are reaching beyond what was shown to the player.
<br>
<br>For example, the introduction of Foxtales is of the fox chasing a mouse and the girl following along--this apparently is the devs showing that the two are disrespecting nature by playing with animals and not hunting them. Is this clear to the player? Not until the very last cultural insight are you told that was the moral of the story.
<br>
<br>This example doesn&apos;t ruin the experience, but it does stand out compared to other cutscenes that tell the lessons of the story through actions and gameplay.
<br>
<br>Conclusion
<br>
<br>No matter how much I have nitpicked at this game, and how there are legitimate issues with the gameplay, I still think I got my money&apos;s worth out of this game. Perhaps you might think the same if you give it a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/never-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=5435924">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>La duraci&#xF3;n es corta si la comparamos con otros juegos (casi 3 horas), pero sabiendo lo que quiere contarnos y las caracter&#xED;sticas jugarles, es m&#xE1;s que suficiente.
<br>
<br>Quiz&#xE1; un punto bastante malo, y que a mi personalmente me ha molestado, son los bugs, y m&#xE1;s seg&#xFA;n te vas acercando al final que se vuelven mas constantes y molestos. Me he llegado a encontrar con uno que solo se solucionaba saliendo y entrando al juego de nuevo.
<br>
<br>El juego es curioso, bonito (sin llegar a destacar) y jugablemente del mont&#xF3;n, pero nos ense&#xF1;a un poco de una de las ultimas culturas que viven en armon&#xED;a con la naturaleza. Sin duda es una experiencia cuando menos curiosa y por el camino aprendes algo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/never-alone/user-reviews?user_review_id=7082437">Expand</a></span>
