<br>Two main complaints would be the lack of ability to control time(lots of waiting in the later stages of the game) and the inability to effect construction without being severely penalized.  Extra content/environments, and a little tweaking of the giants&apos; abilities would serve this game well.  But overall a fun experience, especially for the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3172321">Expand</a></span>

I&#x2019;ve seen a lot of people try saying it is not a god game, but a puzzle game.  Every game is a puzzle of sorts if you think about it.  You&#x2019;re always trying to figure out the best combination to maximize completing the end goal.  The fact of the matter you play as a god controlling giants, so it&#x2019;s a god game.  Enough of my rant though, onto the review!
<br>Graphics:  I won&#x2019;t lie to you I&#x2019;m a sucker for simple graphics.  There is beauty in simplicity and this game does what it sets out to do very well.  They are easy on the eyes and very well done.  I don&#x2019;t feel every game needs HD life like graphics to be amazing.  It boils down to personal preference, and you can easily see screen shots on Steam, and judge for yourself.
<br>
<br>Audio:  Well there&#x2019;s not much there really, I honestly can&#x2019;t even recall if there was music so it must not be there or be very lacking.  The effects audio is nice but extremely basic.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:  I found the gameplay very nice.  Your goal is terraforming the earth into four different biomes (ocean, swamp, desert, and forests).  You then place resources (plants, animals, and minerals) down onto the land which provide food, money, or technology points attracting settlers to the land.  The giants have abilities to replace or morph existing tiles to change up the amount or type of resource given.  As you progress the villagers will start to build projects, that upon completion they will provide you with an ambassador that will allow you to unlock a new ability for one of the giants depending upon the village type (the type of village is determined from the three biomes).  If you overload the village with too much resources of a single type at once they will become greedy going to war with neighboring villages, and even eventually becoming bold enough to attack the giants.  You can distract the villages from become violent with certain resource types adding danger to the village.  At which point you must beat down or totally destroy the village.  The true challenge of the game comes from the time limits referred to as eras.  When you first start you have a time limit of thirty minutes to complete the challenges (they stack from game to game).  After you complete so many of the challenges you unlock the next era expanding the time to an hour per game.  There are three eras with a max time of an hour and half.  As you unlock more challenges they even unlock new resource types.
<br>Review:  I really enjoy this game it is challenging and yet still pretty relaxing.  It isn&#x2019;t free of any problems though.  I found when trying to complete specific challenges that the game play kind of got slow and turned into a waiting game of the villages expanding their border so they could get new resources.  I also am not a very big fan of the fact that the giants powers reset after every era.  It increases the challenge aspect, but its aggravating at the same time because it slows and hinders advancing the villages when starting a new era.  Also the game itself in the god game genre is very simplistic.  When I hear god game I automatically expect a very complex and deep game, such a Black &amp; White.  While not perfect by any means that game was complex.  So if you&#x2019;re looking for complexity you may find it lacking.  The game itself is great if you want a short time limit challenge.  I find it a nice break from my other games to try and knock out another era.  It is not a game I could find myself getting lost in which is something I look for in my god games.  For ten dollars though it is an easy purchase and you get what you pay for.
<br>
<br>Score breakdown/summary:
<br>Graphics: 10/10  There is beautify in simplicity and its executed very well.
<br>Audio: 6/10  The audio is very simplistic and there is no music.  Good music would have really increased the value.
<br>Gameplay: 9/10  smooth no noticeable glitches.  Simple with an appropriate level of complexity for what is presented.
<br>Review&#x2019;s Critique: 6/10  It&#x2019;s a nice game for the price, but it is not what I&#x2019;d imagine as an ideal god game, and completing some of the challenges is sort of tedious and slow going.
<br>Final Score: 7.75</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3179745">Expand</a></span>

However, the game remains fairly cartoony and ultimately a bit shallow, as far as narrative goes. I would&apos;ve loved to see the devs delve deeper into some of the issues they bring out through mechanics and very limited &quot;story,&quot; but this isn&apos;t done. The narrative, thus, is ineffective and left by the wayside  but that&apos;s okay, because it&apos;s a casual game with a casual-game pricetag. It&apos;s a fun game with enough content to probably get you through a few hours before peaking. For the developer, this game is a diving board, and insofar as creating a fun game and interest in the devs&apos; future work, I can&apos;t wait to see what comes next, &quot;god game&quot; or not, and I&apos;m glad they&apos;re not going to be just another phone game developer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3201345">Expand</a></span>

You might be a little underwhelmed at first, but by the time you&apos;re managing three villages at the same time, trying to figure out the most effective synergies of elements, it gets quite complex and engrossing.

It&apos;s a God game, in as such that you quite literally play as 4 gods who make the earth and control fate indirectly.  It&apos;s fairly well polished I suppose; the game mechanics are fairly functional and there aren&apos;t any notable glitches.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s just... this feels like a free flash game I&apos;d find on a website that promotes hobbyist game developers.  I might be missing the point here, but the game just isn&apos;t very good.  Specifically one of the core design mechanics hinges on finding the right combination of features to overcome certain situations so that you can unlock an achievement, but with a time limit forcing you to focus on a small number of achievements, you&apos;re forced to play through the exact same scenario.  I could forgive this 2-3 times, but there&apos;s no way I&apos;m going to play literally the same level 50 times and not feel peeved.  Casual and grinding don&apos;t blend well for me.
<br>
<br>Perhaps I could whine a bit when the timer feature caused one of my gods to fall asleep in the middle of a battle, where I had to wait quite a while for the god to get killed by what really was a situation.  I see an analogy to basketball, when the clock runs out and the game is over, except your opponent gets to play on the court another minute and score points.  It&apos;s too much of a fluid mechanic in the game for me to call it a bug, so I&apos;m just going to call it bad design.
<br>
<br>I probably went into this entirely the wrong way.  I expected a PC game to, well, have a little more depth I suppose.  If I had bought this for my cell phone, I suppose I&apos;d be a little less upset.  If you&apos;re looking for a far more casual gaming experience, then you&apos;ll be fine.  But if you&apos;re expecting a shiny version of Populous or even the simulator parts of Act Raisers, look elsewhere.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3852383">Expand</a></span>

Basically, you play the part of the planet. You&apos;re totally barren and unable to sustain life. You control 4 different giants who all have different abilities. Your goal is to make the world liveable and grow the cities as big as you can (racking up the city and world score). Every city will produce a semi random special work with certain requirements. Upon completion, you get an ambassador to upgrade your giants skills/unlock new abilities. This is the real key to the game as higher level project require much more resources which cannot be obtained without upgrading resources (which start out locked and are unlocked by completing various achievements).
<br>
<br>The challenge kicks in late in the game from the greed mechanic. When a city has more than 20 of any unused resource (threshold can be raised/lowered by various things like projects, awe, and danger) they gain greed. Too much greed and they&apos;ll start attacking other cities and even your giants. Late game they will start work on projects that give cities up to 500 unused resources (bigger gap  faster greed accumulation). Losing a city can massively set back your score and cost you valuable achievements. The game is a balancing act of managing multiple cities and their needs while striving for ambassadors without letting the humans kill each other.
<br>
<br>My one complaint comes from the 2 hour game mode (needed to unlock a lot of the high end achievements/resources). If you&apos;re really striving for absurd scores to get the best resources unlocked quickly, you spend a ton of time pausing and issuing orders to ensure you&apos;re maximizing building in the time limit. This can easily result in 4-5 games that I honestly found far less fun than the 30 &amp; 60 min game modes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3366618">Expand</a></span>

<br>I love these types of sim games, and I&apos;ve had a ton of fun with Reus. I love trying to figure out the best way to give my village as much food as possible so they can build the next upgrade in the small amount of space they have. There are many ways to go about playing, and lots of viable strategies. Greed can make the game tough at times, though, because some of the villages will gain greed without provocation and start burning other villages down, which gets annoying at times.
<br>
<br>The graphics are simple and colorful, and they do their job well. The sound and music are fine. The game controls fairly well. My biggest criticism against this game is that the tech tree is pretty complex, and there&apos;s no way to pull up a map of it inside the game.

It combines a very nice aesthetic with good gameplay and a good learning curve, though at a certain point the difficulty ramps up and I&apos;ve found myself stuck.
<br>
<br>This game has a lot of depth.  You start with four giants and need to manage their abilities to develop cities on your planet.  These cities grow depending on the resources you provide  give the people fruits, and farming communities will develop.  Give them animals and hunting or luxury communities will spring up.  If you give the people too many resources at once, they get greedy and might attack nearby settlements  or even the gods.
<br>
<br>The real fun of Reus comes as you begin to understand some &apos;ecosystem&apos; intricacies and how they relate to the great projects your settlements begin to develop.  Some settlement&apos;s great projects even demand the destruction of another settlement, so you have to manage both resources and your people&apos;s happiness, while making sure that once a town is destroyed the group that did it won&apos;t go on a rampage.
<br>
<br>Once these projects are completed  you&apos;ll get an ambassador that unlocks certain abilities in your gods.  Completing a farming project means you get a forest ambassador, for example, which grants benefits to each of the four giants.  It&apos;s your choice on which giants get which ambassadors, and these choices determine which of the later, larger projects you can complete  some require a lot of swamp ambassadors, while others require a few desert, etc.
<br>
<br>Reus is difficult, but rewarding.  You &apos;win&apos; by getting in-game achievements based on how many resources your people have in production. It&apos;s intuitive enough to get you through the first settings (30- 60-minute worlds), but in longer games you need to be active and constantly improve and expand the resources around the settlements.
<br>
<br>The drawbacks are games can be very difficult at the later stages, and it forces the player to really focus on one achievement.  When the game is set to last 120 minutes this can get pretty frustrating.  Still, the music and graphics are done well, as is the gameplay itself, so it rarely feels like a slog.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve put in 35 hours so far and paid $10 for it on sale, and I&apos;d be happy paying the full $20 for it.  Well worth the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3620379">Expand</a></span>

Well, that thought turned out to be wrong. I was skeptical at first, but soon enough Reus turned out to be one hell of a pleasant surprise!
<br>
<br>While the game might look simplistic, childish or even shallow, because of the colorful visuals and the concept of giants ruling the world, I promise you  this is not the case. Being a Civilization series veteran, I&apos;m used to deep and complex games. While Reus might not compare with Civilization 5 or other games on that subject, it definitely provides a sophisticated enough mechanism to keep people like me interested, at least so far.
<br>
<br>The idea in the game is to contribute to the development of the colonies by supplying resources and improvements, mainly plants, animals and minerals of different sorts. But in order to unlock the better, more advanced resources and improvements (called &quot;aspects&quot; in-game), you must explore and use the more basic options, or you can&apos;t progress and reach the advanced stuff. Needless to say, I guess, that the more advanced your giants are, the bigger and more prosperous colonies they can sustain, support and control. ...yes, control. Sometimes a colony gets greedy and arrogant and attacks your giants, and needs a good kick in the ass. In some cases it&apos;s even necessary to destroy a colony, if it looks hopeless.
<br>
<br>Also, the humans in the colonies will try and develop projects of different sorts, and you&apos;re supposed to help them meet the required criteria (if you want that project to succeed). The trick is to choose the optimal combination of resources to supply to the colony, factoring in the resource&apos;s position, its level, and the level of synergy it might or might not have with other resources nearby, plus the project&apos;s criteria, of course. So far, most projects need specific amounts of either food, wealth or technology or any combination of them. Some projects, though, will also require one or more unusual conditions, such as winning a war with another colony or having another colony completely destroyed (either by going to war or by &quot;divine intervention&quot;).
<br>
<br>There are more aspects to the game, some of which I don&apos;t fully understand myself yet, but I promise to update if I feel l learn something important enough. For one, you have time limits, both for the &quot;Era&quot; type of game (what I&apos;ve been playing so far) and for the projects. Obviously, it complicates things.
<br>
<br>Anyway, to summarize this   this game is way more complex and rewarding than it seems, or at least more than it seemed to me at first. If you like strategy and colony management, get it, definitely worth it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3798414">Expand</a></span>

It is a nice idea, and there are many possible combination, but the game is too slow paced to be fun for RTS addicts, and too simple for fans of management games.</span>

It defines itself as a &quot;god-game&quot;, but it&apos;s not quite like conventional god games. Where in black and white you could still directly interact with the real world, Reus offers no such option. All interactions with the world are done through controlling your giants (The &quot;Reuzen&quot;). Some people react negatively to this difference, but it&apos;s actually quite refreshing. This game is not a high action game, but more one of careful planning and discovery. If that&apos;s not your thing, this game is not for you.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s quite clear that a *lot* of time was spent on this by a talented game designer. The mechanics are not quite anything I&apos;ve come across and are consistent with each other (which, in the era of minigames is a rarity).
<br>
<br>All that being said; The graphics are decent, with an excellent distinctive style. The game does feel as if it could work better on a Tablet, but with the current price tag (Low for a PC game, but high for a tablet game) I can understand the decision.
<br>
<br>The only problem that I have with the game is that a lot of the options are locked in the first playtroughs of the game. This forces you to play the game over and over again, with only little changes every playtrough. I&apos;d much rather see all the options being open at the start and letting users find all the options by themselves (and there are a *lot* of options!)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3170187">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>as a ux-designer i have my very own little issues with this game (zooming is itchy, time-speed-up is missing etc.) but all in all this is a absolute remarkable game (especially considering it&apos;s abby game&apos;s first)
<br>
<br>the art style (despite or even because &quot;just 2D&quot;) fits nicely and is unique  on can feel the love that has gone into it. game mechanics are good and it&apos;s NOT a game you dismiss after 30 mins of playing (and boy i own a lot of these ...)

<br>i especially like the fact that you are never in direct control of any human or what they are going to do next (maybe even go crazy an go out for a god-hunt  silly little ignorants :)
<br>
<br>for me this a really nice metaphor on real life, and anyone complaining that therefore &quot;this is not a true god game&quot;: i dare you to show me where the heck (any) god has directly intervened  ever.
<br>
<br>normally i would give it a 9/10 (just because of the interface issues)  but the +1 is for all the flame-reviews which i think this game has not deserved.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3174783">Expand</a></span>

This game is reasonably easy to pick up and hard to master which I like a lot. it has many aspects to it and picks up on the god genre which has not been developed much. For 10 dollars you are going to get more fun and a lot more play time than most of the 60 dollar &quot;AAA&quot; titles out there. It seems like for the people who want to keep it simple they can and for the people who want to go more in depth and unlock everything there is enough content to keep most of us going for a while. The devs also said that if they game is popular enough (thus allowing them to work on the game more) they will be adding more to it so I really hope people take the plunge and play this awesome 10 dollar game. It is so crazy how it seems lately that 10 dollar indie games just wipe the floor with 60 dollar &quot;AAA&quot; games.
<br>
<br>tl;dr Fun, polished indie game that gives depth and great bang for the buck  buy it and have tons of fun!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3168071">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game has a lot going for it.  The idea is sound  you are the God of a planet who holds sway over four golems that live on the surface.  Using the power of the golems, you can change the face of the planet and encourage or destroy the growth of life.
<br>
<br>In terms of mechanics, the game is all about synergy  placing various objects next to each other to boost their performance.  Do a good job, and humans will arrive.  From time to time, if your humans get too greedy, they will go to war.  You then have to decide whether to let it play out or strike them all down with a biblical horror-show.
<br>
<br>In terms of pros, it&apos;s fun watching your golems do their thing.  The game offers up little challenges every now and then to encourage the development of your golems.  Terra-forming was fun and the design of the game would be good for teaching kids about nature.
<br>
<br>In terms of cons, the interface is horrible.  You are constantly clicking on golems trying to figure out what is unlocked and what is not unlocked because each game is only 30 minutes long and each new game resets all the golems.  There are many missed opportunities  specifically in the water biomes  in terms of what you can and can&apos;t build.
<br>
<br>The game to play would be Reus 2  this game but with a bunch of enhancements and a whole new interface that allows the user to quickly find spells, creatures, synergies, and events.  Until that game arrives, this one for me is a pass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3207770">Expand</a></span>

If they where going to make a second game for the PC They most likely should make it 3D that way it feels more like a game that would be on the PC...

The &quot;god&quot; aspect of the game comes from you using four giants to manipulate a world to try and help cities of people accomplish their goals  creating buildings which require a certain amount of resources being available to them.  The challenge comes by requiring you to use your giants (whose abilities synergise) to make enough resources available in a limited amount of space and time.  This requires planning in placement, and planning in deciding which of your giants get additional abilities upgraded along the way to meet these criteria.  Additionally, if you grow your cities too fast, then the inhabitants will become greedy and start trying to destroy neighbouring cities, which usually runs against your objectives.  The gameplay is simple to pick up but takes time to learn and master.  It may appear superficial and shallow at the beginning but the complexity really starts to stack up as you progress through the game.
<br>
<br>The presentation of this game through the art and music is admittedly what drew me into this game and I think that it delivers in this area.  The music is laid back and calming (unless cities are trying to destroy each other) and the art style I believe is well suited for what the game is trying to do.  Through the art and game mechanics, the game did engage me on an emotional level a lot more than I was expecting it to, however this is something subjective to me and may not hold true for other players.
<br>The overall sense I got from the game is that the devs genuinely cared about this project and put a lot of effort and soul into it.
<br>TLDR: A well presented game with original and enjoyable strategy/puzzle mechanics (simple to learn and hard to master) and an art-style that engaged me as a player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3172049">Expand</a></span>

Makes you want to experiment with the symbioses and transmutations. The art is great and has lots of details  the little people and animals are very cute. It&apos;s only $9,99 so I recommend to pick it up and try for yourself!</span>

Although it is more a puzzle game, you can slack off and go make your own cities, even though they build themselves, anyway, you can get them to go to war, get really advance technology, be a trading city, etc. Now I&apos;m going to talk about the actual puzzles themselves. They really aren&apos;t that hard in the beginning, but as you progress through the game, the time limits get shorter, and the puzzles get harder. I really don&apos;t want to spoil much more, but you really should buy this game, I mean it&apos;s only like $9 or $10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3174055">Expand</a></span>

Its gameplay is simple yet rewarding and advancing your villages through eras is fun.

There are good indie games out there that, while simple, provide a more fun gaming experience than mainstream games ever could. But Reus is certainly not among them. It combines the worst aspects of console  mainstream gaming (obligatory tutorials, extreme simplicity, pointless repetition, to name a few) with an amount of depth you would come to expect from a Newgrounds flash game released in 2000.  If buying  games solely for the reason that they&apos;re produced by pretentious indie developers is your thing, then by all means buy Reus. Otherwise, don&apos;t bother with this piece of  I gave it a 1/10 instead of 0/10 because the soundtrack is good, and some of the graphics are somewhat acceptable. It&apos;s an obvious moneygrab though which took the developers a month or two to create, at most. It saddens me that this is what PC gaming has devolved into, but it&apos;s the harsh cold reality. For a good laugh, check out the Abbey Games website (or forums), where they actually have the nerve to describe the development of this game as some kind of spiritual journey. In closing, I feel PC gaming is getting worse every year, and Reus is a prime example of why.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3164082">Expand</a></span>

The inhabitants interactions is only war, and the upgrading of certain features in the game is complicated. I feel as though this is a beta test of what could potentially be a really great game, it does need further development, and simplifying before it is worth spending any money.

<br>55 visuals and artwork.
<br>05 gameplay.
<br>
<br>Seriously, this game has not any gameplay at all. I really mean it, nothing at all. After 30 minutes you have nothing to do anymore, and seeing the settlements expand is not fun at all. Buy Black &amp; white instead.
<br>
<br>Anyway the visuals are really good, i praise the graphic behind it.</span>

<br>- The thing I love about god games is that I am able to essentially do whatever I want in the form of being a god.
<br>- I could create trees, pick up my followers and throw them around, cast meteors, terraform the land
<br>- But I am personally not a fan of this type of game, I see i t more of a number crunching game without a real goal in mind
<br>- in From Dust I had a set goal of protecting my city as well as optional missions and so on and so forth however I just lack the direction that I needed and wanted
<br>- The game turned too technical for me and took the enjoyment out of it for me.
<br>6/10 because is still a good game but not to my tastes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3247800">Expand</a></span>

<br>A fun, but repetitive challenge..
<br>Reus is a strategy math puzzle god game where you control 4 different giants&#x2026;
<br>Forest, Earth, Ocean, and Swamp&#x2026;
<br>Each giant has its own special ability, but they all interact with each other while world building&#x2026;
<br>The concept is simple&#x2026; you need to bring life to the planet&#x2026;
<br>You start with either an ocean or a desert&#x2026;
<br>The ocean allows you to create a forest or a swamp, and then you need to place life in the form of either animals or food&#x2026;
<br>Once you do this people will settle and build a village... they&#x2019;ll start a project which tells you the materials you need and its up to you to balance the small space to ensure you can provide enough materials for the village to strive&#x2026;
<br>And you can manage as many as youd like, but again you only get 4 giants for the entire world, and their abilities have cool downs, so juggling will definitely take skill&#x2026;
<br>As you complete projects you will earn an unlock for an ability of one of the 4 giants&#x2026;
<br>This is where the strategy ultimately comes into play, especially trying to unlock skills around the type of environment you want to build on&#x2026;
<br>And each project gets increasingly harder causing you to have e to mix and match different character abilities to add wealth to an animal for example&#x2026; and strategically place plants animals and minerals to boost the stats of surrounding materials&#x2026;
<br>And at first you get only 30 minutes to play around with your world and complete challenges to eventually unlock the 1 hr. and 2 hr. long modes&#x2026;
<br>You can knock out challenges 1 play through at a time or you can tackle them all at once&#x2026;
<br>But if you do go for a juggling act you have to be careful as settlements that grow too fast get greedy&#x2026;..
<br>The more you provide, the more projects you complete, the less the villagers are impressed by you&#x2026;
<br>They&#x2019;ll start attacking other villages and this is where you have to step in&#x2026;
<br>If a settlement gets too out of hand you have the power to crush them&#x2026;.
<br>To burn them&#x2026; add danger to humble them, or drown them&#x2026;
<br>Unfortunately though while I definitely found my first few hours to be very enjoyable&#x2026;
<br>The game doesn&#x2019;t ever really throw in new hurtles for you to deal with&#x2026;.
<br>So the gameplay ultimately starts to feel slow and frustrating at times trying to get the math right to allow an area to prosper&#x2026;
<br>I found the most fun in the chaos of building multiple settlements at once.. Jumping around to different areas&#x2026;
<br>But even then it feels a bit at a crawl as the giants move at a snail&#x2019;s pace, and the cool downs especially when you&#x2019;re focused on one spot at a time feel just a bit too slow&#x2026;
<br>Ultimately there&#x2019;s no hook to keep you going... the game doesn&#x2019;t do enough to keep itself from feeling painfully repetitive after your first few experiences with it..
<br>That being said if you&#x2019;re a math fan, Reus will offer a decent amount of fun and a great challenge
<br>I Give Reus a 7.0/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=6720000">Expand</a></span>

There are three tutorials which go by quickly, teach you everything you need to know about the game without being heavy handed, and are quite fun. Then you&apos;re launched into the real game. At first, you can only play 30-minute sessions, but as you play, you unlock the ability to play 60-minute, then 120-minute sessions. Even after the tutorials, there are loads of things to unlock (which you unlock by trying different styles of play) and tons of things to learn. The game is very good about encouraging experimentation. Even the tutorials will say things like, &quot;Experiment with X,&quot; so you learn without losing any sense of exploration or control.
<br>
<br>The in-game achievements each correspond to a Steam achievement, and they all encourage different play styles. One might be, &quot;End an era with only one village,&quot; and another might be, &quot;End the game with six co-existant villages.&quot; If you get both of these achievements, you have played two very different games.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s hard to explain what makes the game so fun. However, I know half the fun is in learning the game for yourself, so I won&apos;t try to spoil that for you. If you&apos;re looking for a short-ish game with infinite replay value, Reus is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3916260">Expand</a></span>

You need to mix and improve pieces, and place them in right order to improve their and/or their neighbors&apos; effect or to unlock upgrades and then place new pieces, improve those etc. The hardest part is to remember which pieces transmute into which pieces and what bonuses having such and such neighbor pieces give to a piece - because despite realistic names (&quot;blueberry&quot;, &quot;fox&quot;) most of these rules hardly have any real-word meaning and because of that are hard to remember.
<br>
<br>The graphics are casual which is OK for a game of this type. I did like the eco premise and the novel idea of &quot;playing for a planet&quot;. However, the giants move way too slowly, and there are long cooldowns on their actions, like 30 seconds which introduces long pauses in gameplay where you can&apos;t do much useful.
<br>
<br>If you like Alchemy-style games and enjoy searching for &quot;what transmutes into what&quot; then this game is for you. But if you expect Black &amp; White, Populous or Sim City, there is nothing for you here. I&apos;d even say this game is on a wrong platform. Alchemy games work best on mobile. And the game would have to be free with ads and in-app purchases.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=5870340">Expand</a></span>

The different &quot;level&apos;s&quot; are just a time-limit (at first 30 min), within this time you have to achieve as many goals as possible, this is my only concern with te game in normally don&apos;t like time driven games but after playing Reus for a few ours i certainally gonna play this game much more.

<br>I think Reus is one of indy games with the most value for your money, only &#x20AC;10 to get hours of gameplay!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3177227">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>With regards to graphics, it is a controversial topic in my opinion, it possesses a nice and refreshing design. Music and sound effects gives a light mood and suitable to the game&apos;s intentions.
<br>
<br>With why I gave the game a 5, it is stated in the beginning of this review; needs more options and area of play. Having an achievement system to encourage more replay isn&apos;t a good motivational aspect to unlock certain elements of the game and feels like a chore (like grinding in an mmorpg). After you&apos;ve understood what the game is about, you&apos;ll wonder if there&apos;s anything else to it, only to realize that you&apos;ve done the same thing over and over again.
<br>
<br>The pricing of the game is about $10  some people might say it&apos;s worth the content, some would say not. As for me, it feels like a mobile game that can be found free or priced below $5 like some users have mentioned. At first I gave this game a 6/10, after another 3 hours of playing to come to my final conclusion, I&apos;m moving it down to 5/10. I&apos;m kind of sad that it offers so little.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=3180313">Expand</a></span>

On the positive, the game has nice art work which was the reason I bought it in the first place. I definitely regret buying it..</span>

<br>
<br>Reus is a strategy God game where your control and coordinate 4 different giants (oceans, forests, rocks and swamps) to provide to a planet conditions to humans to settle and prosper. From where do the humans arrive? Who knows, but they came in a donkey.
<br>
<br>You start in an empty planet when the giants awake, and then you have to coordinate them and all of the available abilities to sustain life and unlock new stuff during the predefined amounts of gameplay time. Yes, you are not able to choose how many time your gamewill last...
<br>
<br>2- GAMEPLAY
<br>
<br>You start from playing 3 different tutorial, and they are very good to be honest, and then you start your slow paced journey through eras. Having no fast forward option surely helps giving the slowish feeling to this game.
<br>
<br>Placing minerals, plants in animals in the correct spots to boost production to the max is the secret. This resources will allow us to finish projects that will give us ambassadors, that unlock new abilities, that will allow us to upgrade the resources, to allow new projects to get new ambassadors, to unlock... you understand the point. In top of that you are not able to select projects, and people sometimes are bumb and select projects impossible to finish. Some upgrades are worse than the previous version of the resource, and I do not know that previously to the upgrade. That&apos;s not normal.
<br>
<br>If you give a lot of resources at a time, people will start to become greedy and will start wars against other villages or even against the giants, and then you&apos;ll have to just finish them off. That is fun, but some achievements depends in having war, and you need villages to have those. Bummer!
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not hard to unlock all content, but you can get bored quite easily with the lack of content of the game.
<br>
<br>3- CONCLUSION
<br>
<br>This is a small and fun game, but with not much to offer. The general mechanics of the game is very good, but I was a bit disappointed with it. It seemed different when I saw some gameplay. Do not get me wrong, the game is fun and entertaining, but it lacks some must have stuff of this kind of games.
<br>
<br>At the moment only costs &#x20AC;9,99 and I think this is a fair price for what the game offers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/reus/user-reviews?user_review_id=6656292">Expand</a></span>
