I waited until I could say that I am now used to the new version before I made a comment on it so that I would be more Impartial. Now the time has come. I always went between Pro Evo and Fifa until Pro Evo came out on the PS2 and Finally decided that despite being tougher it was an Evolution in football Games. I mainly play this game with a group of friends who all but one think it is dreadful, so dont care about the AI. This version is so bad that it has almost ruined the tournaments my friends and I play in. we always start the new season with the new version of Pro Evo. This year for the first time ever we had to make the unprecedented decision to revert back to Pro Evo 2013. Despite having worse graphis, Pro Evo 2013 has far more realistic game play, response, movement, running on and off the ball, passing, crossing, etc. It is just amazing at how badly Konami have Messed Up!!!! I agree with everyone who says how bad this version is and other friends who have tried my Pro Evo 2014 are never going to buy it.

<br>
<br>Where do I start? Let&apos;s do positives: the animations and graphics, which has been a point of criticism in the past has benefited greatly from the new engine. The animations are smooth. I own FIFA 12 and PES 2013 and I played both regularly. When I switched the difference between the smoothness of the animations was mind blowing, even better than the 2 year old FIFA. For a an hour or two this led me to believe that the game couldn&apos;t be that bad. Despite the good graphics only about 50 players have real faces. Even relatively well known players in big teams such as Arsenal do not have real faces. It&apos;s shocking how lazy the developers seem to have been on this game, it&apos;s as if they focused all their resources into converting the engine into a basic football game that they didn&apos;t have time for anything else. It really shows. The game is very, very bare bones. I read on one review that it was almost like a glorified Alpha version instead of a final release. On top of that Konami are really slow to try and fix these problems. If there was ever a time for PES to completely die off, it would be now. Even the large South American audience seems to hate it.
<br>
<br>Everything about this game feels wrong. The passing, the running, the shooting all feels as if you&apos;re moving in a plate of jelly. The shooting is the worst part. Advance shooting is too hard to control but might be useful for better players than I but the normal shooting is always, always delayed. Even with the latest data pack, patch and third party tool that&apos;s supposed to fix this. if you&apos;re one on one with the keeper forget about scoring, nothing you do will get the ball into the net, well except the goalkeeper messing up, which happens much too often. I have a feeling Konami realized the terrible shooting will result in very little goals scored so they made the goalkeeper make mistakes as much as possible. Any on-target shot hit with force will bounce from the keepers hands and into the net when shooting from inside the box. Besides making scoring too easy (which it isn&apos;t thanks to the terrible shooting mechanics cancelling it out) it also makes scoring a goal feel very unsatisfying. As someone that&apos;s played an entire season of Master League about 80% of my goals came from the goalkeeper simply letting the ball bounce off him when trying to stop even the mildest of shots. Defending has actually improved, it&apos;s easier to get the ball away from an attacker than ever because the passing and movement of attacking players are so sluggish. Simply attempting to stand in the general direction of an AI attacker will get you the ball. Speaking of the AI: It is horrible in every aspect. Every single COM team will attempt to press as hard as possible, leading to massive space to wreak havoc at the back. Your own teammates AI will always let you down, they seem to completely fall back whenever the ball is lost in the opposition area so you have to physically control them to go back and press.
<br>
<br>I think everyone has talked about the sluggishness but let&apos;s try and explain what they are talking about: the reaction time. If a loose ball appears (ie no one is in possession of it) it will take both you and the opposition several seconds to react to it, regardless of the buttons you press. It is the most frustrating problem I have ever faced in a football game especially when it happens in the box (yours or the opponents)  The difference between a fast player and an average speed player is tremendous, any player above 80 will effortlessly run through defenses while even slightly slow players won&apos;t even be able to run 2 meters in their own half without being completely crowded by faster players. A team with 60 in every stat but 80 in the Speed &amp; Agility and Dribbling Speed stats will beat any other team by at least 3 goals. If you thought pace abuse in FIFA was bad, don&apos;t even consider this game. This leads me to believe that the sluggishness and slow reaction time is a consequence of Konami trying to widen the gap between slow and fast players, which is absurd in the first place.
<br>
<br>The 500 characters I have left is not enough to describe all the issues, bugs and general gameplay problems so I suggest reading the user reviews or trying it for yourself (don&apos;t buy it though, that would be stupid). In summary: PES 2014 is a step in the right direction onto a landmine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3859520">Expand</a></span>

<br>PES 2014 is probably the worst PES they made.
<br>
<br>What happens when you have two companies making games about a sport they don&apos;t understand: FIFA14 and PES14 happen.
<br>
<br>First let&apos;s keep in mind an idea, which is, when you actually play football you have insight that its impossible to simulate in a game, so what happens when you create huge delays for player actions, you actually make a double delay and add a huge random factor into the game.
<br>
<br>So basically when they made it almost impossible to make first touch passes, they broke the game completely,it makes this game unplayable. Football is not remotely about predicting movement, its about realizing its about to happen, so you cant have a game about football that relies on the concept that you have to pass the ball to a player that is fully marked 2 seconds before you even get the ball in your feet, and hope that the AI realizes that the pass must avoid the opposing player and predict the teammate run, therefore making all actions a random action where so much can go unintentionally wrong.
<br>
<br>I could go on and on about these completely wrong game design concepts, but now let&apos;s take a look at the game modes, they are basically the same thing they were 8 or 9 years ago, almost no evolution whatsoever, I&apos;m not asking for a mix of football manager and football simulator, I&apos;m asking for something with a less arcade boring concept, something that isn&apos;t made just for the player to suceed and feel good about itself, football is about challenge.
<br>
<br>The AI... can it get any worst than this? The positioning is just crazy bad, the computer always uses the same type of gameplay, be it Barcelona or the worst team in the game, they all play alike, no difference whatsoever, how dull, how boring, this is not football. Making pressure is just damn useless because bad players behave like good players, they always know precisely what to do, to who they should pass the ball and how.
<br>
<br>At least now players can hold the ball and not be overrun by super tacking defenders, which is the only improvement to the game.
<br>
<br>FIFA is the same dull boring simulation, this games are years away from being considered simulations. Can we have a european company with people that actually know football to make a football game?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3833162">Expand</a></span>

<br>The sluggish controls, dimwitted AI (have played XBLA sports games with better AI than this),  an interface that gives litterally no information about what stats your players have so picking a team is impossible and other stupidity that makes everything just feel like it&#xB4;s put together by a group of 11 year olds.
<br>
<br>I can honestly say that if a reviewer has given this pile higher than a 1, you are either a blind EA hater or haven&#xB4;t play&#xB4;d this game at all.
<br>
<br>AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3634911">Expand</a></span>

Also the uncontrolled player of your team are very stupid  and in most cases run away from the ball. The other main issue and the most frustrating is the worst passing technique, the player happily pass the ball to the opposition player and I throw my new gamepad. If you love your gamepad and you are a little bit impatient, please don&apos;t buy this game.

The control was horrible, positioning by the players is like they never play football before, and dribbling does not make sense at all. It&apos;s so unrealistic, so that a fast player like Walcott can be outrun by the likes of Hummels and Pepe just because he&apos;s on the ball? Perhaps the developers should try going out and actually see people playing football before making such a stupid mistake. Shooting take a massive toll too. The long shot almost always of target, doesn&apos;t matter if you are playing C.Ronaldo or S.Gerrard. Also man marking and tackling doesn&apos;t work, as it&apos;s very easy to turn your back out and shield the ball. The only bright side is the addition of the one-two play, and better graphic. Also, don&apos;t try to pass the ball when you have goal kick, just pump it up field. Half of the time the opponent striker will get it from your defenders or before your defenders and smash it home. It&apos;s extremely easy to intercept balls passing to someone, because of the slow reaction speed. Interaction with the ball seem realistic, until you try to pass it in a high speed combination (like tiki-taka and 1-2 plays)
<br>That was on gameplay. Now what most interesting about the PES series imho is the Master League. If you like this, then don&apos;t even bother to buy this game. Stick to PES 2013 instead. Not only the menu is shrink to tiny size of not that many options, the development of players is horrible as well. No more the ability for you to get a focus trainer for a particular player. No longer you can rely on finding a good gem out of your youth team. No easy way out of striking a deal to buy your favourite players. And it&apos;s so easy to manage your team revenue, it&apos;s sickening (I&apos;m playing AC Milan with 32 players, with like 9 star players with salary above &#xA3;10m, yet there is no trouble keeping my budget high up). Also you can&apos;t renew the contract of anyone you want to secure on your team, until his contract is about to run out.
<br>Bottom line is, KONAMI, please at lease finish making the game before it&apos;s released. It has potentials to claim back the rightful throne from FIFA, but if you keep choosing to ignore your fan reactions, you will never get back in the first place of football games</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3669488">Expand</a></span>

<br>im gona describe my last game, playing with fcp against psg the game was 0/0, at minute 58 lavezzi cross the ball and my player alex sandro on the area dominates the ball with chest and puts the ball inside my won goal line
<br>
<br>at minute 65 i cross the ball and jackson misses, thiago silva instead of cutting out the ball just stops in front of it, varela dash and goal, its like  thiago silva had a strock and sttod there watching the ball
<br>
<br>against man utd i am winning  superstar  1/0, at minute 42 rooney shots from the middle of nowere the balls hits helton and he defends up, but inside the net!
<br>
<br>and theres palyers movements and control i spend the entire game struggling against the controls because they are just bad

<br>Gameplay:
<br>
<br>It plays unbelievable slow and sluggish. You dont feel that you have control over your Team. A good example would be hmmm imagine an online Match with a horrible Connection and you get an impression how PES 2014 feels! Every Action is soooo delayed...its actually painful to think about all the moves you could have made in a Match, if only the Guys on Pitch would respond to the commands on your Joypad in proper time... -_-
<br>
<br>In Matches (not only myself, Friends as well...) You find yourself cramping the controller and pressing buttons harder and harder, hoping to get quicker responses from your player...but nope.
<br>
<br>Gone are quick shots, passes (Manual of course) and exciting gameplay...it feels like a game of chance for the most part. Goalkeeper AI is awful as well...but that would be something a Patch could fix (if the game would be fun, this Point wouldnt even bother me that much at this moment)
<br>
<br>If you liked PES 2011+12+13...skip this one...its a different Beast in a worse way...sure every Year a lot of people are moaning, ranting etc....this time....they seem to be right...
<br>
<br>P.S.
<br>
<br>Played many many Matches the last days. They improved on how sensitive you can direct passes&amp;shots with the analoguestick (compared to prev. Editions) but the delayed, slow Gameplay still ruins a fun experience, it feels like Work...the Fox-Engine seems to be capable of something great, if they only speed it up (setting Gamespeed to +2 actually gives you a hunch of how good this game could be...) this PES could/would/should take the crown of Soccergames...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3576916">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Konami has made mistakes on many of its games, and few are completely perfect. But there was always the magic there. A new game was always a joy to play, even in Free Practice mode.
<br>
<br>So the dissapointment could not be greater. Especially after all the promises, the new engine, the heart feature, etc. Really Konami?
<br>
<br>The magis is gone. PES has gone the FIFA route, but is years behind their formula. Sure the animations are better than ever, but it means the game is sluggish, waiting for the animation to run before a change in direction, shot, pass, etc. Very different to the crisp, immediate response of the ISS and PES games of the past. So, so far, from the great games like PES6.
<br>
<br>The new engine novelty wears off very quickly, as it is a prettier game but by no means jaw dropping. Only a slight improvement. And football games are about gameplay, who cares about facial hair and more accurate lighting, when shooting feels unreal and manouvering in the penalty box is so sluggish.
<br>
<br>Man covering is terrible. I cannot get my team to pressure or hold the formation I desire.
<br>Konami have tried to make defending possible by implementing some ridiculous turbo gimmick. Your player slowly accelerates and then decelerates. Very very unrealistic. There is no player explosion, you have to wait for the players to slowly accelerate. Also running a 20m sprint is now impossible, as your player will decelerate and be caught by any defender like Vidic, etc.
<br>It is a complete gimick and unlike real football.
<br>
<br>In the end, this game is like a blow to the stomach. We knew Konami had problems with PES and going back to a new engine, with all their promises, would bring back the glory days.
<br>
<br>Now, PES is even further away from the original formula. Looking withouth personality. It is a bland FIFA experience, sluggish, gimicky, licenseless.
<br>
<br>PES 2013 is a much, much, better game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3605151">Expand</a></span>

PES 2014 should have been a fresh, new start for PES franchise. But unfortunately, it failed.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s start with positive things:
<br>-&gt; Visuals (except there is no grass, again), presentation and atmosphere are way ahead of it&apos;s predecessor. Now, you really have the felling you are playing at a real life stadium. A big improvement for the franchise, no doubt.
<br>-&gt; Full scale control over passing and shooting. PES 2014 offers the most precise passing in terms of controller input, when the &quot;advanced&quot; mode of passing is turned ON. When it comes to &quot;advanced&quot; shooting, some time is needed to get used to it, even for PES veterans like me.
<br>-&gt; Dribbling. I am sure that PES veterans are not that thrilled with it because it is heavily simplified. But I am pointing this out as the overall improvement for a larger community of players. Less skill is needed to perform dribble moves.
<br>-&gt; More licensed teams from other continents besides Europe.
<br>
<br>Now, the bad things and it is pretty bad:
<br>-&gt; Performance because of the new FOX engine. There is no replay or any break in the game that will not cause a frame rate drop. It is maybe for a second, but it shows that the game was not optimised as it should have been. And because of the new engine, there is no rain or snow. I mean, really? And no grass again, as I pointed out already.
<br>-&gt; AI (talking from the &quot;superstar&quot; difficulty perspective). Opponent players are pretty clever, maybe too much (magical defending), but the goalkeepers are not impressive at all. Another year and the same problem remained. Also, while playing BAL (Become a Legend), no matter what difficulty you choose, your teammates are braindead. It is a frustrating experience, more than enjoyable and I&apos;m sure that is not the way.
<br>-&gt; Passing. It is the most precise ever, but it demands hours and hours of practicing to be able to pass the ball correctly in the match. Most of the players will not have the patience for it, so they will switch to standard passing system which has another big problem. Pass target marking took one step backwards. In the match, you will pass several balls in the way you did not select at all. Tweeking pass support option does not help. &quot;The game knows better&quot; passes, I call it.
<br>-&gt; Dribbling. As I have pointed out above, experienced PES players will not like it at all.
<br>-&gt; So, with all this said, it is time to point out THE MOST ANNOYING thing in the game. LAG, LAG and LAG. When you press a button, you would expect that the game will perform selected action immediately. But that is not the case here. Game needs a whole second and the most saddest thing is the gameplay was made this way, it is not a performance issue. That leads to a slow and sluggish movement of players which eventually breaks the overall pace of the game.
<br>-&gt; Stadiums. PES 2013 had 37 stadiums and this year we have only 18 if I&apos;m correct. I know there has been some issues with licensing and EA, but common, they could at least add more generic stadiums.
<br>-&gt; Soundtrack. Or the lack of it, better said.
<br>-&gt; Stadium creator. Not existent in PES 2014.
<br>-&gt; Fewer modes.
<br>-&gt; No WE and PES United.
<br>
<br>One step forward and two steps back. That sentence would, pretty much, describe what PES 2014 is all about. I will stick to PES 2013 for one more year and hope that 2015 will bring overall improvement to the game. Until then, a mediocre 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3595644">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are just gorgeous, being miles, leaps and bounds ahead of the competition counterpart. The atmosphere surrounding the match is almost surreal. The sound department doesn&apos;t fall behind and delivers quite well. Might not be as good as the competition, but had a significant improvement from the last version (no, even though the sound has seen improvements, the commentary still sucking some royal &quot;s&quot;). The new team licenses add value to the game definitely (at least to some south american and asian players), but, unfortunately, the gameplay has some flawed aspects. The AI is unbalanced, oscillating between unmerciful and plain retarded. The controls, even though not being utter sh**, like some say, could&apos;ve been better; the player with the ball could run a tad bit faster, just enough to not seem like he sh*t himself moments after the start of the match. Overall, the game has it&apos;s flaws, but is definitely a step ahead to franchise. Once the problems get ironed out, the competition will need to come up with something actually new to compete.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3869982">Expand</a></span>

I had no fun with all the PES games from PES 2008 to PES 2012 and the Fifa games felt so much better and more realistisc until I played PES 2013 at that point I switched back to Konami&apos;s PES series. And now I bought PES 2014 for the PC and I have to say that there are a lot of changes. First the graphics look really stunning on the PC at max. settings and there is less lagg than on the console versions. The gameplay feels really smooth and realistic. The ball physics is also really great. But there are also some points which i have to criticise like the licenses. There are less licensed teams and stadiums in contrast to PES 2013. All in all I&apos;m really happy with the new PES and I hope they can optimize the Fox Engine till PES 2015 so that it won&apos;t lag at the opening scenes and so on. Graphics: 9.5/10, Sound 8.5/10, Controls 8/10, Gameplay 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3583817">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are ok, they do, the animations are good, but the thing that bugs the hell out of me in the game is these terrible controls, it just doesn&apos;t work, you really dont have the feeling you got control over you players, and they also added some pressure system, to put pressure on the player with the ball, this basically is just your players rushing towards the dude with the ball, most of the time this ends up you kicking the crap out of the guy and you got the ball, its that simple to get the ball. The difficulty is also very very strange, at one moment i&apos;m absolutely destroying a A+ team with 8-1, and the next i can&apos;t even beat the lowest rated team there is... Looks like i will stick to Fifa this year to restock my interest for a soccer game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3658826">Expand</a></span>

<br>BAD
<br>Poor Controls  AI Needs to be redesigned not copied from FIFA  Lost the &quot;camera angles&quot; variations ,the true  reason for PES was successful.......  player movements crappy....... Automation copied from FIFA but lacked the engine to deliver the total fun..... Some Loading issues on MNL.

<br>
<br>A few patches and tweaks and this game will become quite good. It is already good compared to other football games. In time, maybe we will have a really good and fun football game if Konami keeps up the good work they&apos;ve done on this one. In all fairness, the demo is better so let&apos;s just hope they implement the AI gameplay they used in that one and improve the keepers somewhat.
<br>
<br>It could also use a passing style option. The team styles doesn&apos;t really work all that well, as the AI will favor long passes regardless of what you actually set them to play. How can I give an 8 after saying mostly negative stuff you ask?
<br>
<br>Have you played FIFA? that one deserves -5... ok the two last ones maybe 0. Football games have SUCKED for a few decades and this is a HUGE step in the right direction so it deserves some credit for the effort. I have fun with it if I take it at face value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3692811">Expand</a></span>

Terrible licencing, awful likenesses. Slow, dated menu systems. Broken gameplay in that long range shots are near impossible to score, defending is silly, tackling is unrewarding and based on chance.
<br>
<br>BUT...so much potential. Wish they&apos;d spend two years on it.</span>

The sluggish controls, when you try to hit the shoot button the player will comply after 2,4 seconds delayed. Such a step back for the franchise.</span>

<br>
<br>Well, the bad news with PES 2014 is that it seems that Konami have been looking very closely at FIFA and how the game is constructed, and to a certain extent totally ripped it off (much like EA did with Pro Evo in order to finally get a half decent footie game out themselves). That is not too say that PES 2014 is just like FIFA, it isn&apos;t, but subjectively, it feels very similar to play. By that I mean, slow, unresponsive, over-burdened with fancy tricks, and worst of all, completely unsatisfying to score in. I have had fewer than 10 games on it so admittedly, I don&apos;t really know the game so well, but the problem is, I just don&apos;t feel any motivation to get to know it.
<br>
<br>Konami have completely thrown the baby out with the bathwater I am afraid and I doubt that they are going to find it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3807426">Expand</a></span>

This year tho KONAMI delivers what to me is nothing else but a poor FIFA clone. It&apos;s PES 2008 all over again, whenever KONAMI announces a &quot;whole new game&quot; they deliever one with terrible AI, horrible referees and below par goalkeeper. The game flow, which has been the main reason for me liking PES more than FIFA is pretty much gone completely. I have started a Master League with Bologna on Superstar, looking for a bit of a challenge. I win pretty much of every match with ease and i&apos;m not even happy about the goals i score, because they usually are histerical if not sad mistakes by the opposition&apos;s goalkeepers. The ones i concede are usually own goals by my GK or a case of switching to the wrong defender and not getting to the ball first because KONAMI decided, switching with the right analog stick was too convinient to have in a subpar FIFA clone....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3660658">Expand</a></span>

Bad:

<br>- Less features than previous PES
<br>- No Pre purchase in steam (Thanks god haha)
<br>- Two month to be on steam and 59USD ????
<br>- No steam works
<br>- No steam cloud
<br>
<br>Always making the same errors.
<br>Your best choice, go again with FIFA this year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3773235">Expand</a></span>

The goals seem to be scored the same way again and again and all the passing is based on long balls (especially to the wings). All in all, a mediocre game despite KONAMI&apos;s efforts and online features after releasing the two patches.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=3870004">Expand</a></span>

<br>Siento que Konami no se esforz&#xF3; casi nada en hacer este PES.</span>

<br>Looks like they have given up on the 2014 iteration and moved on to the 2015 version but how awfull it makes the supporters feel, they dont have a clue...
<br>
<br>Other problems are:
<br>
<br>It is still very prone Internet lag! it should atleast!  let you connect to GOOD connections only!
<br>
<br>The defending AI is wo weak against spams and every online player, Be it a &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;Super Star&quot; tends to spam the passes to forvets...
<br>
<br>No matter the formation or the Man marking settings... BLIND passes seem to reach the other 40m far end...
<br>
<br>Everymatch,  i see my defenders staring at very interceptable balls... sometimes the passes actually hit them and yet they can not claim it! IT is depressing at very least!
<br>
<br>There is no voice chat or any kind of useable text-chat in ranked matches.
<br>
<br>Selecting the defence players are faulty,  you can not select your defender closest to attacker...
<br>
<br>It is impossible to use the new feature to select players by R stick, it glitches....
<br>
<br>Actually , i can not decide whether it isThe PES devs Team or the Game itself at a fault...
<br>
<br>The Pes Team pretends to be receiving suggestions via twitter or some non-official forums but i dont see anyone realted to the team responding... ANd the faults of the game are so obvious that it begs the question of why they had to be reported...
<br>
<br>Game is months old and they have not still fixed the cursor change glitches that happen during set pieces...
<br>
<br>It feels as if no one is working on pes 2014 fixes any more... And the game is nowhere near the level that we got accustomed by KONAMI products...
<br>
<br>Very Dishonest business structure!
<br>
<br>Not supporting them any more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=4150650">Expand</a></span>

<br>Coming to PES 14, :( i really disappointed alot with this PES14, i am PES fan and played all the PES series, and honestly the PES 6 and PES13 were really awesome games every regarding graphics,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and all other aspects compared to PES14. In PES14 the ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS REALLY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY BAD, You&apos;ll feel irritated with the AI in this game, you cant pass the to the desired player,you cant run faster than your opponent, the GOAL KEEPER is a TOY, he&apos;ll respond after the GOAL. And so many full of negative points are in this game. Hoping best in PES15. I SUGGEST DONT GO FOR THIS AND PLAY PES13</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pro-evolution-soccer-2014/user-reviews?user_review_id=4497555">Expand</a></span>
