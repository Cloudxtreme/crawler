From the woeful tutorial sections at the beginning of the game, to the intuitive design choices, Black and White seems more like a title designed to frustrate the player than to actual teach them anything.  If anyone recalls the much better game, Populous 3, which came out some years before this, exceeds in teaching the player fairly basic mechanics and structure without attaching a one ton weight that is the atrocious AI of Black And White&apos;s infamous &quot;creatures.&quot;  You start the game off helping some folks being GOD and whatnot, you aren&apos;t opposed to helping (or harming) people once in awhile.  After you&apos;re bored with that its time to listen to a tutorial for an hour rather than to introduce things slowly to the player without patronizing them or belittling their technical abilities to understand how a very basic game actually works.  Their is no &quot;management&quot; of your throng of villagers, the gaggles of them will just literally do whatever you need them to do.  Should you wish, you could essentially sit around and do nothing for them, but unfortunately nothing would ever get done.  Unsurprisingly these villagers are pretty slow compared to you, GOD, who can essentially do their work for them much faster.  After a few buildings are finished you will get to pick from three adorably polygonal monstrous creatures:  A cow, a lion or an Orangutan.  In what can only be described as, &quot;tedious to a degree not since seen in any other game ever&quot; you are now forced into what can only be described as a pet simulation till the end of single player game.  None of the creatures were particularly better than you, GOD, and the effort needed to train these beasts from murdering citizens or gaining their trust before picking one up all of a sudden and eating them was mentally draining.  I certainly don&apos;t remember this portion of the game being intuitive either.  In fact I found it revolting how easily you could accidentally train your monster something entirely wrong and not know the consequences until it was too late.  I never even bothered to finished the incredibly long winded Single player portion, as I was just too frustrated by the creature AI mechanics to possibly stomach the rest of the game.  Though it was met with exceedingly amazed reviewers at its time of release, since then it has been confirmed for one of the most overrated and over hyped pieces of software to come out in some time.  Is it fun to pick up villagers and throw all of them into the ocean one by one in an effort to bring some peace from the chaos?  Yes of course.  But you&apos;ll never get anything done that way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/black-white/user-reviews?user_review_id=3528040">Expand</a></span>

And, yes the gameplay does eventually get rather boring after a while and the story isn&apos;t even really worth paying attention to. Most of the time, I just try to build the best, most efficient city ever and then once my goals are met I bring the apocalypse upon my people. Muahahaha! Ahem.
<br>
<br>Anyways, I wouldn&apos;t exactly recommend this game, but if it&apos;s really cheap then buy it. Otherwise, I&apos;d go for B&amp;W 2 instead.

So yea I finally did, well I don&apos;t know that to say, I can think of so many things but I will just try to keep it simple. The game looks great very nice considering it came out in 2001, the sound and music are really good and the presentation is great, almost all about the game is decent for a 2001 game. nothing can go wrong right? Well... I am not sure if the game didn&apos;t age well or the concept was just too new back in the day or if it all was just a commercial stunt. Thing is the game is great but it just lacks depth, it gets very repetitive soon and trying too keep things in order, the vilages and citizens food wood miracles your creature etc etc becomes really hard, it starts to feel more like a chore than a game. Soon I started to feel more like a maid or a slave than a god. The game and concept is really great but it was poorly executed. I have very mixed feelings about this game and I don&apos;t know if I could recommend it, I have not played B&amp;W2 but if its slightly better than this one then get that one instead of this one. This game just feels incomplete that should have been my whole review summarized &apos;Incomplete game&apos;. I will rate it a 7 just because the game is not bad even with all it&apos;s flaws. if you like these type of games then get (Jowood The Nations) it&apos;s an old game too but at least it is more balanced than this one and it makes me feel more of a god than this one too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/black-white/user-reviews?user_review_id=5558619">Expand</a></span>

And the game had extremely nice graphics for the time when it was released, and the presentation of the game and tutorial is top notch and it has an innovative control system, so as a game developer I fully appreciate the game and it is a nice work of art. But as a gamer there simply isn&apos;t any game to play, micro managment of the minions is killing the game and training the AI is close to impossible. However the game serves as a great tool of sorting out magazines that do real game reviews and those the just look at the cover, play the game for 15 minutes and then write a review. Don&apos;t ever buy one of the magazines that rated this game above 70. I haven&apos;t tried out B&amp;W2 yet, but hopefully gameplay is included in the sequel which might make it a great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/black-white/user-reviews?user_review_id=397900">Expand</a></span>

Naive, kitschy characters (a little devil and a wizard-type figure that are about as charming as the Microsoft paperclip), blocky and dull-looking worshippers and kludgy game play make for uninspiring game play. Sadly, B&amp;W doesn&apos;t deliver half of what it promises.</span>

Though having some major issues, this game was entertaining enough to keep my interest for a while.  The miracle system and freedom to act how you please are what made this game so entertaining.  No boundaries but your own sense of right and wrong.  However, the AI was leagues behind where it needed to be for a game like this.  Stupid villagers cannot even feed themselves if you don&apos;t manage their village&apos;s every need.  Your creature will walk around eating folk, even if you slap him silly every time he does it.  This game was created far before its time.  If made today, this could have been so much better!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/black-white/user-reviews?user_review_id=1604076">Expand</a></span>

The creature aspect either feels too advanced, or just wasn&apos;t thought through completely. I can&apos;t decide. Somehow it will feel like having a real pet, with a colorful personality where you can affect it&apos;s choices, lifestyle and morale. But the system for doing this requires a lot of patience, as it&apos;s seldom clear on how to do this. Often you will be required to watch him closely every minute to find the right timing on when to praise him or scold him, and the outcome may still not be what you thought it to be. It also seems like the creature forgets stuff over time, so he will have to keep relearning things throughout the game, which proves tedious. As for being a god  the layout feels clever. You&apos;ll impress different towns with your godly ways, which will give you enough influence for them to start worshiping you. But you may only do stuff within your &quot;influence radar&quot;, which makes it essential to either bring your pet over to impress or cause distress; or throw rocks and stuff from afar like crazy until people take notice. Sometimes, it works out well and you&apos;ll feel good about it. Other times, you&apos;ll want to rip your hair out as the god-villain so easily may electrify your creature to death, making your choices very few on how to proceed. It&apos;s also quite sad how boring it may be to be a god, as it often will feel like a village simulator where you just micromanage stuff; like turning citizens into farmers, build stuff and keep bringing food over to your worshipers. And every level will be repetitive as this is pretty much all you do. Then there&apos;s the side quests. They&apos;re always cheesy, but often a fun break from the regular god-stuff that you do. The rewards will often be surprising, but seldom that useful. Though I have to say that most of the charm in this game lies within such things. I find a lot of pleasure from the side quests, exploring the world, pressing F1 to get descriptions of weird stuff on the islands, checking out small easter eggs and such. It&apos;s clear that the game is meant to be quirky and fun, rather than a die hard strategy game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/black-white/user-reviews?user_review_id=3759673">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll give it a 9 instead of the 10 it deserves sheerly out of contempt with the lack of patches given for Black &amp; White&apos;s expansion pack: Creatures Isle. Overall its a wonderful game that I recommend it for all. Good for ages young to immortal.</span>

The game is very easy to learn so don&apos;t listen to those idiots at Computer Games Magazine or Gaming Age. Not only that its awesome for single player experiences! If possible I would give it a 110 out of 10! Try It!!!</span>

The game itself is a complete marvel, an innovative game that breaks the boundaries of what many games today still struggle and hide behind. However, the micromanagement becomes too much of a thorn in your side unless you get yourself together within around 10 minutes. Case in point: I am currently on a level where i must capture and maintain the faith of 3 villages. Not only am I under threat from the opposing god, i also have to fill granaries and silos, build homes, MANUALLY set individuals to SPECIFIC jobs, and many other fiddly tasks. If you leave your plebites to try and control themselves, the game becomes a nightmare. This aside, this game is an absolutely addicting masterpiece with innovation by the bucketloads. A MUST play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/black-white/user-reviews?user_review_id=740506">Expand</a></span>

Only 1 problem....it tends to freeze up and crash occasionally (it seems like this happens when I want to quick save...LOL!!)</span>

The more villagers pray to you, the greater your circle of influence on the map becomes. Your goal is to capture the whole map and defeat rival gods. You also control a creature which you teach with rewards and punishments. Astonishingly, the creature&apos;s AI is designed with so much plasticity that, with some patience, you can teach it to do very complex things like creating forests, fetching stuff and generally helping villagers a lot and taking most of micromanagement away from you. Villagers tend to become lazy if you just give them food and wood, so it&apos;s better to create forests and rains instead, letting the villagers produce food and wood themselves. With some training, your creature would even do all the forests/rain spells.
<br>
<br>You can also choose to be an evil god, torture villages and let your creature eat them. The creature can fight with creatures of rival gods. There are quests scattered over the world, with the most famous one being where you bring grain and a pig to sailors (I still remember their song: &quot;We&apos;re not complaining but there is one more thing remaining: We&apos;re not going nowhere &apos;ntil we get some meat.. &quot;).
<br>
<br>The graphics are great for the time and still look good, and you can fully zoom out to see the whole map on the screen. You have 2 advisers (one good and one evil) who are funny and have a lot of character, especially the evil one. The game has an innovative system of casting spells (by drawing signs on the screen) which unfortunately doesn&apos;t work well - but you can also just use hotkeys for spells as well.
<br>
<br>The only real downside (and that&apos;s why 9/10 and not 10/10) is that the game somehow lacks purpose. The campaign offers a handful of words to conquer and after that you don&apos;t know what to do else. Even being evil for a while gets boring fast. This game came years before Minecraft, which made this style of game (&quot;do whatever you want&quot;) more common and accepted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/black-white/user-reviews?user_review_id=5873172">Expand</a></span>
