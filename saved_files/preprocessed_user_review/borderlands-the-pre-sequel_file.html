No Goliath&apos;s like in Borderlands 2, so the enemies are only running at you and trying to kill you.  No real interesting enemies.   Lots of running around and even though there&apos;s vehicles, you tend to find yourself without one most of the time.  Resulting in you having to traverse the same area over and over on foot, which results in you fighting the same enemies over and over.  The new classes aren&apos;t interesting either.
<br>
<br>The game also seems to have new mechanics for the hell of it.  You have to worry about oxygen, which is available within arm reaching distance.  So it&apos;s not hard to get oxygen but it&apos;s annoying to remember that you need to refill.  You also have badass points that you can throw at increasing things like gun damage, shields, and etc.  But it&apos;s just another annoying thing to remember to deal with.
<br>
<br>Then there&apos;s the in your face about sexuality.  For example Janey Springs is a lesbian, and that information was told to us more than once.  Sir Hammerlock is also referenced to be gay.  The new female character classes look clearly like the developers were trying to avoid trying to sexualized them.  Even Mad Moxxi turns out to be a mechanical genius, which happens to be the one over sexualized character.  We get that GBX is very pro same sex and you don&apos;t want to treat woman as sexual objects.  We also get that the developers are Australian.  But this doesn&apos;t add anything comedic to the game, like what is usually done in Borderlands 2.  The game just doesn&apos;t seem to be as funny as Borderlands 2, and is nearly downright serious.  I really miss hearing the random idiocy from npc&apos;s like the Goliath.
<br>
<br>Overall the game isn&apos;t worth $60.  You want a good Borderlands game then get Borderlands 2.  The game has a lot of travel time between key areas and you get sick and tired of killing Aussie&apos;s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4620051">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Let me start by saying BL1 was one of my favorite games. Of. All. Time.
<br>
<br>I eagerly bought BL2 and it&apos;s season pass, and definitely enjoyed playing more in Pandora. I finished all of the games, much of the BL1 DLC and I think all of the BL2 DLC. The graphic style, action, individual character&apos;s traits &amp; special abilities, and weaponry were all super enjoyable, but even more so was the overall story line, voice acting, humor and just the overall way the games presented themselves to me as a player. But I have to say, the game was getting long in the tooth for me.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d been watching some news about the pre-sequel for a few months, but didn&apos;t read too much of it because I wanted it to still have some surprises for me when it came out, but I had pretty much committed to buying the next thing Gearbox put out in the series. I was honestly expecting a very different game from the past couple, and am incredibly disappointed to find out that this is not the case.
<br>
<br>Without being overly dramatic, as many other have said, this looks like the BL12 assets were dumped over to another developer who has, imho, done a pretty poor job of creating a new game out of them. I was really surprised to see that right off the bat, the story seemed poorly told, the voice acting and dialogue is not very good (actually the dialogue is terrible in parts to be honest). Most everything in the game is either pulled directly from the first games (like the gratuitous and stupid appearances of Roland and Lilith in a bar) or is a reskinned asset from the game.  The awesome personalities of the past characters are smothered in bad writing now, and the new playable characters seem dull as well.
<br>
<br>Even early on the game there are visual glitches, tons of pathcollision problems (both I and NPCsMobs getting stuck, etc). The framerates seem to hiccup at times, etc. Not what I would expect from a title in a several year old franchise. There are years-old issues (example: why are there a million little green light boxes that have $1 or $2 in them - why does the game make you waste so much time opening stuff only to receive more junk?) and even more fundamental issues in new game - why do you spend hours playing and getting access to the health vending machines, only to be shown a tutorial tip long after that saying you can buy health kits from them?) It&apos;s like no one actually paid attention to this stuff to see if it was done properly, to the standards of any other &apos;new&apos; game.
<br>
<br>But honestly, the worst part - no told me this was going to be &quot;Aussies in Space&quot;. Seriously. I love stuff Aussie in general, but if someone told me the developer was going to use so mush Aussie voice acting *with* accent and moreover, tons of Aussie slang, I would never have even considered purchasing this. This whole aspect is off-putting and the jokesreferences are just plain terrible.
<br>
<br>I seriously feel like this was a rehashed game put out to pull in revenue leading up to the holiday season. This is a purchase I really regret and would return the game if I could. Randy, if you read this - this kind of thing is what turns a loyal customer into a &quot;never going to buy from this company again&quot;, because I won&apos;t take a $60 chance again if this is what you going to let be published.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4612208">Expand</a></span>

<br>This DLC is great. I mean seriously. ten hours of content for a price of... 30 pounds... I&apos;ll admit I feel cheated. And you know, I knew this would happen but I decided to pre-order this game anyway. This game feels and plays out like a DLC. this does NOT feel like a complete 30 quid game at ALL.
<br>
<br>There are some modifications made from borderlands 2 however, weirdly enough, I think they uswd an older version of Borderlands 2 as a template because some good things from borderlanda 2 were removed like for example the possibility to mark inventory items as trash has unfortunately vanished. As well as the zoom level on sniper rifles and weapons with scopes. Are there any positive modificatoins made from the original game (and by this I mean BL2) ?
<br>
<br>Yes, namely one, the zero gravity system. Ill admit it feels like a breath of fresh air to have the gravity system as a functionning system. it is also particularly well implemented in the search for treasure and the like. the terrain is much more explorable than in Borderlands 2 and you&apos;ll have to inspect every roof of every building to make sure you haven&apos;t missed a chest somewhere.
<br>Its uses in combat are fairly limited. You can the so called butt slam but it seems a bit useless to do that when you can get some purple level equipment pretty easily and shred your enemies to pieces. Also, if it is like melee damage in borderlands 2 (which I think is a good way to assimilate), it will probably become completely insignificant in new game + and ng ++.
<br>But yeah, the jumping feels good and responsive (especially that double jumping part, nice going), even if there are those hard times when you are a milimeter under the ledge you want to grab and you just cant get over it (this tends to happen a lot).
<br>
<br>So why do I thumbs down this game? why so much hate?
<br>BECAUSE THIS IS NOT WORTH GODDAMN 30 QUID !!
<br>This is worth 15&#xA3; not a cent more. and to see that they charged full price (I say full but generally itd be 40&#xA3; but since they really wanted people like me to pre-order it, they decided to &quot;make it at a reduced price of 30 pounds&quot; and I mean seriously? this is **** They KNEW very well that the game wasnt worth 40&#xA3; at ALL and they just wanted to make the game look more alluring because of a pseudo &quot;limited time&quot; offer.

<br>But you know, when they see that borderlands 3 doesnt have as good a start as they expected, now theyll know why: Because they are lying cheating bastards whom I (and other people I&apos;m sure) trusted in making a game and failed to deliver.
<br>
<br>To add to that, the four player co-up is COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY BROKEN. Not only is there not a single match with less than 30 ping but there are huge connection problems in general, massive lag spikes, CONSTANT freezes when using the chat and sometimes youll have to wait 5 minutes to get the list of available servers to play from. So yeah, I am NOT satisfied.
<br>
<br>This game couldve been good but I think its pretty obvious that 2K only intended to use the franchise as a way to milk money out of honest fans. And I have learnt my lesson. I will only buy 2K games when they are at half price and never buy them full price again.
<br>
<br>Do I have any other general comments on the &quot;game&quot; as a whole?
<br>I like the story. the SHORT story. I also like the vehicles but found it particularly tedious to drive the buggies without falling in lava.
<br>I think that the game fits well in the BL universe, for what it&apos;s worth.
<br>
<br>Is this DLC good? hell yeah, its a top quality DLC worth 15&#xA3; for sure. Is it worth buying now? NO. DEFINITELY NOT. And if I were you, I&apos;d just not buy it at all just to show 2K that we arent **** stupid at the point of buying a DLC at 30&#xA3;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4606378">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Borderlands 2 was fantastic and the DLC that went along side that game was quite good, however it has been some time since this original release and in 2014 I just dont think the game holds up all that well. The visuals are dated, the impact and quality of the writing has tapered off, the shooting feels mechanical and flat and features added here that attempt to mix up the formula feel very minor, unoriginal and probably should have made an appearance earlier in Borderlands 2 DLC.
<br>
<br>If you really loved Borderlands 2, you will probably enjoy what is on offer here however really only if you are looking for more of the same with a few twists.
<br>
<br>People hate to see padded out re-hashes of old games shipped at full retail prices and unfortunately this feels exactly what we have here. If this game was cheaper, shorter, less broken and released a little earlier in the year everyone would likely be more than satisfied, or simply un-interested. I am the latter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4604377">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The most horrible part lies in the gameplay: they tried to add a third dimension to the series by injecting gravity and loooong and booooring jumps that fail to be enjoyable. The player spends too much time trying to master this skill and, guess what ?, the enemies are shooting at you when you are mid-air :) In a FPS game, jumping in low-gravity is the dumbest move you can do as a player because you&apos;re an just an easy target waiting to get shot ... So, the overhyped feature (low-grav) is nothing but a bad one.
<br>
<br>Laser guns are not fun at all. They just don&apos;t work on animals and are way too effective on humans... Speaking of these, there are way too many to be enjoyable past the first couple hours of gameplay.
<br>
<br>Because of low-grav, the combat system tends to be very cumbersome. That&apos;s a show killer for me !
<br>
<br>The level design in the &apos;open world&apos; maps renders the vehicles useless. In fact, the game forces you to use the jump/low-grav combo too many times in these areas and the player spends a lot of time just ... running and shooting animals. So, in my opinion the game lifespan is overrated. In general, I fell the level design is not well done.
<br>
<br>The only really good part comes from the character design: playing as claptrap is funny as hell ! It&apos;s dialogues are amusing and sometimes really funny ! It&apos;s skills, and their combination, are puzzling and offer a great deal of variety. On the contrary, the other characters are just new names put on the old ones from the first two games of the franchise. Their skills are way too common.
<br>
<br>As another commenter said it, Gearbox has been taking too much money from me already (duke nukem, alien colonial marines, borderlands tps). At the point I even consider not buying Homeworld Remastered when it will get out ! Please Gearbox, don&apos;t mess up with this one or you will lose a sale ! You already lost   a pre-sale ...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4605592">Expand</a></span>

<br>...I think this is, if anything, a larger DLC. I found the environments horribly monotonous, or rather, bi-tonous: Tech or generic Moon with small cosmetic adjustments.
<br>
<br>Whacky Borderlands scenarios and personalities were much more scarce this time, much of them replaced by extremely annoying, some INTENTIONALLY annoying voices. The unending barrage of trivial vocalized nerve-gas some of the NPCs keep attacking you with caused some of my group to just turn voices down a lot. I don&apos;t remember a similar situation once in whole BL1 and BL2. In fact, the only NPC that never grated on our nerves was Springs.
<br>
<br>The game progress, story turns and story &quot;connections&quot; between the two games felt rushed, sometimes half-assed, and my group thought the best ones were actually the small, hidden ones in ECHOs and similar. The focus on our pro/antagonist... well a rushed chain of total over-reactions from both sides hardly surmounts to an interesting character development, and sometimes ridiculed those the game tried to display as dramatic. This is only the second time BL had a good opportunity to give contrasting serious and dramatic situations opposed to the fun and nonsense, but failed, none of them turned out believable in my eyes.
<br>
<br>As for the gameplay mechanics, I like the increased variations through lazers and cryo weapons, but the O2 is im my opinion more obstacle than feature, same with airborne bonuses and atmosphere split bonuses.
<br>
<br>Objectively...
<br>...the raw amount of landscape variations is less than in the previous games, and using the moon as an excuse for this does not apply in a logic-defying universe as BL&apos;s.
<br>
<br>Now voices are of course completely subjective, but the fact can be noted that 4 out of 4 in my group were annoyed by them, though our personalities are quite varying.
<br>
<br>The amount of quests AND environments was limited compared to the previous games, just open a finished quest log in BL2 -and- look through every zone&apos;s map once, two looks are enough to show that it is unnecessary to count them to verify this being objective.
<br>
<br>Summary: Thanks for the lazers but I&apos;m gonna go back to Borderlands 2</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4615396">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>However, if you&apos;re new to the Borderlands series, I cannot recommend the game at this time.
<br>- The pacing is horrible.  Not Final Fantasy XIII horrible, but the first 4-6 hours of the game it&apos;ll be holding your hand
<br>- The environments are, well, as boring as in Borderlands 1.  You&apos;ll be looking at grey moon for nearly the entire game.
<br>- There are game breaking bugs, to include a main story mission in which you take a lift to the 2nd floor of a building.  If you get knocked off said 2nd floor, there is currently no way to get back up.  Since it&apos;s a main story mission, you can&apos;t proceed (unless it&apos;s patched later).  So your only option is to restart with a new character.  This is completely unacceptable in 2014, not to mention Borderlands 1 and 2 had the same issues with missions that would become broken.
<br>- The gameplay gets way, way too chaotic, and with many of the action skills this time around, so much is flashing on the screen (especially with ClapTrap) you don&apos;t always know what in the **** is hitting you, and then you&apos;re in FFYL and dead.
<br>- The story.  Nothing even close to Borderlands 2.  But it is better than Borderlands 1, I&apos;ll give it that.  They had quite the potential to show Jack&apos;s rise to power, but it just falls flat.
<br>
<br>So, in closing:
<br>- You&apos;re a huge Borderlands honk who can&apos;t get enough.  Raise this to 9/10.
<br>- You&apos;re someone who has never played Borderlands.  5/10, take $20 and wait for the GOTY edition to go on sale for Borderlands 2.  You&apos;ll get 50-70 hours of content and a much, MUCH better game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4593055">Expand</a></span>

I really loved the first Borderlands. Was honestly one of my favorite games. The second was a step backwards, mainly because it was mostly just a DLC of the first game. I had high hopes for this games.
<br>
<br>Graphics: The graphics were basically the same as the other games, which when the first game came out were good, when the second game came out there were okay... At this point I really expect more. There was no upgrade of graphics and while they are stylized that is no excuse for some kind of upgrade. 5/10
<br>
<br>Gameplay: Really the biggest issue I have is the same. There hasn&apos;t been any upgrade in gameplay in the series at all. it is more of the same. From my experience there is even less variety in weapon drops than in the first game. 5/10
<br>
<br>Story: This is the biggest dissappointment to me. I thought the story to the first game was really good. And again, the second game, at least for me, took a step forward. But this game is basically one long injoke after another. Not only that but if you are in on the joke, you may as well just ignore the story. If the gameplay had advanced or the graphics were an upgrade I might be able to forgive this but it is hard when the one saving grace should have been the trite, meme inspired, rehashed BS story. 3/10
<br>
<br>Overall score a 4.3 so rounded down... 4/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4604384">Expand</a></span>

So far, The Pre-Sequel leaves a lot to be desired. Loot drops are few and far between, the characters are just reskinned, revoiced versions of the BL2 stereotypes, and the distinctions between the four character classes are &quot;meh&quot; at best. The O2 (Oz Kits) thing seemed novel at first but then it becomes just another meter and piece of gear to worry about along with your shields, health, and class kits. Weapons still suffer the same boring homogenization from Borderlands 2, except slag is basically replaced by lasers.
<br>
<br>This doesn&apos;t even get into the terrible and buggy textures or the ridiculous amounts of bugs in the game. In the first 30 minutes of playing, I was hit by both a &quot;Fight for Your Life&quot; bug on Helios Station that caused me to die when it shouldn&apos;t have and I fell through a texture on Elpis that forced a complete game restart. Meanwhile, the flat, terrible textures on static items (like power conduits) are a slap to the face, as if they just couldn&apos;t take the time to be bothered. I&apos;ve seen better texture work back on the Dreamcast.
<br>
<br>This feels like it should have been just a larger DLC for Borderlands 2 but, instead, Gearbox decided to milk it into a full release that exists solely to push out another 6 to 8 months of further DLC. Save your money and just wait for a complete edition that will inevitably come out around next summer.
<br>
<br>Edit: Beware, the downranking and &quot;new user, first time review&quot; shills are coming. Read the critic reviews, don&apos;t just pay attention to number. Most of them, even the positive ones, make the exact same complaints I do. This is NOT a game worth full retail price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4590446">Expand</a></span>

The more I&apos;ve gotten into it, though, the worse it seems. In addition to feeling like DLC rather than a full new game, almost everything that it does is done poorly. The story, most notably, is horrid, especially when contrasted against the great writing of Borderlands 2. Instead of cleverness, wit, and endearing characters, we get blandness, incoherence, and a neverending stream of Australian stereotypes. The only good thing here is Moxxi&apos;s role in the story, and that gets overshadowed by just how bad the rest of the story is.
<br>
<br>The oxygen mechanics get old quickly and ultimately act to the game&apos;s detriment, gameplay feels less satisfying, fast travel stations are painfully infrequent, the level design is bland, the story makes no sense, the pacing is all wrong, so many cheap pit deaths, needlessly large amounts of empty space between everything, a confusing to navigate hub area, moonstone (eridium) chests are annoying since if you don&apos;t have forty moonstones you miss out on a large portion of that area&apos;s loot, enemy designs are uninteresting, the whole world looks very same-y, the vehicles aren&apos;t fun to drive. Outside of the same reasonably solid gunplay, if Borderlands 2 did it well, Borderlands The Pre-Sequel does it poorly. It&apos;s not the worst game I&apos;ve ever played, but it&apos;s a sequel that does everything wrong. Unless you&apos;re a series die hard or it&apos;s $5 with DLC, this is one to avoid. Even for cheap, it&apos;s not even really worth your time if you aren&apos;t a Borderlands devotee.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4590420">Expand</a></span>

Avoid this game like a plague.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4594491">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, Pre-Sequel creators decided to take bad things out of B1 and B2 and base whole game only on this leaving everything phenomenal out. So, here we have bunch of boring time trail missions. Level design is poor and missions design even worse. In 50% of missions you don&apos;t exactly know what you need to do. Most of the missions you can&apos;t start before listening 5 minutes of boring self conversation! In B1 and B2 you could start the mission and then listen to talks. But here they figured how to make this part boring. In 80% of missions you must stand and listed because at end of all talking you get some stupid thing you need for mission. Starting mission before would result with need to return to starting point. Unfortunately, don&apos;t see way how updates could repair this game. It have same sweet cartoon graphics as previous games, but gameplay and mission design is totally bad!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4614330">Expand</a></span>

<br>Lots of bugs at the moment everything from quest items to inventory management.
<br>The story is good enough to hold up as far as consistency, but oh my god the humor in this game is awful. The jokes feel very forced and for the vast majority of it i was not laughing.
<br>I am glad i beat this game so i understand the events that transpired, but it felt more like a chore then something i should be enjoying in my free time and towards the end i was skipping entire packs of mobs to run to the teleporter out of sheer disinterest.
<br>
<br>At the end i&apos;m left with the questions, &quot;what was missing in this game? what went wrong?&quot; because after it all i did not receive the same delight i&apos;ve come to expect from it&apos;s predecessors.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4609270">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s shorter than Borderlands 2, significantly. The map is smaller, and the area reuse is really noticeable. The side quests are incredibly tedious, especially due to the area reuse. You&apos;ll get side quests in areas that you outlevel so much that actually stopping to shoot anything is a waste of time.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is still good, but this is more like an expansion than a full game, and isn&apos;t worth full game prices. Series fans should wait for a sale. People new to the series should get Borderlands 2 instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4654649">Expand</a></span>

I started to play it, while very exited, and it was at least 4-5 hours in the game until I realized that something is missing and is kind-of off with the game as a whole. It is still Borderlands installment but I felt it was worse than most of the DLCs for the previous games. The map design is poor, story and dialog are neither inspired nor fun anymore (which were big points for BL1 and BL2). The new game-play mechanics are alright though. Biggest minus for me: the overall atmosphere is not there. I can even say that this game didn&apos;t feel like true Borderlands in some ways. After finishing it, I played BL2 for a bit and I was almost stunned how much better everything was arranged within a given map. The enemy variety and the beautiful places of BL2 are just in another league. I wonder, did the &quot;The Pre-Sequel&quot; was just an exercise for another sub-team of developers or they just lost the inspiration?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4627095">Expand</a></span>

Either that, or do the boring side quests. The enemy power and health has been increased, making second winds nigh impossible, and the characters are just boring, I found myself thinking which of these would be the least boring to play,  I have yet to play the DLC characters, the gladiator, or the enforcer, but if you do buy it, do not play Nisha or Claptrap.
<br>
<br>This game is not good for single player, it&apos;s a terrible single player experience, and should only be played with friends. That seems to have been the intent of the game seeing as it has a drastic increase in difficulty when compared to BL2. Who knows it may actually be good if you have friends(who have the game) to play it with. Otherwise do not buy this game. It&apos;s not worth 40$, and its sure as HELL not worth 60$. If you enjoyed Borderlands 2, this game will be a disappointment, if you didn&apos;t like Borderlands 2, then you&apos;ll enjoy this thing even less.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=5321087">Expand</a></span>

Complete bullcrap of a game. I&apos;m not even going to bother beating this game, wasted my money on the season pass expecting much more than what I payed for.</span>

<br>
<br>First, the humor.  It was dry, bland, and it felt like it was written by Australians, for Australians.  Doesn&apos;t 2K Australia understand that people from all around the world are buying this game and might not get Aussie humor?  The accents grated on my nerves a little bit, but it got better as you went along.
<br>
<br>The character depth just wasn&apos;t there, plus characters from BL 1 and 2 were reused with about 25% of their personalities we all know and love intact. The seemingly arbitrary homosexual references really pissed me off.  Not that I have anything against LGBT people, but I find it very insulting that the writers had to shoehorn another gay character in there and wave it in my face.  I mean, Springs, which I think was one of the few more charming characters, had several dialogue sequences in which the main subject being that she was a lesbian.  Great, you&apos;re a woman that likes other women.  So what?  I couldn&apos;t care less.  If a character&apos;s defining trait is their sexual orientation, then you&apos;re a horrible writer.
<br>
<br>The lack of extra content was astounding.  I bought the season pass, thinking that the game would redeem itself with a DLC gem.  I was mistaken.  The first DLC that queued in my Steam download tab was another arena map.  There was already an arena map in the main game and then you make a DLC that is just another one?  Boring, absolutely boring.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t have a big problem with the maps, because what do you really expect?  It was on a moon, you can&apos;t really get too creative with that.
<br>
<br>The length of the story is hard to gauge because I&apos;m the type that completes all available side quests before moving on with the main story.  I think it took me maybe 20 hours to complete the entire game and 90%+ of the side quests.
<br>
<br>Buy it on sale if you absolutely have to try it.  I uninstalled it and haven&apos;t looked back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4939806">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The bad: Too few enemies to kill. You spend most of your time running and backtracking. Combat is not satisfying enough you will miss the critical strike points of enemies in BL2, arms dropping, crippling etc. all maps look like each other and more backtracking. incredibly repetitive. No end game content.
<br>
<br>I tried hard to love this game a lot but got bored as soon as tvhm started.
<br>I would suggest waiting for huge discount and some DLC content to be available otherwise you will have 20-25 hours of game play before you realize you are forcing yourself to play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4779226">Expand</a></span>

<br>I recently played through Borderlands 2 and really couldn&apos;t put it down from start to finish. Unfortunately for this game I&apos;m having to force myself to play it just so I feel like I wasn&apos;t totally jipped out of my money.
<br>
<br>The world gets ugly and repetitive to look at very quickly. World design in Borderlands is always something I&apos;ve felt the game series did pretty bad, but the Presequel does it REALLY bad. It is the most unmemorable game world I&apos;ve ever played, I would literally rather explore a dog turd.
<br>
<br>The low gravity doesn&apos;t add any real value to the gameplay other then throwing your loot off the map on a regular basis, and the o2 mechanic is one of the most pointless tacked on features I&apos;ve seen in a video game. There&apos;s no real threat in running out of oxygen because you&apos;re always surrounded by areas to restore it. Even if you do run out it takes eternity for it to kill you.
<br>
<br>They CONSTANTLY throw weapon crates at you. I mean you don&apos;t even need to explore for them, you&apos;ll often run into multiple just along your path during a mission. It honestly takes away the joy of exploring and finding them like in BL2. Many of them will cost moonstone to open (presequels version of eridium). You&apos;ll probably find yourself accidentally wasting all your moonstone by opening them without realizing it.
<br>
<br>The story about Jacks rise to power should be fairly interesting, but somehow it manages to be pretty much total crap. It&apos;s a mixture of boring characters, poor writing, and a serious lack of humo, though it does attempt and fail over and over to bring humor.
<br>
<br>The side quests are simply not even worth doing. They are nothing but fetch quests, always taking you back to areas you&apos;ve already been at a lower level, meaning you&apos;ll be having to kill lower level mobs while you do it.
<br>
<br>Anyone with half a brain will see this game was rushed and extremely lazily done. Calling this Borderlands 2.5 would imply this would be as good as BL2 with some new stuff. It isn&apos;t. It&apos;s the worst of the series and it&apos;s an absolute rip off they are charging $60 for this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4604920">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Everything is worse by either a bit or by a lot. Humor and story: NPCs are fewer and flatter, the humor seems to be aimed at Australians, is preachy and tedious, and the story doesn&apos;t arc nearly as well. The gameplay features entirely too many platformer elements, skewed balance (compared to BL1, especially), and quests that are less varied and involve more backtracking (go there, oh, it&apos;s broken/blocked/guarded, go elsewhere, etc), and the oxygen system adds little but annoyance. On the technical side, we see no improvements (still no dupe/modding protection, still can&apos;t even choose the audio output in the options), and a lot more issues: clipping, game-stopping quest bugs, and glitches.
<br>
<br>The game isn&apos;t bad in the sense that you can&apos;t get your money&apos;s worth from it, but it&apos;s not anywhere on Borderland 2&apos;s level, even if you remove the DLC from the latter. It&apos;s painfully obvious that it was outsourced and that the original team had little to do with it. A shame, really, but in all fairness it should be said that Borderlands 2 was an unusually great game whose excellence is hard to match.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4605332">Expand</a></span>

<br>I tried to love this game. I tried as hard as I have ever tried. As a huge fan of the Borderlands series, This game looked like the best thing to ever happen. I watched every ad with wide eyes, and preordered the second I was able to. I even bought the season pass, as Borderlands 2 more than delivered on its price for its season pass. When the Presequel finally came out, I had booked several days off worked, stocked up on food, and prepared to delve into another adventure into the borderlands universe. Barely an hour later I was standing away from my PC, shaking my head, and regretting my blindness.This game is bad. Not legendary &apos;bad&apos;, just bad. From gimmicky mechanics which interfere with your gameplay (Goodbye rare weapon headed for low orbit!), to ridiculously unintuitive level design (Because instant death pits immediately outside of vehicle spawns are fun, right?), to length padding of the worst kind (Hey, you got the thing! Now go get three more from the other corners of the map!). However, this isn&apos;t the worst part, not at all. Both previous games had their glitches and faults. However, what they did have was fun. Hours upon hours of childlike fun, especially Borderlands 2. Even the worst areas in the game (I&apos;m looking at you Sawtooth cauldron, padding based level that you are!) are still enjoyable, although perhaps a bit tedious. This is where Borderlands: The Presequel fails. It simply is not FUN to play. Oh sure, it has interesting gimmicks, such as low gravity, Oz kits, Laser weapons, and plenty of eye candy, but this isn&apos;t what makes a game fun. A game is fun when its has honed gameplay mechanics, well designed levels, creative enemies, good music, enjoyable characters, and passable writing. The presequel has none of these.
<br>- The gameplay mechanics are pretty much ripped right from borderlands 2, icons and all, with virtually no change at all, bar their gimmick of gravity and air; you control exactly the same on the ground.
<br>- The levels are a bunch of interconnected linear paths of which you will be backtracking along most of during the story missions (cause backtracking is one of FPS gamer&apos;s most beloved mechanics!). And yes, I said story missions. Not side missions sending you back to somewhere, but straight up backtracking in th mandatory story missions...
<br>- The enemies are almost completely reskins with one or two quirks. The soldiers are just hyperion soldiers with more health and medics, the scavs are just bandits with jetpacks, the Torks are just spiderants with corrosive attacks and wallclimbing, the Rathyds are just Rakk with a more sustained attack, and the infected are just rats with helmets (Because rats weren&apos;t hard enough to deal with, and now they have headshot immunity!). The few enemies that aren&apos;t reskins, like the Shuggaths, are ridiculous. Huge floating sacks with tentacles with elemental attacks. Then the game begins not even reskining enemies! Yup, straight up throwing Stalkers at you with no explanation other than &quot;R&amp;D department&quot; (Because again, everyone loved the guys, right?). Even a thresher makes an appearance!
<br>- The music is uninspired, and a very poor followup to the soundtrack mastery of Borderlands 2. The entire score is par for the course in a sci-fi based game, and has no high points, just a mediocre soundtrack to your mediocre journey.
<br>- The characters... Oh god... Every lovable trait in any returning characters has been scrubbed away to make room for the Memes, such as Moxxi, who is now only innuendo, instead of the clever character from Borderlands 2, who had surprising levels of depth to her.. There&apos;s no originality in the new characters either, just a shallow representation of a single character trait, which is then amplified to truly irritating levels! The Australian character is a mechanic/homosexual/story-writer/blackmarket-dealer, who has almost no relevance past the first few missions, and is a poor followup character to Sir Hammerlock, whose role she fills. The British kid is a pickpocket/junk-dealer/information-dealer/salvager who ends up WELL overstaying his welcome in one mission which has the most padding out of all the ones I played and only serves to remind you that you&apos;re not done yet! Jack is the one who has suffered the worst, though, coming across as a jerk right from the beginning and only getting worse as the game advances. Wasn&apos;t the game supposed to be his fall from grace, the story of his transformation from decent leader to the tyrannical dictator that we all loved to hate? Well, he starts as an ass, and stays that way the whole game.
<br>- The writing is uninspired, lazy, and predicable. Plot points are forecast way in advance (Hmmm, an AI companion? Hope shes not gonna go crazy!), are often lackluster, and most often serve to make the game&apos;s characters worse. Again, Handsome Jack just become less and less enjoyable, and his actions aren&apos;t justifiable in the least throughout the game.

Do not play if you care about the franchise. Do play if you enjoyed game-play and would like a more child-friendly version of BL.
<br>
<br>I wanted to love this game, I really did.
<br>
<br>I knew very little about the Pre-Sequel itself before playing it but had high expectations and faith in the franchise that had delivered in the past, and gotten me enthralled in the lore and backstory of Boarderlands. After playing it for the last six hours, I feel a mix of denial and a sense of being cheated. Admittedly I have not played it all the way through, however things are not looking good. The game had potential, exploring more backstory, presenting Jack from another side, origin stories of other characters, revamping the gameplay, menus, weaponry, and just seemed to fail to impress on all fronts.
<br>
<br>I lot of this review will be subjective, however the game seems to have failed to improve in many areas, and taken a step back in others. The gameplay is practically identical to BL2, there seems to be less variety with the weaponry (discounting the lasers), the AI seems to be worse than previous instalments, the vehicle mechanics are worse and buggies often are unable to drive over a small ridge.
<br>
<br>The gaming features meant to be exciting and new just come off as gimmicks. The oxygen thing changes from being inconsequential to frustrating, but never really steps out from being boring. I can see they were trying to create some more pressure to travel and combat but it just doesnt make it any more fun. The landscape so far is boring, not remarkable apart from the novelty of seeing the Hyperion H in the sky again and from a different angle. And the zero-gravity gimmick seems to detract from the overall gameplay, rather than adding to it. This in itself had a lot of potential in exploring the world, however it is just frustrating in combat and ends up reducing a lot of tactics to &apos;jump and shoot&apos;.
<br>
<br>Finally, what really killed it for me was the characters and the humour. Personally, I could overlook all the rest if BL:TPS was equal in regard to either, bugs get fixed and patches are released. While I was expecting a darker turn for the BL universe, considering we know the conclusion of the character arcs, it seems to have moved in the other direction. The twisted, quirky, dry, sharp humour of the first two games seems to be dulled, polite and very careful not to offend, with one or two notable and kind of puzzling exclusions. The inappropriateness of the first two, as well as the feeling that the game had been made for the gaming community by the gaming community, and stacked full of easter eggs or references, seems to be replaced by poor imitations. If anything this seems to be trying to be child-friendly.
<br>
<br>Final point, why on earth is every second character Australian, and a poor Australian accent at that. As an Australian, those accents, coupled with the poor dialogue and line delivery, made the game seem like a B-grade movie, and distracted greatly from enjoying the backstory and relevant information being dispersed. Please note we for the most part don&apos;t sound like that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4630128">Expand</a></span>

The tutorial still sucks, the drop system is still flimsy with common loot and overspecialized with boss loot, there are still bullet sponge enemies everywhere, the lighting is still hard on the eyes, (though a little better because of the lack of variety), the frame rate is inconsistent no matter what system you run it on, the inventory UI is still an unwieldy abomination, enemy level progression is all over the place, and the writing still sucks. What we have here is a Majora&apos;s Mask sequel&apos;s worst case scenario--a one-off game that with a gimmick that completely changes the way you play, but but is completely and totally inferior to the home series&apos; &quot;mainstay&quot; games. This is a game with slow and unsatisfying gunplay, horrendous pacing, a plot that seems to have been put together with glue and chicken feathers, and a cast that is, at best, conventionally unlikable, at worst, obdurate to the point of inhumanity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4613374">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, it seems like ever since Anthony Burch took the helm the quality has steadily degraded, starting with Borderlands 2 and hopefully ending with this sorry excuse for a &quot;Pre-Sequel&quot;. We can only hope that this is the final nail in the cheap, plywood coffin of Gearbox Software, and that with a little luck the IP will finally fall into the hands of a competent designer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4604563">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>After watching the opening cinematic, I had a gut wrenching feeling that I had just wasted $60+ on a knock off. Unfortunately, the next few hours into the game only made me realize my instinct was dead on. FYI, introducing a poorly voiced character with a hard to understand accent who basically says Americans are stupid, is a poor way to lead into your game. For the player to then realize that most of the characters all have the same accent just destroys any immersion we had.
<br>
<br>This should be a lesson to other studios out there. When your flagship IP is handled by an amazing studio and then gets passed off to a mediocre one to milk it, we can all tell. Follow Pixar&apos;s example and when you see something is just bad, REWRITE IT. Didn&apos;t Colonial Marines teach anything?
<br>
<br>I&apos;m a huge Borderlands fan and was looking forward to this release. I didn&apos;t want to see any major changes or overhauls, just wanted more of the same awesome thing. Problem is, the writing in this is flat at best. The pacing of the humor is entirely off. Lines said too quickly without any impact, or just of poor taste to begin with.
<br>
<br>We get it, Australians believe Americans are stupid and they think that&apos;s fine to put in the game. However they censored a lot of other things they thought would be offensive, yet insulting their largest target market was deemed ok. I can understand why the impression of us is negative, but if we&apos;re going to generalize a nation of people then your penal colony production facility isn&apos;t any better, just cheaper to use and less successful at everything.
<br>
<br>On top of it, you&apos;re just not funny. Really. You took a stellar IP and basically turned it into a B movie-direct-to-video production. Congratulations.
<br>
<br>Low gravity is a gimmick and becomes just an annoyance. Oz kits are basically just relics with a different name to remind you where this garbage was produced.
<br>
<br>Characters are flat, none of the new playable toons really have any desirable qualities that feel new outside of Claptrop who ironically copies other toon&apos;s abilities. Mordecai became Gauge and now becomes Wilhelm. Salvador is a chick now. Not even bothering Miss Captain America and no siren this time around. Speaking of sirens.... Where&apos;s Angel?

The main quest flows like borderlands 2, but the writing and dialogues are way inferior. The graphic, gameplay, UI are all same as Borderlands 2 (throughout the whole game, I felt like playing one of long Borderlands 2 DLC).</span>

I didn&apos;t want to finish it, because it was that boring. Everything is boring. Thank god it&apos;s quite short.
<br>
<br>What&apos;s &quot;new&quot;:
<br>-&quot;Maps&quot; - Read 5-6 areas with the same old grey/moon filter.
<br>-Laser Weapons (It needs to be mentioned that these were also present in BL2, albeit in a more rudimentary form)
<br>-A constant cycle between Atmosphere and Zero G areas,which is kind of pointless.
<br>-O2 bar, to be used for breathing in space and double jump, which is
<br>-A new &quot;story&quot;. Jesus Christ, what the hell were these people thinking...
<br>
<br>Fans will be utterly disappointed by this, and if they really must have it, they should get it on sale, same as everyone else. It&apos;s a 10$ title at best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4835045">Expand</a></span>

<br>But what is new?
<br>
<br>-Lasers:They are new but they(like other new features) replace something old.In this case, lasers will replace the slug weapons.was never a fan of slug weapons, its ok.Lasers are fun in the game, some are overpowered compared to other weapons i think buti ts ok.
<br>
<br>-Ice damage:Ice damage is new, you can freeze enemys.I dont see any reason why i would do that.I can kill most enemys much fast with headshots.Not a great invention, sorry.
<br>
<br>-OZ kits:In some areas you need O2 to survive because you are on a moon.This becomes a minor annoying features cause the moon is full of small oxygenflieds of generators you can activate.You can do longer jumps in trade for some oxygen.Why not?Gives you some mobility, but you are very vulnerable in mid air i think.If you float high enough you can do a dash attack on the ground for enormous damage.Nice at first but after some hours into the game youll play on a station with normal gravity where you cant jump that high.And the OZ kits replace the relicts, so its not THAT new.
<br>
<br>-New classes:4 new classes, which mean semi new.Some of them play like the old one with some tweaks.Ive played the lawbringer, extrem useless actionskill.Autoaim that is not working well in some cases.All in all, its ok.
<br>
<br>Now a generall inspection of the hole game:
<br>
<br>Visuals:Same as Borderlands 2, its the same engine.Nothing new.
<br>
<br>Sound:Same as Borderlands 2.Some backroundmusic, nothing stands out, ok voiceacting.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:Many of the new features are nearly useless and something bothers me what other reviewers citized too:You cant cancel the dialogous!!!Sometimes this is sooooo boooooring because youll have to wait until the &quot;talking&quot; is other to progress.There are some quest that you can fail when you are too fast because the talking was not other.Techically the game thinks the mission isnt startet yet, you kill the target, it says &quot;failed&quot; because the target is dead when it shouldnt.From a technical stanpoint this is amateurstuff that souldnt happen.From that arises another problem:Trying out the 4 characters is booooooring as hell cause youll have to play through the hole tutorial.This is especialy stupid because this game is clearly made for fans of the series.They know how this game works.

<br>Conclusion:Borderlands 2 is ok for me.Like i said, im no fan of the mechanics.Borderlands 2 is ja solid 7 for me.What is my rating for the pre-qell?Hard to say.The humor is overused and extremly premature.You can say the same about the mechanics.Everything here is old, youve seen it in 2 other games of the series.The humor is gone, at least for me.Small bugs and a full priced game.I say thats enough on the con site to give this game a lower rating.Borderlands:TPQ is a 5 out of 10!For fans that played Borderlands 2 its ok, you can add 1 point.But thats it!If you never played Borderlands you should play Borderlands 2 instead of this game.More game per euro/dollar and a better villian.Cause the pre-quell is lacking a good villian.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4634027">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game should have been a dlc. There&apos;s just not enough character or story development. I gave it a 5 because I think I&apos;m still in love with BL2.
<br>The mobs. Jesus you enter an area and a ton of dudes railroad you.
<br>Jack. He sucks until the third act. Then he gets his funny/psycho thing on.
<br>If you find it on Steam for cheap, get it as it can still be fun. Especially as Athena and Fragtrap.

<br>Welcome to Elpis (Pandora&apos;s Moon). The population is 99% Australian accent and 1%, well you guys and some characters from BL 1 and 2. Not a huge issue until it got squased into your face with poor dialogue and bad jokes. They even went and redone the &quot;bandit voice&quot; for some odd reason. I have played a lot in one day and I have yet to actually just smile at a joke, but felt a lot of disgust most of the time - lets just say their jokes are more aimed at earthly issues/matters/cultures and nothing to do with the borderlands universe.
<br>
<br>What made Borderlands humour so awesome is that characters had a trait in their personality and then that trait was taken to the EXTREME. In pre-sequal that concept was just thrown down the drain, the characters are a jack-of-all-trades with normal earthly personalities and jokes - which in turn makes you feel very uncomfortable when all these people want to do is kill each other. Oh and just want to say thank you to the devolopers for ruining Moxxi for me, that goddess has totally been stripped down to the normal earthly grounds.
<br>
<br>Ok enough of me ranting about how badly the dialogue and jokes are.
<br>For a few good points: If you never bothered with the story of the previous games or cared for the humour then you will be pleased that nothing has change regarding the gameplay/fighting and graphics.
<br>Another good point is that this game has the best fighting start scene compared to the previous 2 and you can play as Claptrap (eventhough I didn&apos;t). Also what was a good surprise is that your character actually talks to people this time around and comunicates back with Jack. Anti-gravity.
<br>
<br>Bad points: Your character talks back with quest givers, if they limited this to Jack alone then it would have worked - but now you totally feel at a distance as your character spews the biggest load of rubbish when speaking to random quest givers. I play Nishe and I am very close to throw her into the dustbin, skill tree sucks and her &quot;personality&quot; sucks even more. Her special skill is auto-aim and her trees have a lot of &quot;needs&quot; that has to be met first. Want more gun damage? Then kill someone 1st and then you get more damage. Want more accuracy? You will only get it when you shoot from the hip - nevermind the fact that the scope outperforms that skill immediatly. Want healing regen? then 1st take damage 10 times and then we give you back 50% from then on - if you are still alive.
<br>Jumping is super limited and slow for a place with no gravity, you will run around on foot quite a lot as cars can&apos;t make every cliff jump. Also a small ledge in the middle of the road, nope still have to run around it as you are just just unable to jump ontop of it. This is also the 1st borderlands game where I am drowned in Ammo but starved for weapons. Now either they hid the weapon crates or there just isn&apos;t, maybe the 1st but as jumping gets old super fast and frustrating you can imagine. The battle field are also badly thought out - you want cover? nope you went and aggro another set of enemies. Heck - if your able to aim, stay in the air or just chase down your enemies. This game is so unimaginary they took names from other sources like - drakensburg or a small gang that named themselves the darksiders.
<br>
<br>I really want to throw this game in the bin, really I do - but the only thing that keeps me going is Jack. If it weren&apos;t for him, I would have uninstalled this game already. Take it from a player that loved the humour and story from Borderlands 1 and 2.

                                        <span>If you like Borderlands franchise, this game is good. However, the price tag for something that could have easily been a DLC is a show stopper. Same graphics, same gameplay, new classes and a cheesy story...that&apos;s all you get.  I will instead continue enjoying BL2 as I haven&apos;t tried all classes yet.</span>

<br>Sure, you can say that it has all the elements of Borderlands 2, so it also must be as good of a game. This is not true at all. The basic mechanics of BL are there and they still are very enjoyable, but fun and interesting campaign are missing. You only find yourself running from one end to another inside many very annoying, maze-like levels. Thats a fine way to add some content (hours) to the game play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4863271">Expand</a></span>

One of the things that really annoy me is the fact that developers made the hours of gameplay longer by simly making you run through whole location to teleport back to town. In borderlands 2, you always had teleport at the end of the mission. Also to complete all the quests you have visit the same location about 3 times. You cannot just take 3 quests and make them all in one location at once. You have first to complete the first one, run whole the way back to the location where you have taken it, take the second quest and run whole the way back to the same location to complete it and so on, its boring and costs you A LOT of time, Acid weapons ARE USELESS. They&apos;re the worst kind of weapon in the game since you never get to fight versus armored targets. Legendaries, most of them, are useless garbage. They&apos;re... original(?), and I can see how the developers found the mechanics of them a cool idea, but that just doesnt work. On lvl 50, youre basically using one legendarie, not because youre lazy, just because some of them are completely better then the other ones. Also the humour is kinda gone. Also you have to listen to the exact same dialogues TWICE to get to lvl 50. This is just annoying as **** since you cannot skip it. Borderlands 2 was better. Thats all I can say.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4609306">Expand</a></span>

They basically modded it slightly, then shipped it but also decided to add some hilarious Australian humor because they wanted the world to know that they were Aussies and they were really, really funny.  Hilarious that is, if you&apos;re some bearded Canberran hipster otherwise it&apos;s cringe worthy and the exact opposite of really, really funny and entertaining. The game does have the good gameplay of the original, something they left largely alone; so just when I thought the negatives could be mitigated by this fact, I got hit by a bug that basically made all my items/money magically disappear. So yeah, thanks for nothing 2K Australia.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4609228">Expand</a></span>

The whole oxygen mechanic is frustrating not innovative. The humor is nonexistent. It feels repetitive. Level design is uninspired. On the plus side, leveling up seems to be quicker. That&apos;s about it. Instead of buying this, get the DLC for Borderlands 2.</span>

You&apos;re getting literally 1/3 the content of previous Borderlands games and paying a higher price than you did for the real full games. The season pass is also a ripoff, only giving buyers 1 additional campaign when previous season passes gave 4 campaigns each. It&apos;s almost as if they&apos;re intentionally slapping Borderlands fans in the face.</span>

<br>Interesting new characters.
<br>
<br>What it does poorly:
<br>The humour is gone :(
<br>The story is crap
<br>It&apos;s way too short for $60. It&apos;s the length of 2 DLCs so should have been $40.
<br>A lack of variety in enemies. Reuse of many enemy models from B2.
<br>Bugs. Lots of game breaking bugs.
<br>
<br>Overall I can&apos;t see myself replaying this as the combat in the second half of the game is just horrible. The side quests are boring and the main quest storyline is so bad I don&apos;t think I want to live through it again. I&apos;m never buying another 2K Australia title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4632169">Expand</a></span>

Everything that was fun about Borderlands 2 is either repeated word for word in this game, or toned down. The loot system is the exact same, the enemies are still identical in function but with different names and graphics; Skags are replaced by space skags called Kraggons, bandits are replaced by space bandits with oxygen masks... the slag element is replaced by lasers. If anything, content wise, the presequel is roughly half the content of BL2. The game engine is identical to the one used in BL2, so this game feels more of an expansion pack than a standalone game. The characters this time around are also generic reskins of the standard team in past BL games. The humor is lackluster and more slapstick than ever before. There seems to be less quests and less things to do.
<br>
<br>Everything that was bad about Borderlands 2 is repeated word for word in this game. A quest will require you to go from point A to point B, and then insert obstacle C for you to make a boring and senseless detour around. Oh hey! Kill this guy for no reason other than he&apos;s a dick(a LITERAL example of how deep and interesting the plot is, taken from the actual game) Oh no! He destroyed the only launchpad to get to him! Walk 30 seconds around the map to a conveniently placed fuse charge to undo his efforts! This quest formula was notoriously plentiful in BL1 and BL2. It occurs more in Presequel. As with all iterations of the game, there is still no improvement on quality of life. You still have to accept a quest, finish it, and then travel all the way back to turn it in. You still have to travel all the way back to the main city to organize all your items. You still have to travel all the way across the map if you&apos;re going to places that don&apos;t have a travel point.  I&apos;m just save-quitting the game because that&apos;s a faster way to get to where I want to go sometimes. There are so many inconvenient, non-fun, time-consuming grinding experiences in this game.
<br>
<br>The setting of the game is set on the moon. Boring as hell. If you thought the environment in past iterations was on the bland side, wait til you see this. The story is so simple and the plot so meaningless. Handsome Jack from BL2 was in my opinion one of the greatest game villains of all time. He made you hate him and he did such a wonderful job doing it. Presequel downplays his characteristics and tries to make him seem more misunderstood and victimized in a way. It presents a different perspective that views Lilith and the other main cast members of BL as more of villains than heroes.
<br>
<br>And Claptrap is just boring retarded this time around. The whole game feels like you&apos;ve done it before and there&apos;s just no sense of novelty or inspiration. Some games come out feeling unfinished and cut up so that developers could get more money out of it; this game is the satanic reincarnation of that idea. This is &quot;bad&quot; DLC for Borderlands 2 that is somehow worth the full price of a new, standalone game.
<br>
<br>I hate this game so much, and I really enjoyed BL1 and BL2.  I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll find this game fun whether you liked the previous iterations or not. Even if BL1 and BL2 didn&apos;t exist, this game by itself is a horrible. Like, golf ball sized hemorrhoids horrible. The whole concept of this game rides so hard on the coattails of BL2 that it couldn&apos;t be seen as anything else besides an expansion. I played through the entire game hoping it would get better or interesting at some point, but it never did, it just abruptly ended and then asked me if I wanted a second playthrough. This is why people pirate games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4799921">Expand</a></span>

<br>Borderlands TP-S is not bad. In fact - it is as good as Borderlands 2 - so much that it is pretty much the same thing. ( Same in terms of feeling and gameplay )

It has all the features you expect from an expansion:

- new characters to play
- new enemies or at least reskins
- new locales
- new equipment

That is the formula for an expansion</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Disappointing on a high level...

<br>- new locales

<br>
<br>That is the formula for an expansion pack from my point of view. The thing about an expansion pack is that it expands on the base game, adding stuff - but not so much to justify calling it a sequel.
<br>
<br>I am also fairly sure that Gearbox will reserve the title &quot;Borderlands 3&quot; for bigger change in engine, gameplay etc. - with that in mind, i cannot help but feel a bit ripped off paying full price for what actually is a bigger DLC / expansion.
<br>
<br>I would happily recommend this game as a DLC for ~20$, but i cannot recommend it for a full price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4615390">Expand</a></span>

I paid 50 bucks for it in Australia, PC (own BL2 to i got the 10% thing) where as a normal new release is around 80-100.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617613">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game is fairly mediocre, not a terrible game, but it gets really boring after you reach around level 10. The humor in this game is the only redeeming quality and most of the jokes are references so keep that in mind when you are playing this game.
<br>
<br>The artwork is fairly well done, it looks pretty and the way they style the characters are pretty cool.
<br>
<br>The controls feel identical to Call of Duty&apos;s which should be good news to some people.
<br>
<br>The game plays smoothly, nothing too much here.
<br>
<br>The storyline is pretty awful, actually, it doesn&apos;t really have a storyline at all.
<br>
<br>Gave it a 6, couldn&apos;t finish it but I might pick it up later on and play in on console.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4604050">Expand</a></span>

<br>Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel -</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">It&apos;s sometimes a little tough doing a follow-up in this day and age. especially when following up on previous success. do something different which doesn&apos;t catch on: you&apos;ll get pilloried for &apos;changing a winning&apos; formula and breaking what was not broken - do it the same way: you&apos;ll get flamed for &apos;churning out the same thing&apos;,  &apos;rehashing&apos; and cash-grabbing.
<br>
<br>Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel - tries to straddle that thin line between the two.
<br>
<br>The game-play and mechanics have not been changed too much. Four new (kinda) characters with (some)what different skills. The same loot-hunting and over-the-top dialogue, action and story. Fans of 1 and 2 may like (perhaps) several scenes where the game shows-cases former characters; and a different perspective on Jack.
<br>
<br>As for the new: the low-gravity feature sometimes comes as more of a hindrance than any real fun. While the premise is sound, the maps/environment aren&apos;t as well designed as to allow for more of this feature to really shine. Imagine being able to bound from one point of cover to the next; or from cover to an overhead sniping position. The possibilities are endless but unfortunately, very limited in the game, which usually amounts to jumping around and shooting enemies at your feet/slamming them.
<br>
<br>Pacing and plodding around (especially in the first map and before you get your vehicle) isn&apos;t great. There is a whole lot of running around (in relative drab scenery) with little to do and few enemies.
<br>
<br>By and large, a decent game. But not really worth the full retail price right now. It does feel a little like a DLC rather than a stand-alone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4598721">Expand</a></span>

I loved the first one and I loved the second one even more. And I loved the DLCs too. The gameplay, the characters, the writing have always been top notch, absolutely fantastic.
<br>But I was a bit skeptic about the pre-sequel... and I was right. It wasn&apos;t developed by Gearbox, and it shows.
<br>The worst flaw is the writing. It&apos;s subpar, not even close to the Borderlands standards. The writer tries too hard and he really doesn&apos;t get the humour right. The characters are dull, shallow and not interesting at all. They also talk in an australian accent that it&apos;s fun at start, but gets trite pretty fast. Also, resorting to old characters just for the sake of having them in this game too feels desperate and like a bad retcon. Feels more like a fanfic, actually., and I will consider this game as apocryphal on the matter of the story. Hope it&apos;s not canon, especially what they did to the old characters.
<br>The playable characters are quite good, but their skill trees are just bad designed and uninteresting and don&apos;t allow the deepness of customization that we had in Borderlands 2.
<br>Map design is pretty dull, and it&apos;s sometimes WAY overcomplicated to the point it gets pretty annoying to navigate the maps, and this gets exacerbated by a bad and tedious mission design and a few bad teleporters placement.
<br>The zero-g mechanic is fun at start, but it&apos;s a gimmick and it doesn&apos;t add much to the gunplay, on the contrary, it actually tends to remove tactic from it. The new laser weapons and new element also don&apos;t fit too well.
<br>It can be fun, but it feels like a big DLC and cash grab and it&apos;s really not Borderlands.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4918071">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s just something about this game that leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. I find none of the characters particularly fun to play, and even the most interesting player character here is less interesting than the least interesting player character in other games. When you lose out in personality to Salvador the Gunzerker, that&apos;s really a problem.
<br>
<br>The thing is, as much as I felt like I would have liked &quot;more Borderlands 2&quot;, for a game that deserved to be so much more the Pre-Sequel just disappoints me. As much as I liked Handsome Jack as a character, I never felt so interested in him that I felt his backstory deserved an entire full-length game to flesh out. The game suffers the same faults as its predecessors, which I&apos;ll do my best to summarize quickly:
<br>
<br>-side quest overload. Not to say that there&apos;s too many, but rather too many are necessary simply to progress in the story. It is absolutely paradoxical that the writers will work so hard to create a main story that players will want to progress in then SLAM them back down at every mission or two to say NO! Too low level, go grind some side missions that are usually far less interesting. With every passing Borderlands game I find this more and more infuriating.
<br>
<br>-singleplayer vs coop paradox: in singleplayer, you get the distinct feeling that the number of enemies is balanced for multiplayer, as you quickly get swarmed by a dozen enemies ALL shooting at you when normally that would be spread among a few more players. In multiplayer however, the enemies become such bullet sponges (bosses especially) that you lose any feeling of your weapons having weight or impact. It&apos;s the same issue that Destiny has, where bosses can soak up thousands of bullets. Can you even call them bullets at that point?
<br>
<br>Other than these two major ones, I still enjoy the writing, and I greatly enjoy how player banter is increased several times over. This is one feature that I feel needs to make it into the inevitable Borderlands 3, because player characters could certainly feel lifeless in past games (which was why it was such a shock--an awesome shock--to see how much character they actually had when they appeared as NPCs in BL2).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4779769">Expand</a></span>

Borderlands The Pre-Sequel has ruined the franchise for me. It&apos;s a &quot;AAA&quot; game which feels and plays like an expansion of some sort.
<br>
<br>The whole space concept is just plain retarded and distasteful. The atmosphere and running along a giant red crater and then along the same looking crater except covered in ice really bored me within the first few hours. The whole oxygen thing is useless and a waste of design. Can&apos;t even use your vehicle to travel across the boring environment because the ramps they&apos;ve set out to clear giant death cracks in the surface don&apos;t propel you enough distance to clear the gap! So you then end up getting out on foot, double jumping with your crappy oxygen pack and wait 20seconds to land back on the surface of the crappy crater.
<br>
<br>Seriously, this game was a major disappointment. Borderland fans, look past this game and save your cash. Serious waste of time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4777420">Expand</a></span>

Some could argue that Borderlands 2 was just a better version of its prequel as well, but in this case, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel is NOT a better game than Borderlands 2 in my opinion. Also there are quite a few bugs at the point of launch but most likely these will get fixed soon enough. The asking price of $60 will likely to get you more bang for the buck compared to other titles but it falls short from Borderland&apos;s standard that has been set high by Borderlands 2. All in all, I&apos;d wait for a sale or price-drop unless you&apos;re dying to play something similar to Borderlands 2 even if it&apos;s not as good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4594137">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is an extremely difficult review to write, because I am very conflicted over this game. On the one side, it&apos;s a *fairly* solid FPS shooter with loot in abundance, some good humour and great co-op gaming. One that I am sure you will enjoy playing with a few friends. On the other hand, it feels like an expensive Borderlands 2 DLC and a blatant cash grab (they will be bringing out MORE DLC for this one too, if you are so inclined).
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>All the little annoyances and bugs from number 2 got carried over, without so much as a look at getting them fixed or changed. I have already experienced sound randomly disappearing for no reason, only to come back after I die (a bug that plagued the previous game as well). I have also had an NPC glitch on the tutorial mission, making it impossible to finish without exiting the game and coming back in.
<br>
<br>Then there is the horrendous amount of back tracking through the same old levels - surely they could just add more fast travel locations to the game? How about some form of teleport device - since we seem to be able to constantly cheat death and respawn nearby anyway? The menus are still horrendous to navigate - a remnant of it being a console port, no doubt. Boring fetch-this and go-there quests seem as abundant as ever too, I really wish there was a bit more depth to the multitude of side-quests.
<br>
<br>The new low gravity / O2 mechanic is really just a gimmick and does nothing to improve the game. All it seems to do is make for bunny-hopping gun-fights. The classes are also not that interesting. Claptrap is a completely useless character in single or co-op, Wilhelm is basically Axton from the previous game and the last two characters are nothing special either.
<br>
<br>Borderlands games have always advertised themselves as a fusion of FPS and RPG, but I was kind of hoping a little more of the RPG side of things would be brought into the games as time went on. This is sadly not the case. Customisation is limited to poor skill trees and throw-away skins that do nothing but change the basic colours of your character. The bad-&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; system is a neat idea, but never really seems to do much for you and I can&apos;t help but wonder if more could have also been done here as well.
<br>
<br>The humour and general feel of Borderlands 2 is here - so it is really just more of the same. This is its biggest problem. It brings nothing new to the table and looks and feels like you are playing Borderlands 2. Most of the points I have mentioned so far could be forgiven in BL2, but 2 years later, to bring out this &quot;expansion pack&quot; and try palming it off as a separate game without addressing any of its predecessors issues is just a bit much.
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>Moving on to the positives: it&apos;s more Borderlands, which surely cannot be a bad thing in itself. It&apos;s still a great co-op game that gets better with more people playing. The graphics look as good as ever and it has Handsome Jack before he was Handsome Jack - who was always one of my favourite characters in the last game. The story seems acceptable but nothing ground-breaking. It is nice to see previous characters making a come-back to fill in some gaps.
<br>
<br>The game is still great fun to play co-op, where a full-team of vault hunters is much more enjoyable than wondering around alone. The guns and loot is as crazy and fun as ever. There is also a new laser-class weapon, which is a welcome addition. &quot;Slag&quot; seems to have been replaced with &quot;Cryo&quot; weapons, which is a welcome addition, since Slag weapons became more and more essential as you levelled up in number 2 - and limited your options.
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>So, to summarise, it&apos;s an overpriced, underdeveloped slog through similar territory - a cash-grab by lazy developers. If you can see past this and enjoyed Borderlands 2 then that will be of no consequence and you can ignore most of the cons in this review. If you, like me, expected more, then you have come to the wrong place and should wait for Borderlands 3 instead. Still, this is Gearbox afterall - who gave us Duke Nukem Forever and Colonial Marines - I guess I shouldn&apos;t have expected too much from them. It&apos;s a fairly decent game that will keep diehard fans of the franchise happy, but you can&apos;t help but wonder what more could have been done.
<br>
<br>My Jimbo Rating on this game will differ based on two important factors, shown below.
<br>
<br>If you wanted more from the new Borderlands game than a lazy, copy-paste clone:
<br>Jimbo Rating: 5/10 - &quot;Not Recommended&quot;
<br>
<br>If you simply wanted more Borderlands 2 and are a diehard fan that has cash to throw at the lazy devs:
<br>Jimbo Rating: 7/10 - &quot;Recommended&quot;
<br>
<br>For me, this game falls in the first category, making it a 5/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4761832">Expand</a></span>

I loved Borderlands 2 (beat it on hard and got all DLC) but this mess is a huge disappointment -  which seems to be happening all too often in the Gaming World lately (Watchdogs, Destiny) and I&apos;m pissed.   I am still on same planet with that dingbat Aussie **** after leaving the space station with Jack.  (Sorry, but I kint stind Ozzie iccents!)  I don&apos;t mind zany characters but she is ridiculous and her quests are stupid and I hate her voice!  Additionally, the jumping mechanic is godawful.  Can&apos;t see half the time to butt-slam or you look up and don&apos;t go where you want to.   Have spent hours trying to reach quest items.  Have had to resort to You Tube videos already and other walk-throughs several times to figure out what to do because Aussie dingbat talks too fast and you can&apos;t understand her!!  Re: Nova quest.  And I&apos;ve been killed so many times I can&apos;t even count due to the bad jumping mechanic and running out of air!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Who&apos;s smart idea was that??  You can&apos;t enjoy what you&apos;re doing as you&apos;re always afraid you&apos;re going to run out of air.   I loved the voice of Axton and the funny things he said to his turret, and the other characters as well, but Wilhelm&apos;s voice is awful and he&apos;s not funny.  He looks like some English lord but sounds like his last name is Hodunk!  Very disappointing.  I&apos;m a female gamer and I like playing the cute guys so I having something to look at but Wilhelm definitely doesn&apos;t float my boat.  Also the female characters look dumb as well and with all the cool elemental weapons why would I want to play a character who can only shoot regular pistols (Nisha)????  Dumb idea!  And what&apos;s up with all the female characters anyway?  Is Aussie 2K run by women?  Are they kowtowing to Anita Sarkeesian?  Have not seen one gun machine yet but Marcus is still selling bullets using the same lines from B2.  How lazy.   No more Dr. Zed! (boo hoo).  Now we have some female Marcus with a Russian accent on the Health machines.  So far the guns I&apos;ve picked up are Meh!, the quests are boring, voice acting sucks, jumping mechanic is a major fail and I doubt I&apos;ll finish this game as I&apos;m stuck on another jumping quest!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  A minor gripe is the element barrels don&apos;t stand out like in B2 so you don&apos;t even know they are there!  They&apos;re silver just like some of the loot barrels!  The bad guys are even boring and don&apos;t say funny stuff like they used to.  All in all, you blew it 2K!  Major disappointment - Not a lot of thought went into this game, that&apos;s for sure.  Definitely NOT a game of the year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4606221">Expand</a></span>

All these polarized reviews are just yet another facet of the internet that shouldn&apos;t exist.  that being said, BL:tPS should not be rated either a 10 or a 0.  It is neither a OMG-amazing ground breaking new game nor a unplayable mess.  it is a glorified piece of BL2 DLC with slight changes to systems that already existed.  What makes this game really really sad is that some one could easily have modded the feel of it in a few days from the existing BL2 game.  Changing how gravity works, adding O2, re-skinning enemies and adding a few new weapons really doesn&apos;t do much to make the game fresh and it wouldn&apos;t take that much programming to augment the BL2 engine to get these things.   The story is rather dull, your typical Framed narrative style with a point of view that tries to play off of the personality of handsome jack.  Ironically, its more interesting to fight him than to be on his side because hes downright annoying for extended periods of time.  the new vault hunters are uninteresting, some mechanics as simple as a shield or an Aim bot and then ofc there&apos;s the novelty of playing as claptrap (or a character similar to) which wears off in a few secs.   If you enjoyed BL2 will you like this game?  Of course you will.  If you hated BL2 will this game make you change your mind, hell no.  If you kinda liked BL2 and didnt grind it to hell and back through the hardest difficulty then steer clear of this until it goes on sale.  Asking for 60 dollars for a game such as this is a new low for gearbox even considering their other titles, Aliens colonial marines and Duke Nukem forever.  Pirate it or wait for a steam sale when its 10 dollars, but for god sakes dont buy it now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4600820">Expand</a></span>

Weapons selection is pathetic  to say the least (I had a laser weapon that was shooting through people and doing no damage wtf?). They added this thing called grinder where you put in 3 weapons of the same type and color and they pop out another one of higher grade, well all I ever got was a **** weapon even when using lunar stones with no extras like corrosion, cryo, etc, its pathetic. They increased the difficulty as well so if you play solo you are f***** especially near the end of the game, I mean its ridiculous. They might of just said oh you want to play solo well F*** YOU, co-op only. As if the game wasn&apos;t bad enough it was made even worse by the poisonous influence of SJW&apos;s &amp; pseudo-feminist BS propaganda that ruin everything they touch (censoring curse words, making characters scream how they are gay in your face all the time for no reason, replacing midget with little, etc).

The loot drops feel more balanced, and the new mechanics such as low gravity work extremely well. My main worry was the oxygen, and how it drains just by being in zero atmosphere, however enemies often drop refills and there are many areas with atmosphere. The story is better than that of borderlands 2 in my opinion, especially the development of Jack. The playable character are each extremely well done and the upgrade trees add a lot of variety to cater for most play styles. My main issue is with the mission layouts: They stay very much like the previous games with objectives being very far apart at points, and there is a lot of backtracking! However, the enemy variety throughout levels makes each story and side mission varied as do the locals.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4612838">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>+ Graphics are beautiful and the game looks very panoramic, if a bit darker (that is, however, understandable since the majority of the game occurs on a moon rather than a planet)
<br>
<br>- One of the critics&apos; reviews on here claimed that BL: TPS is a reskin of BL2, and I am inclined to agree. So many of the missions are so similar, including a mission where the player has to acquire a vehicle in order to jump over a broken bridge.
<br>
<br>- The game is fancier than BL2 but it is not better.
<br>
<br>+ The enemy AI in this game is better than that of BL2.
<br>
<br>+ some new weapon modes make the game better.
<br>
<br>- I think the character classes are a bit lazy and lackluster.
<br>
<br>- - - And, ultimately this game doesn&apos;t have the substance, the heart that BL2 had. I didn&apos;t feel as awesome playing this game as I did playing BL2.
<br>
<br>If you are Borderlands fan, get the game but keep your expectations moderate. The material here feels more DLC than a feature release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4601193">Expand</a></span>

For the time being however the status-quo seems to be just fine for fans of the series. And that is okay. Again, more Borderlands isn&apos;t a bad thing. It just feels like a game I played almost five years ago with updated graphics and new loot.</span>

What has changed, what is new, what hasn&apos;t changed, what should have changed. So If you haven&apos;t played, hopefully this will help you decide:
<br>
<br>What&apos;s changed:
<br>
<br>Guns - A lot more guns. Lasers have been added which are a nice change. I like that they made Hyperion sniper rifles less difficult to control. The amount of loot to gain is absolutely insane. Thing is, for me, this point is bleh. I don&apos;t care about loot as much as I care about skill development, but if you&apos;re a loot junkie, this game delivers BIG time. And since that&apos;s one of the game&apos;s major draws, you should, most likely, be happy with this part. Caveat: A lot of the weapons are the same, snipers, pistols, shotguns etc. So you will be getting a lot of the same too.
<br>
<br>Skills Customization: Better in my opinion. In BL2 I played quite a bit as Zero before having to turn over to other characters because he was a lot more work and time than I had to put into the game. This time I went with Athena cause I like swords and she&apos;s a lot better than Zero, and from I&apos;ve experienced online, even Claptrap&apos;s power adds something to the game. Over all I think they did a solid job here. If skill customization was your thing, they made a definite improvement here.
<br>
<br>Gameplay: They added the space jump, which makes the game a little more dynamic, HOWEVER, because they didn&apos;t change how you interact with the environment, you may get frustrated with it. Depends on your game play. I do a lot of guerrilla style tactics, and your character still doesn&apos;t slide around obstacles easily, so it&apos;s EXTREMELY annoying when I&apos;m trying to outmaneuver my enemy and I get stuck by a slight change in elevation and have to jump (and keep in mind you have to moon jump now and butt slam if you want to hurry to the ground and keep from being a floating bullseye). They idn&apos;t change a single thing in missions. That can be okay or bad (definitely isn&apos;t good as some of the missions make you literal traverse the entire span of a convoluted map to get one thing only to have that thing not be the thing you need and so you have to traverse all that terrain again to finally get what you need) They DID change the speed of your down scope movement, and it&apos;s really, really slooooowwww. So if you play the game looking through your weapon sites like me, you&apos;ll find yourself heaving your controller up and down and all around to get it to move fast. Most frustrating thing I&apos;ve ever experienced in a game. Anyone know how to speed it up?
<br>
<br>Story: Like Pirates of the Caribean you shouldn&apos;t expect a deep logical storyline. You expect funny dialogue and interaction. Your characters do speak, but their dialogue is poorly done and add to the story in some instance and subtract in others. Each player will decide.
<br>
<br>Combat: For some reasons, it seems like the number of enemies and the rate at which they spawn makes coop almost a necessity if you don&apos;t want to feel like you&apos;re being punished for daring to be a Lone Wolf. Areas that you killed long ago will suddenly spas enemies while you&apos;re fighting a new wave and you&apos;ll get killed. So watch your back.
<br>
<br>Score. This game got the score I gave it because a lot of the fixes should have been no brainers, but they chose not to fix them and instead expected gamers to &quot;get over it.&quot; Good thing for them my score means JACK SQUAT!!! But at least I get to air my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4603290">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>-tons of backtracking and chores through bland boring environments
<br>-low gravity just makes movement feel even more sluggish than it already was, remove the sprint crap and make sprint the base movement speed.
<br>-forgettable characters
<br>-mostly boring enemies and encounters
<br>-loot is super dull
<br>-opening 454456446 lockers and boxes got boring by the end of fallout 3 , like 7 years have passed since then, it&apos;s more of a chore than ever.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not even the borderlands formula getting stale, it just isn&apos;t a very well made borderlands sequel, was this by the same developer?
<br>Except for the gunplay it feels like a B team made it (not that blands was ever anything more than a 7/10 game series)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4787505">Expand</a></span>

Most annyoyin are the time consuming Dialogues which can be skipped and are just toooooo stupid. On some of the missions you need to have mission equipment and therefore you need to hear out the whole crap otherwise you can do the mission to begin with. ..... In Short, everything which was Bad about Borderland 2 they put more into BPS. The whole story is short and does often not really make sense at all. Some Level and Map Design is outright Stupid. Basically i should rate the game a 4-5 but i love the whole story a lot and comparing it with real trash games which get better rating then a 4-5 it would be unfair cause its still fun to play but full price game for a 24h playthrough is really a bit a ripp off style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617482">Expand</a></span>

People complain about how its so similar to borderlands 2. To be honest is that such a bad thing?This game should not be bashed for knowing its own identity. So yes borderlands the presequel plays like its game of the year predecessor with a few extra things. You get two types of vehicles with different loadouts. Gun battles have  been taken from the ground to in the air in zero gravity where you can slam down on opponent&apos;s.(simultaneously shoot them in the face if you please) The presequel also boasts the best cast of vault hunters the franchise has ever had. Each character represents a different angle to the story. The fact that each character reacts slightly differently to dialogue brings a tonal change to the story. Athena is clearly the main character because to story is told through her, so theres a little more narrative when playing as athena. Claptrap brings a certain darkness and sadness to the story especially at the end of &quot;claptraps claptastic voyage&quot; Wilhelm and Nisha are made out to be clear bad guys seeming to agree with what ever jack decides to do. There is a great origins story that was told in this game accept it was broken  into pieces for DLC purposes. Claptastic voyage  is the true ending to the game and should have been included in full version. Being a borderlands title i expected more DLC with the season pass. More origin stories could have been told through DLC Like how Wilhelm became the badass we fight in borderlands 2. How does jack get nisha her own town, and last but not least what happens to Athena after all this. These topics are things as a fan would pay to see. Borderlands to presequel is a good installment in the series but it does not push things forward. It attempts to add more depth to the characters but its cut short. This game has alot of replay value like the other borderlands but doesnt live up to the legend of borderlands 2. As a fan i expected more DLC granted &quot;claptastic voyage&quot; was great ,it left me wanting more. This game is about two DLC packs short of being a perfect 10. I want to see the aftermath stories of each character, especially the origins of wilhelm and how he became a robot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=5632936">Expand</a></span>

He&#x2019;s also jumping around the place so he&#x2019;s impossible to even aim at.  Not to mention he has an endless spawn of adds that keep hammering away at you too.   There is no healing either.

I&apos;ve beaten the game and I was severely disappointed with how this title turned out. I&apos;ll start with the pros:

<br>
<br>New guns and combat mechanics are a great addition from lasers to double jump/air gliding and butt stomping, all welcome additions.
<br>
<br>And that&apos;s where the praise for this game ends because everything else it brings to the table is absolute trash. The writing is overwhelmingly poor. It&apos;s not the same Borderlands humor anymore, 2K Australia replaced that with their own horrible inoffensive Australian humor and that leaves for a very dull experience. The new characters they introduce you&apos;ll notice are all Australian and normally I wouldn&apos;t mind but the dialogue they&apos;ve written into the game is just so piss-poor that I don&apos;t see anyone who cares for the quality of games or jokes for that matter to be able to enjoy this title.
<br>
<br>Even the original characters that they brought back have nothing memorable or worthwhile to contribute and are simply just there as a selling point. I was a huge fan of Borderlands 1 and 2 and all they&apos;ve done in the Pre-Sequel is reuse references from the old games, not even cleverly written in mind you, and offer absolutely nothing new to the table. Tiny Tina comes back in for one line and just mentions Bunkers and Badasses. That was it for her. This may look like a Borderlands game and the combat and gameplay are still fantastic but the heart and substance that made everyone love the franchise to begin with just are not there.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s for these reasons I have to give this game a 5/10 truthfully. If you are a Borderlands fan, do not expect so much from this title going in as I did because it was just inoffensively unfunny. If you just want to play around in a new coop game with friends and don&apos;t care about the story, writing, voice acting, or quality of jokes or plot in general, then go right ahead and play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/user-reviews?user_review_id=4600679">Expand</a></span>
