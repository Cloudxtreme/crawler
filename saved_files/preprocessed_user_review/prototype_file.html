In fact this game&apos;s city is probably it&apos;s worst feature. They reduced the detail on nearly everything so that widespread destruction could take place without nosediving the framerate, the problem with this approach is that you get what is barely a step up from an old flight simulator so that you can throw a lot of npc&apos;s and cars on screen at once. Also the pc version was a quick-port. So it has a lot of problems. Get past these and the core game is very fun, the method of storytelling is hit-and-miss, however most of what is there is interesting. The problem is that these smaller stories don&apos;t come together to create a compelling &apos;whole&apos; all that well. The thing that stands out the most in this entire package is the unlockable powers. There is a absolutely huge amount of them, far higher than any other game can claim. And while this might be overkill, I am fine with that. I think prototype 2 needs to raise the detail levels a bit, change the method of storytelling - or at least tweak it, and make the core city more interesting. As for the powers, they already have a knack for that. So I am comfortable with what they do so long as it&apos;s not reducing them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=2157246">Expand</a></span>

But there&apos;s so much more that could have been done in regards to story line. You have a whole free roam city similar to say Grand Theft Auto 4, yet so many people wandering around minding their own business while the military and zombies etc. are running riot. Makes no sense! Hundreds of taxis all parked up in the middle of infected zones, half of them with inanimate people at the wheel. Still, makes no sense! You can pick up cars, and still the people in those cars don&apos;t seem to care. The playability isn&apos;t too great. I enjoyed the game the first time though, was given the ability to start a new game with all my powers, but just couldn&apos;t find a reason to start the game again. Brilliant graphics, brilliant concept, but I think GTA 4 has already set a bench mark for free roam cities. Unless this can be matched, or topped, along with the concept of Prototype, I&apos;m simply not satisfied.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=83852">Expand</a></span>

If you are a person that values gameplay way more than graphics, this might be the game for you. Not visually stellar with very dated graphics that the game has, but some really cool combat and abilities.
<br>
<br>Though as much as I did enjoy the hack and slash that this game offered, I did find myself frustrated at times with some difficulty spikes, especially towards the end of the game. The game is challenging in its own way and I did enjoy some challenges. I was however often frustrated by some rigidities of the combat the game had, not flowing as much as I would have liked it to.
<br>
<br>I did enjoy some parts of the game. Especially scaling up walls and gliding through the city like a bat, and I do recommend unlocking it as one of your first few upgrades with your EP. I also enjoyed the cool moves like devastator and also slicing away people with your blade or claws. One really cool feature I liked was also hijacking helicopters and the relative ease of piloting the helicopter was really good as well.
<br>
<br>The game did have some enjoyable minigames but not those that you might want to play it over and over again, probably a one-off thing or just trying to achieve a gold status on it. As for the city, it is very dull and there is completely nothing much you can do about it, but you wouldn&apos;t really care since you&apos;re gliding through the skies most of your time. Exploration is not really of great value here except collecting Blue and Purple balls that give you EP and hints(for the purple ones). The game did not have a really good story line and most of you would start of quite confused at the beginning of the game. Gameplay is somewhat linear and repetitive, though there are levels that require you to use tanks or helicopters to complete them. It felt boring going through some missions with really short cut-scenes in between that don&apos;t string that well together.
<br>
<br>The game might not rate highly in me but maybe you might find it otherwise. As much as I tried to not take this game seriously at all, I often found myself just getting through the game rather than enjoying it and that is not how a game should be played. Maybe you may enjoy this game better than I did though I personally would not recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=2911135">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are just detailed enough so it looks good but doesn&apos;t destroy frame rate on a 8800gt. I get 45+ fps with like 60+ characters on the screen and the entire city of of NY. with choppers flying around and explosions going off.</span>

Ever play one of those games made to go along with a popular movie?  I couldn&apos;t help but think Spiderman, as the game engine seems identical with mild graphic updates.  Yeah you got super transforma-ninja powers but cool fighting moves don&apos;t equal a great game.  The story is blurry at best, controlling with a keyboard and mouse is annoying, and the gameplay itself just feels like a killfest.  If you absolutely love mindless, zombie-killing games then get this...AFTER it goes down in price in a few months.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=82904">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is great as well, with your main guy able to leap across buildings and transform into a bunch of different forms and use disguises. Controls will take some time to get use to when climbing buildings etc. And the target locking can get annoying at times. Graphics are solid, but it does need a bit more color. The city is infested and everything but some times it looks like a ps2 game, needs more rich colors. Sound is great, with explosions and voice acting. Know that the game has a save feature but no autosave or checkpoint to go back to AFTER you quit the game. It&apos;ll only return to the point where you saved, so if the game crash or freeze for w/e reason then you will have to do the entire missions over... So Overall, Great game but a few things keeping it from a great experience. Its like a mirror&apos;s edge meets prince of persia meets gta sandbox style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=2971069">Expand</a></span>

Game was over in 3 hours. Finished it the night I brought it home. The devs made up for the short story by flooding the game with Mercenaries styled minigames. You can pretty much get all the worthwhile superpowers within an hour of casually playing. I consumed the identity of middleaged woman and nobody cared I was running up the side of the chrysler building. I picked up a truck and the dude inside it was totally cool with it. These &quot;Territory wars&quot; the military and infected have only happen when your involved in it and the gameplay during that is rinse and repeat to the extreme. --- I hate havin&apos; to nail on this game, Ive been following it since I heard about when it was first being developed. I was real giddy about getting it the first day it came out. It was insanely FUN for about 2 hours, and then it ended an hour later. Great concept, just didnt pull it off. Hope they try it again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=84447">Expand</a></span>

The people who made this game do not know how to tell a story properly. Never mind what kind of story. They just don&apos;t know how to tell one properly period. I felt like I was watching a direct to video sci-fi B-movie, and even that statement is giving it credit it does not nearly deserve. Bad voice acting, a game engine that looks like it came out ages ago, and a character that is impossible to identify with (unless your a mass-murdering sociath who&apos;d enjoy mowing down truckloads of civilians on your questionable path of revenge. Seriously the main character is a bloody ignorant jerk, why am I going to invest in someone as repulsive as this lowlife?! It was horrible. I made it through about four or five levels before it became clear to me that not even the gameplay could redeem this ... this indescribable turd. It was amusing using some of the powers, however that sweet taste quickly turned to a used kitty-litter box in my mouth as I realized I was facing the same. old. enemies. over. and. over. again. Using. the. same. combos. over. and. over. again. There are so many usless upgrades, you&apos;ll settle into using the handful of useful ones and--BAM! Boooring. They didn&apos;t introduce new enemies with variable attacks, they just threw more and ore of the same units at you. and the city ... I can&apos;t believe this company is using that as a marketable feature! It is so bland and repetitive and lifeless. Good lord, what happaned to having some standards people? I think most people would enjoy just about anything nowadays. There&apos;s no way in Biggest dissapointment of my year in gaming. I am flabbergasted at the score this game has gotten, but I guess the critics have not had enough decent games this year and their perspectives have become skewed or something. I can&apos;t explain it. For a big-budget, hotly anticipated release, this game gets: Ugliest Game Engine of 2009. Worst Voice Acting of 2009. Biggest Jerk-Wad Player Character of 2009. Most Inept Storytelling Mechanics of 2009.

In theory, communism could be the fantastical wonder ideology that would eradicate all poverty instead of raise a lot of privacy issues. Because of people assuming things worked in theory, Religion is selling like hotcakes, Communist governments are still banging their heads against walls to forget all the horrible things going on in their country, and people still think GTA 4 and Prototype are actually good.<br>You play a forgettable and unlikeable character in one of the laziest plots ever put in the physical realm.<br>Maybe if the story was a cave drawing, people would have i&apos;d have some respect for it, but it&apos;s not, so i really don&apos;t. It&apos;s probably personal taste, since there are, at the time of writing, 235 good reviews. In theory, i would really like to play this type of game but in reality, i hate everything about it. The first thing i see is that the publisher is &quot;Activision&quot; otherwise known as evil in video game publisher form, and the developer is &quot;Radical Entertainment&quot;, who developed smash hits such as &quot;The Simpsons: Hit and Run&quot;, &quot;Hulk&quot; and a plethora, In all senses of the word,  of SNES games that are still being played to this day. Like &quot;BeBe&apos;s Kids&quot;! OK, every piece of code they write are doomed of sucking but, hey, they did completely rip off &quot;The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction&quot; and &quot;Spiderman: Web Of Shadows&quot; by just repackaging it and making it uglier! Plus, they added WEAPONS that ejaculate bullets at BLAZING FAST SPEEDS, so it&apos;ll probably be good, in theory. Of course, having talent makes the discipline of &quot;Completely Ripping Something The F#ck Off&quot; makes it better, a la Disney. So let&apos;s start!<br><br>Did i mention the game was ugly? Well, fully comprehend the emotion you get from reading that word and then multiply it by how many times the word **** is used in all &quot;Realistic&quot; and &quot;Gritty&quot; games. You get 37 billion joules of emotion.<br>Seriously, look at a video or ANYTHING  see how his game looks. But, in this accepting age, we don&apos;t care about graphics. But, graphics dictate the atmosphere of a game, so if you&apos;re game makes Deus Ex look like Crysis, GTA 4, and a PS3 processor, then the graphics department REALLY screwed you. Max Payne 2 looks better than this.<br>And i should know, i actually played it a few seconds after i was finished with that &quot;game&quot;. Maybe they did this on purpose to show you helplessness and ignorance the protagonist faces. Then i realize Activision published it, and the people who made &quot;Mario&apos;s Time Machine&quot; developed it.<br><br>The Soundtrack really sucks. REALLY.<br><br>GAMEPLAY!<br>In theory, the gameplay would be enough for the game occupying 300 GBs of space and costing several billion dollars. IN THEORY. In reality, the gameplay is as boring and unbalanced as the Stock Market. You&apos;re given all this POWER and yet this POWER doesn&apos;t make this anus of a GAME any FUNNER. (You won&apos;t get this reference unless you&apos;re black or you pay a very strange amount of attention to Kanye West songs) You&apos;re just thinking &quot;This is so cool&quot; instead of &quot;This is so fun.&quot; It would be cool if you can run up a tower, jump off, and land on Military Tank. It would, In theory. Play the game and focus on how much fun you&apos;re having instead of wondering how cool it would be, in theory.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=1361928">Expand</a></span>

I defendly hope for a Prototype 2. Where Alex mercer can change his hand in a shooting weapon. And maybe some more options with the weaponst he has now. Like the whip he can us it to pull enamies to him and use spidey webslinging.</span>

The gameplay is stunning. And the game does not have a 100% designed story that you have to follow every single bit by bit, unlike 90% of games out there. Get this game if you can afford it. It WILL BE worth it.</span>

It&apos;s the same game basically, just more violent melee combat and no web swinging. Definitly not for kids though. Lots of cursing and bloody murder of innocents. Spiderman was more fun I think.</span>

It&apos;s a good thing Sierra died before attaching its name to this mediocrity of a game.

Once again another game that riped the famous G.T.A. free exploration. I have a computer that can&apos;t get anymore faster for games, it has all the newest cards etc. and this game is impossible to play even with settings as low as possible. The sound quality is horrorfying, it doesn&apos;t come out in clear words for example; &quot;Mmmm-m-MY- MY MY n-n-nnnn-n-n-naaaaaaa-ame is Al-A-is -ALEX&quot; UGH!! And it&apos;s like that for the whole game. The blood is terrible looking because it&apos;s the same as in Dead Space. FILLED WITH BUGS!! I can&apos;t even begin to describe how many bugs there are! Camera angle is worst I&apos;ve seen because you are prevented from seeing any danger until it finds you. Characters all look like they have Downs, the list goes on and on. Graphics are all that developers care about today. I don&apos;t care if a game used graphics from &apos;99 as long as everything else is good, like GUN. I wouldn&apos;t advise anybody to purchase this with a $49.99 price tag and I still won&apos;t in a year after it is lowered to $19.99 or $29.99. The two is only for the idea and one cool weapon.

Test drive a pirate copy before sinking your teeth into the biased ratings it received. Most of the 10&apos;s and 9&apos;s are sadly from guys working for this game company.</span>

<br>Surprisingly the story is pretty good as well, Mercer HAS A PERSONALITY on his own although he is not a guy you&apos;d like to be friends with Lol, and there is a decent plot twist as well.
<br>The graphics were dated when this game was released now they are pretty crappy but that does not take from awesomeness of the game and it can run on low-end computers.
<br>Flaws? Well the graphic for once, dumb side-missions, repetetive NPC models making you feel like in clone wars. Nothing major.

I was expecting more of a roaming aspect like GTA but most of the side quests are boring or just not worth the time (I did maybe 20% of them and still maxed almost all my skills by the end of the game). There&apos;s three sets of collectables in the city: landmarks (200 blue orbs that give exp), hints (50 loading screen &quot;protips&quot; which are really pointless), and web of intrigue targets. WoI targets are the most interesting because they add more depth to the story but they are hit or miss. Sometimes you get insight into past story events, sometimes you get militant chest beating. The graphics are pretty bland and boring in a city full of grey but I guess there&apos;s only so much you can do with Manhattan. Overall this game is solidly average but a definite console port. If you can get it cheaper on a console go for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822729">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Controls are okay to run around aimlessly. However once you have to actually do something (e.g. fight or navigate enclosed spaces) it all comes crashing down. Combat is horribly clunky and uncontrollable. You&apos;ll constantly get stuck in corners, jump into the wrong direction, fail to pick up a weapon even after half a dozen tries or curse at the camera because it blocks your view.
<br>
<br>Combat requires you to do complicated combos and perfectly timed attacks. However the game tries too hard to predict what you want to do, and it gets it wrong more often than not. The control scheme is an exercise in frustration and just doesn&apos;t work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=2745739">Expand</a></span>

I should go buy it off of steam right now I recommend it very much has an awesome story and I prefer this one over prototype 2 because the story is better on this one and it is the original. I was actually excited for prototype 2, but I didn&apos;t really like it as much as the original.</span>

Many people say that they are having issues with the game but it works perfectly for me. Except maybe that the sound is a little quiet and i have to turn it up, but great game overall</span>

It&apos;s geared towards alerting everyone around yout that you exist and the demolishing everything in sight. So far it&apos;s not the most beautiful game I&apos;ve seen lately, but definitely one of the most fun.</span>

It&apos;s sketchy, and slow. The minigame-missions are very hard, but also very fun. You&apos;ll never believe they actually thought of something this awesome when you feel yourself exploding tanks with your fists or flying off skyscrapers, or defying gravity and landing on the ground safely. The military NPC&apos;s are dumb, but there&apos;s enough of them to keep the difficulty up, where as half of the zombie &quot;Infected&quot; NPC&apos;s take well over 40 slashes from your claws to take down. It is about ten times easier to take a tank down than a zombie, which IMO is kinda gay. Overall, it&apos;s great. I found it for 39.99 and am very glad I bought it despite the fact I&apos;m saving for Aion and Modern Warfare 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=83461">Expand</a></span>

Before you review a game perhaps you need to check your system, and make sure it&apos;s up to date (if you really do have the rig you say you have, which I don&apos;t think you do or you&apos;d not be complaining about how this runs). Other then that small rant, the game is f&apos;ing awesome. Graphics are good, but not really today&apos;s standards, so despite what SOME say, it&apos;s not all about the graphics with this game. The game runs smooth on midrange to high range systems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=425182">Expand</a></span>

Too many reviewers played this right after getting used to the inFamous controls  and didn&apos;t give it a fair chance.  And since when is a &quot;B-&quot; grade translated to a &quot;67&quot; numerical score.  That&apos;s what Metacritic did with 1Up&apos;s review and the reviewer, Garnett Lee, was complaining about it on his podcast himself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=82176">Expand</a></span>

Think assassins creed meets bad marvel games like spiderman and hulk, without the BAD part. I&apos;ll admit though that the sound is a little messed up, its quite low in some parts, but nothing is missed. And to Jared J., your review doesn&apos;t make any sense. The graphics aren&apos;t that great so your topic sentence doesn&apos;t really make the rest of your paragraph arguable. If anything I wish they had worked on the graphics a bit more. However if you&apos;re computer can&apos;t run this then you do not have a &quot;good&quot; computer by any means. I&apos;m running this game at max settings with no framerate drops.

                                        <span> That game is awesome. It has much action scenes and u can go wherever u want in manhattan. Like in gta. U have superhuman powers and u can disguise as military or civilian. It means u can play it as a shooter game. the movement is great, too, parkour, like in &quot;Assassin&apos;s Creed&quot; is it called. This game is for everyone who like plenty of action, fenomenal graphics and a bit of Sci-Fi. Baal.</span>

The way of movement is nice - in my opinnion Spiderman was harder to handel than Prototype. The graphic isn&apos;t that good and I think the programmers tried to make it look good but they still had an eye on compability for weaker systems. What they&apos;ve done is telling a nice story - k everyone will say &quot;Oh it isn&apos;t that great as the story of GTA&quot; - Prototype doesn&apos;t want to be like GTA - there were other games like GTA 3 even before GTA 3 was released and noone said oh look its&apos;s GTA 3 - how boring it&apos;s like &quot;....&quot; Prototype is a good game and I&apos;m glad to own this it. It&apos;s just funny to run through Manhatten and fight Zombies or destroy Hives, military bases or steal Helicopters(while they&apos;re flying^^)....so for me Prototype is one of my favorite games and better than GTA 4 which was a big smoking piece of shit with huge hardware requestions and without any long-term motivation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=425288">Expand</a></span>

My first impression was that the graphics were sub-par, but you actually get used to them and basically forget about them. The city is huge and the concept of the infected zones and military zones is brilliant. You won&apos;t get bored of this game for a long, long, time. Far more fun than inFAMOUS if you ask me. A must buy for 2009.</span>

Firstly, the game is one for gameplay and mechanics. This is where it&apos;s strengths lie. The crowd/civilians, the cutscenes, the amazing Mise-En-Scene and a decent (if disjointed/confusing) storyline serve as great strengths. The dept of combat was also a highlight. All of these aspects, the mechanical, programming side, was fantastic. The let-down for me was on two major fronts: graphics and polish. On the polish side, there were some major bugs that I ran into, locking up a number of times in game, invulnerabile bosses, ect. Some of the models were a bit buggy, and some of the models/animations weren&apos;t lined up perfectly. Small things, but they really do irk you after a while. The side-missions could have used some variety as well, if only to help replayability. Graphically is where this game is weak. Despite the great gameplay, the graphics let it down on its longevity and its effect on the player. Whether it be from messy textures, messy models, or repetitive modeling, as well as ugly physics, it just detracts from the gameplays look and realism. I wonder if it was an intentional aspect to create a more cartoony effect, but I don&apos;t think so. To me, it felt like Mercenaries 2 because of the graphics. All in all its a good game, one that should be tried. What it lacks graphically will be made up for in the gameplay aspects.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=82828">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t know what kind of computer he has but something is terribly wrong with it. The game plays flawlessly for me on all the highest settings. I don&apos;t even have the latest hardware either. Now on to the actual review. I love this game. Although not the greatest game ever it is fun to play. The controls are a little difficult at times but they can be changed. The graphics are not the greatest but it doesn&apos;t matter much. I&apos;d rather have a game that looks decent and runs flawlessly then look spectacular but can barely play. The script is horrendous. They could have gotten better writers. I&apos;m not sure what it is but the acting feels awkward either because of the script or the actors. In spite of the poor writing the gameplay completely makes up for it. Running up buildings then jumping off of them and gliding around the city is stunning. It was difficult to get the hang of it at first with the weird controls but once you get the hang of it it&apos;s a blast. I&apos;d definitely recommend it to anyeone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=425139">Expand</a></span>

Honestly, one of THE BEST games to come out this decade, why some of these &quot;professional&quot; reviewers rated it so low is beyond me, obviously they&apos;re up on their GTA high horse One stated that &quot;the world is far from engaging&quot; well neither is GTA&apos;s where one minute you&apos;re running over pedestrians in a park, being chastd by the Police, the next you out run them and no one asks questions about the beat up car with bullet holes. At least in Prototype if you so much as shapeshift in plain sight, they&apos;re on you with everything they got from the word go&quot;, This is a wise investment in both time and money, you will not be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=425145">Expand</a></span>

A revenge story and a supernatural thriller, this game has so many elements many games only dream of executing perfectly. I found myself gasping and staring at the screen, mouth agape more times than i did with Gears of War, GTA4 or Crackdown. The only qualm i have with the game is the level of detail. On the queue above the door of a building, the lights stream simply COMING UP NEXT: WEATHER. Stuff like that should have more in depth detail. Also, the people wander like mindless zombies, making the city not only NOT feel alive, but simply a mechanized playground on which you have your gruesome fun. Furthermore, why are there so many people wandering around when a known madman is running around murdering everyone? And given the military presence, why don&apos;t i see protesters or something? Aside from that, I feel incredible playing this game. The challenge exists despite your immense power, and it is too much fun to do the little challenges and find all of the point markers for hints and pieces of the story. Not only will you have a good time with this game, but you&apos;ll realize that GTA4 can&apos;t match up to the level of fun and quality this game does. A purchase well warranted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=425043">Expand</a></span>

Be warned! it does have a lot of gore so its not something to be played near children ages 1-12 since they may cause nightmares.</span>

Dead Space blood was fucking amazing (maybe his shitty comp. would not let his see it properly). 3. the sound compliant is probably due to his shitty on board sound and not a stand alone sound card.</span>

                                        <span> This game was incredible there was almost too much action that sometimes i needed a break. the game was very addicting and also had a well driven story line but the cut scenes were not the greatest same with the graphics. you should not have a problem running it if you have a standered computer. I do think that its worth the money if you like total destruction or just really fast paced action.</span>

There is an immense variety of weapons and attacks and each one is more than the other. The most fun part for me at least has to be the movement, you can spend hours just jumping and gliding from building to building without getting bored. Sure the stealth mechanic feels tacked on but it doesn&apos;t hinder your enjoyment in any way. The graphics aren&apos;t spectacular but you won&apos;t notice it most of the time because of this game&apos;s speed and mayhem. Performance wise this game is PC friendly I&apos;m able to run it at maximum graphics without a hitch on my modest laptop (4gigs of ram 9600 geforce and 2.2 core 2 duo) so you shouldn&apos;t have any problems running this if your PC isn&apos;t more than 2 years old. The story could have been a bit more fleshed out, but it&apos;s enough to keep you interested given how fun this game is. My main gripe is that the main missions feel too short and loose, but there are plenty of side missions. So all in all this is the most fun game to come out in years and it is definitely worth the price tag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=425220">Expand</a></span>

This said though, the game does sacrifice visuals for gameplay and pulls the gameplay off very well. I have heard many complaints about visuals affecting gameplay. For me this is just not true in prototype. One of the comments is the draw distance, the draw distance i thought was brilliant considering everything else that is going on in the game, and it does not affect the game for me because i have never been one for collecting missions. I think they are a waste of time that could be spent giving more to the game itself. Overall Prototype is a great game and is definatley worth a look, also it is a game to be played with a controller rather than a mouse and keyboard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=425209">Expand</a></span>

The powers are awesome fun to use, theres a million different ways to kill anything, hijacking helicopters right out of the sky is a blast, the list goes on. My only problem with it, is that I prefer the clean pristine city to jump around in, and lets just say it dosn&apos;t stay that way for long.</span>

Let me start out by saying i&apos;m a hardcore gamer and it&apos;s a long time since i played 9 hours in just 1 day of a single game. Graphics: 9/10 Very pretty game indeed also quite smooth, the only time my frames dropped was when i got in a heli second time, but this is just a bug i think. Sound: 8/10 not amazing sound but still solid and quite good, dialouge is usually very good except a few comments from Alex (the main character) Story: 10/10 Stunning story, it is VERY good in my oppinion if you are into this sort anyway. A solid interesting and complex story, with some things which is ACTUALLY unexpected, rare indeed for games thease days. Gameplay: 10/10 GTA.. meh been done... shooter? with targeting system even.. meh. Run 70 mph sideways on building then jumbing on to a helicopter hijacking it and using it to blast through hundreds of zombies and Marines ? Pretty damn awesome. Presentation: 9/10 A good interface which is not confusing at all, the way the story is told is great, and i mean really great. It&apos;s hard to explain though without revealing plot. Controls are sort of stiff though. That gotta be the only real downside of the game. It&apos;s a tad confusing on the PC to begin with but once you get used to it it&apos;s really not a problem at all. AI: 7/10 The AI is easyly tricked and don&apos;t appear to be doing alot when not fighting, however fighting wise they can pose a real challenge. Conclusion: 9/10 This game is a must have if you conspiracies, hordes of zombies, marines, superpowers or just any free roam game. If the controls had been better and perhaps been First person like Mirrors Edge this would probably have been one of the best games of the decade. Quite a few small flaws but no serious ones and you barely notice them once you get into the amazing story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=425244">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is everything, tired of doing the story mission? lots of side missions to do or just wreak havok in an infected new york city. Oh lets not forget shape shifting!! this game really has everything you&apos;d want in a Superhero game. Though id like to mention that if you buy the pc version (wich kicks ass btw) there&apos;s a couple of annoying bugs that can be quickly fixed by going to the game&apos;s official forum.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=425283">Expand</a></span>

It puts FUN at the top of its list and makes no concessions. It never forgets that its primary focus is to entertain and as such it never penalizes the player or arbitrarily restricts you. It gives you the abilities to create believable chaos in the world&apos;s most recognizable city from the get-go and only rewards you with greater control, destruction, and finesse as the game goes on. Nor does it sacrifice subtleties. The small touches in terms of animation, ambient sound and art design generate a believable atmosphere of a slowly decaying metropolis. Disregard statements of poor controls or performance problems- I have a mid level PC and play with keyboard and mouse and the game is a dream to play on high settings. These comments are not written naively I have been playing games of all genres consistently for the past 20 years and own all three current gen systems as well as a self-built pc, and I can honestly say that this game is one of the most fun titles I have ever played. Buy it, play it, you won&apos;t be disappointed. One of my favorite all time games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=425341">Expand</a></span>

While screwing around in Free Roam is the only fun part of the game, It&apos;s story line is impossible to follow, and Alex Mercer is possibly the most cheesiest character I&apos;ve seen in-game ever. If you plan on just screwing around and not to follow the story, I advise you do just that because the games story is pretty poor.</span>

Too bad that this fun wont last long when the helicopter strike-tream comes, because your character feels VERY underpowered (even after you get all your powers) when fighting multiple helicopters and tough enemies at once. Crappy targeting system makes such encounters to a very annoying expirience and in most cases you&apos;ll have to flee to survive :/. Yep, the difficulty curve in this game is one ridiculous roller coaster... While i really love all the cool and fun powers of the main character, there is not much praiseworthy in this game except those. I suggest to wait for a price drop before getting this. 6.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=425379">Expand</a></span>

The best fun is when a strike team is called down on you - it takes skill and determination to take them apart in the latter stages of the game. DONT PLAY IT ON A CONSOLE. It will ruin it for you. The long (10+) combos are impossible to get period and the control is a lot less dexterous. A keyboard and mouse allow much more diversity and make the game leaps and bounds more fun (the PC porting is done extremely well so it doesn&apos;t feel a bit like a port). Oh, the Physics is a LOT better on the PC - on a PS3 it&apos;s horrible making some battles next to impossible. Far and away the most fun and immersive game of the year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prototype/user-reviews?user_review_id=425682">Expand</a></span>

The game play alone is &quot;interactive&quot; enough without the spine chilling twists thrown at you by the designers. 9/10 with the possibility to become a 10/10 with some minor tweaks.</span>
