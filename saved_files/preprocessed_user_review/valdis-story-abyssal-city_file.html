It&apos;s a bit rough around the edges, but it will satisfy.
<br>The combat in this game is a blast. It is very fluid. At first, it felt pretty awkward. After I got a little bit of practice with the different abilities, I was hooked. The combat and the boss fights hit that balance between challenging and fun. If combat was the only aspect of this game, it would be an easy 10/10.
<br>Unfortunately, combat is not the only aspect of this game. It is chock-full of platforming sequences that are simply not fun. A lot of them have timers that are horridly strict and punish you for even a slight mis-step. The controls are also just not built for platforming. Lastly, the enemies themselves also frustrate matters since one hit in the air causes you to recoil until you hit the ground...sometimes setting you back 2-5 minutes only to have it happen again and again.
<br>I know that this game is not meant to hold your hand, but I&apos;m guessing that it is meant to be fun. The platforming sequences are just not fun. They are tedious.
<br>The music is awesome. The combat is awesome. The controls are kind of spotty but good most of the time (and not built for platforming). The platforming sequences are not awesome, and hold this game back something fierce. The highest I can give this game is a 6/10, and I count myself as a metroidvania fan.
<br>A bit of advice: Get a controller for this game and you will enjoy it much more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=3779990">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The music is fine. Nothing about it ever sounds too repetitive or boring, and I&apos;m always super-critical of music in vidya, so this is really a compliment. It&apos;s not Nobuo Uematsu but there is nothing about it that makes me want to silence the game. Sound effects are nice too, albeit again are a bit cartoony and don&apos;t necessarily fit the &quot;Abyssal City&quot; side the game tries to push in.
<br>
<br>Story is delivered in a let&apos;s say somewhat successful way. You&apos;re not showered with over the top characters or ridiculous lines. It&apos;s gritty as it should be, Wyatt(who I&apos;m playing with) does have a few witty lines and I didn&apos;t have a single character that made me roll my eyes or laugh at him.
<br>
<br>With that said, that&apos;s pretty much all the story has been able to do thus far. Considering that I&apos;m several hours in, it&apos;s quite disappointing and it reminds me of modern Final Fantasy type of stories where the mystery is kept for over 30 hours before being uncovered, only to reveal itself to be a predictable and absolutely uninteresting secret. I can&apos;t say that I&apos;m sure of this since I didn&apos;t finish the game, but if it ends up being that the Abyssal City has some sort of magical stone or super-machine that can end the war between Angels and Demons, I will not be one bit surprised and the whole &quot;let&apos;s ellipse our way through the game&quot; storytelling is really going to come off as lame.
<br>
<br>In a simple line, it does atmosphere quite decently IMO, but it stops at that. Storytelling seems to be nothing fantastic, even a bit meh sometimes, and nothing has piqued my interest yet.
<br>
<br>Characters are also usually defined with a few lines like FF NPCs, and that just sucks. I can barely remember Wyatt&apos;s personality, the fact that the rest of the people around usually don&apos;t really bring much more really make you feel like you&apos;re going through a land of pixels with cardboard cutouts in it.
<br>
<br>Best and worst part of this game is probably the gameplay.
<br>
<br>As several people have said, the combat is fast, energetic and erratic as hell, reflex-heavy and made in full 80s spirit: you will have to die, and die, and die, before learning the bosses&apos; patterns and how to beat them. It&apos;s very fun and the RPG system&apos;s complexity and freedom of use allows for a ton of personalisation and upgrading. Every enemy and boss has a pattern to learn and beat, whose complexity gives the game&apos;s fighting system its really huge potential. I won&apos;t lie, it&apos;s terribly frustrating and infuriating sometimes. The worst during your first playthrough is that you are &quot;paid&quot; with experience depending on how well you&apos;ve beaten the boss. Meaning that you will go through 1 full hour of pattern-learning before beating a boss that takes 5 minutes, only to be given a measly 20XP that any grunt can give you!
<br>
<br>That system does encourage excellence but it&apos;s a terrible pain for newcomers.
<br>
<br>The other and worst part of the gameplay is the platforming, as everyone&apos;s said already.
<br>The controls are way too imprecise to do decent platforming. Jumping on the keyboard is binded to up, which is just plain stupid, but can be changed. Sometimes you will have to do extremely tight jumps on small platforms with controls that are obviously not meant for it.
<br>
<br>Walljumping is too automatic, sometimes you&apos;ll go left, jumping from ledge to higher ledge on your left, and for some reason Wyatt will jump right and fall all the way down. This happens a lot and the opposite does too, you&apos;ll climb up ledges when you want to walljump because your inputs aren&apos;t mint precise. In a fast-paced game as this, having to slowly input everything under fear of hyperreactive controls is a really huge bother. But when this platforming is required for bosses like Treu, Magus, or Shu Gohth, you will scream in rage at the mad controls that are getting you killed!
<br>
<br>The numerous speed platforming puzzles are just an incredible pain as they require extremely tight movement that the control doesn&apos;t help you with one tiny bit. I often thought of Sonic the Hedgehog, the original one, and how Sonic always has acceleration and slowing down to help him do precise jumps. Valdis Story does not offer that kind of precision at all and whether it&apos;s platform jumping, avoiding hazards above or aside of you or doing several jumps to avoid enemy projectiles trying to knockback you down to hell, you will suffer tons with this.
<br>
<br>Along with all that, the lack of a world map makes finding your way very tedious as you will have to try every way out of an area to see the next area&apos;s map...and the area maps don&apos;t even tell you what the exits lead to.
<br>
<br>As a whole, the game is very much worth trying at least, but only if you can get into a try-and-die spirit and are ready to face the horribly poor and frustrating platforming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=4013951">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The problem is that it is sloppy, which makes it extremely hard.  There&apos;s also a huge learning curve to play the game well.  Way higher than most any Castlevania game.  You can&apos;t play this casually and expect to get through.
<br>
<br>But, as other people point out, it relies so heavily on endless boring timed puzzles that are unforgiving.  At least those are for optional items.
<br>
<br>You have no warning for bosses, and are then stuck in an endless loop of grinding to beat the boss.  I&apos;m not sure, but I think if you don&apos;t do awesome at bosses you don&apos;t get stat upgrades.  So... how is that fair?
<br>
<br>Jumping puzzles abound.  HATE jumping puzzles.  This trope was thrown out years ago for most games.  But there are single-block cubes you have to land on.  Enemies attack you, but if you attack them your character moves automatically and falls off.  Oh, and performance issues make the game stutter at random moments, sometimes when I&apos;m in the middle of a jump, and I mistime the jump.  Ugh.
<br>
<br>Having so many items and options is also a bit of a problem, too.  It&apos;s very unclear which items to use at any given time and the spells are clunky to change.  I stopped using spells altogether because of that, but this is the same problem one of the Castlevania games had.
<br>
<br>Controllers almost invariably don&apos;t work.  None of my Logitech gamepads are recognized.  Apparently the Xbox 360 usb controller works well, but of course that&apos;s the one kind I don&apos;t have.
<br>
<br>Still, there&apos;s a lot of high quality art, animations, and it&apos;s more or less a reasonably solid fighting engine.  It&apos;s fun for a few hours, so I&apos;m rating on the amount of enjoyment I got out of it.  A good solid afternoon of fun.  After that, I suggest giving up before the fiery Temple (or at the wizard with a sword) and moving on unless you seriously like grinding on jumping puzzles and unforgiving bosses.  There&apos;s more pain then reward at this point unless you&apos;re really committed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=6199756">Expand</a></span>

Metroid and castlvania were much more fun to play and way better designed. Those are fighting, RPG, and exploring games. This is a timed jump and running platform game more than a fighting game. So unless you like doing that teenage mutant ninja turtles electric death water scene over and over a billion times over then this game is not for you, becuase thats what doing those stupid jump timed puzzles felt like. Everything in this game is pretty great (including the fighting and rpg leveling) except for one thing that totally brings it down: the platforming. You can&apos;t ignore the platforming unfortunately, its required and even focused on. The controls for it feel so terrible, wall jumping and double jumping isn&apos;t made easy at all, and it is not satisfying like in metroid or castlevania, instead you just pray for luck and feel stress and frustration relief when its completed instead of satisfaction. Everything you do will require timed jumps, you have to do puzzles that are literally timed and jump all around avoiding the slightest hit or you have to do it all over again. 1 battle? next scene is timed jump platform that may take an hour to complete, just jumping. boss scene? another jump puzzle. Getting a special item? more jump timed puzzles. Backtracking? more jumped timed puzzles. Going to the village? more jump and running timed puzzles. You will spend 10 times more of your time just running and doing frustrating timed jumps than fighting, and fighting is the fun part of the game, platforming is boring, repetitive, and frustrating. Making it much worse is the fact that you can&apos;t avoid it, it makes it 10x more aggravating to backtrack since you do need to backtrack to find new items and discover new areas, and you won&apos;t know if you are failing because of your skill, the fact the controls suck, or that you don&apos;t have an item that will give you that one second of extra quickness to complete the timed jumping and running puzzle. I absolutely hated that portion of the game, and i realized 90% of the game is trying to hit a button, run and jump without getting hit by any enemies or obstacles, and reaching the end location before the time limit is up with an absurdly low tolerance of delay. That is most of the game and it kind of sucks because it could easily have been a masterpiece if that part of the game was just eliminated and added just more game features to it, creatures and items. Metroid and castlevania did it much better, and focused on the items that gave clear abilities to clearly reach unaccessible areas before. Flying bat/cloud, double space jump, small sticky space ball.. so much more simple yet it totally worked and all cool, instead Valdis used timed jump puzzles and total crap spell upgrades to make these items accessible, so much more frustrating and less satisfying. When will you game designers learn timed quests and tasks never add to the fun?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=5340282">Expand</a></span>

It won&apos;t cuddle you like modern games that are built to make you feel good by holding your hand while giving you the illusion of challenge and danger. It&apos;s a great experience with beautiful art, awesome music, lovely animations and great gameplay. There are 4 playable characters (2 unlocked from the start) that have different powers and combat style giving good replayability to this title. The game punishes foolishness or sloppy gaming, but is very rewarding for being smart in analyzing challenges and using your skills correctly. In a way, it reminds me of Dark Souls for giving a difficult but exciting experience.  I&apos;d easily recommend this to anyone that loved the old Mega Man or the Castlevania titles on Nintendo DS</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=3521727">Expand</a></span>

But when the challenge is  to overcome counterintuitive controls and make 10 perfect moves in 10 seconds  it&apos;s not fun at all. You just have to repeat over and over, until you master it. It may take 30-100 tries to solve 1 trick or to learn a boss. This is what this game is all about.

<br>Let me start by saying I am a metroidvania enthusiast, I live for these games and they are my favorite genre in the fastness of video games. I grew up with super metroid and to this day is my favorite game of all time, the &quot;what the  do I do next thing&quot; sold the whole franchise to me. SoTN just nailed it in every way possible. In other words: I&apos;ve been waiting for Valdis Story: Abyssal City  for years.
<br>
<br>On the surface the game is tight, as in the controls and the overall JRPG is there, but its a action RPG. It feels sometimes like a action fighting game, kind of like devil may cry, where the combos are so different depending on what you hit (jump included). The combat focuses on melee, and uses magic as a means of navigation, kind of like metroids&apos; ability&apos;s.
<br>
<br>I will admit the crafting interface could be a little easier to do, like maybe check a item you want to farm for, so you can see your progress. The only way i could do that is wright down the mats needed for it, then go off fighting the mobs who drop it.
<br>
<br>The artwork is outstanding, it brings me back to when I was first learning how truly powerful games could really be. All this 1080 HD next gen  couldn&apos;t make me thing this game looks anything but beautiful. This  is hand drawn, and it looks great.
<br>
<br>Overall, I can not recommend this game enough, If you liked SoTN, buy this game.
<br>
<br>I am using a xbox 360 controller and the controls are very good and tight,</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=3726637">Expand</a></span>

You can tell the creators really put a lot into this game over the years. The lack of voice over in the dialog was something I could easily overlook as the game presents very well. Everything was smooth sailing except for a few hard timed puzzles. Even up through the first two or three bosses I was fine despite some rather annoying fight-extending mechanics like random teleporting around the screen. That was until I cam across Magus. Needless to say this game does not hold your hand past the first boss. Be prepared to try each boss 20-40 times  and this is on normal. This is clearly not a casual game.
<br>
<br>By this time the controls beginning to show their true colors as the all-important dodge mechanic is used by pressing down+left/right. This wasn&apos;t a problem if you only need to time one of these maneuvers  however stringing them together  especially in different directions was an effort in futility. Sometimes it works and sometimes your character will sit there and take the full brunt of an enemy attack despite you &quot;dodging&quot;. Oh, and sometimes you will randomly &quot;dodge&quot; straight down while trying to platform left or right resulting in having to redo your previous five minutes of platforming. This could have been a result of the controller I was using having a joystick however a keyboard didn&apos;t seem to do much better. Magic is also tied to a similar system. RT+down/left/right/up will cast a variety of customization spells  after a couple of attempt of course.
<br>
<br>Sticky controls coupled with the fact that anything  a boss attack, a trash mob, a spawned flying sword (or four as Magus is fond of)  will knock you back and off platforms makes parts of the game keyboard-breakingly frustrating. Ledge grabbing, long a staple of platforming games, seems random. Sometimes you will grab a ledge (only to be knocked off by a sword/mob/dodge) and sometimes your character will just face hump the wall for several jumps. Nothing I have played recently has made my blood boil like having to pray to the platforming gods that I will grab a ledge in a boss battle, have my wish be granted, only to be chain knocked off by a boss attack, a sword, a lightning attack, and have to start all over again with half health.
<br>
<br>Do you like timed puzzles? Great! This game has them in spades. And I&apos;m not talking about the kind with a second or two of leeway for you to complete. I&apos;m talking the kind that have 9 frame perfect jumps complete with dodging for extra speed and unreliable magic abilities. And I&apos;m not even talking about the end of the game.  This was happening from the second boss onward. Want that upgraded armor? You had better be prepared to do the same jumping puzzle 10, 20, 50 times until you can input the correct set of commands in frame perfect timing.
<br>
<br>My hat is off to the artist and composer for this game. Hell even the overall design is pretty interesting and reminds me a lot of Dust. That being said, some sticky controls, frustrating mechanics, and some huge difficulty spikes drag this game down hard. I&apos;m all for challenging games however challenging games need to have airtight controls and, in the case of a plat former, perfect jump physics to be successful. This game has neither.  It&apos;s a shame too  the game had so much promise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=3757300">Expand</a></span>

As otherwise noted, it&apos;s derivative of Symphony of the Night and other great Metroidvania games. Personally, I feel it stands head and shoulders above other recent entries like Dust: An Elysian Tale and Guacamelee Relative to both, the story is more interesting, there is materially more life breathed into the characters. Similarly, combat is much, much deeper (in exponential terms) and crisper in this game. The game is about three or four times longer than Guacamelee and Dust, and has more replay value due to better difficulty scaling and multiple characters. Further, the RPG elements, in terms of leveling, a host of items to find and upgrade, decisions in the game with substantial consequences, etc. are all present. I haven&apos;t enjoyed a Metroidvania this much since SoTN. If you don&apos;t like the genre then invariably it&apos;s not for you, otherwise strongly recommended. It&apos;s an injustice that IGN/Gamespot etc. have not given this more coverage.
<br>
<br>One small negative, upon rare occasions the game froze on my computer and proceeded to crash. This happened about 5 times in roughly 20 hours of play so definitely not game breaking, but was annoying nonetheless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=3950530">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is an action game and it shows.
<br>
<br>I found every single boss fight challenging (unlike Castlevania SotN where you can just SoulSteal past every boss), and the timed platforming challenges had me swearing at the screen every time I made a mistake, but were oh so satisfying once completed, and my skills were that much better as a result (not to mention the extra loot).
<br>
<br>The game has a unique potion system whereby potions are never lost when used, but refilled at a save point. They effectively act as continues, rezzing you automatically at the spot you died in the midst of the battle. It&apos;s really satisfying to find an extra potion as they are quite rare!
<br>
<br>The move-cancellation system is a real treat! At any time you can press down to cancel whatever you are doing. This can be to cancel out of a longer attack animation, or to recover after being hit. This also has the effect of hammering you towards the ground post haste, so can even be used to move around the levels quickly.
<br>Also once you hit the ground (or if you were already on the ground), you can immediately press left/right to dash in said direction! This is often used to get behind enemies that block from the front, or that are telegraphing overpowered attacks.
<br>
<br>Even when running from A to B, a quick &apos;down, forward&apos; on the D-pad will give you a burst of speed to make the slight hesitation of pressing down worthwhile!
<br>
<br>The cancellation is on a 2 second timer so can&apos;t be abused after every single attack animation, but you can find/craft more charges, and learn skills that reset the charges.
<br>
<br>As you play the game you begin to transfer the cancel/dash and other moves to your muscle memory (the timed platforming sections are great for this, as while they start off easy enough, they soon become really challenging and require as many dashes and wall jumps as humanly possible).
<br>
<br>Once you are performing these technical moves on the battlefield, you feel like such a badass, dashing, dodging, countering, wall jumping, building combos and triggering assists from your &apos;party&apos; (think of any recent fighting game that allows you to tag in a backup character for a second), or going all out in focus mode!
<br>
<br>There is no dodge rating or block percentage in this game; all skills must be performed by the player and timed perfectly for maximum results. Grinding can help to soften the edges of boss battles, but it&apos;s still on you to play well, especially once the timed platforming sections go from optional to compulsory, later in the game!
<br>
<br>All in all, Valdis Story is a great action platformer in the style of Metroidvania, and is the most fun I&apos;ve had with a game since I replayed Castlevania: Symphony of the Night on PS1 (earlier this morning).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=3904119">Expand</a></span>

<br>With that said:
<br>game combat is great. Some boss battles are very challenging and time puzzles are VERY challenging at times but rewarding. Platforms are well done even if frustrating from time to time. This isn&apos;t just a button masher you have to learn to time and set off dodges (called skill cancels). Character build I had was really fun (i had a all warrior with enough guardian to get the reset cancel skill on successful cancel with wanderer rainment, dagger/bow wep (which you get 3/4 game wish was sooner) bloodletter crest and Faolan assistant with mostly agility decent luck and some strength and assassin skill that makes you invisible). Basically made me an assassin/ vampire. The music was great. Loved the art style. Everything was rather fluid. Overall a very good game just not a 10.
<br>
<br>Dislikes: broken baddy that floats and looks like Mew from pokemon with ice magic that freezes you with every attack and can&apos;t skill cancel once frozen so when hit with certain moves drained half my life because of the combo. also there is no &apos;world&apos; map (just area map) which was frustrating at times. The lore was cool but the actual in game story was a little bland. These are my only complaints.
<br>
<br>Verdict: buy a copy it does have replay-ability worth it even at full price (15, but i got it on steam on sale though for like 5 bux i think) game is awesome. Don&apos;t buy a copy if your a  that can&apos;t handle tough challenges here and there(nuff said!)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=3903423">Expand</a></span>

<br>You can build your character in some different manners. Going for hard hitting attacks, or incredibly strong criticals, maybe a magic user  you won&apos;t be left unrewarded
<br>The game flows well in combat, and skill cancel is your most important tool

This has kept me from finishing the game a second time with the second character and on the highest difficulty. I got to the first boss just fine but then I was like &quot;You got to be kidding!&quot;
<br>That said - it DOES take a while to get through the game even just once, so depending on what price you pay for it, it is still absolutely worth it. I just find it unfortunate that it possibly will never be finished and I&apos;m also not a huge fan of the art style. It looks more like what you would see from a hobbyist on deviantart rather than a professional game artist (even if it&apos;s indie games - just check out Bastion, Braid, This War Of Mine, etc.).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=4882283">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game has tons of areas to explore, loads of weapons/armor items to find, a whole lot of customization, and everything about it is basically top notch at a budget price.
<br>
<br>The combat never gets boring, even if it takes a little getting used to.  This game borrows quite a bit from SOTN but puts its own spin on things with a lot of platforming challenges (puzzles maybe) and unique spells and abilities for both of the playable characters.  leveling up gives you points to distribute to your stats and they all make a big difference.  There are tons of different abilities and skills to learn.
<br>
<br>The game really nails the exploration aspect of Super Metroid.  I constantly found myself running around looking for new areas and items to acquire.  There is a real feeling of mystery and adventure as you&apos;re adventuring around, even if you have specific goals most of the time (find a character here, make your way to a certain town to the east, etc.)
<br>
<br>I am not just giving this game a 10 because I like it a lot, I think it deserves it.  It&apos;s hands down the best metroid-vania style game to come out in a LONG time.  It&apos;s criminally underrated and it&apos;s really a shame it&apos;s so under the radar.  A game with this much going for it should be on year end &quot;best-of&quot; lists.
<br>
<br>My only complaints would be that the jumping arc of your character is a little weird.  Sometimes it makes the platforming kind of wonky, but you get used to it. If you think about it, the jump arc on Super Metroid was pretty weird, too. :P
<br>
<br>Also, the story wasn&apos;t bad and I&apos;m glad that it didn&apos;t bog down the gameplay (it never spits endless long winded dialogue at you) but it wasn&apos;t exactly memorable for me.  Maybe I wasn&apos;t paying a lot of attention because I wanted to get onto one of the awesome memorable boss battles.
<br>
<br>Only other complaint is that some of the enemies get palette swapped and reused throughout the game.  There&apos;s a decent diversity but I would have liked to see some more enemy types.  I will give it a reprieve since it&apos;s an independent (and amazing) budget title.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played other so called &quot;great&quot; metroid-vania style games (the underwhelming Dust: Elysian Tale and the extremely disappointing Xeodrifter), and I am a harsh critic.  But i can without a doubt recommend to this anybody looking for a great, challenging, and rewarding action-rpg-metroidvania type game.  I&apos;ve put 30 hours into it and I&apos;m still coming back to playing it after beating it once already.  Even the music is top notch, creating the mood perfectly and adding its own flair on the whole thing.  Really high quality stuff.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m serious.  JUst get this game.  It&apos;s worth every penny.  It&apos;s a freaking steal.  I hate most modern games and the direction gaming is going, and this is true to the classics in every way.  Like I said, it borrows a lot from the best in the genre but changes it up with a unique and fun combat system and lots of customization with quite a bit of challenge thrown in.  It all comes together being one of my favorite gaming experiences I&apos;ve had in a really long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=4902724">Expand</a></span>

If you can get past the initial shock, however, it&apos;s a fantastic game.
<br>THE PROS:
<br>The are multiple characters, each has a surprising amount of customization options, and which one you pick affects the story of the game. The combat is deep, the platforming can be very challenging, and there are loads of secrets for you to find. Easily entertaining for more than one playthrough.
<br>THE CONS:
<br>The game has some design faults which make it a bit frustrating. The player is told where to go, but the lack of overworld map and quest markers make it hard to actually get there. Movement powers and magic occupy the same slots, forcing you to swap spells whenever you need to platform. Some of the boss and puzzle designs are downright cruel.
<br>VERDICT:
<br>If you&apos;re already a fan of the genre it&apos;s worth buying. If you&apos;ve never played a metroidvania before, the complicated systems and lack of guidance might be too much for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=3760033">Expand</a></span>

<br>As of this review i&apos;ve played about 6 hours of the game and there&apos;s a certain boss that teleports randomly and if he goes into a certain location the fight becomes impossible to complete because not only does it force you to preform the platforming puzzle to climb back up it&apos;s impossible to do so when said boss enters a certain phase and begins shooting lasers through the room which knock u off the platform.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=3756106">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;d say Castlevania excelled in and emphasised exploring, whereas Valdis Story aims to grip the player with its often cruel platforms and bosses - a moment&apos;s distraction usually means death. So we have:
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Well-crafted game mechanics
<br>- Challenging and not too repetitive bosses
<br>- Beautiful and fluid visuals
<br>- Nice soundtrack
<br>- Good replay value
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Poor map traversal (one often has to fight a long way to get to their objective, even though there is fast travel)
<br>- Dash (Skill Cancel) is sometimes difficult to get right because it uses the same button as magic. I did not quite understand why it was not set to another button
<br>- Some events permanently affect your game, making it impossible to obtain gear and such
<br>- Underdeveloped/underused item and shop systems
<br>
<br>Overall, it is that game which brings satisfaction after some suffering from trying to defeat a boss or get to a platform without having to backtrack once again. Recommended mainly for hardcore gamers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=4324687">Expand</a></span>

The game is flooded with terrible design, choppy, iffy and twitchy controls, dreadful, ugly graphics and is all around a weak experience.  The game pretends to give you a degree of freedom by throwing you in what appears to be an open, Metroidvania-esque world, but it blocks you from backtracking with cheap tricks like overly-powerful bosses, one-way doors and requirements for abilities you do not get until later.  It is almost entirely linear, disguised as open.  There is little to explore, the platforming is loose and floaty, the combat is fast and fluid, but this is negated by the fact that enemies attack you through combos and skills, and endless attacks that are either unblockable, or require you to use a dodge that cancels your combo.
<br>
<br>The game has typical design for a cheap modern attempt at this genre, but feels claustrophobic and repetitive.  Unlike Symphony of the Night, which has well-thought-out, varied environments very close together, Valdis Story&apos;s art is a seemingly-endless repetition of the same sprites.  The bad gameplay makes this even worse at times when there are platforms that look accessible, but aren&apos;t, or they simply lead to an alcove at the top of the screen, because attempts in vein to access these ledges often send you falling back down to an arduous vertical room.
<br>
<br>The upgrade system is rudimentary and uninspired, the gear system is pointlessly demanding, requiring you to pick up or even buy an item, only to be forced to use it and other resources to upgrade it at a shop, occasionally forcing you to buy gear twice!  The addition of spells is hindered by a terrible casting control scheme, that, like the cancel/dodge ability are necessary for beating the game, but are broken as they do not work properly at times, leaving you spamming a button before a spell or ability will finally decide to work.
<br>
<br>Super Metroid is my favorite video game of all time, and many games in this genre are in my wheelhouse, and I have NOT played a game like this that is more frustrating and less fun than Valdis Story.  I feel like half the travel and map navigation is nothing more than busy work and the RPG elements that require a level of grinding are locked because each room only has a few enemies, who are not worth near enough experience points to level you, forcing you to move through rooms to reset the spawns to power up.  This is a very poorly-designed game, obviously made by either schizophrenic Otakus or retarded monkeys, I&apos;m not sure which.  If you like this game, fine, but I found it to be the single most joyless experience I&apos;ve had all year with a game that SHOULD and COULD have been good.  Valdis Story is WORSE THAN SIM CITY!  Because with all of Sim City&apos;s faults, it is technically playable, and you can, to an extent, play it the way you want.  Valdis Story&apos;s attempt at variety is a forced, one-way street of repeating combos, uninspired enemies, cheap and annoying boss fights and terrible artwork.

<br>
<br>The kickstarter promised great fighting mechanics and combos, but all everybody really got was the same three moves repeated over and over along with poorly placed, unrebindable controls and the worlds most annoying cancel... which is really JUST a glorified dash, that other games let you bind to the proper keys. But hey! The enemies can infi-combo you, so maybe the kickstarter was talking about how good the combos would be for them! Oh and the spikes... apparently those can infi-combo better than the player character as well. In the end though I guess you can&apos;t really talk about how responsive controls are when a game even has slow down issues on an i-7 processor... I guess it should just be expected at that point.
<br>
<br>The controls are definitely not stellar, no matter how many die-hard fans accost you with &quot;git gud&quot; memes and an obvious attempt at feeling superior for once in theirs lives. No, the controls are bad and unresponsive... yes, you can make them work, but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s an excuse to have them and the difficulty shouldn&apos;t be in fighting them to do what you want. The real truth is it&apos;s a platforming game, with bad platforming and a wall jump mechanic that seriously needs a revision.
<br>
<br>The bosses start off fun and challenging, but soon spiral down into mass projectile and minion spamming nonsense, and by the end of the game you&apos;re fighting a screen of bright colors and no discernible hitbox while you&apos;re being infi-comboed because you missed one dash because the game felt like being unresponsive that one time. I guess it&apos;s hard to invent a new boss pattern after you&apos;ve used up all the ones you know on the first two...
<br>
<br>The story is terrible and the writing makes you wonder if they&apos;ve even written anything before, as it&apos;s littered with bad habits and constant references to things that have never been previously explained... similar to a fan-fiction, but imagine the subject the fan-fiction was about simply didn&apos;t even exist... The ending was anti-climatic and left the feeling of &quot;So? Big whoop? Was that supposed to be surprising?&quot; It&apos;s not a twist if it isn&apos;t even relevant to the story and came off as nothing more than a corny way to end the game. Overall, unenjoyable story and definitely worth mashing your buttons through.
<br>
<br>The artwork is great, and definitely the best, if not only (read as only) aspect worth playing the game to experience.... although, just like the combo system... the artwork is repetitive and doesn&apos;t have a lot of variety. The townsfolk all consist of the same 3 character designs and the portraits next to the speech dialogs always show the same emotion; lending absolutely nothing more than getting in the way of reading the situation properly. In fact, the whole game comes off as a concept or prototype that you&apos;d pitch to a publisher... and not a final game.
<br>
<br>To summarize, if you want to play a good game, just go play SOTN or co. and if you want to play something obviously made in game maker... don&apos;t... or better yet, just hire their artist and make something yourself, because it&apos;d be hard pressed not to be a hundred fold better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=4789882">Expand</a></span>

<br>_dynamic story (yes 3 events that could change what happen several hours after is dynamic xD)
<br>
<br>As cons I should mention the fact that the manual is very lacking and the game is in a serious need of an in-game map
<br>
<br>I read from some negative / mixed review a bunch of issues that some people had. The vast majority of these issues has been fixed. So :
<br>_you can now rebind  the skill cancel button
<br>_the slow downs on some very good PC has been &quot;fixed&quot; - say, greatly lessen. I was one of them before the last patch. Now it&apos;s well playable event if it&apos;s still not as smooth as on a PC without the issue (I have both)

<br>I wasn&apos;t sold at first, it seemed a little silly and unrefined, but as I kept playing I discovered that the combat was far better and customizable than I thought. Kind of like a platinum game combat, with combos, super powers, etc... Far deeper than you would expect from a indie platform game like this. I played on normal mode and it was still a fair challenge. The bosses are really good in this game. As for the rest, it offers a nice selection of areas with various timed puzzles that are quite fun to do.
<br>
<br>The only main issue is that it is hard to remember where you&apos;ve been and where you need to go, or where a place is. There is a map when you are in an area, but you can&apos;t access a bigger map with the names of the place, etc... There is also a tram that brings you to 3 different towns, but sometimes a fast travel would be nice when you&apos;ve been wandering about for a while.
<br>
<br>The game offers new characters to play with, once you finished the game and even items that can port over to a new game, and I can definitely see myself playing this game again in the future with a different character build.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/valdis-story-abyssal-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=7409274">Expand</a></span>
