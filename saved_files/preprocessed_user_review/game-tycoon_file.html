In fact, it would be completely erroneous to call this one of the worst games ever made. I have bought many modern AAA games which have been extremely disappointing; in fact, I&apos;ve had more fun and put more time into this small, 11 year old game, than in many modern critically acclaimed games. Like I said at the start, this game has some issues, most of which are small and don&#x2019;t impact the gameplay at all. The larger problems happen very infrequently, if at all. The largest thing I have had happen to me after many hours of gameplay is one crash. I&apos;ve seen multiple games on consoles crash more often than this, and have more problems than this old game.
<br>I see, however, people all over the place raging on about how awful this game is, making me doubt that they&apos;ve even played it. This bit&#x2019;s going to be more-so centred on the other two reviews written here, which state that one cannot make money; this is obviously a completely false statement, as I have roughly 25 million dollars, and have bought out my competitors by purchasing all of their shares. It may be a somewhat challenging game, but it&#x2019;s not that hard, guys. Geo over it.
<br>SHOULD YOU BUY IT? Well, if you&#x2019;re into these kind of games, and you can be somewhat forgiving when it comes to small bugs, then I believe that you, like me, will have a fun time with this game. I have, without a doubt, gotten my money out of this game, and do not regret buying it. I didn&apos;t listen to all of these people on steam demanding a refund, and took a risk that I don&#x2019;t regret at all. I would like to say that this game may not be quite as good as Game Dev Tycoon, however, it is ten years older, and takes this genre in a completely different way; one which I would say is definitely worth a try.
<br>I&#x2019;m going to rate this game an eight out of ten in order to somewhat level out the rating, and would rate it realistically somewhere around a seven out of ten if others weren&apos;t raging so much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-tycoon/user-reviews?user_review_id=4003557">Expand</a></span>
