I really enjoyed Candorous&apos; stories of the Mandalorian Wars, for example. They were compact with imagery and none of the dialogue seems superfluous. I seriously don&apos;t understand why this game should get anything less than a 9. I have played nearly every Star Wars game to date (and certainly many rpgs) and KOTOR is definitely one that sets the standards high. Don&apos;t be fooled by the low reviews.

Any one who picked this up back when it was new expecting JK series game play was a moron.)  After sitting back and examining how i was allotting points for stats and skills however I managed to create a character that played through to finish the game.  I realized a few things.  Bioware makes challenging games.  They really push the boundary of: How much will I let myself get immersed and what mechanics will i explore?  There is a wrong way to play and select stats and abilities and this is a good thing.  There is still choice. You just have to know what you are doing to create the character you want to play.  I like this game more than dragon age origins admittedly because it is a bit more forgiving if you get yourself in a sticky situation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=1710304">Expand</a></span>

After playing KOTOR for a couple of hours, i completely forgotten NFSU2 and whenever i switched on the com, it would be KOTOR until i finished the old game. This is one superb game, with excellent and amazing story line.</span>

For the most part, was pretty easy (even the final battle wasn&apos;t a challenge) and has one of the best stories you can get, with some interesting plot twists. Recommended for [hardcore] fans and non. The only complaint of mine would be that the beginning is a little bit to rushed. Overall, I say everyone should give this game a try.</span>

In fact, its nice that you don&apos;t start off as a Jedi, because than everything would be so easy! Plus it would make the storyline worse, if anything. And Mr Justin K stated that all missions require killing someone. OK.... since when is Star Wars about being a Pacifist? Secondly, I know many missions that don&apos;t require action. What about the murder case that you can act Arbiter in on the planet Manaan? What about swoop racing or pazaak playing? Justin K.&apos;s review couldn&apos;t be further off. This is the Star Wars Game for Star Wars haters, and the RPG game for RPG haters. If you haven&apos;t bought this game yet, and you call yourself a gamer, I&apos;m sorry, but you aren&apos;t a gamer. This is a true classic. Grand Theft Auto is not a true classic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=12940">Expand</a></span>

Once I turned off the auto-pause feature, it quickly turned my interest into high gear. No one company will ever make the &quot;perfect&quot; RPG. There will always be some aspects to be included or left out of every game. This is the main reason I play both ESIII and KOTOR. If I feel like slaughtering a village, ESIII, if I feel like journeying into Star Wars friendly territory, KOTOR.

Those with a little patience (couple hours tops) can experience one of the best and most accessible (fun) RPG&apos;s made in the last 5 years. Everything you ever wanted to do from Star Wars, and it even fits well into the SW universe (for all those who care). A true must-play.</span>

But what time doesn&apos;t improve (Like graphics, financial support) is simply perfect in this game. This is the ONLY game I&apos;ve known that actually give you choices that you need to think about. The star wars ultimate Dilemma, Dark Side or Light Side, come in this game stronger then ever- You will face situations when you actually think- &quot;hey, The Jedi code is to tense, Nothing will happen if I just use my force for little personal gain this one time&quot; And you actually feel the burden of being a Jedi. (Why pay 500 credits for parking when you can just &quot;convince&quot; someone you don&apos;t need to un-violently?, This is one tiny example). Until today I have never seen choises in games so real and also effect the story line so deeply. Dialogue in this game is very advanced. Most of the times there are actually right and wrong answers and failing them will not come unforigiven. (Ever been put on trial in a RPG? this is one true masterpiece!) Plus it&apos;s Brilliant idea to use the Jedi ability to understand foreign language to cut off text acting- Personally I don&apos;t mind if the voice is total rubbish to me as long as the actual text is rich and developed. Character building in this game is great- you decide for you and your companions what are they going to be good at (Jedi are divided into three classes- depending on the light sabre skill and their force manipulation skill). There are many options and you are not going to use them all in one go. Plus the inventory allows many more modification for your weapons gadgets and robots. And of course- The storyline, which make this game a MUST for anyone who really loves star wars, even you ignore the effect of your choices on the plot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=2342123">Expand</a></span>

Also, Bioware only make RPGs&apos;, so expecting anything else was a little silly. So, yeah, as an action game it would score low, but as it is not a third person shooter, these scores are not valid. If it was scored low as an RPG however, I respect that peoples tastes are different. Personally I think it is a brilliant game, with a great storyline, and a lot of tactical combat. The only problem that I had with it on the first play through is the level cap, but if you play it through again, then you can plan your character better. Also I understand that the cap was for gameplay balance towards the end of the game. Definately give this game a chance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=742917">Expand</a></span>

With this one I defintly had that old familiar feeling of, just another ten minutes. The story grabs you and transports you to another universe. My only main criticsm was the inventory system and that I found the final battle frustratingly hard.</span>

Do yourselves a favor and learn to read. The game is one of the most amazing gaming experience I have had in a while. The story is gripping until the end. There are various plot twists, one in particular is in the same league as &quot;Luke, I am your father&quot; (Just do yourself a favor and do not read anything that could possbly ruin the story for you...believe me, the plot twist is that awesome). The depth of each character and each setting is so deep that you&apos;ll constantly want to hear more about them. The gameplay is unique and feels like an MMORPG. It is turn based, but not in the Final Fantasy sense. Anyone expecting a hack n&apos; slash game (like most of the people who gave the game low scores) look elsewhere. But for those who want a deep gaming experience, trust me this is one of the best of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=744495">Expand</a></span>

About mid-way through the game i thought it deserved a 9, but after beating it i want to give it a 20. Yes, you can choose light or dark side. The story is amazing. But the best part about choosing your path is how you make the decisions. For instance- I made a character who i was intent on being absolutely dark side the whole game, as dark side powers cost cheaper that way. So I was as evil as possible.......but somehow on the wookie planet of Kashyyk i just couldnt be mean to the wookies. so for then i momentarilly gained some light side points! you actually feel the moral decisions. now THATS good roleplaying. as someone said below it is a bit easy, including the final battle, and i agree, but i like it that way. its cool being an amazingly powerful jedi (or sith) who can destroy 6 enemy sith by himself. also some people have complained that there is no jumping. this game is techincally a 3d version of the baldurs gate style of playing, and there definitely wasnt jumping in that. however you CAN use force jump where your character jumps up to about 30 feet to the enemy with his lightsaber. its really cool. My only complaint is that once you get to a point where you can choose to go to a certain 4 planets, these individual planets dont have enough on them, especially tatooine. i can accomplish all the tasks on them in around an hour, but the first planet takes about 4-5 hours. This game has great replay too. There is a different ending for light and dark side. I have only played the dark side, but I am going to replay it as light side! The dialogue is very well written too, the characters are really good, and i encountered very few bugs, most of them minor like getting stuck or not being able to open a chest that says it can be opened. this game is cheap, so buy it NOW!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=381594">Expand</a></span>

That is just lame... The Uniqe thing about this game is that you DON&apos;T need anymore than the 6 classes... you have everything you need, with all the skills you can improve, that makes up for all the &quot;missing&quot; classes you speak of... Of the main characters I have: a droid computer expert, a strong warrior, a warrior healer, a twi tech and 4 different jedi&apos;s each with different powers! There is no need to have 20+ classes, and that was plain stupid to even suggest it, and compare to SW Galaxies!!! This is a single player game for christ sake, with a main story!!! Galaxies is a whole world, trying to reflect different lives you can live! Well if you were even smart enough to notice, this doesn&apos;t work well in single player games, to be a bountyhunter or a smith.... I don&apos;t know about you, but I can never in my wildest dreams see a bounty hunter save the galaxy or become a jedi knight. You have the choice in the game(if you go the dark path) to make money collecting a few bounties as a side quest. The game dosn&apos;t use the Neverwinter Nights engine, this one is much more complex. If you notice then you will see light shining back from the twi&apos;leks skin and so on. I can&apos;t even believe you would say that it uses the same graphics engine as NwN... when you get close to the grapichs in NwN you wil see how bad it really was, even in the highest resolutions. Besides the NwN engine was never constructed to run the HUGE inviroments in SWKotOR! It was totally crazy to even suggest it is the same engine! &quot;You can only be human. Thought you could be one of those Twi&apos;leks or Wookies? Well too bad, you can&apos;t even choose your race (NWN had 8). That&apos;s sad, because even in Jedi Academy there are 6 races you could choose from and that&apos;s an FPS&quot; You want it to be like Jedi Academy?? Even if you choose another race, it is just another skin.. no different voice, nothing special, not even another name! If you took your time and compleeted more than just the first 5% of the game, you would know that you get to have many different races and caracters on your ship (9 besides the main caracter) and that you can take control over them as you pleese. Your main caracter is the one who speaks to people but you should be fine with that because in JK it is only the action it is about, so action only with a wookie in KotOR should not be your problem. &quot;combat is supposed to have variety, a strategy of executing the right moves at the right time, and so far the only thing I see myself doing is changing to melee weapons when the enemy gets in point blank range of one of my party members&quot; Well thanks for pointing another great thing about KotOR out. If you choose hard difficulty the game can be hard enough... and there will be a time when you have to change strategy... but my team goes like this: 1 melee, 1 middlerange with 2 blasters, and a sniper (long range). some places in the game you have to go alone and that changes everything. I agree in that Taris is the planet that takes most time and can be long sometimes, even though it is still great. But after Taris I couldn&apos;t stop myself again, I just had to see what happened next. The game took 50 hours to complete and I don&apos;t think I got all sidequests... a game that long and that good is very hard to find today. Well im off... got to play KotOR again to see how the dark side is :D Igor--&gt;nothing personal, I juist think you should know something about a game before you go on and talk about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=373977">Expand</a></span>

This is a great game with tremendous graphics that sucked me in for five straight days while I completed it. Now I&apos;m starting all over again from the beginning and it is just as fun. The only complaint I have is that later battles are comparatively easier than early ones because the encounters are non-linear and don&apos;t seem to &quot;level-up&quot; along with the characters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=375205">Expand</a></span>

Despite this, the game excels in every area, attracting non-RPG players to a simple interface and control set up. Trust me, the only things you will need to run this game are your mouse and a space-bar (for quick pause). The story and music were excellent (the music won an award from PC Gamer) and this game also ended up with GOTY from PC Gamer. Character creation is a tad bit shallow, but once you get past that, the great story starts. Oh and the beginning is a bit slow, but dont worry as soon as you get out of the apartments, the fun will start!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=376205">Expand</a></span>

This game tries to cover it&apos;s linear nature poorly, so it really isn&apos;t much more open ended than final fantasy, unless you count the fact that you can either be on the darkside or the lightside. Also, on my version, there is a bug which stops you from progressing (on tattoine near the entrance of the sand peoples hq), and while I&apos;m sure there is a patch for this, I have not yet aquired it. I reccomend this for novice rpg-ers, but for more experianced gamers out there who are looking for a more freeform, and generally better rpg, stick with elder scrolls 3 or neverwinter nights, as they have not been tainted by previous release on the xbox.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=381205">Expand</a></span>

While it doesn&apos;t succeed at having as great a story as the BG games, it is a TON better than the stuff from Ep. 1 and 2 in the movies. Overall Great Game.</span>

KOTOR is a wonderfully deep RPG based in a living Star Wars universe. The game is wonderful. The only reason it didn&apos;t get a perfect score is because I found the controls to be less than intuitive. Otherwise, this is a spectacular game.</span>

Do I have to say more? This is the first time they are leaving D&amp;D as base of their RPG. The game is still based on pen  &amp; paper like rules and feels like sci-fy version on D&amp;D. The story is happening in the universe of Old Republic (the is long before Star Wars movies) so creators have enough space for their own creativity, but still fans of SW will see lot of familiar places. Player cannot choose any race but human this is little bit shame, but no worries shortly you will find lot of companions, so you would enjoy playing as wookiee or  android. As it is common for BioWare every companion have his own agenda and history and would by stepping into conversation when he think he have something to say. As the story will proceed you will be getting more informations from their past and from time to time they will ask you to help them. The story is really great and with twists and stuffs that make RPG good RPG. It will lead you to different planets each is completely different world with own culture, flora, fauna and inhabitants. Main quest is pretty long and there is also lot of side quests I spent 40 h on first play through. The game have good repeatability as you can choose if you are going to complete quests with affliction to light or dark side of the Force plus there are also different possibilities how to solve problems based on yours skill as persuading, stealth, repair, computers, demolition each have its own use an there is now skill that would be there just for numbers as it in many games. The fighting system is intuitive. Fights with easier opponents may feel bit dull, but at least they are quick. You are able to use different items as grenades, mines  stimulants, different skills for shooting and melee  weapons and also force powers as stun, push-back or throwing your lightsaber.
<br>Graphic is pretty good and in full HD resolution still look really good as this from 2003. I think this is one of the best RPG ever made a have all those things that nowadays sand box RPG lack depth, emotions you really like some characters and you don&apos;t do quests just for money, but you really wan&apos;t to help somebody or stop that bad guy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=3223047">Expand</a></span>

Sure it&apos;s a bit dated, with a more primitive NPC dialogue system, and the graphics are a little out of date. But this game still holds up. You can mix and match party members for different fighting styles, talk to your NPC companions which are well written and feel like real people. I do have a few gripes about it though, the customization is a bit lacking, you choose from a set of heads, then you choose from 3 different classes, which don&apos;t really matter because you&apos;re forced to become a Jedi. Blasters are pretty much useless, because you&apos;re forced to use a light sabre. I feel if this game got an HD remake, with combat like Dragon Age, along with the character customization, better NPC interactions, and more items to mix and match, it would be a near perfect game. The story in this game is amazing, it has a major plot twist that you wouldn&apos;t expect. No matter the flaws of this game, it will always be one of my favourite games of all time. It&apos;s a must buy for any Star Wars or RPG fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=2589552">Expand</a></span>

Every game I play I try to rate on a scale of zero to SW: KOTOR. It will probably blow your mind too. This game has everything you want in a game: a terrific and immersing story-line, top notch voice-acting, a unique type of mechanics, and beautiful, memorable graphics. The game isn&apos;t a game that you finish in mere hours. You can spend days playing this game. That might be a con to some, but to me that just means you get to enjoy the game for a long time. All of the characters have great and easily identifiable personalities. There are different paths you can choose with your party members, so choose wisely. The game is played as a third-person turn-based RPG. Don&apos;t get frightened by turn-based, because it can be both fast and slow. It also helps you out by auto-pausing at different times (such as an enemy sighted). It&apos;s really easy to understand and different from other games. In addition to all of that, the graphics are amazing, especially for a game made just eight years ago! I really hope if you are planning to get this game you enjoy this as much as I did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=2486730">Expand</a></span>

You build your very own Jedi, hang around at pubs and drink beer :D travel around and search for components to build up lightsabers... MANY opportunities.

<br>If they made a new game like this one these days, Metascritic would go crazy about this game ;D for real. It brings good memories.</span>

If you don&apos;t like Star Wars or never cared for it, and want a solid RPG, this is your ticket. If you like Star Wars and have been a fan for who knows how long, then nobody has done anything greater in the gaming industry for you than this. Play this game. It&apos;s a masterpiece, it&apos;s well written, loads of fun, and not only that, but you can mod the game with mods from Filefront and add tons more replay value to it. You&apos;re not just staring at a game my friends; you&apos;re staring at an exquisite work of art.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=2829408">Expand</a></span>

Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is, and has been since I first finished it, my absolute favorite game. For ten years, this game, despite all of the other awesome and fantastic games I have played, still manages to be number one. Why? Because this game has what any game should, both quality and quantity.
<br>
<br>I remember picking this game up on my Xbox for the first time. I didn&#x2019;t know what to expect. I have been a Star Wars fan forever, since I saw the first movies. It was praised by critics and reviewers, so I figure I would try it. Little did I know that I would be playing a game that would inspire so many good memories in me.
<br>
<br>I&#x2019;ll start with the meat of the game&#x2014;the storyline.  This is probably one of the best stories I have ever experienced. It flows quite easily and was very immersive. This game introduced me to the whole &#x201C;Old Republic&#x201D; era of Star Wars, and as of now it is actually my favorite. This game introduces you to a story that you will love and really get involved in. It also gives you choice, such as a multitude of dialogue options which can affect the game in the end. I&#x2019;m always a fan of the option to give as much choice as possible to players. There is also a very surprisingly plot twist at the near-end of the game which really makes the story pop.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is also great. It&#x2019;s sort of a fast-paced turn-based style of combat. I feel the difficulties are pretty balanced, none too easy and none too hard. The level up system is alright, but can be made better with mods (which I will discuss later on). The different skills and whatnot are very helpful throughout the game, such as Computer Use which allows you to hack into terminals and do a variety of things or Repair where you can repair broken droids to assist you in combat in that area. Combat is just very smooth and I was very happy with how they brought lightsaber battles to light.
<br>
<br>The graphics are, in my opinion, really good for its time. You won&#x2019;t be seeing HD textures or Skyrim-quality graphics, but really in 2003 there were few games that actually looked as good as KOTOR. But even today, it&#x2019;s not all that bad looking. Planets are pretty good looking and heads for models are detailed.
<br>
<br>This game really shines on the PC, and the reason why is because you can mod it. The KOTOR Filefront has thousands of mods which you can easily install to improve the game, either gameplay-wise or cosmetic-wise. I love it when a game has modding capabilities, and BioWare was kind enough to make this game easily moddable. I always mod it when I play it and it makes gameplay even better than it is vanilla.
<br>
<br>This game is a standard for all role-playing games. This is what a role-playing game should feel like, fun and never boring. It&#x2019;s a must have in my opinion if you like stories and Star Wars both. I have so much nostalgia when I replay this game. I hope you all love this game as much as I have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=3162940">Expand</a></span>

You get an incredibly engrossing story with tons of customization. This means you get tons of different feats, powers, equipment, weapons, etc. to use at your disposal, along with three classes to choose from at the start. With so many side quests to do and decisions to make (leading you towards the light side or dark side, with multiple endings too), no single playthrough will be the same. That&apos;s really saying something especially considering that the game is about 40 hours long, so there&apos;s definitely some very hefty replay value.
<br>
<br>The way that Bioware let us be who we are as a person (all set in the glorious Star Wars universe) is simply astounding. There are tons of planets to visit, and it&apos;s pretty amazing to see all of them come to life. There are tons of characters to talk to on each planet; some can give you advice, some gamble, some give you quests, while others will even fight you. Many characters (particularly my party members) are extremely memorable  like the fan favorite HK-47, for example. I found myself become very attached to some, and the interaction is basically limitless. By the way, the voice acting (which you&apos;ll be hearing quite a bit) is incredible. The lip syncing is pretty good as well. And of course, the graphics are great, especially for the time.
<br>
<br>This is an RPG, so you will continuously get stronger, and I felt extremely powerful by the end. The fighting system is excellent. Basically, you choose the moves you want to perform before fighting and the battle plays out in real-time. A die is rolled in order to decide whether your attack will land or not. All in all, it works very well. Everything is pretty smooth, and I didn&apos;t encounter many glitches. If you&apos;re going to buy it on Steam, be wary of playing it on Windows 7, as there could potentially be TONS of glitches.
<br>
<br>All in all, this is a groundbreaking, near-perfect game that will forever stand the test of time. In my mind, it will probably be considered a classic in a few years from now. It&apos;s that good. If you haven&apos;t played this Bioware masterpiece yet, then GO PLAY IT NOW. Even if you&apos;re not a Star Wars fan. You&apos;ll love every bit and will never forget it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=3196450">Expand</a></span>

Maybe a bit too easy on normal difficulty, and sometimes a bit lengthy due to a lot of running around in the same areas, but still one of my all time favorites. The sequel is good, but not a match to this game.</span>

This game i feel is timeless my reasons being is it has superb story telling, character development, difficult choices, deep history, great voice acting and if you are hardcore about star wars it flushes out the universe so beautifully with a setting fresh and interesting. If enjoyed a more strategic combat than this has it, or you can adjust some setting to make it a little more fast pace. I have never played the PC version but this game is a must play its a classic that really pushed story telling to a whole new level.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=3681811">Expand</a></span>

Few games give as many choices, plot twists, and lovable characters. Sadly, I did get stuck and ended up looking up a quick guide, which ended up spoiling a bit plot twist.</span>

As a young Star Wars fan, when I started playing it, I was absolutely immersed in the story.  Since it takes place long before the movies, it brings about a new and interesting story.  Although not the best by today&apos;s standards, I still play it to this day.</span>

The RPG style gameplay works to perfection with an addicting leveling up system that makes you want to keep playing.</span>

You feel a true connection to them as their path is chosen by you, the player. Their story is yours to craft however you want. The graphics for this game, especially in the cut scenes, are phenomenal for it&apos;s time and some still stand up today. The story driven elements are perfectly suited to it&apos;s light side dark side karma-like mechanic. The combat system is very innovative allowing for strategy rather than charging opponents head on - very unique design. Gameplay is slick and easy, and there aren&apos;t enough words for how I would love to compliment this game. A very trademark game of Bioware. The best Star Wars video game ever and my all time favorite game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=4315641">Expand</a></span>

<br>the story makes you feel like you&apos;re part of it,
<br>the work that Old Bioware did here was a masterpiece,the characters are done brilliant,the Revan Plot twist was one of my biggest &apos;Wow&apos; moments in my gamer life,the story is done very well
<br>the gameplay is good for a RPG,the romance with Bastila was good and funny at the same time
<br>my favourite character was HK-47 with his dark humor
<br>suggestion:go buy it now with Kotor 2,this is what modern RPGs should take inspiration from.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=4399845">Expand</a></span>

I feel like this is one of the greatest RPG&apos;s of all time but that isn&apos;t nostalgia talking... (since this is my second time playing this game after a year first trying KOTOR.) I feel that this game deserves a place in the top 100 video games of all time.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll spare you the details but the major positives for this game are amazing character development, great story, good pacing and lots of actions and missions to play, with the interesting characters and missions you cannot help but take your sweet time enjoying what KOTOR has to offer. It&apos;s like the father of Mass Effect.. Even as a old game it&apos;s worth playing for the story and the plot twist is probably one of the greatest plot twists told in video game history and I&apos;m not overreacting when I say this. It also tells one of thr best star wars story even better then the orginal trilogy in terms of orginal story. Shame it has to be ruined by further star wars lore but that&apos;s a different story.
<br>
<br>Although the character development isn&apos;t as strong as Mass Effect and Dragon Age Origins which doesn&apos;t give you enough dialogue to appreciate the character. It was enough to give the character some back story. Shame that certain characters are favored, treating them with more dialogue options than the ladder which as I said disappoints me because some characters I felt like were more for cannon fodder rather than a buddy in your squad. (T3m4 and zallbar are some examples) The dialogue in KOTOR is also very black and white.. (aka Dark Side and Light Side) and also I felt like some dialogue whatever you choose led to the same dialogue outcome even without a dialogue change. The dialogue isn&apos;t strong like Mass Effect but strong enough to care about what&apos;s going on. But the characters comments throughout missions are intereating to hear which makes every encounter different then the last playthrough. Also story progresses very well... Pacing is great and even though the story is quite linear with the only big differences is in the end. I found the planets you explore was well thought out and fun to play through with levithan and taris being personal favourites, the only map I didin&apos;t like was the final area. Where the difficultly and final boss were suddenly difficult and tedious to play through if you didin&apos;t properly set up or built your character.
<br>
<br>Also a problem I have with this game is 2 things... 1 has to be the combat, it feels outdated... But it was the best combat for these types of rpgs where combat isn&apos;t just a point and click but it varies on dice rolls and different character builds. In the end thought it feels like I&apos;m playing baldur&apos;s gate which is okay and acceptable at times but it&apos;s sometimes can be tedious and undeniably punishing if you choose force powers/feats and skill points incorrectly. But rewarding if choose it correctly. So take your time and read through the descriptions and understand the game... otherwise you&apos;ll make a mistake forcing you to reset the game or continue because points cannot be reverted unless with a previous save. Also the game is poorly optimized for this generation of computer hardware... AMD&apos;s cards cannot even start the game without certain graphic settings turned off and the effects such as smoke, fog and explosions give me a drastic change in FPS dipping to the low 10&apos;s and in rare cases crashes the game. The game poorly runs even as a old game... I had older games run better than KOTOR so that&apos;s no excuse.
<br>
<br>I usually don&apos;t recommend games to anyone in my review but this will be an exception.... If you haven&apos;t played this game, play it. Even if you aren&apos;t a huge fan of star wars like me... Play this game right now... this game was a lot of fun. You will love everything about this game, sure it&apos;s a pain to setup on a new computer with windows 7 but it&apos;s honestly worth it. If you liked Star Wars or any other bioware game or if you like good rpgs... then play this game, you won&apos;t regret it. I stated before that this could be one of the greatest games ever... But this is for sure the best star wars game out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/user-reviews?user_review_id=6566156">Expand</a></span>
