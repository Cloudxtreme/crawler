The pitching system is undoubtedly fun, and very realistic. On opening day I had Pedro with 12 K&apos;s through 7, and when I brought him out in the 8th, I noticed it was getting harder and harder to place the ball, leading to two singles and my yanking of him. Fielding grounders has never been more fun, even diving for that fly ball can make your heart skip a beat. If you were to just give me the actualy gameplay, I would rate this game a 10.5/10. However, there are some drawbacks. Most notably is the absence of all players not registered with the MLBPA, Barry Bonds is one, and Kevin Millar is another. There are many more, this should not count against the score of the game however since none of the other games in the genre carry these players either. Another is the Dynasty Mode. At 120 years (ridiculous!), it can keep you playing for months. However, you are forced to play a 162 game schedule. You cannot set the length of the season, forcing you to use their &quot;Momentum&quot; meters. Pretty much, each game is rated in importance 1 to 10. The more important games you win, the more momentum you gain, the more momentum you gain, the better chance you win simulated games. Forcing you to simulate games against the tigers, devil rays, and reds and playing games against teh A&apos;s, Yanks and Braves. I wish you could have set a season length of 30 or 40 games (like in high heat), and just played out the entire season. Another fault is the complete lack of statistics. They keep stats during the season but not year to year. Therefore, at the beginning of your second season in dynasty mode, you cannot see how your players in your lineup faired the year before. This is a pure console port, they did not put anytime into upgrading the interface in the matter of statistics or the GUI. Weird things like having to click on a player, then hit the &quot;select&quot; button, and then select another player and then select the &quot;substitute&quot; button could have easily been redone. Overall, I think it&apos;s a game that will keep people coming back for the incredible gameplay it offers, I have never had more fun in game. It will not however satisfy my baseball Sim/Managing instincts. Its clunky interface makes it difficult and the lack of year to year stats makes the dynasty mode a little empty. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mvp-baseball-2004/user-reviews?user_review_id=374277">Expand</a></span>
