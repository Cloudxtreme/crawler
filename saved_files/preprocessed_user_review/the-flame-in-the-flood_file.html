<br>
<br>I like the mechanic that you can carry over items if you die because your dog &apos;survives&apos; and brings the backpack from the last survivor to your next character, but all in all I probably won&apos;t play the game anymore. It&apos;s fun and quick, but only for so long before it becomes VERY repetitive. And after I died a bit into the game because there was actually a dead end in the river after a camp (which I wasn&apos;t able to see before going that way) I became a bit frustrated.
<br>
<br>But to be honest, I&apos;m missing the scope and secrets of don&apos;t starve. In FITF I get the feeling that I&apos;m doing a routine every time and do not find anything interesting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-flame-in-the-flood/user-reviews?user_review_id=6815602">Expand</a></span>

In my opinion days are passing too fast and you&apos;re almost constantly wet or/and hungry, but what annoyed me the most are really rare checkpoints. I know it supposed to be a rogue-like but losing 2h of progress can be really frustrating. Sadly after few &quot;Game Overs&quot; it&apos;s getting boring and no storyline (or any kind of plot) makes it even worse.

The hunger decay is ridiculous, no one dies of starvation in 2 days, not even in &quot;Don&apos;t Starve&quot; . The randomness in the resources and location types turns the surviving theme into pure luck. Traps can&apos;t be reused, why? Do I really need to go to a specific type of camp to find bloody stone and a piece of wood? This kind of things make the game stupidly difficult.

It&apos;s a very refreshing take on survival game where rater than trying to survive in open world, you&apos;re trying to travel down a river on your raft, while visiting locations along the river for supplies. Game also has quite robust crafting system with multiple tools and crafting materials. Sounds great, right? Problem is - locations you&apos;ll get to visit are entirely random and there is no telling what you might find, and you can&apos;t go back since river flows only one way. So many times you&apos;ll start game, go trough several locations and parts of the river, and de before finding basic materials to craft even most basic tool. Game is difficult and punishing, and it&apos;s not bad. But thanks to randomness of resources there is no interaction with the game - you just collect everything and move on, hoping that at next spot you&apos;ll actually get something you need. If you don&apos;t mind game so heavily based around RNG, by all means, go for it, it&apos;s quite interesting. But in my opinion all interesting parts of this cool game gets drowned out by it&apos;s randomness,</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-flame-in-the-flood/user-reviews?user_review_id=6195025">Expand</a></span>

That said, my rating here misrepresents my initial feeling for the game with regard to some of the gameplay mechanics for which I&apos;m still trying to come to some kind of conclusion.
<br>
<br>The Flame in the Flood is a great game and deserves high marks, but I did find its unruly, randomized quality and steep learning curve prohibitively difficult and frustrating in the context of playing its campaign mode. While unexpected challenges in games like TFitF make for a fun and replayable experience overall that keeps you guessing about what you should do, how you need to compromise, and what you could change or bring with you for the next playthrough (not unlike FTL), it&apos;s been pretty maddening so far, not really being able to fully enjoy what I imagine is a basic storyline thrown over with fun mystery and atmosphere.
<br>
<br>And all of this might boil down to some kind of anterior randomness that clumps up playthroughs somewhere along the process of playing. I found myself in the middle of few playthroughs on the easiest setting relatively prepared but ultimately out of luck with regard to the resources, essentially trapped watching myself starve to death or pass out from exhaustion floating down the river because, hey, that&apos;s just how that particular game disproportionately shook out. Maybe there wasn&apos;t enough food. Maybe you couldn&apos;t find building supplies. Hell, maybe there were just too many wolves and warthogs. Frankly, the normal game is so difficult, it&apos;s hard for me to imagine the harder difficulty to be all that playable.
<br>
<br>All of that said, the game is refreshingly ambitious and cinematic. The art direction is strong, offering a brightly visual look at a game world that is honest and vaguely literary. The sound design also hits hard, helping to generate expansive environments that play with your sense of safety and alarm. Even the game&apos;s overall difficulty, which can certainly be prohibitive, seems to take on a charming quality, part of a larger, wild idea, a force with a real soul to it and not entirely unlike the wolves that threaten to tear you down.
<br>
<br>Great game, great courage in development, and a fun experience for more hardy gamers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-flame-in-the-flood/user-reviews?user_review_id=6134928">Expand</a></span>

<br>hurt by procedural generation
<br>Flame in the Flood is a rogue like survival game where you play as a woman named scout who&#x2019;s accompanies by a companion either asop or daisy
<br>There are 2 modes here, a campaign mode and an endless modes..
<br>Most of my issues with the game are exclusive to the campaign and are completely forgiven for endless mode&#x2026;
<br>Mostly that in the campaign you&#x2019;re at the mercy of procedural generation&#x2026;
<br>you would think this would be a hand crafted and balanced journey down the river while endless mode would offer a randomized challenge&#x2026; but no.. both are completely random&#x2026;
<br>In this game you collect items to use as food, hydration, clothes to keep you warm, items to craft medical supplies and try to make your way down the river through the 10 different regions&#x2026;
<br>The challenge is balance&#x2026;
<br>Your nutrition drains by the second so you have to carefully choose when to stop at a location or when to keep going&#x2026;
<br>Are you desperate for food? Stop at a farm
<br>sleep deprived or cold? Find a fire and shelter... raft taking too much damage?
<br>pray you&#x2019;ve found bolts and wood to repair or upgrade it&#x2026;
<br>The problem is this is less about strategy and planning and more of a desperate search for items you need in the moment&#x2026;
<br>And again you&#x2019;re at the mercy of procedural generation&#x2026;
<br>There is no balance of supplies.. you aren&#x2019;t guaranteed to get what you need from stopping at places  that typically have those supplies&#x2026;
<br>Especially medical supplies&#x2026;
<br>MY first playthrough I had none, I had scratches and broken bones from running into enemies like boars and wolves and no way to fix them as I never ran into a drug store or was lucky enough to run into supplies to craft items while in my 2nd playthrough I was swimming in bandages alcohol and crutches&#x2026;
<br>I feel this campaign would be miles better if it was more about managing than it was getting lucky&#x2026;
<br>Instead the campaign only offers an end goal and a few npc characters to find&#x2026;
<br>And if you do get lucky finding tons of food and other supplies it isn&#x2019;t going to matter as the inventory is a joke&#x2026;
<br>Slightly increased by the pack of your companion who also barks near items you can pick up or search as well as your raft&#x2026;
<br>But it isn&#x2019;t nearly enough to feel like you&#x2019;re doing anything more than scrounging&#x2026;
<br>All of this would&#x2019;ve been fine in the endless mode as its own thing&#x2026;
<br>But a campaign with no balance and just as luck based is a problem&#x2026;
<br>Poor campaign mode but as a survival game its beautiful to look at and a pretty decent challenge&#x2026;
<br>I give The Flame in the Flood
