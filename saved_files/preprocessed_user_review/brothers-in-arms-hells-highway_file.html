The game was also longer than I expected which was nice. This game is a great improvement over previous BoH games and I really enjoyed it. This time around the FPS elements are improved and the squad AI is awesome in my opinion. Any low scores say to me either bad hardware was used or the person is just sick of WWII games. I highly recommend this game!

The good things are definitely the story, it&apos;s just epic and finally crushes games like Call of Duty that are just brainless shooters. Hell&apos;s Highway shows the player a deeper meaning into it and the Nazi-Germans are for once shown like a force to be reckoned with, not cannon fodder. I will not reveal anything about it, all I can say is that the singleplayer alone is worth playing. The multiplayer is also great, finally you have to advance carefully. With no respawns, you can&apos;t just rush in to kill the enemy, often you will die. Because of that, noobs will often get pissed off, but serious gamers will love this game. Thanks to that cover system, it looks more like a real war simulator, making this far better than games like Call of Duty. There are some bad things about it, though, Online is just terrible with connections. Normally, I have no lag at all in multiplayer games. In this game, it keeps going on, and on, and on. When most people host a server, nobody can even join it, meaning that only a few people are able to host resulting in just a few online servers, which is really sad because it&apos;s a good game. However, what&apos;s also sad is that multiplayer features only a few maps and a single game mode, meaning that you can hardly experience the game any differently. It&apos;s understandable that many people dislike the game for that, but in my personal opinion that one game mode is actually a great one. My conclusion, you can clearly see that this game had a lot of work put into it, so it is really worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-hells-highway/user-reviews?user_review_id=421643">Expand</a></span>

<br>
as for the game, the plot is pretty sweet and the gameplay is great it takes the duck and cover from gears and perfects it in a world war 2 setting great tactical combat, enjoy it, buy a console version though much nicer using a pad</span>

Once you complete an objective, you do get a feeling of accomplishment, (and a save checkpoint. . .whew!) This is not, and not meant to be a Call of Duty clone. If that&apos;s the game you&apos;re looking for, then stay away. I love the CoD series, but it is an arcade game compared to BIAHH. In this game you feel more attached to your squad mates, and absolutely must utilize them in order to be effective on the battlefield. I actually did feel guilty when one of my assault squad members got killed after I gave a move order. The slo-mo kill cam for getting headshots is over the top, but really gives you a satisfying, &quot;take that you Nazi bastard&quot; moment. Graphics are good using the Unreal 3 engine and shouldn&apos;t tax most current PCs. The sound is excellent. While the WWII shooter has been done to death, this title is reason to go back to the well one more time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-hells-highway/user-reviews?user_review_id=418131">Expand</a></span>

A few complaints: The AI could have been smarter since they never move from their spots. Online is kind of buggy but playable. You can&apos;t go prone, which would really help with things like machine guns. Overall, a must get.</span>

And stop compairing it to the likes of COD its not suppose to be like them, infact its about tactics more than being a FPS. Yes that means you have to use your brain and thing about how to out flank and eliminate the enemy. Unlike the COD games which is a typical FPS, dont get me wrong the COD games are good and have got better over the years, but you cannot compair those to this. TBH I only rate it 8/10 but Im giving it the extra to make it up for all those who gave it silly low score for very poor reasons. Buy it if you like realism over arcade style play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-hells-highway/user-reviews?user_review_id=421206">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I absolutely loved this game. I loved hill 30, and this was amazing! The troops are a lot smarter and the game is simply amazing on all points. I would like to see the old, bloody difficult, shaky aiming like the old game. Other than that, I loved everything about and was extremely swallowed by the story line. I can&apos;t wait for the next installment! Please reveal it this E3!</span>

Either way it got boring for me after 15 hours, but don&apos;t let me stop you,if you want to waste your money,go right ahead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-hells-highway/user-reviews?user_review_id=422696">Expand</a></span>

The game crashes to desktop and gives bizarre errors right after the intro movie to the single player campaign (&quot;Previously on Brothers in Arms&quot;). I&apos;ve tried everything I could find in forums across the internet, to no avail. Judging from the amount of posts from others with problems, this game is seriously defective and full of bugs. When I tried to get support from Ubisoft, they basically told me to get bent. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if there is a patch out soon that Ubisoft stole from some pirate group (just like they did with the new Rainbow Six, where they released a no-CD patch from a warez group). I&apos;ll never waste my money on another Ubisoft game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-hells-highway/user-reviews?user_review_id=419021">Expand</a></span>

With the over saturation of FPS games from huge companies, I decided to play a gamed I missed a few years back. I&apos;ve played previous installments in the BIA series but never played this one. I have to say that it is a very refreshing game when everyone else wants to play COD with horrible stories. This game has a great story, decent combat but poor AI. However, it is an older game so the AI might not be on par with 2012 games but it&apos;s worth a play through. Only issues I have with the game is the poor AI (all you have to do is pick up a KAR98 and pick off their heads when they look from behind cover), and historical inaccuracy. But if you&apos;re sick of the COD type games nowadays give this a play through and you&apos;ll have some fun you wouldn&apos;t have expected.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-hells-highway/user-reviews?user_review_id=2859049">Expand</a></span>

The only issue i have is that the game is not optimized for CrossfireX Configuration, and was a pain ti play even with the V-Sync on.</span>

<br>
<br>And the graphic is great, especially the landscape and when scooping down. The cutscene is better than the game, though.
<br>
<br>The atmosphere is awesome, this game tells us that war isn&apos;t funny, it&apos;s a hell.
<br>
<br>100-th review btw :P</span>

Sure it may not be as bad as the Mobile games but it doesn&apos;t have the excuse of being on a weak platform with touch controls. Hell&apos;s Highway should have been a good game. Road to Hill 30 and Earned in Blood did amazing things for the time, told a great story, had new and interesting gameplay, and the most intelligent AI I&apos;ve ever seen. Hell&apos;s Highway on the other hand tells a nonsensical cliche story, has extremely watered down gameplay with elements that I can&apos;t even begin to understand why they were put in, and AI that serves as more of a placeholder for the squad you used to have.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s start with graphics and sound design. This is probably the only good thing this game did and made me enjoy some moments. The guns all look and sound nice and the terrain is bright and colorful which works in a World War 2 setting. The game even takes some of the original audio clips from the first game to go through and show you what&apos;s happened so far and seeing some scenes from two of my favorite games remastered was nice. However, what isn&apos;t nice is some of the new voice clips. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s just me, but some of the early scenes in the game have such poor audio quality when anyone talks. But this went away after a while.
<br>
<br>The gameplay COULD have been good, if it wasn&apos;t hampered but newly shoved in mechanics and poor world design. Sure, the map is pretty but small and corridor like. The finally added sprinting into the game which was a minor annoyance during the old series but I&apos;d rather go back to jogging around constantly any day than have to deal with the HORRIBLE cover system. No longer are you hunkering behind cover manually praying the enemy doesn&apos;t hit you and every now and then standing up to return fire. No, now you run up to any piece of compatible cover, press q, and attach yourself to the wall and activate third person mode. This removes your ability to aim down sights. I say that again, in a series which is heralded as being the most realistic around you switch to third person mode and it removes your iron sights forcing you to either guess where your bullets are going or go back and re-enable the crosshair (which is turned off forcefully in authentic mode). I don&apos;t understand this. It makes the game SO MUCH WORSE. Sure you can still crouch manually behind cover but doing so will have enemies practically lock on to your skull and your screen with constantly be bathed in red as you aren&apos;t sure whether you are dying or just suppressed. The map design and AI are also garbage. A typical battle is you and your squad(s) standing at a location as waves of Germans come from the same few locations, run to the same cover, and die as you stand behind them. Then when you are done fighting in this little corridor you run through the German lines not into more Germans BUT INTO YOUR OWN MEN. The maps are small and a far cry from the old gameplay which had multiple avenues in which you could handle the mission, now your hand is guided to make sure you do the same flanking maneuver over and over again. It&apos;s boring beyond belief. I can&apos;t say much for the AI. It&apos;s stupid, and the enemy doesn&apos;t try to flank it spends most of it&apos;s time either running away when cover is destroyed, sitting around returning fire, or charging you. No flanking nothing, not that it matters. Your squad AI is just as stupid and in my experience fails to miss German enemies which stand around in the open.
<br>
<br>But the story, the story was so amazing in the earlier games. In Road to Hill 30 you marched your way through Normandy in a slog, and Baker was forced to harden himself and lead his men as **** hit the fan and his friends died before him. In Earned in Blood you get to see Baker deal with mental breakdowns and have to deal with taking the place of a fallen comrade as Hartstock. In Hell&apos;s Highway everything is just peachy. Baker no longer seems to really be bothered by the events of previous games and just continues on as normal. The men are no longer at all concerned with taking on the massive Wehrmacht but instead acts like stereotypical jock-esque soldiers. Who love to joke around. There is so much more I can say about how boring and stupid everything is but I&apos;m running out of characters.
<br>
<br>Overall, Hell&apos;s Highway deserves a 4 out of 10, a few points for the graphics and sounds but everything else forces me to dock it points for horrendous gameplay mechanics and an awful story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/brothers-in-arms-hells-highway/user-reviews?user_review_id=7491353">Expand</a></span>

But the worst part about this game is the squad. Seven people will take 2 minutes to kill one man. It&apos;s easier to do everything by yourself because your squad is God awful. Which sucks because this game has pretty good squad mechanics.</span>
