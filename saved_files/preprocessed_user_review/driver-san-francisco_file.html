For most parts the execution is quite well. The map is huge and fun to bash across, the car park features over 100 various models from a last few decades, including lots of classics and muscle cars, and the soundtrack makes for a brilliant mood with a superb choice of over 70 songs ranging from funk and soul to alternative rock and light electronic music, shining with names such as Aretha Franklin, the Beastie Boys, DJ Shadow, Jamiroquai, Queens Of The Stone Age and The Black Keys. Other outstanding features are 70s style car chase special missions and a variety of stunt challenges. Some things however put a few dirty spots on the otherwise great picture. The career missions are often bland chases or escapes and the story, full of generic characters, seems to go nowhere, making the side missions more interesting than the main ones; many of the cars handle exactly alike, and the AI traffic can be quite stupid at times. The game is still good for one or two complete playthroughs and fans of the open world racing genre might find themselves addicted to simply racing through the city. Overall a pretty solid title and a turn for the good for the Driver series after multiple rather disappointing titles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=2049191">Expand</a></span>

I expected it to be like the last two. I didn&apos;t watch trailers or reviews I just went straight to playing the game. So, here&apos;s me thinking this game is going to suck really bad.<br>I began playing and already felt like the handling sucked. Driving around, feeling like the game is seriously limited. The voice acting so bad, it made me cringe.<br>I stuck to it for a little longer when the game began to change. I was shocked. Completely stunned by what was happening. I was overwhelmed and got goosebumps it was so different.<br>I did not expect to be able to jump from your car into another, in such a quick space of time. Control the cars on the road as you race, blocking other racers and opening clear paths for yourself just made this game something else. No other game is like this. It&apos;s fantastic. Incredibly unique. The more I played, the more fun I had. I began to get used to the driving and figured out that it was the handling you had to get used to. The voice acting began to make sense. Cheesyness was the best way to play it. The game all began to fit together and make sense to me.<br>So yes, I completely changed my view on this game after playing, and it was awesome.<br>I would highly advise people to play this game! No matter what you think of it before playing, just do it, it&apos;s worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=1849194">Expand</a></span>

You have a variety of events all available for you to choose, which you want to complete, because you have to complete some to progress the story. I personally completed all the events, cause I enjoyed the gameplay very much! :)
<br>The graphics are top-notch. Of course you see some lazy-cheezy designed work, but only if you stop to look at it. It&apos;s not a problem since you&apos;ll be driving at huge speeds all the time :D
<br>The mechanics are just mind-boggling! I mean load a portion of a city in half a second, and then suddenly SHIFT and load the whole other part of the city in half a second as well? Whoah, LOVE IT!
<br>Music is made specifically to resemble the 70s era, and there&apos;s a variety of songs for everyone to choose from, since you can always change the song.
<br>The cutscenes are a mix of CGI / In-game material. How did they were able to implement such a technology, I don&apos;t know, that&apos;s why the cut scenes always look great.
<br>

Since then, I found a fix on YouTube which involved copying, pasting and renaming one of the &apos;Input&apos; subfolders for Logitech devices within the install directories. It takes seconds to do and Ubisoft, frankly, should really be doing this sort of thing themselves. My initial response from Ubisoft helpdesk was equally lazy, &quot;...nowhere in the game&apos;s specification does it say anything about steering wheels or pedals...&quot; Eh??!!!!
<br>All this is a real shame, since now that I am able to play the game with my steering wheel, several solid days of tearing around the city, dipping in and out the storyline for some manic freeplay, I actually love it. I think the graphics are beautiful, driving physics have a pleasing feel to them, sound is spot on... Sitting inside a car, tearing down a narrow street, demolishing roadside objects, pedestrians diving out of the way, police trying to ram you off the road... well, it&apos;s thrilling to say the least. Gameplay gets a bit samey if you expect to do other stuff apart from drive... basically it&apos;s all about driving. It reminds me of a more driving-focused GTA. That&apos;s fine with me as I am a driving game enthusiast and I definitely think this is one of the best if you can get the controls to work properly. Come on Ubisoft, more PC users deserve to get the best out of this fantastic piece of work. Would have been 9/10 if not for the hassle with the controls. Even now, I have to reassign all the wheel axis/buttons every time I start the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=2020401">Expand</a></span>

The graphics and sound are great. The main storyline is pretty good as well. The missions are also done pretty well. The one gripe I have is you have to do some kind of work around to get ti to work with a dual action logitech controller, but I haven&apos;t done that yet. The control keys are pretty easy to use. The arrow keys, space bar, and sometimes the mouse (for looking around). The open driving experience I havent found elsewhere and I&apos;ve been gaming for 25+ years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=2535239">Expand</a></span>

Great, innovative idea. First thing I though about is whether I would be able to shift into a truck (from opposite direction) while chasing a suspect. xD And it worked! That was refreshing. Plenty of diverse challenges and dares. After some remapping, controls and general mechanics are intuitive and well though out. It got out much better than I expected.<br>Car models are solid, graphics a bit dated and rough but ok, music and sound are brilliant.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769197">Expand</a></span>

So we have great graphics, nice choice of cars and a big, stunning map plus a lot of challenges and all sorts of diversions. And the idiotic storyline, which makes even 10 year old ask, WTF? The map is big, but the world is not opened. I&apos;m far from telling you why - you&apos;ll have to judge that by yourself. Driver SF is a fun game, but it&apos;s not a game changer, and withing a couple of months, gamers will forget about it. It offers what most gamers take for granted - the SHIFT gameplay is definitely a great invention, but it can&apos;t carry the title to the gold. The game gets boring after 2 days of playing, and in today&apos;s reality, you really expect more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=1767907">Expand</a></span>

Second, if you have an AMD graphics card you will get a lock of 24Hz in full screen so you have to use Fake Fullscreen software to combat this. Third, the in-game graphics are the most pathetic I&apos;ve seen even on max. Fourth, the driving mechanics are amongst the most ancient and lifeless I&apos;ve ever come across. Fifth, various problems with starting the game. Sixth, it doesn&apos;t do what a driving game should. Eight, too many cutscenes for a racing game. Need I go on? The only thing I can possibly give credit to is the facial detail in cutscenes and that it&apos;s actually trying to do a &apos;Starsky and Hutch&apos; style story, something you don&apos;t see in newer racing games. But seriously, if you want a decent game like this either play Starsky and Hutch or Midtown Madness 2 SE. At least with Midtown Madness 2, you know the game has been made by professionals (Rockstar San Diego, published by Microsoft). Driver San Fransisco not only has horrible controls, laughable graphics and driving physics, but also poorly optimised for PC. Unless you have zero experience with racing games you can&apos;t possibly think these driving mechanics are acceptable. Sure, you get interior view but what&apos;s the use if you can&apos;t have manual transmission and the animations and graphics are shockingly bad?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=3123988">Expand</a></span>

I messed around with Driver back in the day, but never spent too much time on it, later I tried the horrible Driv3r and hated it with a passion. My cousins and I would take turns during the missions and apparently beating them was a matter of luck more so than skill. Needless to say, we didn&apos;t beat that game and probably didn&apos;t get too far either. Now Driver SF is out and I find that it has what many contemporary games lack: FUN! Sure, you may complain that the keyboard input sucks, but then it usually does when you mix cars and a keyboard; it may have limited graphical options, but that should not matter as much as actual gameplay; it may not be the best looking game, but then again we&apos;re talking about Driver, a game that clearly knows its limits. Driver SF is also limited to vehicles only (no walking) and also has the craziest plot device ever: the Shift mechanism. But with all these flaws, the game delivers. The Shift idea may be insane but it works, its fun and it adds a whole new dimension to what would be a boring linear gameplay experience. I played Deus Ex HR, I completed it, and I immediately removed it from my computer; I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever play it again because at some point I just finished it for the sake of doing so, not because I was having fun. Duke Nukem Forever, well, I didn&apos;t last more than 30 minutes playing it. Warhammer Space Marine? Tried the demo and couldn&apos;t see myself playing it for too long either. Driver SF, on the other hand, has already swallowed 4 hours of my life (I had a hard time putting the game down) and not a single minute was dull. The game itself works, the story works, the cars work, the shift mechanism works, missions are no longer im-freaking-possible. The game mechanics are few, but they are simple, sweet, easy to learn and fun to use. Now, it is true that you cannot customize your cars, which is a bummer since it would&apos;ve added a lot to gameplay, but you&apos;re going to spend a lot of time driving other people&apos;s cars so the use of mods would&apos;ve been limited. It&apos;s also nice that every car (that I have encountered) is a real-life car. Also, I&apos;ve never been to San Francisco and perhaps it would have been neat if the game was more true-to-life, but when designing a level, gamemakers have to be very careful and plan every single aspect so that the gameplay is fluid, this and technology limitations are probably the reason why it&apos;s not the real life SF.<br>In conclusion, if you want an in-depth driving simulator, a shooter, a super epic triple A title, then Driver SF is not for you; however if you want to sit back, have tons of fun and enjoy hilarious conversations that occur when you jump into a stranger&apos;s car, then Driver SF is a delightful little title that will turn sunrise into sundown without you taking notice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769249">Expand</a></span>

And if you&apos;re anything like me, you, too, should have been shaken and appalled by just how horrible a game Parallel Lines truly was. And thus, if you&apos;re anything like me, you should be wondering: Does D:SF live up to the series name?<br><br>Sadly, most of you are not like me. So here&apos;s a quick recap of the Driver series: Driver is a franchise revolved around one core element - that which TV Tropes notes to be &quot;Badass Driver&quot;. Sure, over time there have been some side-elements like a GTA-style gunplay mechanic, but in conclusion, if a Driver game cannot be described as &quot;Protagonist Drives An Assortment Of Cars At High Speed In A City&quot;, it&apos;s not worthy to be called Driver.<br><br>And with that little description, Driver: San Francisco falls into our lap. And at the second intro movie, where we&apos;re treated to the angelic sound of an old-school V8 revving its engine in aplomb, it&apos;s already faintly obvious: This. Is. Driver.<br><br>And right from the get-go, the fun starts. You are John Tanner, a cop with an awesome haircut and an even more awesome 1970 Dodge Challenger. Wait, don&apos;t cringe just yet! Yes, it is an old car. And yes, it still steers similar to a ship, BUT! The developers have kept one thing in mind: The super-effective tool of the deities knows as the E-Brake. And with this.... Old School becomes Very Cool indeed.<br><br>And Old School is not the only option you have, either. While loving your E-Brake like a pedophile loves little children on your keyboard (Yes, this game DOES play decently on a keyboard), you&apos;ll be spinning, drifting, ramping and overtaking with cars ranging from the Hudson Hornet to the &apos;67 Mustang Fastback to the Audi S5 to the Alfa 8C, all the way to the McLaren MP4-12C. And each of these cars is brilliantly portrayed in this dream re-enactment of San Francisco. The Bentley Arnage requires you mash your directional arrows through your desk, while the McLaren will pull away with such speed that you will push yourself back into your chair. Each of the cars is painstakingly detailed and reacts much like their real-life counterparts - and each of them does so without the need of a rich boy&apos;s toys like an Xbox controller or wireless wheel.<br><br>Most of the sounds are exquisite. The aforementioned Challenger makes one turn off the in-game music just to hear that sweet V8 roar as you storm off, and the other screechers like the McLaren are just as lovely on the ear. The music stations are a refreshing add-on to the game, eschewing the bizarre antics of GTA&apos;s more ludicrous stations in return for some genuinely nice tunes. The tires sound exactly as they do in real life when they spin, especially when varying horses are pushed through with each car. The voices, for the most part, are very well portrayed - Jericho sounds exactly like a smug villain should, and Tobias Jones&apos; voice actor delivers a performance of pure gold in this game. My only objection is Tanner&apos;s voice - during the in-car conversations he&apos;s okay, mediocre at best. But in cutscenes... He has this swagger, this exaggeration to his voice that just doesn&apos;t fit a protagonist - something that hinders me each time he opens his mouth.<br><br>Of course, as brilliant as this game is, it is far from flawless - Most of the missions are repetitive later in the game, and certain Stunt Dares are downright ludicrous - overtaking 40 cars in 60 seconds becomes VERY difficult later on. The storyline is also a tad stale - its basically a long, drawn out version of a predictable GTA mission, and Tanner&apos;s voice actor doesn&apos;t lighten that load one bit.<br><br>Other than the tedious side-missions later in the game, Driver: San Francisco offers what appears to be one of the most solid driving experiences of the year. Brilliant driving, great engine notes, beautiful environments and lovingly detailed cars makes this one a game for any racing gamer - period.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=2060360">Expand</a></span>

A lot of variety. Great city streets and atmosphere (and you can NEVER hit anybody, all pedestrians are 2 fast 4 U!). Great feeling in the cars (150 of them). Very different characteristics. Actually, far too many, so that you dont really need or have time to do anything with most of them unless you merely drive around, Oh, and by the way, you ALWAYS get some points for driving around and doing whatever stunts you like, even when not on any specific missions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=1852921">Expand</a></span>

Especially because they have so many licensed cars there. Of course it doesn,t get close to a GTA or a MAFIA II in terms of entertainment, as it&apos;s only car driving stuff but it is serious fun , expecially the shifting. There is a lot of humour in the cut scenes and dialogs which add to the fun. The story telling is very good, and you can see this was made for road-movies lovers. The keyboard controls are a bit hard but with a pad it&apos;s ok. With a wheel it&apos;s rubbish.

Just thought I should mention I love old car chase movies which probably affects my score somewhat! Anyway, this beats all the other Drivers into a **** hat. The driving model is superb - really fun and exhilarating to drive, realistic enough to be challenging but not too realistic to be annoying. The plot is pretty far fetched but so much more interesting than pretty much every other game of it&apos;s type, probably even GTA which can get a bit staid. The jumping mechanic is really cleverly done and adds so much to the game and removes annoying bits in such games as if you smash your car up you just jump into another one but it doesn&apos;t feel like cheating at all. The plot really grabs you and it&apos;s all served up in a 70&apos;s style cop setting which is very well done. The icing on the cake is the bunch of old car chases from films complete with cars and driver models (ie starsky and hutch, bullitt etc. etc.). 10/10 game, one of the best/most engrossing I&apos;ve ever played. Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=2308778">Expand</a></span>

Driver absolutely delivers in how the cars handle and the physics of the vehicles. Each car is different and unique in how it drives. The physics are impressive, cars feel like they have weight to them and burnouts and crashes are satisfying. Cop chases are very fun, especially considering that you can pick to either be a cop or an escapee. There is also racing (street racing) and other COOL driving challenges (lots and lots of em). The only downside is that the crashes and damage could be a bit more extreme (hopefully they will do it in the next game), for example no matter how fast you do a head on collision in a brand new car you will always drive away (with like 10% health in some cases), when in reality a car should be a heap of bent metal. Also in free-drive mode cops always have Corvette and Charger cop cars available (along with the regulars) so you basically have no chance at getting away if you picked a classic to ride. Although I must point out that there are many movie and other challenges that involve you riding a classic (old school charger, camaro ss, mustang fastback, etc... dukes of hazzard anyone or smokie and the bandit?? YES! these movie challenges are here) while escaping from old-school cops.<br><br>(9/10) REPLAYABILITY: If you love driving, then you will love this game and play it when you want to do some crazy driving.<br><br>CONCLUSION: I recommend you get this game if you love driving games. Driver is not like Need for Speed and Burnout, in this game the cars handle realistically somewhat and places Driver in whole other category of driving games. This game is a mix of arcade gameplay with semi-simulator driving physics and controls. So if you can handle your virtual cars from spinning while doing awesome drifts and burnouts then this game is for you!!!<br><br>TOTAL SCORE 9/10<br><br>(if you suck at &quot;driving&quot; go get Ridge Racer Unbounded which is also fun but a whole other game completely)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=2429766">Expand</a></span>

Cant even play the game because it puts a black border around the whole game making the viewing window very small on a big screen.  For anyone who enjoys gaming I would avoid this game.  it also has DRM from ubisoft on it which is known to ruin computers.</span>

<br>
<br>Also graphics are on top notch to be handled by DX9 every single part of the city, road, cars, crash, civilians, effects are all  well detailed ...
<br>
<br>This game is like having 3 in one; NF most wanted, something of Dirt 2, and something of mafia 2.
<br>
<br>I highly recommend it. I know Ubi soft has bad reputation to have screwed some games but this one, is not one of them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=3083966">Expand</a></span>

E.g. i followed enemy into an alley and he disappeared, then my partner said to go into the alley i was already in.<br><br>it just seems like they rushed a console-to-PC port and didn&apos;t bother with QA. wish i could get my money back :(<br><br>i would say if you aren&apos;t using the keyboard (you have a steering wheel or analog controller) and you don&apos;t care at all about the setting being completely fictional (not in San Francisco), and you don&apos;t care about small bugs then you might like the game. but i think most people will find it nearly unplayable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=1768386">Expand</a></span>

The Cinematics are cool, alot of Funny stuff happening, the Music is crap. They should input more than just one style of music in there, music in these types of games is what makes the player comfortable or not. Seriously, i am honestly sad. I preferred older Driver Titles. This one feels to Arcade to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=2199881">Expand</a></span>

What i dont like were the features like the crash action or throwing cars. Thats really stupid. Doesnt fit in this series. The story is also a bit crazy that could be much better.</span>

                                        <span>I love this game so much, it&apos;s very fun and has a lot of humor.
<br>using the keyboard is terrible because it&apos;s hard to turn just a little to the right or the left.
<br>but if you&apos;re using the controller it&apos;s much better.
<br>there are a few problems with the resolution that causes the game to crash, so configuring has to be done before starting the game.
<br>the story is awesome and i love it.

The second is more vaguely defined, but Driver: San Francisco fits the bill. It is surprisingly fun to play when compared to other driving games of late, such as the most recent Need For Speeds and Fuel. Realism is a secondary concern here. Though set in the present day, the plot, music and overall setting ooze the best elements of 1970&apos;s era cops-and-robbers television, and the cars have characteristics to match: roaring engines, spectacular burnouts and looooong four-wheel drifts. The jewel in this game&apos;s crown is the &quot;Shift&quot; mechanic, which murders the thing I hate most about driving games- the low margin of error. Say you&apos;re trying to stop a bad guy, but drift too wide around a turn and slam into a wall or oncoming truck. In most other games, that would mean yet another mission restart. Not here. Mindjack some unsuspecting schmuck and continue the chase in a whole new car! Tip: Beware Ubisoft&apos;s DRM.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507956">Expand</a></span>

Not just sportscars, but also trucks of all kinds and normal city cars. Many of them drive very different, with few favorites being obvious (like the 4x4 cars for example). Very easy to drive but fun. The interiors are surprisingly well done for and arcade racer. The particle effects and damage model are also exceptional (funny enough, I find the smoke modelling to be the best ever in a pc game). The sounds and music are on par with the cars. Everything being built into a shallow story, but again, one that provides a lot of wild racing and side challenges that are painfully simple (not always easy) yet  appealing. A well made , big and living city. This game gives solid more than 10 hours of gameplay and is worth the price.  I`d say it is a perfect game for a person that wanted GTA to be more of a car game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=2549879">Expand</a></span>

And it still managed to stay pretty hard, like it&apos;s predecessors.
<br>
<br>And as of now, you can safely start and continue playing offline, you only need to register it online on the first run. So, no DRM hard time.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a pure arcade driving game with a weird but pleasant twist.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=2479822">Expand</a></span>

The shift-function works really well and and feel like a core part of the gameplay and not just some stupid gimmick. It is also used quite frequently in the game in a lot of different ways making the game really stand apart from other racing game. I completed the campaign in 12 hours but I had a lot of side missions left to do. The story was actually surprisingly decent and it really fits with the shift-function. The conversations that occur when you shift both in free roaming and in narrated side missions also works really well and i found myself smirking from time to time. I thought the driving worked well enough as an arcade racer but i seldom play racing-games so i don&apos;t know how it compares to other games in its genre. The game isn&apos;t flawless though. The checkpoints sometimes forces you to replay needless bits, the environment is quite static and there is some invisible walls here and there, cinematic-views sometimes take away the control of your car in critical times, lack of customization, some gameplay bits in certain missions just doesn&apos;t work very well and the game does look kind of visually dated here and there. I still had a lot of fun with this arcade-racer and if you are looking for a racing game that tries something different you should give Driver  San Francisco a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=2575791">Expand</a></span>

It may not be the most memorable game or GOTY material but it&apos;s different enough that I can actually say I really enjoyed the entire experience.  There&apos;s really nothing bad to say about it either.  It&apos;s a good game.  If you can snatch it for 10$ I say it&apos;s worth it.</span>

Driver San Francisco is driven by a more than mediocre story which keeps the game interesting and the ability to shift between cars is a revolutionary new way of playing not seen before in car/racing games. The campaign isn&apos;t super long but due to the game&apos;s difficulty it will have you playing through for hours trying to complete certain missions, once you&apos;ve finished the campaign you&apos;ll be free to roam the streets of San Francisco and complete dares and challenges which will help you earn will power and unlock new cars to buy.
<br>
<br>Despite all this the PC version of the game does have it&apos;s flaws/cons:
<br>
<br>-Being a console port it is best played with a controller (xbox 360) as steering with the keyboard doesn&apos;t play well with the vehicles&apos; sensitive handling, on the plus side this allows for epic drifts which can reward you with a lot of points
<br>-The graphics are good but they could have been better as the game does not support or seem to respond to overriding the anti-aliasing through the Nvidia control panel, however playing at a higher resolution will make you forget this issue, just make sure you don&apos;t sit too close to the screen
<br>-The lighting in the PC version isn&apos;t that great, when driving under bridges or through tunnels you will only be able to see car lights and not much else which isn&apos;t much good if you&apos;re driving at high speed, the game colors are pretty dark even in well lit areas but this can be fixed with an enb graphics mod
<br>-The game gets boring and repetitive after a while,  the traffic cars cruising the city are pretty much the same handful of models, you will rarely find an exotic car cruising around but once you do you&apos;ll end up crashing it cause as I haven&apos;t mentioned already the streets are filled with cars, it&apos;s almost like playing car racing on brick game.
<br>-You need a ubisoft uPlay account to play the game as well which you will have to run every time you want to play the game, personally I don&apos;t have a problem with that as it beats piracy but ubisoft need to get their act together when it comes to their so called &quot;cloud&quot; gaming, oh yes,if re-installing  you will need to manually back up your save games which are supposed to get synchronized from the cloud but don&apos;t, go ubisoft!
<br>-The soundtrack is fairly good but it&apos;s a pity that it&apos;s limited and you&apos;ll end up hearing the same first song every time you play the game
<br>
<br>My favorite thing about this game is that it improves on pretty much everything that the previous driver games had to offer, finally making it to the HD era, it fits right in but it&apos;s such a shame that it didn&apos;t get the attention that it deserved. Sure it&apos;s not perfect but hoping that developers learn from their mistakes it would be great to see some remakes of the older games, the last few driver games didn&apos;t do any good to the franchise but it&apos;s still there and there&apos;s a light at the end of the tunnel...somewhere.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving this an 8/10, if you see driver sf, why not give it a go?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=3220592">Expand</a></span>

I will admit though, I liked the voice actor for Tanner in DRIV3R (Michael M.).  10
<br>
<br>Graphics:  Amazing graphics, so much detail to the licensed cars.  10.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:  The car handling for each car is different which is a good thing, but then again it still feels arcady, and sometimes some of the cars handling is just plain ridiculous.  Overall though it&#x2019;s still a great game, and it does an excellent job mixing up the gameplay with various missions (racing missions, bomb defuses, stunt missions, etc).  There are cars in which you can purchase but it seems rather pointless for the main storyline.  As for the main storyline, you only need to do 2 missions to unlock each 1 mission.  There&#x2019;s only 2 story mission in each 8 chapters.  The drifting element in the game is basic, and I had a few frameskip issues at times, but this is by far the most glitch free driver games compared to the past (Yes I&#x2019;m looking at you DRIV3R).  9.
<br>
<br>Story:  The story is really interesting, it continues a few years after Driver 3 and centers on Tanner (the way all Driver games should).  He gets knocked into a coma, and its bent on stopping Jerico.  Things that happen in the coma happen for a reason, and by the end of the game things get pieced together just fine.  The game ends on a good note but still leaves some unanswered questions.  9.0
<br>
<br>Replay Value:  The main storyline is really short but can still clock from 6-8 hours.  There are tons of things to do if you get into the game, I also bought it on a steam deal for cheap, but I&#x2019;d only recommend the game if you&#x2019;re up for doing all the side missions.  8.5.
<br>
<br>Overall Score:  9.3 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=3773282">Expand</a></span>

This game shows what can be done on current systems and should be looked at by those making games today.  If this type of open world and driving was incorporated into Watch Dogs it would have been game of the year contender.  If you like any open world driving/racing games you have to get this.  It is a 2011 game but it still holds up today.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=4344483">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s (knowingly) built on clich&#xE9;s, and all the more fun for it, but then surprises you by providing some impressively creative twists on its own set-up.
<br>
<br>It takes a little time to familiarise yourself with the knack of driving well in this game, but the time trial missions will encourage you to discover the approach required. Once you&apos;ve cracked that problem, the game is a joy; cornering will become second nature.
<br>
<br>Driving itself is not D:SF&apos;s special factor. Our protagonist is in a hospital bed, with his soul untethered from both his body and our reality, existing somewhere between worlds. I know this sounds like the stupidest thing in the world, but D:SF rolls in its own stupidity with the glee of a pig in its own manure, and believe it or not you&apos;re going to love it for that. This means you can hop from your car to any other car in the world, shocking that car&apos;s passengers with a sudden detour into reckless drving. This makes objectives tactical. You could win a race through skill, or you could possess vehicles in the oncoming traffic and send them into head-on collisions with your opponents, or use the police to do your bidding. This ability also gives you the freedom to instantly select any mission on the map from an eagle&apos;s eye view, or indeed pick a vehicle for some between-mission sandbox fun. This ability improves in various ways in response to your progression, so you always feel the pull dragging you deeper into the game.
<br>
<br>It introduces some huge surprises towards the end, which I won&apos;t spoil, that you have (and will never) see in another driving game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=4372090">Expand</a></span>

It has the potential to be a very good open world driving, racing game, but is completely let down by rubbish car physics and driving model. Driving feels like youre on ice all the time, all the time you turn and slow down your car it loses grip and you slide all over the place. That is made even worse by the traffic amount in this game, there are games in which i often wish there were more cars on the road, but on Driver SF there just too much damn traffic which very often turn into you, hit you in blind spots and go crazy when you barely touch them. Plus it seems there are no brakes in the game, the one that should function that way is just another handbrake which doesnt allow you to slow down normally from high speeds, it instantly locks up and causes you to slide all over the place. Of road handling in the game is different kind of bad and annoying, it makes you question what kind of an idiot was responsible for such handling model while developing the game. However if youre just cruising around off missions and activities driving can be serviceable and decently fun, but when it counts it can be become a nightmare.
<br>
<br>Really only thing that kept me playing was the enticing story that i really wanted to see how it plays out, altough the ending of the game made me question &apos;&apos;Is that it ?&apos;&apos;, its tad disappointing in my opinion, i wanted something more compelling. Also the way game transitions from CGI cutscenes to in game footage during in game cutscenes felt bit way off and weird, however the CGI parts are really well done. I&apos;ve never been to San Francisco in real life, closest thing i guess has been San Fierro in GTA San Andreas, but the city felt very well made for the game, and the adding of pedestrians roaming the streets added the alive factor thats missing from most open world driving games.
<br>
<br>Graphics for a 2011 felt bit dated, also game is bit too dark, i often ran into walls and objects that i simply couldnt see while driving fast and focusing on driving itself. Also there was no way to get rid of black bars while playing in my native 16:10 aspect ratio, but it didnt hurt the experience too bad. I wish the HUD wasnt so huge aswell, especially the annoying hint and boost bars, thay made felt like game is straight up console port, but atleast the game ran extremely well with locked 60 fps, without single crash, tho sometimes i saw some visual artifacting occuring, which bugged me out thinking my GPU might be on its last legs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=7486448">Expand</a></span>

Barren options menus, crash-prone, no longer available on Steam (and if you already have it on Steam it launches Uplay anyway) and, most importantly, extremely poor gamepad/wheel support.
<br>
<br>Simply put, if you plug in anything other than X360 controller, the game crashes on launch. Reportedly, at times it crashes even WITH a 360 controller. This is a port of a racing game that doesn&apos;t properly support racing wheels, forcing you to play with a keyboard or, if the stars allign, maybe a 360 gamepad.
<br>
<br>On top of that there are reports of corrupted saves and problems with system compatibility, crashes and other problems that require messing with local files, reinstalling and manually deleting saves to fix sudden hangs and crashes that make the thing unplayable.
<br>
<br>Ubisoft is the worst AAA company when it comes to PC gaming and they need to be held accountable for distributing product of this quality. 0/10, the game doesn&apos;t launch, it&apos;s useless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=6932333">Expand</a></span>

Also, it doesn&apos;t matter HOW good you get, the opponents will always cheat. Gets very, very aggravating.
<br>- Boost out of range? Opponents always have rubber band cars - no matter how fast you&apos;re going, they go faster and catch up as if tied to you by rubber bands. Then they stay in a group in front of you and block.
<br>- If you crash, you&apos;ll rarely catch up. If they crash, they&apos;re on your tail and passing you in seconds. Again.
<br>- If they hit you, you take massive damage. If you hit them, minor dings at best, even with ramming.
<br>- if they hit you you WILL spin out. If you hit them... it&apos;s like they&apos;re driving a heavy truck with infinite traction - no effect most times. Even when there is, see above about rubber band cars. Might as well have no effect.
<br>
<br>The list goes on and on. So yeah, the solo races can be fun, so 2/10 for those. Soon as there&apos;s an opponent, the only way the developers know to give a challenge is to change the physics in favour of the computer, instead of doing it right and having an AI that actually plays the game. I guess that&apos;s why they didn&apos;t bother having &quot;difficulty levels&quot; for novice players, because they only knew one way to make the game a &quot;challenge&quot; - the annoying way. Since there are &quot;must do&quot; opponent races in the game, it gets very frustrating, very quickly. I play for FUN, not to be frustrated by games poorly programmed by lazy developers.
<br>
<br>Specific example:
<br>In the Baja race, you have 3 opponents. Even if you crash a damn BUS head-on into an opponent using your shift ability, they will take no more than a tiny sliver of damage. If you PIN the opponent against the fence until the rest of the field is 1/2 way through the race, the opponent WILL CATCH UP by the next gate, pass you, then stay in front.
<br>Again, if you fall behind and use boost, you can in fact catch up to the three opponents. You can pass them. Soon as you do, they&apos;re faster and stronger than you and will muscle you out of the race by slamming you into a wall.
<br>I&apos;m guessing that the only people to beat the game just let the autopilot race for them until the last couple of gates (the autopilot will always keep you just behind the opponents). Then you MIGHT be able to pass them in one mad dash for the finish. If you fail, try again. Nothing else seems to work. It&apos;s a closed track so you can&apos;t keep ramming with shifted vehicles until they finally die (takes a LOT of ramming when you do this with other races!). You cannot pass and stay passed - they&apos;re ALWAYS faster than you when they&apos;re behind you, and they will always force you into a wall each time they hit you - unlike when you hit them, which forces YOU into the wall. Yeah, they&apos;re driving disguised tanks.
<br>
<br>Lowered the score to 1. Just for the solo races. Because luck should not be a feature of a game that is supposed to be about skilled driving, and these races are all about luck, not about skill.
<br>
<br>ps: yes, I beat that race and others. It was just... stupidly annoying, when it didn&apos;t have to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/driver-san-francisco/user-reviews?user_review_id=7143636">Expand</a></span>
