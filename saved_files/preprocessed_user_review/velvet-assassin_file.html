However, from there it seems to sink ever so much. It tries to be almost akin to both Splinter Cell and they seem to have pinched the purplish hue of the character when in shadows from Ion Storm&apos;s/Eidos Theif. The plot is fine, but the gameplay could have used a LOT more development. It would have been nice to have thrown a loose bottle lying around to distract the enemy, but instead whistling seems to be the order of the day - which kind of really dampens any kind of realism to the game. What surprised me most of all is that this game was developed by a German-based company, and you don&apos;t see many german manufacturer&apos;s or producers of a game of this kind. This was a refreshing change from seeing something that would usually have been something the American game names would have otherwise produced (probably to greater effect having had more experience in the field). Some slight quirks will annoy the hell out of people, like a British person&apos;s inability to say english words properly (like Quay and route, both of which appear to be pronounced using the American format - with a British character?). Aside from some of it&apos;s - at times simply infuriating - poor moments, it is graphically well presented, the script will sometimes unnerve the bejesus out of you if you have far too much imagination, and the graphics are very good indeed, as is the pleasantly realistic voice acting on the the part of the German soldiers, any German script being much better spoken by germans themselves. But the gameplay is a big downer, and needs a lot of work. If they produce a sequel to this - which it seems like they will (and they&apos;d better if you&apos;ve ever seen the ending), it would be interesting to know if they make it even better - because it needs to be if I&apos;m going to buy it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/velvet-assassin/user-reviews?user_review_id=741313">Expand</a></span>

I waited until this game was half price before getting it, because I did want it no matter what (I&apos;m a sucker for female lead or co-lead characters) but $49 is a little too much to justify for almost any game. Anyway, the game does look great. Nvidia still doesn&apos;t include an SLI profile in their driver months after the game&apos;s release, so have to set that up yourself for SLI performance. The gameplay is a little shakey unless really accustomed to the whole sneak and stealth style. The story is just that, a story, basically a reliving of memories told by the hero. No idea why it&apos;s so criticized, I mean she&apos;s in WWII doing missions to bring down the evil idiots. Gee, I wanted Shakespeare!!! (nah, he sucks) So where this game fails for me is in the game saving. The whole checkpoint saving idea is stupid and simply offers only frustration. Can&apos;t understand why that is the trend today (even if on a console) -- if I want to save at any time I should be able too, we have the technology! Is it supposed to add to the challenge or do they think players will get a greater sense of accomplishment?!

You will not find any of the great Splinter Cell features in this game. The weak story and cut scenes are the only things it has going for it and maybe the fact that it is controller enabled. Killing nazis is always fun, but there is no climbing on boxes, you can&apos;t hug walls, AI always seems to be setup in the right direction for you to sneak up and kill them removing any challenge, doors squeak, but AI is not alerted and even if you are spotted you can go back through the door and they won&apos;t follow. Extremely repetitious. I recommend avoiding this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/velvet-assassin/user-reviews?user_review_id=1989257">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is one of the worst ports I have ever seen, the graphics are so-so. They gameplay is based around a hot attractive female &apos;spy&apos; there is no story. Go out and spend your money on games such as Super Meat Boy/Skyrim.. Anything but this please.</span>

<br>There wasn&#x2019;t anything particularly interesting in this game. The visuals were crisp but bland and they didn&#x2019;t fit with the setting. The story was not interesting at all and because of that, you&#x2019;ll likely not remember anything about it. The gameplay itself doesn&#x2019;t really save this game either. It&#x2019;s incredibly basic and often times repetitive.
<br>
<br>While this review isn&#x2019;t comprehensive of the entire game, there isn&#x2019;t much to say. The gameplay is boring, the visuals and story lack any depth and are uninteresting. The length of the game is fairly short, which is actually a good thing. I wanted to be finished with this game as quickly as possible. I wish I would have saved that money and gotten something else, but for $1.24 it was tempting. This is a average game, so expect a average experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/velvet-assassin/user-reviews?user_review_id=3295701">Expand</a></span>

Its a good idea gone wrong by bad design, poor controls, bad porting, weak storyline, limited game play choices... the list goes on and on and on. The only saving grace is that the graphics look great. Visuals mean nothing if you can&apos;t make a solid game. I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t waste my money on this, no wonder they didn&apos;t have a demo for it.</span>

For a sneaking game where any encounter can be deadly (if the enemy accidentally turns around before you expect him to do so), it was simply too frustrating playing the same sequences over and over only to arrive at the same difficult point.
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong: In any shooter game I don&apos;t have a problem with save points. Usually you can save yourself from dying by taking cover or hiding. But in this game you can&apos;t do that. Once the bad guys detect you, it&apos;s over. This kind of game definitely needs quick saves!
<br>The game is quite cheap nowadays.

Well, Velvet Assassin is the perfect example of a great concept poorly executed.  There was little to no quality control done here.  So here are the pros:  Atmosphere.  Great ambiance with the environments.  The lighting is very nice and well balanced.  Voice over work is good.  Music os good but can be a bit over-zealous at the wrong moments.  And now for the longer list of cons: Controls.  She&apos;s difficult to maneuver and she moves slowly and jerky.  The walking paths are littered with junk that can&apos;t be picked up or climbed over.  She only climbs select areas and when she does they&apos;re in the worst places.  Weapons.  There are only four total including your default knife.  Attack.  She stabs like she has mono and the stabbing does little to no damage.  She can&apos;t reload while running.  Enemies.  Apparently Nazis can shoot at you but things like doors and ropes stop them.  Once a Nazi searches for you they stop after awhile and go back to their original paths even with the ground being littered with dead Nazis.  Video.  No one bothered to test the video or even patch anything afterwards.  There are checkerboard glitches throughout but not enough to truly deter anyone from continuing.  No saving: only checkpoints.  Truly annoying.  Pathing.  Truly linear.  You can&apos;t explore as much as the areas reveal but there are some hidden things here and there.  Conclusion:  It&apos;s not a total loss but with such frustrating controls and setup and video issues it&apos;s not worth playing at a high retail price.  Get it cheap and uninstall it if it pisses you off...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/velvet-assassin/user-reviews?user_review_id=2488899">Expand</a></span>

Getting in and out without anybody ever noticing. The controls are pretty good and the character is hot. There are some bugs but never impacting the game-play. I got it at $1.25 on Steam and seriously have paid higher prices for game much worse than that.</span>

I was wrong. This game is actually quite good. The graphics are great, and the whole art direction is coherent and at the same time very &quot;new&quot;, using sepia tones and dark, cold atmospheres are the same time. The gameplay is... well, I don&apos;t know. old school? Simple? Yes, it IS simple. But while the beginning of the game has a definite emphasis on stealth, the ending is much more frenetic. In short, it doesn&apos;t get boring at all. The audio is so-so. The ambiance sounds are good, although the music sometimes gets too loud and can distract the player. But then again, It may be just my opinion, since I usually don&apos;t like music in games anyway. The voice acting ranges from good to downright awful, depending on the language : german acting is good, which is expected since it was developed by a german studio. The English acting (the hero) is average. It could be a bit better sometimes, but it&apos;s still bearable. The French acting is AWFUL. The story itself is the most original and the best part of the game, in my opinion. I&apos;ve played a lot of WW2-themed games, and this one definitely portrays the atrocity of war the best. The scenario isn&apos;t a generic copycat of other mainstream games I won&apos;t name (it starts with a C, end with a D, and there&apos;s a o in the middle), and it definitely works great. My only regret is, as usual, the portrayal of the main character. I can accept the oh-so-tight pants that don&apos;t look practical at all or the sexy makeup (on a WW2 spy!). Those are clich&#xE9;s, alright. I&apos;m used to seeing them on female videogame characters. But playing 1/5 of the game in a nightie... come on. Seriously? Alright, she wakes up in a hospital. So obviously she doesn&apos;t have her normal suit anymore. But give her clothes at some point in the game, damn it. The violence of the ending becomes ridiculous when you realize you&apos;re playing in a NIGHTIE. Hello, half-naked hot chick killing nazis. Can you keep your serious there? No. It&apos;s absurd. And the problem is, the game is stone-cold serious the whole time. The atrocities of war, everything. This game, right here, says &quot;man always lose wars&quot;. You can&apos;t have both a very serious story and a ridiculously clich&#xE9;d sexualized character.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/velvet-assassin/user-reviews?user_review_id=2470511">Expand</a></span>

This game has good stealth and creative enemy path/actions. The silent kills are rewarding each time. The game play is slintercellesc, but with some new twists. Where its a tad repetitive, it is unique enough that I enjoy a good hour dose or so a day. I found the shooting action fun when spotted. Sure, its a little weird you can just exit a room and peek through a keyhole and the enemies never follow you. I&apos;m willing to cut a little slack there though, as the overall game is awesome, and this makes it beatable at a reasonable pace. I&apos;m about 2/3 of the way through now enjoying the storyline and game play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/velvet-assassin/user-reviews?user_review_id=1427144">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Velvet Assassin is a generally good game that is like a remake of Thief, but with guns and Nazis.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, the ending is bad and out of character with the story.  There is a final battle where you must defeat waves of enemies, and if f you played as stealthy character, then you won&apos;t have enough health stars to finish.</span>

This game repays the patient player, and Violette&apos;s story is compelling and engrossing. The voice acting is excellent, and the gameplay is good if you keep within your machine&apos;s capabilities. One previous poster hit the nail on the head: you&apos;ll either love this or hate it.

The mechanics are totally unoriginal, but still satisfying except in one respect: the consolized save game system sucks! The checkpoints are seriously WAY too far apart. They should either put them MUCH closer together or just let u save whenever u want, PC style. It enraged me and almost made me stop playing when I had to redo rather long sequences AGAIN and AGAIN. As far as the setting, World War 2 is rather tired. However, I have yet to play a WW2 stealth game, let a lone one based on an actual historical character. I find the story and the setting compelling and new IPs should be encouraged. I gave the game a 7. If they had done the saves better so I don&apos;t have to do the same thing 300 times, I&apos;d have given it an 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/velvet-assassin/user-reviews?user_review_id=424073">Expand</a></span>

Since Violette is based on a real WWII War Heroe and she suffered such a tragic life and death, it is easy to relate to her and want to help her achieve her goals in the game. The stealth kills are very satisfying, especially after being killed by the same nazi soldier numerous times. It&apos;s like sweet revenge to finally watch a nice animation of his demise. The game is difficult, as it should be, and the all around coolest stealth action game I&apos;ve played to date. I have currently completed 4 of the 12 missions in the game and so far, all have been excellently designed and awesome graphics and special effects. The game sucks you right in to the environment and you find yourself looking around corners to see what&apos;s ahead. A lot of work went into the game and it shows. The interface is clean and informative, and better looking than the previews posted all over the internet. I highly recommend Velvet Assassin to anyone looking for a great, challenging stealth game with some fun additons to keep the interest, including an RPG element of improving 3 areas: Stealth, Morphine use, and Strength, so your character can be built to fit your playing style. The morphine is used in a &quot;bullet time&quot; type mode, but freezes the enemies for a short time to enable Violette to kill one quickly or allow her escape. I&apos;m more impressed with the game than I thought I would be, though I knew I was going to love it before I bought it. Do a search on Violette Szabo and you will find out about an amazing young lady, a life full of tragedy, sharpshooter and risk taker; a perfect character for this type of game, as well as a great war heroe that many have never heard of. Velvet Assassin hits the mark with me and I&apos;m looking forwad to an expansion!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/velvet-assassin/user-reviews?user_review_id=423780">Expand</a></span>

You go around killing nazis, stealing documents and just causing havoc on the enemy front. The graphics are really nice and the controls smooth and fluid. I recommend picking this up if you have some time to kill.</span>

She is who she is and that is how it is.
<br>
<br>This sort of reflects a game that does things in a half-baked  way. Oh sure, I liked it in one way, but I also found it nothing remarkable in other ways. A pro in stealth games will probably feel disappointed because while it does have stealth,  it is certainly made for the impatient  and the clumsy among us, like me. So you can sneak past your guards in full view -say five feet in front of them - as long as you do it in the dark. Oh and kill them to in front of them too as long as you back stab them from behind in that same dark. Nobody will notice. Just like they won&apos;t miss all their buddies disappearing one after the other. You can actually upgrade your sneaking to the point that you can overtake a patrolling guard from behind. It gets to be a walk in the park that way. Just with corpses littering the grass that is.
<br>
<br>But don&apos;t do something to alert them. They hunt you down relentlessly as if they know where you are, but can&apos;t shoot you unless they get close enough to do so. They got x-ray eyes and are highly sensitive. In fact they almost home in to you and the only way is to sneak away from them long enough so the timer gives up and they let you of the hook.
<br>
<br>But once they are aware of you they will shoot at you, even from the other side of the map right through obstacles and never give up until you or they are dead.
<br>
<br>However at some point during the game you will not worry much about the enemy anymore because once you upgraded enough and are armed with a proper weapon(not that  whimsy silenced gun) there is only the lack of bullets that keep you from going on a killing spree and decide World War 2 that way. Think Inglourious Basterds. Oh yes, and then that wacky way of fighting. Because to be able to shoot, you need to get into a special mode. Which is, frankly, unhandy because you can&apos;t pick up things or kill someone from behind. For that you have to get into another mode again.
<br>
<br>This kinda reflects how the game is. It is a bit of sneaking, but not well done. It is a bit of fighting. Not well done either. It has a kind of story, that has okay graphics, is told using a scrapbook, it is nice but just not captivating enough. It has missions, that have nothing to do with each other, because they are not related or do not seem to build towards something. They are in that game together because Summer is doing them.
<br>
<br>Velvet Assassin is therefore a nice diversion that you might pick up when digging around in the bargain bin, but it isn&apos;t a good stealth game or a good fighting game. In fact it isn&apos;t good in anything in particular. It is a collection of unrelated missions done with lackluster game play held together by a flimsy story that is nice to look at but not something that will stick with you. Maybe 10 dollars/euros at best. More would be waste of your precious money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/velvet-assassin/user-reviews?user_review_id=6309708">Expand</a></span>

There were an awesome graphics, pretty good gameplay, and interesting story! If you are a big fan of stealth-action games (MGS, Hitman, etc), this title is essential for picking up.</span>

The level design is unfortunately very linear and the gameplay overall is &apos;okay&apos;.  The protagonist is appealing, in that she&apos;s a &apos;she&apos;!  Recommended for WWII / historically theme game fans.</span>

<br>Deleted the game after 2 hours despite the fact that I LOVE STEALTH GAMES. I can&apos;t even remember what the story was all about. You can give it a shot but I think I&apos;d rather play NOLF instead.</span>
