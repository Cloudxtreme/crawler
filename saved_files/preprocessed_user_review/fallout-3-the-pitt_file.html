It&apos;s obvious that the concept tried to differentiate itself from the rest of FO3, but it&apos;s still pretty much the same desolate, gutter-like and lawless environment the player will be in. The new items are okay, but they are quite redundant once you&apos;re done with The Pitt.</span>

I&apos;m trying to look from the developer as well as the business side because it&apos;s that combination that users actually perceive in their analysis of quality nowadays. We all love Bethesda without a doubt, but they&apos;re no 2K or Source team in so far as dystopian sci fi adventure writing goes and it&apos;s really overdue they bump up their technology a bit. A good engine would help them greatly. The Pitt is good proof of my meaning - while it would have made a super part of the FO3 world we bought for $50, it is ultimately lonely and tired by itself for $10 one full year later. That sort of poor business thinking reflects back on the creative team. Developers and gaming scriptwriters really must learn how to edit our storylines better - we no longer have the liberty of allowing the marketing bosses &quot; to take care of that&quot; anymore because they will do so and the result will be degraded art like FO3&apos;s The Pitt which should have never existed on its own. ISFA Bethesda&apos;s business decision to distribute the FO3 mods via MGWL exclusively ~ a move which defied reason unless it was Bethesda&apos;s goal to alienate their fans ~ I wouldn&apos;t recommend that strategy again. I sense Steam may have served all parties far better. Steam live and breathe pc gaming and understand this tiny but wonderful corner of the entertainment industry better than any generic mass marketing distributor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3-the-pitt/user-reviews?user_review_id=423815">Expand</a></span>

It was worth my $10.00 (USD). and I would defintely pay another $10.00 for some DLC pack like this. Unlike all other DLC pack that dev released for Fallout 3, this is the only DLC pack that involves choice-making, morale concepts and deeper storyline that is very interesting.

The new worldspace is very large, but the collision markers block player from going other routes than the one that leads to the main quest. The new enemies (trog and wildman) aren&apos;t that impressive. The quest reward items are average items. and the NPC are just mediocre (meaning nothing special..
