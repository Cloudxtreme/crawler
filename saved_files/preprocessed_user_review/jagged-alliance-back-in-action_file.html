As someone who has never played the original JA or JA2 games, I am still aware of the legendary reputation these games bring to the franchise. And thus the level of expectation which the community has towards this third installment.<br><br>However, as a standalone game, not taking into account its heritage, I am immensely enjoying the experience. Gameplay reminds me a bit of the Men of War series of games. But with the added depth of a &apos;persistent&apos; world map, which will feature random counterattacks from the defending forces on Arulco.<br>Liberated towns or mines give you daily income, which can be spent on hiring new mercs or better equipment. Enemies drop loot, which can be sold or used to keep your mercs going. Militias can be equipped with guns from your stores to defend your holdings. All this and more makes for a very complex and satisfying game, with levels of interaction and tactical options rarely seen in games these days - mainstream RTS included. And just for trying to bring this experience to a new audience 10 or more years after the originals the developers deserve a 10.<br><br>I do however have to subtract one point from my final rating due to sometimes flaky camera controls, which can be responsible for getting your mercs killed in tight situations. And another for samey, predictable AI, which will send all their goons out in the open and after your squad once one of them is spotted, rather than making use of their well entrenched positions.<br><br>I can see how Fog of War would have made this game an even more intense experience, and it is a shame the devs decided to not  include it in the final game. And I am sure that veterans of this series will have many more bones to pick, but JA:BiA as it stands, is head and shoulders above anything in the RTS realm that is currently on offer on the PC. And with patches already coming out 1 day after release, I am sure this game can be polished to an even brighter sheen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2135673">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s riddled with bugs and seemingly inexplicable phenomena. To name but a few: I&apos;ve had mercs spotted through walls, enemies alerted to a mercs presence for no apparent reason (yes I understand the stealth mechanics), enemy AI is appalling (you can eliminate a building full of enemies but just running a merc around the perimeter of the building, thus alerting the enemies, and then shooting them all as they come out of the door), the game is riddled with typos (e.g. some of the mercs have a trait called &apos;though&apos;, which is obviously meant to be &apos;tough&apos;), the voices acting is poor and annoying (who honestly wants to have their merc scream the same phrase over and over again every time you select them?), the towns are lifeless and dull (filled with aimlessly wandering NPCs who interact with nothing, they remind me of playing Ultima). There&apos;s also myriad other infuriating gameplay problems, such as when you stealth melee someone in crouch mode, you inexplicably change to run mode after the kill, which means if you move, you automatically alert everyone in the area to your presence), NPCs also have a tendency to block you into confined spaces (I&apos;ve had a merc stuck in a garage for an entire mission because a child decided to sit on the floor in the only exit and refused to move). Dialogue is appalling and the sub-quests uninteresting. Combat is unfulfilling and tedious (the rag-doll bodies are about the most satisfying part) and generally consists of endlessly having to reload whilst you try and make-up for the non-sensical mechanics (e.g. tell a merc to shoot an enemy that is running towards them, and if the enemy passes out of sight for a second (e.g. to run around a tree) the order is cancelled and your merc generally ends up dying unless you continually re-tell him to shoot the target. Other problems elevate the game to the height of tedium (why, for example, when buying and selling items can you not just cycle through the various mercs, rather than having to individually move each merc to the vendor?). The game feels like an unfinished b-movie. You might overlook these things if it were &#xC2;&#xA3;10 (but even then it&apos;d annoy the hell out of you) but for &#xC2;&#xA3;30 you expect a game to have proper A.I., a user-friendly interface and acceptable game mechanics. Back in Action has none of these. It is a franchise that has clearly not moved on since the last decade, which is a shame, because I really wanted to enjoy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2135609">Expand</a></span>

<br>Apart from the graphics, everything from game mechanism to scenario looks like a downgrade. There&apos;s a lot of limitations that comes with BIA compared to JA2.
<br>
<br>You cannot plant bombs anywhere you want
<br>You cannot DIY your makeshift traps with landmines
<br>You cannot bash enemies with a crowbar
<br>You cannot unlock a door with a shotgun
<br>And the list goes on, there&apos;s a lot of things you could do in JA2 that is totally missing in BIA, playing BIA is more of a chore than fun. Ten minutes into the game and you can tell that the developers have not really played Jagged Alliance 2.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not that exciting. Another example of failed resurrection by developers who wants to make easy dollars</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=3116898">Expand</a></span>

<br>Your soldiers are absolute morons and can&apos;t do anything without being micromanaged. Even when set to guard your Mercs often won&apos;t shoot at enemies within range and sight zone, you have to manually tell them &quot;Hey kill that guys who&apos;s raping your face.&quot; They see a mine? Better halt em or they&apos;ll run over it. This is super annoying when splitting a squad into smaller teams for flanking. Want them to go talk to someone? Better hope there&apos;s no closed doors in the way. They are incapable of opening them to get to somewhere on their own. Also ran into several issues with game freezes &amp; crashes.
<br>
<br>For a real time squad based game, which I tend to hate in comparison to turn based, it isn&apos;t too bad thanks to the ability to pause and issue commands. Though sadly, even that system has it&apos;s flaws. Once your guys run out of shoot commands, they&apos;ll stop shooting. I often found myself just staying in real time or loading up with dozens of shoot commands to cut down on the micromanaging.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=3247233">Expand</a></span>

<br>Well I reloaded the game the past few days and have now put 18 hrs into the campaign. This time around the game has received several patches since and one of them added is a &quot;tactical FOW&quot; mode which literally fixes ALL of my complaints and make the game feel truly great. I have no idea why this wasn&apos;t in place from day zero, but it literally is the different between scoring this a 5/10 and giving it a 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=4411237">Expand</a></span>

<br>This Back in actions is half finished, its bugged, and mostly its ridded by terrible developer choices.
<br>The camera controls are awful, in some maps the point of view is so low that i was wondering if they ever tested it.
<br>The line of sight/cover system is full of bugs and also when it works it goes against common sense in many cases, like covering behind a tree results in having half los blocked by the tree itself.
<br>For some reason they stripped out half content which was in the original, there are less mercs, less traits, no training, no cars, no chopper, less npcs, less quests, and they changed the story in a manner that make no sense.
<br>To mention also the very sub par voice acting, which is instead superb in the original one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2548920">Expand</a></span>

<br>Well I don&apos;t see anything fun about this game, which is the reason you play games in the first place. It&apos;s not that it&apos;s not like JA2: it&apos;s not and it&apos;s fine. It&apos;s just not fun, period. The AI will spot you out of nowhere even if you&apos;re crawling behind them and make no noise at all. Your squad member will take 2 seconds to aim a gun even if he/she has 90 Marksmanship skill. If your character gets hit, it resets the counter too. That basically means that a guy running over 200 meters with an axe will kill you even if you have a shotgun and is facing him, because of the weird randomization of the game (in this case, the aiming speed).
<br>
<br>The auto-save is horrible, it basically saves you &quot;just&quot; before you start combat. Most of the time loading an auto-save means getting blown to smithereens because for some reason, loading a save will not pause the game for you (even with all the auto-pause events activated). Enemies are clearly overpowered. I was used to overpowered enemies in JA2 but this is even worse, because of the counter-reset thing. Enemies will just blast your squad in seconds even if you play very tactical.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s no strafing possible in the game, which means everytime you go around a corner you get shot if someone&apos;s there, because your character will not &quot;spot&quot; them until you face them (line of sight). The controls are poor: they give you tips during loading screens about aiming manually yet give you no clue about how to do it. Hell, I even get most tips in German for some reason.
<br>
<br>I have really no idea why this game passed QA. If you liked JA2, don&apos;t buy this game. If you hated JA2, don&apos;t buy this game. If you don&apos;t care about JA2, well don&apos;t buy this game. It&apos;s not a game at all anyway.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2513375">Expand</a></span>

I played all the XCOM, fallout, jagged alliance etc games, and I must say I really enjoyed them. Especially the xcom series, with that mix of tactics and strategy, economic management and R&amp;D, so freaking awesome. And JA2, I discovered this game quite &quot;late&quot;, and wow what a gem! Fun, difficult, nice humor, very immersive. Jagged Alliance Back in Action has some very serious flaws, for a tactical squad level game. 1. No fog of war. Are you kidding? no, really. No fog of war. Try to understand the deep meaning of this statement. Try thinking xcom without fow. Try to imagine a tactical engagement where you are aware of EVERY single enemy position right from the start.  Magic! Telepathy! Just..why? 2. Inventory management. What inventory management? to sell items, you have to select every single merc and talk individually with the merchant. If I want to SWAP items between my mercs, I can&apos;t do it from the strategic map. You must load a tactical map and do it from there in real time. Try thinking when you have I dunno, 8 mercs, ten maps full of items, and you have to manage this mess. Of course, no sector inventory, so you have to load maps and run around fetching stuff left over from that time when you were too loaded to carry other suff away. For the first time in my life, I disregarded drops from enemies in pure frustration, since if you don&apos;t pick up something as soon as you kill an enemy, well good luck running around the whole map. Not fun.
<br>3. Militia: now this is really ridiculous. Apply all that was said for inventory management, and now imagine that you must equip EVERY SINGLE militia (auto generated guys that fight to defend your territories when you are not there) manually, by giving them weapons and armor. Tedious is an euphemism. It literally takes hours. But don&apos;t worry, militia is useless in any case, you&apos;re much better off just selling your stuff to equip your mercs.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know, instead of going forward in terms of innovation, immersion, gameplay, in one word FUN, this game is a huge step back if compared to JA2. And since it&apos;s called &quot;Jagged Alliance back in action&quot; well..you are gonna get comparisons. JA2 is what, 10 years old?? shame shame shame..can&apos;t give a higher score to a TACTICAL game with no fow, sorry. Yeah graphics are ok.
<br>
<br>So they destroyed the fallout series, crippled heroes of might and magic, utterly smashed to pulp that miracle of a game that was civilization, and really did a bad job with Jagged Alliance.. now what? oh right, xcom! i would not be surprised if it was a spaghetti western in a post atomic world where you must hunt down dinosaurs. BUT...hey it&apos;s 3D!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2578018">Expand</a></span>

The biggest disappointment was the lack of custom character generation. This was an integral part of Jagged Alliance 2 as it affected the balance of your mercenary squad to a point where you could not only control it by having money but by having a character generated to your spec. There is a lot to speak good about though, you have the characters and the story you loved from Jagged Alliance 2 but the play style is different. It&apos;s different in a way that makes it more challenging, and makes you want to plan your infiltrations better. I liked Jagged Alliance &amp; Jagged Alliance 2 dearly even though this isn&apos;t an exact remake it still hits an enjoyable note. Don&apos;t expect a true to life remake if you decide to try this, the turn based aspect is gone and replaced by a pause,think-and-move style. Overall the voice acting could be better, the AI could be better and they could definitely add IMP back. I would recommend giving this game a try if you haven&apos;t already.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2140350">Expand</a></span>

The story, the maps, the weapons etc. They could have just COPIED everything with better graphics, and most fans would have bought this game outright.<br>The AI is very erratic. Most of the times it just seems stuck. It ignores weapon ranges and tries to hit you with a shotgun, 120 yards away. Other times it moves in loops without actually doing something useful.<br>There is no fog of war. You enter a map, and you can see where everyone is. No surprises, no suspense. The plan&amp;Go is an ok mechanic but in no way as good as the round based system in the original.<br>The management aspect has been botched extremely. You don&apos;t have to pay your soldiers regularly, you just &quot;buy&quot; them. An illogical and unnecessary streamlining.  On the other hand you have to arm militia by hand like in XCOM. But the militia can be so numerous, that you have to arm 30 people by hand. Why?<br>Even the story presentation is bad. How can someone make cutscenes which look WORSE and more ugly than in the 13 year old original, with its minimalistic graphics?<br>Sorry, how someone can fail so badly in doing a remake with had nearly perfect mechanics is beyond me. Please don&apos;t buy this game, or we have to endure comparable **** games in the future!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2138095">Expand</a></span>

The problem with this is that some people use these review sites to make purchasing judgments, and there is FAR too much collective bias against games that try to revive old cult classics.<br><br>As to the game itself, it&apos;s good.  It&apos;s difficult if you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re doing, easy if you do.  It&apos;s going to take you a day or two to get the hang of things.  You  might want to restart the game once you get the hang of it.  This is one of the best RTS/RPGs in existence right now (still hoping for a worthwhile UFO remake); Please give it a chance and ignore the butthurt babies who want to rate it down out of their spite towards the choices the developers made with game direction.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2143712">Expand</a></span>

Anyway most of the enemies can be eliminated by lure tactics, but when the AI is on the defence, you can count on that it will not send all its men to the slaughter; you have to go in, to finish the job. -- I like this game, although it&apos;s far from perfect. Sometimes I experience unexplainable slowdowns, mostly occurring when the roof of a building is removed for a better view. You can&apos;t remove the roofs of &quot;distant building&quot; (more than a few feet away...) so it&apos;s quite possible, that you can&apos;t issue a fire order, even if the enemy is in your mercenary&apos;s line of sight. You have to get used to the camera; in my opinion it&apos;s movement is too restricted. There are clipping problems, which will not only look weird, but will hinder you: f.e. your mercenary lies behind a cover, but their weapon and hands clip through it, making them a shootable target. Of course you can pull them back a bit, but still, it&apos;s annoying. There are problems with issuing orders, especially when you want them to shoot on a moving enemy at close range. They will aim, then state they can&apos;t hit the target, turn to face it, aim again, state it&apos;s impossible to shoot at it, etc. Especially annoying when they can&apos;t finish a single axe-armed guy off, and thanks to it he kindly chops a few of your men to pieces. The militia, in its current form is quite unusable, or should I say, it&apos;s not worth investing money, or loot in it, but hey, you have mercs, to defend your territory. -- What I mean to say is that this game has it&apos;s own share of problems, _but_ it&apos;s still a good, enjoyable game. The graphics are outdated, but it&apos;s far from ugly; the sounds and music are good (in my opinion), and when those annoyances mentioned earlier don&apos;t make their appearances, the action is quite enjoyable; for me, it has that certain urban warfare feeling with the heavy need to use cover, popping out from behind it just for a few moments, to harass the enemy with a handful of bullets. JABiA is not a genre defining product, it was never meant to be that, but I enjoy playing it. I would give it an 8, were it not for the number of minor, more or less avoidable glitches.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2150149">Expand</a></span>

Ok, so it&apos;s not as good as Jagged Alliance 2. But how many games are? he new real-time system is quite fun (and I&apos;m normally a TBS nutter!) and the ability to plan your strategy while the game is paused is well implemented. A number of patches have removed or alleviated some of the more blatant flaws in the initial release - the addition of sector inventories is a godsend, although equipping militas is still cumbersome (you need to run around and talk to each merc to equip them). If you can see past the lack of FOW and some of the other changes since JA2, there&apos;s a lot of fun to be had here. If you desperately want to play JA2, well, then play JA2, it&apos;s still the great game it always was.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2279875">Expand</a></span>

The game has a sense of tactics that many RTS games eschew in favour of faced based game-play. The game provides an interesting set of characters and a sometimes humorous set of Easter eggs. In addition, it seems the writers decided to bypass copyright law by mixing names, like the hallowed SAM-AF and the Klock 18. Finally, the game provides a half-decent [not completely decent] UI that ranges from intelligent in some areas and even enlightened, to completely idiotic in others. There is a lot to be said for this game. It has its flaws and it has its pros. Among the many flaws of this game are the huge amount of system-crashing bugs one will experience when playing the game, which effectively limits the employability of the game with their continual and common occurrence.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2134278">Expand</a></span>

Absolutely.  But it also has made some real improvements in many areas, and the &quot;plan and go&quot; system is a great idea that works very well and will perhaps breath some new life into this genre.  JA2 was a 10/10, especially considering when it was made.  But just because this game has some glitches and needs a little more polish doesn&apos;t mean it deserves a &quot;2&quot; like people give an unfinished abortion of a game like Sword of the Stars 2.  This game is substantially finished, playable and a lot of fun.  And personally I play games to have fun, not to pick them apart with comparisons with a determined effort to find every way they could be better.  I get the impression some people reviewing this either haven&apos;t played it, or bought it specifically to pick it apart, which is quite silly if you ask me.<br><br>The voice acting could be better, but it is sufficient.  The combat mechanics are not perfect, but they are fun and make sense.  The interface could really use so work to make managing inventories better, but my understanding is that is in the next patch.  I thought the music was quite good, and the graphic elements were absolutely excellent for a game like this.<br><br>The strategy map is a real improvement over the old classic, parts of the interface are greatly improved (and other parts missing/lacking).  Anyway if you liked JA2, or XCOM, or the UFO: A series, or Laser Squad Nemesis, et cetera and you would like to play a modern game with those elements than this is just the thing for you.<br><br>I had very modest expectations and it has been the game I have had the most fun with since portal 2 was released (and I buy a game a week).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2140035">Expand</a></span>

The game is clearly unfinished, from the bland character models, lack of the personality and charm from the original series, and no polish.  You can even hear the gore exclamations, &quot;Wow, that was gross!&quot; and the enemy models fall in the same tired fashion.  You know there is a horrific death animation that just wasn&apos;t added in.  The mercenaries are all generic character models, with almost no details to distinguish them.  How is it that the game from 1999 has better portrayals of these classic characters in terms of graphics and voice acting.  Remember those cutscenes from JA2 that showed Elliot getting slapped around and feeling the genuine rage of the Queen and the progression of your campaign?  Well, those are gone too.  The tactical aspect of training rebels, and mercenaries has also been removed.  You collect a weapon and hand it to an available freedom fighter.  He becomes militia.  Which you might as well give them all knives because the weapons and armor seems to make almost no difference, and they will lose the battle.  Most of the game will be limited by retaking points and stationing your mercenaries near various parts of the map to intercept and defend the cities before the squads even get near them.<br><br>But even with all the bugs, poor AI at times, and just lack of any type of production value, there is a solid game hidden behind it all.  The mix of real time and planning during battles is challenging and addicting.  You&apos;ll find yourself re-loading after getting wiped out over and over again and enjoying every minute of it.  Learning from each approach until you find the perfect strategy to clear the immediate area and move on.  There is still a large selection of weapons, armor, camouflage and items which stay true to the Jagged Alliance style.<br><br>This game could have been so much more and it falls short on so many levels.  I really hope the modding community can fix this mess of a game and bring out the amazing potential that it could and should have had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2139621">Expand</a></span>

Whilst the developers have supposedly innovated with a plan and go system, they have clearly cut corners everywhere else and also while they are at it, robbed your grandma. The game feels like jagged alliance interpreted through creative ballet. Without fog of war the game is severely broken. It was in the early dev version supposedly but became &quot;too hard&quot; to play. A sheer remake on a new graphical platform and fixing and improving would have been awesome. I get the distinct feeling the developers drank all day instead of coding, scratched this together in a week and are laughing all the way to the bank knowing the nostalgic steam users will grab it and give it a run, without trusting the overwhelmingly negative reviews.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2136424">Expand</a></span>

If these guys can make a game with tactics, open-world, quests, nice graphics, surely they will get much attention. But why take all that Arulco crap again? Scores low, people only see &quot;Elliot!..&quot; thing been removed and jump out of the window..

<br>
<br>The lack of a way to change formation, the so called tutorial that teaches you next to nothing ( shows you othing about things to do with the main ma, doesnt tell you how to give militia weapons etc) and the so called &apos;stealth&apos; aspect is a joke no matter what you do you can crawl and sneak your way to the enemy but there are times you tell your men to shoot someone ad they run towards him and hug him, also it doesnt help that the enemy sometimes have xray vision and supre accuracy, the delay between giving an firing order and them shooting is laughable, told them to fire once and took them 20 seconds to shoot and by that time the enemy had wiped out 5 of my squad.
<br>
<br>I am in agreement with the rest of the reviews here that this should have either been released at a different name or in coming patches be fixed so that you can actually play the game without screaming at your monitor at how stupid your mercs are.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2146935">Expand</a></span>

<br>If I were young enough to not have been able to enjoy the original when it was released I would find that to be an insult to my intelligence. Not being able to appreciate the tactical depth that the original turn based system that JA2 offers does not reflect well upon the intelligence or the attention span of a younger gaming audience.
<br>
<br>Had this remake been given some of the technological advancements in the vein of Silent Storm, I think it would have garnered much more positive attention, turn based isn&apos;t bad unless you&apos;re a complete tard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=3799937">Expand</a></span>

They also took out armor repair, which renders the best armor you find, useless in a couple of battles. The store mechanic is also cumbersome, why can&apos;t they just design a drop ship from a helicopter to a specified sector instead of having to have to go to the airport every single freakin time. Oh yeah, your sector militias are useless, they always get beat unless you reinforce them with your own merc. Oh yeah, the stealth mechanic is borked. Even when the sound meter is all the way down, somehow the enemy could detect you and face you. Best of all, there is NO tactic in this game. If you don&apos;t lure the enemies to your waiting mercs then the enemy could swarm your lone gunman. Also an enemy with a pistol can beat your sniper at range, at night too, without nightscope, omg the cheating AI so OP</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=4096590">Expand</a></span>

It can be tedious work sometimes but it can also be very challenging. The gameplay is repetitive but you do not really realise this because the layout of every area is very unique with different vantage points and choke points. A great sum of weapons and equipment make the game seem like every character is unique and every enemy you have to look at to get a understanding if he is wearing body armor or not. The game deserves an 8 for a well planned game with a unique concept and gameplay that will last awhile. I have 11 hours into the game and i&apos;ve been running into graphical glitches and crashes. Could be my sli setup by why 11 hours to conflict. Either way i would recommend the game. But fair warning, if you don&apos;t have patience than this is not for you. One enemy can whipe out your entire team if you rush without care.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2134832">Expand</a></span>

It also contains questionable game-play decisions, such as no FOW, no tactical overlays, no difficulty setting (the game is way to easy), no way to change squad formation. If compared to the old Jagged Alliance 2, the game is also lacking in content and strategic gameplay.  Gone is the need to train militia, now the militia pop up when you capture a place, unarmed though so you need to collect weapons and run around handing them to every single militia soldier in the area, and if you want to upgrade their weapons you have to do the whole thing again. This is dreadfully boring and time consuming. Gone is also the doctor/patient healing system in which you only could bandage your soldiers in tactical view, and then had to use a doctor to heal them up in strategic view.  Instead you now fully heal your soldiers in 5 secs when using heal kits in tactical view, without any kind of debuff. And as your characters don&#xC2;&#xB4;t die instantly when getting to 0 hp (the fall down, and you have a good amount of time to heal them before the die)  you can often just run straight at the enemy using no tactics whatsoever. This takes away all the realism that helped make Jagged Alliance 2 so good, and makes for a really boring game.<br><br>If you want to play a tactical squad based game, go play Jagged Alliance 2 or good old X-com (or wait for the remake from Fireaxis). Or if you do not like turn-based games, go play Fallout Tactics, which lets you chose if you want to play real time or turn-based. Do not buy Jagged Alliance: Back in Action, you will be disappointed!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2138317">Expand</a></span>

It allows for strategy, planning, and management without sacrificing action and pacing.  You lead your heavily-armed squad as it carves its way through heavy resistance across the detailed 3D locations of Arulco.  The main strength of this game is the Plan &amp; Go feature.  This allows you to pause the game at any time and issue detailed orders to your squad.  These orders range from movement commands-- stances, facings-- to combat commands-- targeting specific enemies and specific body parts, throwing grenades.  These waypoints can then be linked (synced) resulting in coordinated maneuvers and take-downs.  Once the mode is exited the game un-pauses and your mercenaries carry out their orders as you watch the carnage.  If something changes, simply press the space-bar, go back into the P&amp;Go mode and adjust your tactic to the new situation.  This system allows the best of both worlds:  Old-school turn based aficionados (like myself) don&apos;t need to fear an RTS click-fest that our arthritic fingers can&apos;t keep up with.  Young-pup BF3 lovers get the pacing, action, and exploding ragdolls that they love.  Everybody wins.  It&apos;s like Rainbow 6 (the original), with a birds-eye view of your troops and the ability to make on-the-fly corrections to your plan.  In what other tactical sim can you actually plan a detailed breach and clear and watch the AI carry it out?  The tenets of squad-based warfare actually work in this game.<br><br>If you&apos;re looking for Jagged Alliance 2; this isn&apos;t it.  If that fact automatically makes the game awful, that&apos;s fine, but I didn&apos;t buy it looking for its predecessor.   The fans of 2-decade-old turn based games feel that their X-Com&apos;s and JA2&apos;s are becoming extinct.  They are angry with developers who can&apos;t or won&apos;t fund their (admittedly unprofitable) type of game, and some of them have taken to trashing this game ever since the announcement that it wouldn&apos;t be turn-based, and that their precious mercenary characters would have new portraits...<br><br>The game is not without bugs, it is coming from a small production team and lacks some polish.  However, I have been able to easily overlook the bugs, inconsistencies and quirks of the game because it is far better than any of the recent X-Com knock-offs, and it is fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2137386">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s still a solid tactic game with a lot of fun. Most bugs are already patched so negative reviews should be &quot;upgraded&quot;.<br><br>Graphics - good as for tactic game and detailed enough to know that enemy is using sniper rifle and that there is a pistol on the ground next to wall. That&apos;s more than you need to plan and fight your battles! DX11 and ultra details are no needed.<br><br>Sounds - average. Mercs voice acting could and should be better but since they don&apos;t talk too much i can ignore this. Weapons sounds like in game from 2000r. but still acceptable. For sure the worst part of this game.<br><br>Game play - real time action + active pause is good for dynamic battles. I don&apos;t miss FOG but it will be added in patch soon(for fans). I could even accept that you can climb only where DEVs let you and blow up only where they let you. The only thing that i&apos;m angry about is AI. You must do everything manually because mercs wont even turn back if they are getting hits from behind. The same zombie AI for Militia which is useless for almost anything(promised to be patched) but  what is strange &quot;great&quot; Ai of enemy soldiers. They can see and hear almost everything + they are rushing like hell so keep a fast shooting gun near you ;)<br><br>After 40h of playing(75% of game for me) still funny and interesting, that&apos;s why i don&apos;t regret buying this game and that&apos;s why 8/10 from me :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2157798">Expand</a></span>

But to be honest a lot of the criticism is exaggerated...and there is a lot that this games does BETTER than JA2 did - I think the strategy map, for example, is much better designed in this game.  And, lets be realistic about this - this game shows a lot of potential, and if it sells well the developers will hopefully be supported in producing an even better addition to this genre.  For now though, I am really enjoying another trip around Arulco.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2137412">Expand</a></span>

Game lacks of many, reaaally many features that made the game enjoyable ( check for this list on developers forum ). The game mechanics are dumbed down so hard that every single fight looks the same. Game is released with no thought about later gameplay ( imagine u have to micromanage every item by running your character to pick it up, run around again to deliver it somewhere - yup no convenient sector inventory, after capturing 4 or 5 locations ( about 20 of them in a game) and having 4 or more ( becouse the militia is hopeless and even with best kevlars/rifles they get wiped out by a smaller force of axe armed AI to capture and hold more locations you will need at least 8 ) mercs it becomes a serious issue, last time it took time 30 mins JUST to manage items in captured territory - barracks ), hell u cant even manage inventory of your mercs during they journey on world map - thats totally ignorant and bad. NO FOW - you can see every enemy on the map from the beginning, no comment on this one...<br>To be honest the list goes on and on, check this out on developers forum or steam platform... For me the game is only a quick cash grab , after many hours ( got 20 hours already) Iam really fed up with this. The only cure for the game is the modding scene but the devs clearly state they won&apos;t help at any means...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2134938">Expand</a></span>

They take a big name like Jagged Alliance and proceed to take a dump on it, sort of like they did with Dungeons. They played it into being in the spirit of Dungeon Keeper, and it was nothing like it. This game is crap too, rather buy JA2 on Steam for way less, and get the community patch.</span>

I enjoyed it a great deal, especially the unique characters and voice talent (hard to find in current indie games) and found that it in general was an improvement, but it&apos;s not without it&apos;s rough edges. I would say that if you know you already like tactical RPG&apos;s and deep strategy, either turn-based or Plan-and-Go, I would go for it without hesitation. If you are unsure about the genre, this one has a learning curve and poor documentation (though a friendly community forum) and you might be better off starting with the UFO: After series and working up to it.
<br>
<br>The plus&apos;s are a reasonably comepelling story, and an interesting (though fixed) map that is different from Zone-to-Zone maps common in the XCOM tradition, a well thought out Plan-and-Go features. Cons are fidgety pathing (in crowded or cluttered settings, Plan-and-Go becomes &quot;Plan-and-Babysit&quot;), simplified / unrealistic weapons properties (weapons which use different ammo from what the actual weapon in the real world does, holographic sights that increase the aiming accuracy of sniper rifles, etc), and the lack of good item inventory management tools that leave the player spending game time sorting spoils.
<br>
<br>Another feature is that it&apos;s hard, and punishes conservative play. Without spoiling, I would just say that a player should be mentally prepared to take territory and lose it again rather than protect a small territory to the death.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2266994">Expand</a></span>

I think this game does have potential, but i wish they would have created a new game and not slapped JA on it.  Alone (and in a different country), it would have had it&apos;s own room to grow.  The errors in this though, are pretty terrible.  I hope the full version is not as terrible as the demo version, but if it is, I see no joy in playing it.  I had only 4 mercs, and it was terrible trying to micromanage the four during a firefight.  If you give me a game where I can change formations (line, wedge, column, etc) while at the same time the mercs act like PROFESSIONALs and cover their sector for 360 degree security, that would be pretty neat.  Of course, something would need to be done for engaging, like a button to select for fire at will, or only fire when engaged, etc would be even better.  In short, they should be able to defend themselves if I&apos;m not looking directly at them.  As I mentioned earlier, I would totally buy another JA if they took JA2 and placed it in a different country and just improved some of the key problem areas that have been identified.  Why completely revamp the entire game process, when JA2 was such a success?  Every attempt to make the game &quot;3D&quot; has not lived up to the hype...Brigade E5 was enjoyable, but it became so monotonous.  The missions weren&apos;t even worth doing (take this package here, blah blah).  I ended up going around the country killing everyone for the combat, and not caring about the end of the game.  Just bring back the original JA2 (something like Unfinished Business will work), so I can spend my hard earned money on a quality game.  Take BIA back to the shop, fix it, call it something else, and I will buy that as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2144205">Expand</a></span>

<br>2. Destruct-able environment - you can place c4 only on walls who marked by developers - that is irritating. You can destroy some concrete walls but unable to even scratch some wall buildings.
<br>3. Weapon modifiers - you have some gun and want attach silencer  and optical scope? You can&apos;t - you have to choose 1 modifier.
<br>4. No penalty for wounds. As long as doctor can revive him(her) - your mercenary can be good as new in no time.
<br>5. Sometimes you merc &quot;can&apos;t make the shot&quot; ... without reason.
<br>Those &quot;mistakes&quot; i can remember right away, maybe there is couple more in long run. But even this amount is enough for me.
<br>
<br>Maybe developers tried - but i don&apos;t believe in it. For me it seems as they trying just to get some easy cash. Game lack too much of detail which made game of this genre enjoyable. Hell, i can remember X-COM apocalypse (you can use similar real-time based control mode instead of turn based one), but at least in 1997 i had fully destructible environment and buildings with multiple floors.
<br>
<br>This game should be heavily reworked or modded to make it worth buying. In result i recommend you buy JA2 and get 1.13 patch for example - you get much more (yep that is not 2012 graphic and it is turn based, but it cost less and it is better).

The User Interface is awkward and counter-intuitive.  Moving the camera around involves holding down the alt-key. Cameras are a semi-standardized part of gaming- I&apos;m not sure why they chose to go with something that didn&apos;t work over something established that does work.  I haven&apos;t seen a way to click on an enemy and have my character move towards it and fire.  It seems like you have to first move your character into range, and when it&apos;s just right, they&apos;ll start firing.  There may be a way to do this, but even if there is, it isn&apos;t adequately explained.  There are also a number of bugs and little annoyances.  Like when you recruit people, you have to wait for this sequence of a sound of a modem connecting to finish before actually recruiting someone. Even when you first start the game there are a ton of logos you have to click escape from, etc.  I bought this game because I like the concept, and some people gave it positive reviews- so I had hoped the main version would be better than the demo.  I knowingly took a risk, and, so far anyway, it wasn&apos;t worth taking.  In fact, if I can return this game (bought it less than 24 hours ago), then I intend to.  Somebody said this was a rough diamond, and I agree, but I would emphasize the word rough.  Until there is a patch out to *really* fix all the bugs and annoyances, my rating will be at a 2, because for $40.00 I expect a hell of a lot better than what I got.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2145031">Expand</a></span>

Throw in arming civilians in towns you have liberated, usually with the guns and armor you find on bad guys, a need to help protect these areas from warnings of incoming hostiles, and better graphics. There are a few frustrating bits that become much less of an annoyance after playing several hours. Using the camera view becomes more fluid with use, for example. I also see complaints here about things that they obviously fixed (assuming the original reviewer was accurate to begin with), like how you can check &quot;fog of war&quot; before starting a new game if you want.
<br>
<br>I am about 20-30 hours into the game and am having a good time, which is the best review a game can receive, IMO. I&apos;ve been a video game hobbyist since the early 80&apos;s, and still play dozens of hours a week. I rarely submit reviews, but a 5.4 user score is not in line with the current version that I am playing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2908911">Expand</a></span>

Often times you will give orders and sit and curse while your soldiers decide not to shoot. They badly needed testers to play through the game a few times before publishing. You can immediately see all enemy soldiers every mission. This makes stealth completely ridiculous as you can simply wait for the enemy soldier to randomly look the other way before having your character round the corner and knife them in the back. This game rips off Jagged Alliance 2, but strips down all the flavor that makes the game fun. Lets hope fans can try to crack the game and mod it to make it playable.<br><br>If this game weren&apos;t in any way related to the Jagged Alliance franchise I think I would not have the issues I have. The graphical engine isn&apos;t terrible and I think that with a another year and some passion about the original game they could have made this into something fun. I also question the amount of money that went into advertising this release and into the good reviews I&apos;ve been reading that appear to be out of touch with the individuals who actually played the game.<br><br>Before buying this game, go buy Silent Storm. It&apos;s graphics are still superior and they actually took the time to flesh the game out. Oh it&apos;s also 8 years old.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2135442">Expand</a></span>

But I gave it a try a few months after launch, and it&apos;s quite good! I can&apos;t say how it was at launch, but now there are very few bugs so it&apos;s totally playable.
<br>It&apos;s hard enough without being frustrating, worthy of the jagged alliance name :)</span>

I myself have played JA2 since release in 1999 and have enjoyed it immensely; it is one of the few games I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to score as a 10/10.  Its mix of combat, strategic depth and humor have created a lasting appeal that few other games possess (tl;dr I&apos;m a JA2 fanboy).  Unfortunately, Back in Action is a poor man&apos;s version of JA2, inferior in nearly every way that made JA2 awesome.  Let&apos;s start with what BiA did right.  The towns and scenery look good, and a 3d environment is something the series has desperately needed.  The movable camera is generally an asset (though it still has some kinks to work out). Traveling on the overland map has also been modified so that you can choose a &apos;faster&apos; path and can bypass enemy patrols easier.  The major change/feature &apos;Plan and Go&apos; is not as bad as people had been worrying, and in certain aspects it actually does better than a turn-based system,.. though, I still wish there had been an option for turn based mode.  The outfitting of a mercenary with clothing and camo schemes is a pretty nice touch.  Now for the bad.  Probably the most major complaint I have is the removal of the Fog of War.  When you enter an enemy controlled sector, you can immediately see every single enemy and determine what they are armed with, even in the dead of night or if they&apos;re hiding in a building.  Needless to say, this makes scouting, spotting and guarding vulnerable mercs completely unnecessary.  It&apos;s the equivalent of being able to see an enemy base and units in an RTS, or having a form of wallhack in an FPS.  It literally ruins the game, ratchets the difficulty down several notches, and absolutely. must. go.  Another major complaint:  the AI is as dumb as a box of rocks.  They rarely react to gunfire, and if they do, there is an odd prevalence of melee enemies who charge straight into your gunsights while swinging axes.  This might make for an interesting zombie themed mod, but as a tactical shooter it&apos;s kind of silly.  To make things worse, While you are struggling against braindead axe murderers, you are also fighting a battle against the interface, which makes a chore out of trying to do anything that doesn&apos;t directly involve shooting.  Trading items between mercenaries is difficult, weapons autounload when placed in your backpack, weapons can only have ONE attachment, and effective inventory management is nearly impossible with no sector inventory.  Additionally, the changes they&apos;ve made to certain systems remove many layers of strategy.  The levelling up system has been completely revamped - you get enough XP, you level up and spend points on whatever you want.  No more practicing a skill to level it up, shoot enough guys and you can become the best medic ever.  &quot;Training&quot; militia is literally finding a gun and giving it to someone standing around, which is far more expensive, time-consuming, and ultimately ineffective than you might initially believe.  Medkits and repair kits are now essentially &quot;health potions&quot; for mercs and guns.  Rather than a merc getting seriously wounded and spending a few days in the care of your teams doctor, you use a health kit and they are immediately good as new.  Keep in mind however that while repair kits repair weapons, they do NOT repair armor, because that would be &quot;too unbalanced&quot;.  IMP, the creat-a-merc feature from JA2 is noticibly absent, again because of &quot;balancing issues&quot;.  The mercenary portraits are pretty ugly and there is a lot less humor this time around.  There are no more vehicles.  I actually miss the old Ira.  Anyway, I suspect I&apos;m ranting a bit so I&apos;ll try to draw this to a close.  BiA at its core is a literal copy and paste of JA2 (seriously, all the descriptions and text are lifted straight from it) yet it still manages to fail because it is lacking what made people love JA2 - the immersive aspects, deep strategy and black humor.  Despite this, I hold a small sliver of hope for this game due to the modding community.  Already people are working on IMP mods and trying to figure out how to re-implement FoW.  My recommendation, currently, is to give BiA a pass.  If you must play it, wait until BiA lands on the bargain bin then immediately search for mods that might appeal to you - don&apos;t bother with the vanilla version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2139450">Expand</a></span>

<br>What makes a game it&apos;s it&apos;s playstyle - not it&apos;s name. If someone brought out the next Battlefield game, and it was a point and click adventure game...well it wouldn&apos;t be Battlefield would it? Oh yes - in BF now you do &quot;point and click...when you shoot something what else are you doing but &quot;pointing and clicking&quot; dullards might argue, but the point would be the gameplay is the game - NOT the name. Calling this game Jagged Alliance is a mistake. It&apos;s pausible for sure (and that&apos;s rolled out as a reason why it&apos;s &quot;similar&quot;....meh) Taken on it&apos;s own merits it&apos;s a lot more like Commando&apos;s 2 (rather than the first one) and that&apos;s no real bad thing. It&apos;s a solid pausible strategy game - no more - no less. and I would have given it a 6 if it hadn&apos;t tried to hide under the name Jagged Alliance. Remember we&apos;ve got another monstrous garbage pile coming up soon with X-Com - the first person shooter - god save us!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2145048">Expand</a></span>

The game&apos;s major downfall is its lack of realism: Highly experienced and trained mercs are being gun-downed easily by these so-called bad guys.  Often times, I find the enemy has quicker firing and reflex timing on average than my own mercs!
<br>
<br>For the most part, it should be the opposite.  If anything, have lots of enemies for my mercs to have to deal with in any given circumstance in order to circumvent this strange phenomena.  I can understand if there are a few crack elites, but even on easy, bad guys have better response and accuracy time than even Wolf or Raven.  The lowest of mercs should have a better response and firing timing than the &quot;average&quot; opponent.  Not only that, a lot of bad guys  come better equipped than most mercs!
<br>
<br>Other than that, I enjoy the game.  The constant demand on having to be critical all the time against the &quot;average&quot; enemy is kind of a game breaker.  I&apos;d rather bugs than this.  And I&apos;m not looking at an action game experience.  I understand strategy and critical analysis.  Problem is, the tactical side, given the environment, doesn&apos;t fit the mold.
<br>
<br>Another drawback is inventory management at a base level.  Poor.  In addition, not having the ability to pre-plan base defense before an attack is also a drawback.  Very critical factors in any tactical strategy endeavor.
<br>
<br>Despite these drawbacks (which have nothing to do with my personal difficulty level as it does not wanting to crunch through worthless battles of superior militia), the rating I give I feel is complete and whole.  The game could have been better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=3180329">Expand</a></span>

A lot of people are probably letting dissapointment that this isn&apos;t an all encompassing fantasy wishlist effect their scoring.  I have not played Jagged Alliance - but love XCOM etc. Over the years I&apos;ve played every one of the ever worse buggy XCOM games and quite enjoyed them.  What you get here is a SOLID game, maybe a little simpler than the community wanted.  But this is a GOOD game - and it deserves more credit for being so.<br>Also - this game is so easy to mod.  You can change the way the AI responds just by changing a few lines.  I made opening doors with a key near silent as an example - as that seemed off - (ie you find the key to get in quietly - so why would it make more noise than just forcing the lock?)<br>Modded up - this game gets better and better.  The &quot;blue dawn&quot; mod is shaping up nicely as an example to get you started..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2289318">Expand</a></span>

I`ve been a long time fan of JA, finished it back when there were no mods, and even installed it again a month ago, with version 1.13, which is AMAZING. Now, the topic here is back in Action. At first, I didn`t want to buy the game, the lack of fog of war was making the game pretty unplayable, and the interface in general didn`t seem polished enough. Later on, I got into reading about it, getting more information about the company, and my mark of 10 is given in context of the bigger picture I`ve come to see:
<br>
<br>1. I bought the game, JABIA, when I saw patch 1.13, especially because of the major improvements the devs brought since launch. 2. A team of 12 people was working on JABIA, and I think they managed to accomplish amazing things together. 3. some of the original game mechanics are very difficult to remake into a 3d game from a development standpoint, even though fans &quot;expect them&quot; to be there
<br>
<br>If Blizzard released this game, with all the resources they had, my mark would be much lower, but I believe in this development team, think they have great potential ahead of them given enough resources, as well as if they change their business plan a bit to be more reactive to fans and critics feedback.
<br>
<br>Looking forward for more productions of JA,
<br>
<br>All the best,
<br>Alex</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=2591279">Expand</a></span>

Even two weeks ago I started to play again Jagged Alliance 1 with lovely chats of Ivan Dolvitch in russian. I completed Jagged Alliance 2, JA2 Unfinished Businesses and also played modded versions of JA2. Ok.. so what I expected from JABIA (Jagged Alliance Back in Action) ? I expected the same turn based game and was really disappointed that game will be playable on in real time...... but when I started playing more and more I have to say (and please don&apos;t hang me on the tree... :)) that this version is really good!! Now why? Before I go into the details I will start with small items which makes the game better in many aspects then JA2:
<br>1. knives and matchetes are finally usable -  in JA2 you can do nothing useful with the knife, knives were useful in JA1, but in JABIA you can kill the enemy with single cut
<br>2. you can but good weapons, grenades, armors almost from the beginning of the game (in JA2 new guns most of the time where to week for current power of enemies)
<br>3. armours can not be repaired - this is wonderfull (!) - you need to buy new instead of repairing them
<br>4. explosives are finally usefull... the same with land mines.
<br>5. you can join militia defending cities in the middle of a battle
<br>6.... there is a lot more which I won;&apos;t name at the moment.... just play it and discover
<br>
<br>And in general is the game worse comaring to JA2 ? Nooo.. it is different. Real time fight is realy realistic. You can create ambushes hiding in woods with good camuflage without beeing spoted by enemym, you can play command style - taking knife and silently killing enemies who does not expect attack from the back, you can play sniper style by killing each and everyone from distance. What is better? Enemies IQ is quite good for me. Enemies at certain levels of experience does not come close to you, they can try to ambush you, snipers can shoot you from distance and you will not see them without mercenaries with good perception (but even then they can have good camo so that killing them is hard). I could write about many aspects which makes this game worthwhile, but I really suggest to try (playing tutrial first to see what options there are)... so does the game lack anything from JA2? Yes many things:
<br>1. there is not SCI-FI - oh well... for some people this was redundant part from JA2
<br>2. Faces of mercs are not cartoon-like - oh well... this is 3d world so they are 3d, but still they are different and people saying that they are alike are wrong... take a looke at your friend sitting next to you. Maybe you will notice that in real world we are all alike - and this is how JABIA presents mercs - if you give to all them the same helmets and glasses they will look almost the same... wow like soldiers in real world.. so is there any problem with this ? I don&apos;t think so.
<br>3. turn-based combat - yes...I love turn based games.. I love XCOM and like to play chess... but this is JABIA - it is not turn based game - it is realistic game, so just deal with it
<br>4. ... probably even more, but the point is that almost for every &quot;lack of something&quot; there is a reason behind it and this reason is in most cases &quot;realism&quot;
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t want to say that the game is better, worse or equal to JA, Deadly Games, JA2.... it is simply different but really exciting and I love playing.  I&apos;m treating it as a different approach to the series - having similar plot, the characters (mercs), place (Arulco) and rules (jamming weapons, lockpicks that needs to be taken etc.).
<br>
<br>People who are giving bad reviews are, in my opinion, mostly frustrated that it is not turn-based and forget to pay attention to what is good... and there is a lot of good in JABIA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=4177652">Expand</a></span>

Pourtant &#xE7;a devrait fonctionner vu qu&apos;on peut m&#xEA;me encha&#xEE;ner les actions dans une file d&apos;attente comme bien des jeux de r&#xF4;le utilisant ce syst&#xE8;me de combat. Durant la pause, on peut voir &#xE9;galement les c&#xF4;nes de vision des ennemis comme dans un vieux Metal Gear sauf qu&apos;ici les c&#xF4;nes sont &#xE0; 180&#xB0; dans un souci de r&#xE9;alisme (on suppose).
<br>
<br>R&#xE9;alisme... Fallout Tactics en avait aussi mais il proposait une interface proche de la perfection. Or, c&apos;est loin d&apos;&#xEA;tre le cas ici. L&apos;inventaire est sp&#xE9;cifique &#xE0; chaque personnage et devient rapidement un beau merdier avec ses petites cases &#xE0; la mords-moi-le-noeud. Et pas moyen de changer les raccourcis des contr&#xF4;les, on ne peut rien configurer. Mais le gros probl&#xE8;me c&apos;est le niveau tr&#xE8;s &#xE9;lev&#xE9; des ennemis d&#xE8;s le d&#xE9;but du jeu qui met un peu plus en exergue la nullit&#xE9; de ses mercenaires &#xE0; soi (3 au maximum avec l&apos;argent qu&apos;on a), lents, idiots, avec des gilets pare-balles en papier et qui ne savent pas viser.
<br>
<br>Avec des ennemis nombreux qui patrouillent et qui ont un champ de vision de 180&#xB0; et qui parfois vous d&#xE9;tectent au del&#xE0; (!), l&apos;infiltration est quasi impossible et d&#xE8;s qu&apos;on affronte plus d&apos;un ennemi, on se fait laminer en 2 balles et 3 mouvements. Pas de syst&#xE8;me de couverture, environnements tr&#xE8;s ouverts, nulle part o&#xF9; se cacher. Le jeu est tr&#xE8;s agr&#xE9;able graphiquement certes, mais au bout de quelques heures &#xE0; neutraliser un par un les vilains sans se faire r&#xE9;p&#xE9;rer &#xE0; 400 m, on commence &#xE0; se faire chier avec ces tanches de mercenaires dont l&apos;exp&#xE9;rience &#xE9;volue tr&#xE8;s (trop) lentement.
<br>
<br>A ce rythme, on mettra 200h &#xE0; reconqu&#xE9;rir l&apos;&#xEE;le : non, la vie est trop courte pour se faire chier avec un jeu de merde.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jagged-alliance-back-in-action/user-reviews?user_review_id=7232011">Expand</a></span>
