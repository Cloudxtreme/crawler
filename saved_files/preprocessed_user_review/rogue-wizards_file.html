<br>
<br>pro:
<br>
<br>- nice graphical style (although minimal animations)
<br>- engaging concept of turn based simultanous moving/acting
<br>- interesting item levelling system
<br>
<br>con:
<br>
<br>- visual grid is WAAY too small - limiting the view distance to something like dense fog
<br>- sound and music are rather poor
<br>- Monster balancing is rather bad in my opinion. Too many monsters have abilities that are unavoidable and/or able to stun-lock the player. Furthermore bosses dish out and take damage hundredfold (or so it seems) compared to normal mobs. I had a boss that would have an unavoidable ranged attack from the very fringe of my vision - that would one-hit-kill my fully healthy character. All other mobs up to that boss followed a steady but easily managable difficulty curve.
<br>- The game only allows the player to craft the very important potions at randomly spawned cauldrons. At the same time it does not allow the player to own more than 5 potions at any given time. Health is not regenerating - and as said before - many attacks are unavoidable.
<br>It comes down to very unfair situations where you ran out of health potions - with no means of healing up... no matter how careful you proceeded.
<br>
<br>However - as it stands ... this would be a great game for tablet and/or mobile phone ... kind of. But for PC ... it is too simplistic, too flawed to be anything but average at best (and because there are not too many games around that do the same)
<br>
<br>If you do like dungeon crawlers with permadeath, procedural generated environment, lots of equipment, crafting and simultanous semi turn based acting .... i suggest you get Sword of the Stars the Pit ... it is superior in every way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rogue-wizards/user-reviews?user_review_id=6737021">Expand</a></span>

You have no visual customization options over your toon and all items of each type look the same. Also, body armour, boots and hats don&apos;t show on your character. This does not interfere with the mechanics but it&apos;s always nice to see your avatar change; it gives you the satisfaction of progress.

<br>
<br>First of all, this game reminds me greatly of the &apos;Braveland Trilogy&apos; and that being said you can already create a pretty good idea about, &apos;&apos;if you&apos;re actually going to like it or not&apos;&apos; because i know such games might be a bit too boring for some.. I&apos;m a bit of a geek so i guess i couldn&apos;t go wrong with owning a copy of this nice looking and fun to play game.
<br>But again, it&apos;s just like i said before, you&apos;ll either going to love or hate it but that doesn&apos;t make this a bad game if you don&apos;t like it.
<br>And that&apos;s precisely why i&apos;m letting you guys know, why i personally like this game a lot.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s talk about the graphics: The game looks pretty nice and cartooney (like Braveland and such) and the animations are nicely done although don&apos;t expect blitzes all over the screen or bright flashes because this game is by all means not a AAA graphical masterpiece! But all in all, it looks pretty nice, it doesn&apos;t glitch and it works well with everything else.. So what&apos;s not good about that, right?
<br>Let&apos;s talk about the music/sound: The music for this game is pretty much kept simple although the tunes are catchy and the animation/effects etc all sound just as one would expect from such a game. It works pretty well together impo.
<br>Now let&apos;s talk about the gameplay: The gameplay is set up in turnbased mode as soon as you encounter enemies or obstacles such as hidden traps etc. The grid/map is also devided in tiles, so each step you make will be on one of those tiles each turn. While in battle (outside battle those limitations are absent) you&apos;ll need to do some planning as to whether to move, change weapons, cast spells or heal yourself during the turn/time you&apos;re given. Everything is done in steps so make note of that when you&apos;re used to playing a dungeon crawler and you like to rush in like Rambo because this is not such a game.. You will be whimpy at first, but soon enough you&apos;ll be wearing nice armor, wielding massive weapons and using destructive spells (you can explore, craft/sell stuff) all at the same time which i personally think is a really nice way to let you as a player experiment freely. Also you&apos;ll earn a ton of experience along the many main and sub quests, so each time you earn a level up you can invest those points into 3 separate skills such as Power, Finesse, and Stamina. (and you&apos;ll unlock more buildings along the way too that upgrade/sell you all kinds of neat stuff..)
<br>
<br>There are 3 primary character based skills, namely: &apos;Power, Finesse and Stamina&apos;..
<br>Power: Speaks for itself as it will allow the player to boost the strength of the character, including increasing the damage output for all his attacks.
<br>Finesse: Is your basic dodge, shield, luck counter that will affect pretty much everything you do so don&apos;t ignore that skill!
<br>Stamina: Works hand in hand with Power, because both make sure you can remain longer in tough battles while making it possible to dish out a world of hurt to those that seek to end you (it&apos;s a Roguelike right)..
<br>However, you&apos;re always accompanied by 1 or two minions etc that can usually hold their own pretty well, unless cornered by bosses or packs of poisonous blobs etc.
<br>After completing missions you will be rewarded by gaining additional magic points that you can freely spend in the magic skills department which is always helpful when you would or better said will be encountering tougher enemies and bosses. Note that each enemy has resistances and weaknesses so make sure to spend those points at the earliest sign you&apos;re encountering foes that are immune to your current skill/weapon sets etc.
<br>Don&apos;t worry though, because you can freely adjust your character within any level so just keep your eyes open when you&apos;re facing an enemy because it will be made clearly visible as to what his/her strengths and weaknesses are.
<br>
<br>I can say much more about this fun game, but it is probably best that i don&apos;t spoil you guys too much and so all that&apos;s really left for me to say is, get the game at a sales and play it just like i did and hopefully you&apos;ll enjoy it as much as i do too.
