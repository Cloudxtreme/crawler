I have played the game for hours just for this feature, but once it wears off you are left with flawed and rough game mechanics and plot. Plot is bad, but not critically so, I&apos;ve seen worse. The gameplay features firefights mainly at under 200m with very unrealistic features (such as shooting through corners due to bullet tracing form the crosshair rather than the gun, and using 3rd person to peek and scout the area). The actual situations it places you in as a sniper are also poorly chosen, as most snipers excel in situations of patience, strategy and long-range targets. Forget all of that; it is very linear and confined, and you have will be just as good firing quick snapshots between sprints as you would if you crawled to a good spot, steadied your heartbeat, controlled your breathing and took a good shot. Additionally you just shrug off bullets call of duty style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2331877">Expand</a></span>

The game will intermittently send you in shooting where your shooting prowess will determine your victory. This is the kind of game where you need lots of patience, but the  game is stealth shooter.</span>

I&apos;m generally not a fan of third person shooters but decided to give it a shot and boy was it worth it. The way Sniper Elite is designed, with stealthy and tactical elements, it&apos;s perfect with a third person view and the ability to look around corners etc without peeking out. The graphics are great as far as I&apos;m concerned, very realistic. The audio is pretty good too - the only thing I could complain about is that the 360 angle isn&apos;t always that perfect, having been spoiled with games where I can tell precisely by sound from where the enemy is coming, sometimes it isn&apos;t as accurate in this game which can be a little annoying.
<br>
<br>The plot and the actual gameplay are overall good. I like the fact that even me (who is rather good at online FPS games but usually sucks at single player ones) can easily jump into the action by choosing the beginners mode called cadet mode. The controls are very straightforward and well explained during the first mission. The gameplay is a mix of sneaking or crawling around and taking out enemies silently with your pistol and sniper rifle, and also during some parts you will be engaged in more close combat and forced to take out your machine gun and go rambo. The games has it&apos;s ups and downs of course and some sections are a little boring but at times I truly feel like a sniper during WWII and the bullet cam/x ray cam really adds to this sensation. Nothing beats peeking out only to deliver a fatal headshot from hundreds of meters away and then see the Nazi&apos;s brain being all splattered.
<br>
<br>The only actual problem with the game that I have is the limited amount of secondary weapons/ammunition. I mean the things you start out with, a silenced pistol which is great at close range but sucks even at short distances and a machine gun that has very little ammo and is certain to gather the enemies attention isn&apos;t very useful. More often than not I find myself having to rely on my sniper rifle, even in close quarter combat where I have to bring out my noscope/quickscoping skills. But hey this is something I can overlook as I love using the rifle anyways.
<br>
<br>If you want constant action and think it is boring to slowly crawl on the ground while infiltrating a base or spending a few minutes scouting the surroundings with your binocular to find where the enemies are located, then it may not be for you. But if you are looking for realism and having to think before you act rather than just go crazy with heavy artillery then it is certainly something you should try out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3984740">Expand</a></span>

Vale a pena compr&#xE1;-lo, a ambienta&#xE7;&#xE3;o  sensacional e apesar de ser dif&#xED;cil se acostumar com a jogabilidade (troca de armas, precis&#xE3;o, etc), voc&#xEA; pega o jeito logo na segunda fase. Eu gostaria de um pouco mais de &quot;stealth&quot; e espionagem, por isso darei apenas 8 pontos.</span>

<br>I wasn&apos;t expecting much, but it it&apos;s a fine WW2 shooter. The sniper missions are interspersed with parts of machine gun action, so it feels like a single player one man hero.
<br>
<br>I prefer first person perspective for many reasons. The weakness of third person shows up in this. That&apos;s running and turning is tricky. Zooming in changes rotation speed. Those kind of mechanical functions that feel a little off. However when you zoom on an enemy it goes into first person, and the mix gives it that something else.
<br>
<br>I simply can&apos;t rate it low when I got it free. I had plenty of great moments in my first time through, and will re-run it sometime. Maybe when I have a more powerful GPU, I will re-play. On max settings this looks good and is thirsty for graphics hardware: even a GTX660 will struggle under 25fps. Maybe if I can work out how to run DX10, or 9, instead of DX11, I may squeeze a few more frames out.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know what it is about sniper shooting that I like so much. Maybe it&apos;s getting the enemies down without being too close to the heat. Whatever it is, you get your stealth and slow-mo shots in this game. For me, I never got bored of that, and wished it was longer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4486600">Expand</a></span>

I am an amateur WWII historian so my opinion may be biased when it comes to games based in this era, but it also means I&apos;m a good judge of historical accuracy in WWII games and I must say, this game got a lot more things right than it did wrong.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve seen comments about it being an &apos;arcade shooter&apos; and while I can&apos;t disagree with that completely, there is a lot more here than &apos;a basic shooter&apos;. The main draws are the bullet physics and Kill Cam, and Rebellion got both of those right. I&apos;m not sure if some of these people were playing it on easy mode, but if you turn the difficulty up to Sniper Elite (you can even define custom difficulty levels) the physics and AI become brutally unforgiving. I loved that part of it because I enjoy games that are hard to beat. Some people don&apos;t. But those people needed to specify what difficulty they were using when they said how easy it was. There&apos;s a strong multiplayer and co-op component and the achievements and in-game challenges add a ton of replay to this too. The story is good and, yes, it is very plausible. It takes place during the last days of the Third Reich when the Iron Curtain began to come down in eastern Europe. The enemies you fight are mostly Nazis, but the missions and even some levels focus on the Russians and their involvement with the Nazis after the fall of Berlin. Specifically the story is about the US trying to get to Hitler&apos;s &apos;Wonder Weapons&apos; before the Russians do  and that all happened in reality. Granted there wasn&apos;t some lone wolf sniper collecting everything and killing everyone for the US government, but everything else is quite accurate in historical context.
<br>
<br>Anyway, those are my thought. If you like FPS action games you will like this. If you like WWII-era games you will probably like this. Wait for it to go on sale for $10 and buy it, or better yet buy the bundle with the DLC. The DLCs add a ton of replay to a game that already had a lot of replay potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3813960">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
Unlike a lot of &quot;realistic&quot; shooters nowadays such as Battlefield and Medal of Honor, this game actually has a decent story! It is set near the end of World War 2, an American Sniper named Karl Fairburne is set out to prevent a nuclear disaster (avoiding as many spoilers as I can).

<br>Pros:
<br>Unlike a lot of &quot;realistic&quot; shooters nowadays such as Battlefield and Medal of Honor, this game actually has a decent story! It is set near the end of World War 2, an American Sniper named Karl Fairburne is set out to prevent a nuclear disaster (avoiding as many spoilers as I can).
<br>The visuals are awesome, but slightly bland. In some levels, the lighting effects are absolutely gorgeous and the same goes for the shadows. I really felt like it immersed me in the game and really fit the tone perfectly.
<br>The sniping is heavenly awesome. On harder difficulties, you have to fight against wind movement, forcing you to perfectly align your shots. When you get a kill, it feels really satisfying and rewards you with a breathtaking, yet gruesome kill-cam which shows you where you hit your target.
<br>The narration is perfect. Whether it be during cutscenes in between missions or in the mission briefing, it is well acted and swiftly progresses the story forward.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>There is a multiplayer, but it isn&apos;t even worth mentioning. From my experience, it is horrible. I don&apos;t think that the gameplay style of Sniper Elite v2 fits a multiplayer atmosphere.
<br>
<br>Overall, I think that Sniper Elite V2 is a fantastic WW2 shooter and it really immersed me from the beginning. Multiplayer is horrible though. Maybe its better in Sniper Elite 3.

The game will intermittently send you in shooting where your shooting prowess will determine your victory.

<br>Game it self is solid , especially because i played it after Sniper ghost warrior 2.
<br>Scenery of devastated battlefield brings authentic atmosphere, and the sounds of surrounding war are also good.
<br>Graphics on max are good, I enjoy it i visual terms.
<br>Game is  pretty linear but exchanging fire with other snipers on the battlefield is superb.
<br>Kill cam is great. Gadgets that you carry gives you ways to improvise which is good and fun. Maybe combat in small spaces is a little clunky, i  didn&apos;t like it.
<br>All in all to those who love to snipe and WWII games  has my recommendation</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4311655">Expand</a></span>

Killing them is no challenge at all, and ultimately not a lot of fun. Even when you have to escape from a bunch of snipers, they are pretty lame-ass. Why do they all have to just sit there and get shot? Can&apos;t they move around a bit and take up new positions when they are getting shot at? And, why is each cannon-fodder Nazi so poorly trained that they just constantly run into the line of fire, and show no signs of working together to take out a threat at all? 3) The missions themselves are really linear, and don&apos;t offer much in the way of variety or open-ness - like shooting ducks in a barrel. 4) Graphically things are ok, but still doesn&apos;t feel like you&apos;re playing a current shooter than costs &#xC2;&#xA3;25.<br><br>However, despite my gripes I did find myself playing away til the end (took about 6-7 hours on Medium difficulty). The kill-cam is brilliant fun, and sniping really is the name of the game as you do not last long, trying to take the baddies out with a pistol or machine-gun. One thing I will say though is if you pre-ordered, then the Assassinate the Fuhrer mission is a bit of a let down. If the game had cost less then I would actually recommend that 3PS shooter or sniper fans check it out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2334723">Expand</a></span>

Stealth mechanics are not perfect but they are still pretty fun. Smgs are the worst thing ever clearly just put in so your enemies have a reason to run at you. my advice is to only use pistols and rifles (with rifles if you press cntrl you only zoom in a but making it perfect for picking of those annoying Russians) Graphics look pretty damn good maxed out and wont stress your system too much. On pc there is co-op (level based and wave style and a few other game types) as well as vs (which supervised me in how well it works) one criticism of this is on hardcore 1 team can dominate the other far to easily. Overall very enjoyable with some challenging achievements, hope there will be some expansions packs (im think enemy at the gates style)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2326889">Expand</a></span>

It gets repetitive and in some cases makes the game hard to play as a sniper. You get in to close quarter fights that you can only really survive by pulling out the pistol or machine gun to complete. And it amazes me that every single enemy in the area instantly knows exactly where you are once you fire a shot. In an urban setting with buildings, streets and walls, the sounds of gunfire would echo and be pretty difficult to pinpoint. A good distraction for a few hours maybe, but I&apos;m not planning on finishing it.

Sadly, everything else fails miserably. Movement is very awkward, visually and technically. You can&apos;t jump: you can just &quot;vault&quot; (in a very linear way: some tall obstacles are climbable, while others, much lower, are not). Taking cover is a matter of luck. Sometimes an object will activate the &quot;take cover&quot; option, other times the same identical object - in a different place - will not. Which, as you can imagine, leads you wandering around the field to find the &quot;correct&quot; place to hide. Stealth is, simply put, horrible. As soon as you shoot, enemies are all over you, making this an &quot;action sniper game&quot; instead than a stealthy one. When you think you found the right tactic to kill your enemies silently, some event that renders your efforts useless is activated, since the game WANTS you to be seen, so that enemies can come running at you, and you have to snipe them before they arrive. Above all that, the areas are extremely linear. No smart places to hide and snipe. No alternative routes. Nothing. When I got Sniper V2 I already knew about the bad critiques, but I thought I might enjoy it anyway. I was SO wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2497042">Expand</a></span>

I like the graphics, displayed at 1920 X 1080. The sound is great, and the storyline is pretty good also. Now the obvious downside to this title that makes it, oh so not worth the expensive horse leg roll of cash many companies are now asking to help retire themselves early. The controls are friggin&apos; &quot;atrocious&quot;. Now come on guy&apos;s! You as developers know when you push a keyboard button to snap off an opponents &quot;head&quot;, and virtually nothing happens? WTF? Of all titles to NOT have complete, precise, control of an extraordinary toggle such as a &quot;trigger&quot; on your &quot;sniper rifle&quot;? This becomes a major FAIL ! Ouch....It&apos;s like pissing in a fan, it&apos;s just that frustrating. As you&apos;re getting your butt shot off in the interim. So, if you&apos;re smart? Like I&apos;m SO very sure many of you ARE, because you&apos;re reading reviews before you shell out hard earned money to these companies for entertainment. WAIT until this goes on sale for about $9.99 from steam or other distributors. And for All of our sake, DO NOT spend more than that! You will be so very much happier if you heed my, and other honest reviewers warnings. Until then, look for other titles that won&apos;t anger you in the process!  I pray I&apos;ve saved other people some money in the process.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2423365">Expand</a></span>

The sound is nice too (especially the weapon sounds!).<br><br>Let&apos;s come to the multiplayer... the biggest negative point here: It lacks of content. There are only 2 modes and 3 maps. But Rebellion already announced that they have a pretty big DLC-plan (FREE dlc&apos;s) which will bring new maps, new modes etc. Let&apos;s hope it doesn&apos;t takes too long!<br>The multiplayer is pure fun in my opinion. It&apos;s very refreshing from all those run &apos;n gun shooters. Running around like a chicken only brings you death here ;) Haven&apos;t played much MP matches yet, but the MP feels pretty balanced to me. There are some bugs (spawnbugs for example) but still the MP feels pretty polished to me.<br><br>Can&apos;t say anything about the coop yet sadly since I haven&apos;t tried it out yet.<br><br>Give the game a chance! Try the demo on steam. I recommend it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2326750">Expand</a></span>

The whole game isn&apos;t a stealth shooter, though. The game will intermittently throw you into unavoidable non-stealth situations where your shooting prowess will determine your victory. Co-op feels solid, although there is a bit too much &quot;Waiting for your co-op partner&quot; for my likes, but I guess this keeps the other guy from running ahead and skipping the best parts. The slow-downs are still in co-op, but they&apos;re much shorter unless you get a REALLY good shot, and it forces both players to watch as the bullet streaks across the sky right into the opponent&apos;s eye or heart. Defiantly worth the buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2320702">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t expect historical accuracy.<br>It is a fun game. You are a one man army.<br>The drop of a sniper rifle bullet over a 100m at an average speed of 500 m/s is going to be 20cm.<br>The physics in this are quite accurate to reality, there is a great scope in how you play this game, whether you decide to be entirely covert and take enemies out with a silenced pistol, lure them out with a mine, or pick them off a sniper rifle, or even just go all gun blazing. There&apos;s a lot of scope to play it in different ways.<br>Yes, there is regenerating health. No, it&apos;s not too ridiculous. If you&apos;ve played the original game, you&apos;d almost certainly have noticed how being killed every 15 seconds and having to reload gets annoying.<br>However, I would agree that it regenerates too fast.<br><br>If your idea of a good game is one that&apos;s historically accurate and obeys all the laws of reality, then get out your bedroom and join the army. Because fighting WWII on a PC in 2012 is hardly realistic or historically accurate either.<br><br>The game looks good, and it&apos;s fun.<br>Only problem is the AI. The AI is unnaturally accurate and keen sighted. They can spot you when you&apos;re four storeys up on a roof, lying on the floor, in a pile of dirt, in the shade, at night, from 300m. And with a machine gun, can hit you 9 times out of 10. With a gun which in your hands you&apos;ll be lucky to hit someone 30m away. And that&apos;s before the recoil kicks in.<br>The enemy snipers are also unnaturally gifted. After some experimentation, I discovered that it&apos;s because their bullets track the player.<br>Yes. When they shoot, the bullets curve just so they can hit you. This means that if, for instance, you are out of cover and move into cover, the bullets will hit the cover (I tried this trick with lamp-posts, worked every time). But if you go from a standing start, and dodge as soon as you see the flash of the sniper, they will hit 100% of the time.<br><br>But apart from the psychic enemies, I thought it was a fantastic game.

I was expecting a sniper game and this is a run and gun: as soon as you fire once, everybody runs around and at you shooting, so you end up running around and shooting as well. I&apos;m so frustrated I bought this and wouldn&apos;t recommend it. Yes, the bullet cam is cool but you get used to it so the fun doesn&apos;t sustain long. Also, tagging is useless because even if you take your time, observing and tagging all enemies, after you fired once, new enemies spawn at random places. That&apos;s a SHAME! The worse part has been a mission that starts by securing the ground before searching for your contact. Once it&apos;s done, you get a message: &quot;The place is secured. Go meet your contact&quot;. You go down and new snipers spawn and start shooting at you! This is simply preposterous.
<br>To me, the only game so far that delivered the real sniping thrill is Sniper Ghost Warrior. I don&apos;t understand why critics destroyed it and acclaimed Sniper Elite V2. I guess people just go with the hype instead of searching by themselves what truly works.

I love FPS WWII games and sniping is my favorite, so I love this game.  Those that don&apos;t, give it lower scores.  It&apos;s not &quot;Rocket Surgery&quot; or anything.  Aren&apos;t game reviews fun?  Dah...  Bottom line, play it if you like the genre, you will be happy with the money you spent.  Now go outside and kill somebody.  You spend too much time in doors.
<br>Spoiler Alert:
<br>You shoot people and they die.  Nothing like real combat, but video games never are.  We should send all the freaking idiots who think that game violence is an issue to a war zone.  They would realize how idiotic their behavior is and how safe their little made up worlds are.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2640219">Expand</a></span>

Let&apos;s start with the positive: The x-ray kill cam is pretty impressive as well as being controversial. I enjoy being able to go stealth around rather than go all brutal. Graphics are pretty but not up-to-par to 2012. Animations are really well done. The coding is this game was very well done but still needs some polish. Each gun also has its own distinctive &quot;style&quot; and weapons may fit only certain people. Weapon mechanics such as wind and how each bullet type has a different speed is great. Now the negative: The bullet drop is really ridiculousness because I shouldn&apos;t have to aim higher when a person is only 80 meters away. The level design is mixed; while the maps appear to look very good and have great atmosphere, the levels are very linear and may become boring because of how you don&apos;t get a lot of freedom to go where you want. The AI is very bad... how can a soldier find me so easily when i&apos;m over 100-200 meters away? Why do they shoot with perfect accuracy with SMGs? Another problem is how dumbed down the SMGs are to the player. As I mentioned before the AI have an easy time aiming with them while when the player shoots the accuracy is terrible. The plot in this game does not exist at all and the history in this game is incredibly f***ed up. Why would the Russians shoot people on their own side? Overall the game is a 6.5 for me. You should only play this if you&apos;re very patient and enjoy sniping.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2329098">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I didn&apos;t mind the first and this is not a bad game as such, but once again it finds it self in the middle of what it wants to be. The sniper game mechanics are quite good however the way maps and missions are designed make it very hard to play it without using other guns as you tend to be swarmed with enemies.
<br>
<br>Once again a lot of potential mostly not fulfilled.</span>

It would be nice to have the option to go through a level totaly silent and undetected, which is sadly not possible in most of the levels in this game.

<br>
<br>Overall, fun game. I recommend this purchase.:</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2728340">Expand</a></span>

I am not exaggerating when I say how gutwrenchingly frustrating and abysmal it is. The character will enter cover on the opposite corner of where you&apos;re standing, he will randomly leave it while you move in cover, he will randomly start receiving full damage as if he weren&apos;t even in cover, he won&apos;t be able to step out of cover to shoot, some obvious cover isn&apos;t usable and so on. There is the AI which will yell &quot;Sniper!&quot; or &quot;Grenade!&quot; and then proceed to stand where it is and stare into the ground. There are also some minor but annoying and ridiculously unrealistic things, like taking a 5-bullet sniper magazine from the table and getting 30 bullets from it, taking 2 grenades and getting only 1, finding sniper ammunition on a foot soldier who uses a submachinegun etc. The developers want to force you to play the game as a stealth operative and a sniper so much, they also unrealistically limit ammunition. You are able to carry up to 100 bullets for your 5-bullet magazine sniper, while only being able to carry 60 for your 30-bullet magazine submachine gun. The stealth element is not very entertaining, while the sniping is a lot of fun, especially on higher levels of difficulty with advanced ballistics. Bullet-cam and x-rays remain very entertaining for the duration of the game, while shooting with other weapons besides the sniper can get boring and annoying very quickly. Levels are linear at first, but start getting more complex with different approaches later on. The graphics are a bit on the downside, but they give a good WWII feeling, and believable enemy faces, you will feel numerous times like you&apos;re killing actual people(bullet-cam adds to it), instead of generic soldiers whose only purpose is to stand in your way. It has decent voice-overs with some familiar voices and a story that didn&apos;t keep me particularly interested, but that is a matter of taste. Sadly, the flaws listed above make the game stick at 5, even though it could have been much better, taking into account the great sniper action.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2908906">Expand</a></span>

However, despite those factors leaving a bitter taste in my mouth, I cannot say that I regret the experience. If nothing else, the sniping is so rewarding as to justify the entire purchase. I don&apos;t know what everyone else is complaining about here. Sure, the sniping isn&apos;t realistic on lower difficulties. That being said, sniping variables can be added to enhance the experience. Enough effort is required to line up your shots that the kill cam at the end feels immensely satisfying. I&apos;m not one of those people who demands perfect realism in their games. If something feels right, I often don&apos;t have a problem with willing suspension of disbelief. As such, I&apos;m willing to overlook some of V2&apos;s flaws. Sniper Elite V2 may not offer the most &quot;realistic sniping experience EVAR,&quot; but it does make the player feel like a vengeful god dealing righteous justice from across the map while still providing a reasonable challenge. In my humble opinion, overlooking some kooky AI and graphical kinks is a small price to pay for such badassery.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2977972">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll probably wait and buy V3 as well.  Now the grrrrr.  I have to wonder if any of the developers actually consulted ballistics tables, much less ever fired a scoped rifle.  Here&apos;s my beef.  The weapons have ridiculously large bullet drops (hold over distance) from 70 meters and becomes little more than guesswork at 200 meters plus.  I guess the concept of rifle zeroing escaped the developers.  It amazes me why the hell they would also give ridiculously long wait times between you breath holds (pulse rate drops) while the enemy sniper can accurately snap shoot you at 2 second intervals.  Haven&apos;t any of these people ever fired a rifle at all?  I&apos;ve never measured it but don&apos;t believe my pulse rate goes up 5 or 6 beats following a shot.  I&apos;d be amazed if this happened to a trained sniper.  My final word: an enjoyable but sometimes frustrating game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4269269">Expand</a></span>

The historical accuracy is pretty much not even there, the gun handling is a joke, the game runs like a obese cow even though it doesn&apos;t look particularly fancy, and it has nothing to do with sniping. You can breeze through the game with out even firing your sniper rifle except for scripted hand-holdey bits. The levels are so linear and filled with so many enemies that you have no options but to mow them all down - which is really easy since you can take 5 sniper shots to the face and regen your health back in under 3 seconds. Which you will have to do often because the enemy can spot your exact position from a mile away - and can track you behind walls.  The story is completely cheese - it&apos;s another America Saves The Day type of story.

Seemed decent enough. First missions went like a charm a bit boring and repetetive altogether but still somewhat fun, so I kept playing. And then I got to the mission Museum something.
<br>Started reading the mission briefing (description) and stumbled. Right there white on black it said: &quot;The Krauts were making a stand at Museum Island, I was happy to let them rot, but helping them slow the Reds was my best chance of buying some time&quot;. WTF?!
<br>Is that what the allies were doing during the war? Help nazis against Russians? Is that what the imagination of the devs told them one fine morning when they tried to come up with a mission concept?
<br>Well I started the mission anyway and what I found there just absolutely shocked me. As an american sniper you need to kill soviet troops to get to your goal? Seriously, bi&#x422;ch? Go fu.&#x441;k urselves a$$hole$! Allies, my ar$e! I just got out from around the conrner and let the first Russian man waste my sorry yankee ar$e for aiding the enemy and uninstalled this ridiculous joke of a game.
<br>
<br>To the devs I&apos;d like to say I hope you burn in the same pit of hell where the devs of Company of Heroes 2 shall certainly wait for you for the same type of &quot;creativity&quot; dishonoring the valor and sacrifice of brave Russian people who protected their Motherland to the last breath and rid the world of nazi menace.

The AI does tend to do gunfights at long range even though they have SMG&apos;s most of the time and you have a sniper rifle which is a small let-down but I&apos;ve seen a few good tactics like covering fire as others run to different cover... but it&apos;s marred by the fact he&apos;s just running to another piece of cover that&apos;s far from your location. The graphics are very well done and don&apos;t tax your PC nearly as bad as other games with the same graphics (so ignore Goden&apos;s review cause his pc probably just sucks lol) cause I find it runs just as good if not better than Skyrim and definitely runs better than Mafia II. With a good patch to revamp the AI? This game could easily get higher ratings from most people.. but time will tell.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2331521">Expand</a></span>

However, Sniper Elite V2 is a no-nonsense sniping game which is fun to play and of decent quality. The bullet cam and sound are especially commendable. What&apos;s great is how you can adjust the difficulty; including the bullet physics. The game is intuitive, fast-paced and has smooth controls. It works well with both a gamepad and mouse &amp; keyboard. Mechanically, the game is robust and this becomes apparent in multiplayer. It&apos;s no Gears of War, and the cover system is a bit fiddly but other than that, one would be pushed to find more flaws in a sniping-focused shooter which delivers all the action without the camping and bird-watching. Sure, the campaign and levels aren&apos;t exactly epic and lack the excitement of sniper missions found in other shooters, but overall Sniper Elite V2 is worth playing if you&apos;re after a fun sniping experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4268130">Expand</a></span>

There is something about that time period that really draws me in.  Even when the entire industry was moaning about &quot;another WWII game&quot; I was consuming with glee.  So when this game came out I was going to buy it right away but hesitated because of the mediocre reviews.  Well I can&apos;t say I regret waiting because I got a great deal through steam, I also feel paying full price for this game wouldn&apos;t have hurt.  GAME:  The gameplay is linear.  So if that is one of those pet peeves of yours just don&apos;t get it.  But if you are open minded and understand that linear games belong on the market as much as side scrollers then keep reading.  The kill cam effect is awesome, the first 30 odd times you see it.  After that it becomes a hindrance and slows the gameplay down.  The sniping feels really visceral and when you make that great shot you get that gruelling ...mmmm yeah feeling.   In the end if you like sniping and don&apos;t mind linear gameplay then buy this game.  And if it is on sale on steam just buy it anyway it&apos;s definitely worth a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2875276">Expand</a></span>

Poor graphics? What are you guys? **** Firstly how many historically accuracy games DO NOT EXIST. Look at call of duty, commandos, brothers in arms. Do they have a &quot;to the letter&quot; acurate storyline at all? Nope. Its fiction dear people. For the level design the game needed to be challenging funneling players into tight spots where the snipers are one side and the opposition on the other side with lead rain being exchanged between them. The whole design is like that to intensify the combat and help people to think quick on their feet with what they have surrounding them. If it was sandbox any retard can camp on a spot and skull all the enemies from one spot, where is the fun in that...ahhhh and the graphics.for the truly **** **** **** mainstream noobs out there, we have almost reached the roof of our current gen graphics, what where you guys expecting? Hologram graphics combined with live video feed taken from a quarter million camera? Come on people think like realists. Now that the bad stuff is away from all the bat**** crazy people on with the review. Sniper elite V2 is like a merging of splinter cell conviction, call of duty world at war(vendetta mission) and a touch of serious sam. Reason for those 3 is simple, splinter cell for the caracter interactions, duck and cover system and the whole interface is also similar. The whole game is like the COD mission, vendetta, except way better. And the reason why I chose serious sam as the 3rd comparative game is for the lack of story covered by brutality and mindless killing. It&apos;s highly amusing to just run around with a rifle, focusing and letting a led asprin rip through the enemies. Every kill feels different, and some of them makes me feel a bit queasy, like when hitting both testicles of a gestapo with one bullet (I feel your pain buddy). Long story made short, an excellent game. Only reason for me giving it a seven is because it kind of falls within mainstream gaming and isn&apos;t exactly something new that springs up in your face causing your world to stand still with amusement. But overall it is very entertaining and truly worth a shot, pun intended for the idiots that do not understand the concept of a pun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2332835">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It would be FAR better as a first person game.  AI is better than some and there are some cool tricks, like waiting for loud noises to fire shots. I just wish that when I screw up and the enemy finds me, I can pull out a pistol and or sub and have a running fight.
<br>
<br>Kill cam is cool. But I can see it getting old. With all the cool traps/explosives that you get it would be better to be able to scout out an area, then plan your attack, but that would be in a sniper game, and this is not. It is still fun, but I think it&apos;d be better with better mechanics. Doesn&apos;t have the replayibility of COD World at War, but still good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2874148">Expand</a></span>

It is a fantasy, because even on higher settings your character regenerates health after being shot, and often will be shot 10-20 times but still complete a mission. The graphics are GREAT. This really feels like 1945 Germany. The game mechanics are GOOD. Shooting is fun, and scoping and moving are fluid. Voice work and sound are GOOD as well. The missions are also fairly good, but we can feel all over the constraints of the consoles in the design. The levels are smallish. There are not enough missions and certainly not enough open maps. A good game but finally it is too small and too short. The missions are great but there is not enough open material to let the player roam about and explore. Future games will need MORE content. Especially more and bigger levels to let the players gain a feeling of excitement in sneaking around and discovering things. It also wouldn&apos;t hurt to have a bigger range of interactions with the environment. People have criticized the AI but IMHO it is GREAT. The enemy units have amazing animations, they move realistically, and relocate and flank very effectively. It&apos;s impossible to shoot easily at range when the enemy will close in and take you down with SMGs from short range. This makes for very exciting gameplay, forcing the player into constant vigilance and motion to avoid the enemy counterattacks.

Besides the whole &quot;sniper&quot; theme premise being thrown out the window with all the full out shootouts instead of appropriate missions , the oh so stupid AI, bullet drop equivalent to 5 times the gravity of Earth, you also get to (and this is the really annoying part) scripted enemy soldiers spawning 15 meters ahead of you or magically appearing snipers in building windows that weren&apos;t there half a minute ago. Really? i mean i get nearby patrols instantly joining the battle but troops that just come out of thin air is beyond ridiculous. Then you have the extremely linear maps that make you wonder why there is a stealth mechanic even in the game, frustrating checkpoint system that makes you do a segment 100 times because of some enemy appearing out of nowhere right next to you thus a lame unavoidable death (which ultimately renders stealth useless). I didn&apos;t honestly expect that it could be so bad because i liked the first one. It had much more going for it at the time and a lot of it&apos;s nice features like camouflage, sneaking past enemy troops, finding alternate sniping nests is either gone or just dumbed down to the extreme. To conclude: It&apos;s hard to enjoy the sniping part of the game when it is basically a run and gun shooter most of the time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2325842">Expand</a></span>

This is the kind of game that, depending on the player, gets a 10 or a 1. I you&apos;re a patriot of anywhere who enjoys shooting Nazis and Soviets in the face/balls and loves getting headshots, this is the game for you. If you&apos;re a Neonazi who somehow doesn&apos;t enjoy making some other poor bastard die for his country (RL-3 quote from Fallout 3, Bethesda, I take no credit), than you&apos;ll probably hate this game. Back to seriousness, long range, EPIC, short range, not so much, really bad actually, but if you&apos;re actually good at the game, there wont be too much close combat. For me, you&apos;ve seen my rating, but I feel for the guys out there rating this game a 3, though I am disappointed. Btw, the only reason I don&apos;t rate this game a 10 is because of one particular level (3rd or 4th, you&apos;ll know, it&apos;s pretty bad).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2452247">Expand</a></span>

I noticed too with some levels that enemies would randomly spawn based on my position on the map. This was really frustrating especially when i played a level for the first time. Id position on top of an arch somewere spend 5 mins tagging enemies making sure i had them all. Strategically killing them all, coming down off my ledge to a bottom of a set of stairs or whatever and then out of no where there are 3 more who spot me. When i KNOW they were not there before i advanced. Kind of ruins the &quot;Stealth&quot; aspect in certain parts. I got the game on sale on steam for 14.99 and for that price its alright but i wouldnt pay a dime more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2785986">Expand</a></span>

The enemy soldiers hang sometimes when they try to run and often take the same route just like their comrades took just a second before and got shot. Not very smart. The music int he game is also annoying. The same part repeats far too often. What I like about the game is the graphics with the excellent lightning effects. I play the game in stereoscopic 3D via native AMD HD3D support that adds even more atmosphere. Also the bullet cam is pretty cool especially in stereoscopic 3D.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2573504">Expand</a></span>

I played the first chapter...and it got already very boring and I don&apos;t feel like continuing. If you shot your first 5 guys well you know the rest. Seriously. I also found the &quot;kill cam&quot; a turn-off, it makes the game less realistic.</span>

<br>There is only 2 major bad things about a game:
<br>1) Sniping is unrealistic easy. They should put more realistic sniping. That&apos;s probably because they made that for console noob players and didn&apos;t improve for PC version.
<br>2) Spawning of enemies is really annoying specially in coop. They suddenly pop from locations which you already explored and cleared. So, exploring is not really helpful because enemies pop up from there later.
<br>
<br>All together fun game with few possibilities to improve!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sniper-elite-v2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2572937">Expand</a></span>
