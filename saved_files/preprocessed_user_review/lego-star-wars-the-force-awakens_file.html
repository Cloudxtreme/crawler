I would say it&apos;s probably fourth- or fifth-best overall, behind Undercover, The Clone Wars, Batman 2, and maybe Years 5-7. This game really has the spirit of Star Wars and the charm of Lego, which is something that&apos;s been missing from recent installments like Batman 3, Avengers, and Hobbit which were probably the worst in the entire franchise.
<br>
<br>Though the latest Lego Star Wars game isn&apos;t the long-overdue Clone Wars sequel or packaged with a remade Complete Saga, it is perhaps one of the longest Lego games to date, with at least 50 hours of gameplay if you&apos;re aiming for 100%. The first four levels or so of the game are overly long and a bit boring but the rest of the game is a return to the kind of Lego fun that&apos;s been missing for three years.
<br>
<br>There are a ton of side missions in the game, including story missions that weren&apos;t featured in the film (such as Poe Dameron rescuing Admiral Ackbar and two levels starring a playable Kylo Ren). The world is as open as it could possibly be in a Star Wars game, as jumping from planet to planet would be a bit challenging to implement, and while it isn&apos;t the open sandbox that Lego City and Batman 2 offered, it&apos;s still really fun to explore.
<br>
<br>Surprisingly, Traveller&apos;s Tales has introduced some interesting new game mechanics into this one. The cover sections of the levels are really fun and bring to mind Uncharted, but maybe that&apos;s just me. The ginormous character roster is another great section of the game, as well as the flying sections (though admittedly not as innovative as Lego Star Wars III&apos;s).
<br>
<br>So overall, this latest Lego game is a great return to form for the slightly tired franchise and really gives me hope for future entries and the probably inevitable Lego Star Wars Rebels, Lego Indiana Jones 3, and Lego Pirates 2 (what with the fifth entries in the two latter series coming up). I&apos;d definitely recommend this to anyone who loved Lego City Undercover and the earlier games but has been disappointed by the recent ones.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lego-star-wars-the-force-awakens/user-reviews?user_review_id=6556911">Expand</a></span>
