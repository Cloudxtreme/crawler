Upon it&apos;s release however, we found that as a small organization none of our needs have been catered for by this release. Quite the contrary, it seems, little or no thought was given to the average player with limited in-game resources, instead this expansion was set up so that only a certain sector of the AO community would be able to benefit from it, while penalising smaller guilds and completely excluding the solo player. That coupled with the numerous bugs that ruin gameplay have made this expansion a dissapointing and frustrating experience for all of my guild. Non of the promised game content has been made available to us and as the in gameadvisors and bug hunters are mostly new volunteers the line from them is &quot;put up or shut up&quot;. No prizes for FunCom this year and definately no pre-orders for future expansions from us. Demonstrations that game site reviewers see often take place on controlled servers with GM supervision, something that in no way reflects the practical realities that ordinary players experience. We will all stick with the game as the previous expansion still has lots to offer but I would advise others without so much experience of Anarchy Online to give the Alien Invasion expansion a miss as it will taint your enjoyment of the wider game. Score 0 out of 10, waste of money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anarchy-online-alien-invasion/user-reviews?user_review_id=376390">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re not willing to trust Funcom with your identity, they will keep the account frozen forever with no alternate solutions. All your time invested in the free account will be lost. There are several discussion threads about this, on Reddit and elsewhere if you want to look them up.
<br>
<br>Some of you may not realize what a huge deal it is to send that kind of personal information to a third party in a foreign country - a company that recently had their forums hacked and is struggling financially. Don&apos;t do it. Sending that kind of information to a third party is illegal (for good reason) in some countries, and even if it&apos;s not illegal in yours - your proof of identity is more valuable than any game account, and the fact that Funcom wants it so badly even though they could verify your ID in other ways should give you pause.
<br>
<br>For the record: this happened to me, and others. I&apos;ve had no issues with my credit card ever, I had a different account that was paid without issues with the SAME credit card as the frozen account, and I didn&apos;t share the account with anyone nor was there suspicious activity. The fact that one account (by the same player) gets frozen but the second account, played at the same time and paid with the same card, does not, should tell you all you need to know about Funcom&apos;s &apos;security&apos; system.
<br>
<br>Avoid this game if you don&apos;t want to risk losing all the time you invested.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anarchy-online-alien-invasion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6684458">Expand</a></span>
