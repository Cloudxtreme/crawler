Do not be fooled. This does not even feel like the continuation to Black Plague. Whereas BP (and probably Overture too, I haven&apos;t played it) was about survival, intense atmosphere and getting scared to death, Requiem has NONE of that. NONE at all. Not a single monster, not a single intense moment. Even the puzzles are silly and frustrating. Whereas in BP it was all about realistic logical solutions to problems to help you survive, with Requiem the puzzle element takes an extremely generic, tedious and repetitive approach. Collect X number of glowing globes/keys to activate a portal and teleport to the next area. Rinse and repeat. There is no storyline, no logical explanations as to why you had to solve a puzzle at hand a certain way, it is simply a mess. It even seems like an incomplete game, as if the developers just created the levels and forgot to put in all the rest that was needed to make this game entertaining.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-requiem/user-reviews?user_review_id=2055030">Expand</a></span>

The atmosphere and theme are still there, as the main character returns to where the first two games took place for some finality in the plot. All plot turns are done in what seemingly feels like memory flashbacks, and some more information is entertained concerning the characters of the overall story. This iteration of the series is not scary, and does not provide the player with any creepy or surprising moments, as the main objective this time around is to solve puzzles. While this is a departure from the previous two games, it is rather enjoyable, even for someone like myself who does not prefer to solve puzzles for fun. Some of the levels later in the game are much more difficult than in the beginning. They do not scale up the difficulty gradually. Suddenly, the puzzles are very complicated. The minute details you are expected to spot are very well hidden, which makes some of these later puzzles frustrating and unreasonably time consuming. I&apos;m not sure how viable the comparison is, but Penumbra: Requiem reminds me of Portal. You are in need of some keys, which in turn, opens a portal to the next level. Even though this third installment of the series is an attempt to complete the story, I am a bit disappointed to say that it does not. At least it does not end the story clearly. This goes along well with the first two parts, and leaves the player wondering, and hoping that all ended well. Being the shortest and more complicated of the three, Penumbra: Requiem was fun for a puzzle game, and it should be considered as such. It took me about 5 hours to complete.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-requiem/user-reviews?user_review_id=2090737">Expand</a></span>

They&apos;ve fully exchanged the horror element for extremely difficult puzzles which, in my opinion, isn&apos;t what Penumbra should be focusing on. Though a game it feels like a DLC for it&apos;s previous and that is why it gets a lower score by me!</span>

In fact, out of all of frictional games, this one almost certainly utilises their physics engine the best.
<br>
<br>Portal is mentioned in reviews very often, and not without good reason  Requiem came out only shortly after Portal, and its influence is seen all over this game. Set in an impossibly huge, underground, abandoned scientific facility  check. Dry, dark humour  check. Boxes on buttons  check. Narration by automated female voice  check. And yes, this game even has portals, although they are set in place and only transport you from one level to the next. I&apos;m sure there&apos;s more, but you get the idea.
<br>
<br>Bear in mind that is not a bad thing. Portal was a great game, and anything like it can&apos;t be all bad either.
<br>So it may be better off going into this game looking for a Portal fix than a Penumbra fix. While it does hover over a few not completely explored plot points from the previous two games, it&apos;s hardly necessary for a proper reading of the story as a whole, and if anything confuses more than illuminates. The hallucinatory undercurrent also makes it incredibly unclear how much of this game  if any  is supposed to have really happened and how much was just in your character&apos;s head.
<br>
<br>From a gameplay perspective, however, it performs solidly as a physics puzzler, and for that reason alone I think it deserves a 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-requiem/user-reviews?user_review_id=3118020">Expand</a></span>

Black plague was not as good but still decent but this was garbage. This is not what I have come to expect from Frictional games (especially now after Amnesia). This series would have been far better off being wrapped up in black plague. No story AT ALL. Absolutely no atmosphere and boring tedious puzzles. After the first 30 minutes I just looked at a walk-through before playing each section simply because I had no desire to waste my time on boring, hard puzzles and besides its not like there were and real spoilers in terms of story. No story , no scares, no atmosphere, no fun and bugs to top it all off. I  understand this was mostly due to financial problems during development but they would have been better of making BP longer and ending the series there. Not worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/penumbra-requiem/user-reviews?user_review_id=4644943">Expand</a></span>
