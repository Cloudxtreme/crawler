As always with Telltale, voice acting is top notch, but this time they use crayon style graphics to set up a casual atmosphere that really gives this game a leisurely feel. Each puzzle is self-contained so there are no multi-level puzzles. It differs from traditional point-and-click puzzle adventures where you usually have to find several items or perform a specific sequence of actions before you can advance. Most of the puzzles are on the easy side, but they do throw in a few brainteasers that aren&apos;t obvious at first. There is a hint system which, if used, lowers your ranking for that specific puzzle, same as if you submit a wrong answer--although it is completely casual so there is really no reason to care about rank anyway. Puzzle gamers will certainly enjoy this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/puzzle-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=2198115">Expand</a></span>

The puzzles are boring (it is not an Quest or Adventure game - don&apos;t be fooled), just what it says - a puzzler. The hints are basically unlimited and rightly so - i could really not get several puzzles at all.  AT ALL!  There was no logic behind them.
<br>The only thing that kept me going through the game was the cartoon and the story.  I will not say that the story is great - but it has this suspense to it, the humor, and lots of potential - which, unfortunately, is never realized.
<br>The voice-over is not bad.  The characters are ok too.
<br>A really mediocre, short, and not really fun game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/puzzle-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=2702748">Expand</a></span>

I couldn&apos;t fully understand the point of one or two puzzles because of ambiguity of explanation about problems in these puzzles. But anyway I solved all the puzzles without using hints including these ambiguous ones without much hustles. Overall storyline is interesting and intriguing, making you to feel like buying a sequel to see what will happen next after the ending of the story in this game. The main problem here is that it is too short for $9.99 and the replayability is not much. I solved all the puzzles in less than two hours. Since I bought it with 60% discount, it might be OK with me. I suggest you to get this game when it is on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/puzzle-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=2097576">Expand</a></span>

Naturally, being a Telltale game, the story is pretty interesting and fairly goofy. It&apos;s short; I completed it in 3 hours. However, the tragedy of this game is that it&apos;s a puzzle game with sub-par puzzle gameplay.
<br>
<br>Several of the puzzles are very poorly made. They&apos;re ambiguous, and you need to make odd assumptions about the puzzles for them to make any sense. Most of the rest of the puzzles are dead simple. There are one or two genuinely difficult puzzles, but it&apos;s hard to identify them among the poorly-made ones, and you just start assuming that they didn&apos;t tell you enough on every hard puzzle. It&apos;s really just a sign of incredibly careless puzzle design, and it would make Professor Layton cry. The puzzle&apos;s solution, as described by the &quot;How?&quot; button, almost never actually describes the solution.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, I can recommend the game&apos;s short story, but it&apos;s sure to piss off any puzzle enthusiasts. Try not to pay any money for this one... should be easy since Telltale loves giving it away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/puzzle-agent/user-reviews?user_review_id=2544617">Expand</a></span>
