<br>Firstly and most important i felt like i was playing test drive 1 again but on a different map, did they realy spend that much time on the handling? with the early vehicles at least i felt like i was driving a box that floats on asphalt although you can feel the surface beneath you on dirt. Secondly on a GTX 295 the graphics dont live up to some of the &quot;ingame&quot; screens ive seen. But understandably being an online game its not going to have the best graphics. Also the highly detailed interiors??? i was driving a lancia and the dashboard looked like a 2d image slapped behing the steering wheel. The mediocre graphics could be because they wanted to include the old hawaii map without totally revamping it but seriously for &#xC2;&#xA3;30 i would have been happy with a brand spanking new ibiza map. When my gtx 580&apos;s arrive ill test again on the graphics as im not sure if the game recognises dx11 or not (probably not being a port) and Thirdly on that point i think that this is just another port and without an update alot of people will be dissapointed after all the hype. NFS Hot pursuit has better handling and graphics im sad to say. I think in general eden have spent far 2 much time trying to make cool avatars and casinos etc and have forgotted its a driving game. I hope a few patches will help the handling as that is my main concern. The game is definetly playable and i will enjoy it but if you want a high quality driving simulation you will be disapointed i think.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1478604">Expand</a></span>

Yes the in game scripting and voice acting is terrible and i havn&apos;t used the &quot;Cosmetic Surgery or Clothes shop&quot; so i don&apos;t really mind them being there. Online is a great laugh and never encounter any issues or lag and 99% of the time there are still plenty of people playing.
<br>So if you have a Controller/Racing Wheel then this game is very much for you. Thinking of playing with Keyboard? then expect to rage and call the game crap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3626491">Expand</a></span>

<br>TL;DR: Sadly, a nice looking game that is infuriating to play, so much wasted potentials.
<br>I play this game  800*600 &amp; low quality with a keyboard, and this game is the most frustrating racing game I&apos;ve played, far more than GRiD, DiRT, DiRT 3, NFS UG2, NFS HP III, NFS PU, SHIFT 2. For starters, the &quot;return to road&quot; function is just revolting, Not only does it take ~2 seconds to activate, it does NOT even activate at all in most cases, wtf? I&apos;m 40 metres off of the road, and the red cross appears, really now?
<br>From there, let&apos;s move onto the aesthetics, which is great overall (damn straight, graphics are this game&apos;s strongest selling point, although I&apos;m not fortunate to enjoy it at max level), but have some game-killing flaws. In many off-road races, I cannot even tell the road from the grass.Even if I play on low, the two should be clearly distinguishable. The choice of clothes are sexist as well, just look at the women&apos;s collection of shoes: none of them are flat, even the sport store sell heels.
<br>Racing schools are indeed a painful thorn as said by many, the tests that involve AI&apos;s (passing &amp; dodging) are the stupidest. The AI follows a predetermined path, at the passing test, I find them constantly hitting my backside after I&apos;ve passed them and slowed down for a corner. This game have a algorithm for determining responsibilities of crashes (seen in free ride), but it&apos;s not present in the racing schools.
<br>The choices of cars are interesting in a bad way. Eden clearly worships Ferrari, and maybe Audi and Mercedes-Benz, while not too hot for some other well-known brands, or maybe they did not bother to get licenses from them? Regardless, this game have no Lamborghini, no Maserati, no true Porsche, no BMW&apos;s, only 2 Japanese brands (Subaru &amp; Nissan), and for the bikes, only 2 brands, Ducati and Harley-Davidson, but that&apos;s forgivable, its only DLC content anyways. ~87% of the cars are RWD (most of the non-SUV AWD&apos;s are Audi, god bless Quattro eh?), which translates to spin-outs on start-ups for keyboard users. Seriously, do they not know a great many people play on PC with keyboard? Handling is just unbearable sometimes. Ferrari F40-Can&apos;t drive that thing at all when raining, spin-out after spin-out.
<br>The physics are just funky at times, not even related to the fact that I&apos;m using a keyboard. When I crash into a smooth barrier at ~30 degrees, I get turned 180 degrees. Neither can I do donuts on any surface. I skin a telephone pole, and again, get turned to the opposite direction. Combined with the brilliant &quot;return to road&quot; function, it is a recipe for rage.
<br>Everything else in this game is more than satisfactory, but with the main component--racing, so frustrating, it&apos;s hard to like this game a lot. Maybe I&apos;ll play it from time to time, but it will definitely not be my go-to racing game. If you&apos;ve made it this far, thank you for you patience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3814021">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>only thing is - it&apos;s kinda hard for the newbies to get used to this game, coz differently from other games the car controlls isn&apos;t just W A S D, CTRL and SHIFT. this is *simulator* car controlls are 100% real and everyone knows that the car is harder to drive in real life than in the games like NFS and so on. i brought the steering whell just for this game and my recommendation to everyone who dislikes this game would be to not run over here and write the negative recommendations after their first crash. u cant drive - not the fault of developers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2873112">Expand</a></span>

Only Mass Effect 2 and other few games have managed this. Sadly, Test Drive Unlimited 2 is not one of them. The new interface is amazing, and the environment now seems like a real world, unlike its predecessor in where the world looked unrealistic, specially the trees. The game introduced new features, all of them poorly polished and underdeveloped. First, the new story mode is unnecessary and boring, the licenses, new racing and map systems are good but not enough, all the characters are uninteresting and forgettable and the damage system is almost un-existent, even worst than that of GT5.<br><br>Still, TDU2 is a game worth to enjoy if you are a fan of racing games. Its pretty exciting to be going around in perfect and beautiful depictions of Ibiza and Hawaii in any of the cars in the game. Finally, it&apos;s hard to recommend this game, and harder to be enjoyed by a person just looking for a racing game, because even when TDU2 is a racing game at its core, many of the MMO and RPG elements incorporated could screw up your fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1479355">Expand</a></span>

Cars. Now right off the bat the cars look pretty good, well modeled and the like. But from there it all falls apart.For starters the engine noise of every cars sounds meek and powerless, the handling (if you could call it that) is very floaty and more often than not you&apos;ll end up off-roading. Also maybe it&apos;s just me but from the 10 or so hours i put into this game it seems to me like this game has the worst automatic transmission in existence. Off the line my car would not engage first gear for a few seconds then go right to second gear then gear back down to first and then piddle back into second. By which time my opponents had pulled away nicely. So in short as a driving game if is awful. As a open world game it has some legs but they&apos;re all but ruined by the aforementioned means of exploring said world. the radio dj&apos;s are beyond stupid. talking about how their station plays the best death metal to then lead into some indie rock song.<br>The story is so bad i don&apos;t even want to recant it<br>The games a bloody mess. its not worth anymore than $5. you&apos;ve been warned.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2137609">Expand</a></span>

The open world is sprawling and the cars are fairly well selected, though the game depends too heavily on some brands. Playing this game, I wondered  often why they didn&apos;t play to the design&apos;s strengths as opposed to its weaknesses. The game is spread out across two huge islands, but very few parts of those islands are interesting enough to want to pass by them more than once or twice in an hour. This factor makes racing any race that is over two laps, especially if you have to restart, highly tedious. For the same reasons, the point to point races, with and without competitors, are often a lot of fun and are sometimes brilliant. The car handling can be silly and I would describe the handling as arcade-like. I think this game has a hard time deciding if it is meant for racing game fans or those who have little to no experience with them.  The game starts out incredibly easy and then ramps it up. This makes the first few hours pretty boring. I don&apos;t care for the effects of colliding with things: I wish there were more damage. I can&apos;t think of a good method for repairing though and driving across the islands in a busted vehicle would be a huge drag. The story is thin and the voice acting is often so bad It seems ripped from a subtitle dub of an &apos;80s Japanese action movie. The avatar customization items seem unnecessary, but they are not poorly implemented. I&apos;m sure some people will get a kick out of those. As of now, the PC&apos;s online functions are crippled, but I&apos;d be very surprised if I didn&apos;t see a fix very soon. PC optimization isn&apos;t terrible, but there are instances of unwarranted slowdown in seemingly random places. In one race, I experienced crippling slowdown on one lap and then smooth as butter framerate the next. This may have something to do with the online connectivity problems. I&apos;m curious to see how the online actually pans out when it works, which will hopefully be in the next week or 2. The sound of the engines is pretty good and the radio has a decent selection but seems to try to copy GTA too much. We don&apos;t need sarcastic commercials in every game, especially if they aren&apos;t funny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1480435">Expand</a></span>

Just Cruising.
<br>
<br>The Bad: Can u spell Beta. This game has soo many bugs, completely uninspiring story, lame voice overs (the few that they bothered to do), frustrating!! level design, car upgrades that dont work, a community racing center that was down for a month let alone the online clubs issues, car dynamics wrong (on a very steep incline and stationary, pushing the brakes makes the car skid down, but let off the brakes and freewheel and the car doesn&apos;t move. so many good features from TDU1 somehow not included like:
<br>ability to turn engine on and off
<br>adjustable radial blur
<br>adjustable incar seat
<br>incar dials that actually work (the buggy&apos;s rev count is 1,2,3,4,5,6,5,6,7  -   QA? tested at all?)
<br>ability to move cars around garages
<br>the list seriously just goes on and on
<br>
<br>not to mention that once you finish all the singleplayer races and still have lots to buy you won&apos;t be able to make money at any reasonable rate unlike TDU1. you cannot repeat entire cups to win the end prize money, it seriously is a dead game after that for singleplayer. multiplayer fails because only certain people who bought from a specific retailer (not Steam) got the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport as a preorder &quot;bonus&quot; and it will outstrip every other car no matter how much tuning. meaning if you didn&apos;t live in a specific country, prepare to not be able to win multiplayer games unless by chance - joy. where&apos;s the skill in that?
<br>
<br>such an uninspiring game, disappointment of the year handsdown!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1557033">Expand</a></span>

You buy your car like reallife, you sit in it, you smell it, you look at it like it was real. Games doesn&apos;t need to look like real life, but if it is detailed like real life, I would defenitly give it a good review point.<br><br>The bad parts of this game is actually the charaters :( and yeah they play a big role in this game. They wanted to make the game look like barbie toys, but that was actually a good idea for the inviroment and car creation. But you feel like you are playing with girl toys. Yeah it&apos;s hard to describe, but you would not like to play with barbie if you are a boy on an age of 5. You actually get the same feeling when you try this game. But this is DEFENITLY the most realistic game I&apos;ve ever tried in my entire life. You because of the design, but because every single detail in the Test Drive 2 world is as big, as huge, as detailed as real life. You feel like you are driving your family to Africa sometimes... sometimes to Turkey and sometimes to Canada. It&apos;s bigger than Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption and Deus Ex all together!

The only thing i really like about the game is the music and the look of the cars (even though, in first TDU part they seemed more realistic). Cons :<br><br>- cut scenes - really stupid, i spend most of my gametime laughing because i couldn&apos;t believe that game with such stupid dialogues can be released<br>- the plot - i wish it wasn&apos;t there at all. We had none in TDU 1, people loved it, why change it?<br>- graphics - it&apos;s like TDU1 on highest details with a bit changed graphical engine so it could look less realistic<br>- driving - i so want to go to Atari building and get my 40$ back. I really DON&apos;T KNOW who designed the driving in this game, but he definately didn&apos;t play the first part. IT IS HORRIBLE.<br><br>I tried all modes on both keyboard and wheel (G25). I gotta say, it&apos;s unplayable and there&apos;s a lot of problems with additional controlers.<br><br>- major bugs - When i started playing i first made an offline account. I was excited to see day/night cycles and weather system. But guess what, i got informed that all of this doesn&apos;t work in offline mode cause of a bug. Oh come on, are you serious?<br><br>Conclusions : If you&apos;re more of The Sims fun and you don&apos;t care if driving in game cars is fun, get the game. Otherwise you&apos;re gonna be disappointed, mad and you will swear a lot while playing this game.<br><br>I really hoped this game was going to destroy the competition and that Atari won&apos;t be like other companies, creating new game for the masses and throwing brilliant ideas to the trash. But hey, i guess that if you want to play a good car racing games, you gotta buy a console.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1478801">Expand</a></span>

In fact, when the sequel was announced, I was excited. Reason - a second game could just polish everything the first game had to offer and then some more. It was all set to be a much more refined and fun experience for TDU2. That&apos;s what I thought. Unfortunately, this is not the case. TDU2 has it all - bad physics, bad car handling, lackluster driving mechanics and the racing is just horrid. The online play doesn&apos;t help this game much. It can be fun to drive around in the free roam mode, but gosh, this is 2011 and we get a game that feels so dated. Not recommended. The graphics - well, there are better titles out there that completely dwarfs this. The recently released NFS: Hot Pursuit is a much better choice. Avoid this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1479189">Expand</a></span>

Also maybe fire your voice actors, their repetitive and dull. Actually come to think of it, close up shop and maybe try designing concept art for cars instead. The only thing they got right with the game was the look of the cars and the worlds appearance. I have a truck that corners better then the sports cars in this game, and from driving fast cars I can say spinning out on every corner is hard to do if you know how to drive. But this physics engine, do more then 30 around a corner and your going to be offroading the sports car. Try the **** view, spin out. The license system is a repetitive drag, and really there is no point of playing as there is no story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1490144">Expand</a></span>

Unrelentless cop chases where you can be the cop in on the chase. TDU2 is not the best game in the world and it is not nearly as bad as some people are making it out to be. The driving engine was geared towards the keyboard user, but if tweak the settings some it feels more controller friendly. The cars are drivable and enjoyable once you give them a fair chance. TDU2 was not intended for the IRacing, rFactor, and other hard core sim gamers only. I personally feel like the driving schools are a little too challenging for this game, but very rewarding.<br><br>Those who choose not to buy TDU2 based on the negative opinion of others, are going to miss out on a treat.<br><br>The only thing that really bothers me about the game, is its re-installations is limited to 4.

I screamed out in frustration many, many times, and rage quit many, many times.... much like I was playing a Call of Duty game online......&gt;.</span>

The worlds are large and fairly well detail &amp; there is some pop in, but the entire world only take about 10 seconds to load, which is quite remarkable. The cars are very well detailed, and there are about 100 or more to choose from. The customize option is limited to only decals, but I don&apos;t mind (I find it very similar to Need For Speed: Carbon in many ways). Music is ok with a few standout tracks, but I would put on Grooveshark or your Ipod instead. The social aspect of the game is good, clubs are fun and racing others is really good, now that the glitches have been fixed. True, in the beginning there were alot of problems, but Eden addressed them reletively quickly. The characters are cut-outs, so skip cut scenes. Other voice acting is okay, like on the sales people and on misc. races. The story is really weak, but only is there to explain why there is suddenly legal street racing going on. My main complaint is that handling is bad if your using a keyboard, and doesn&apos;t get much better with a xbox controller. A racing wheel makes it alot better. Be warned that this is not a game for sim racers, the game isn&apos;t particularly challenging or realistic. This is made to be a social game, were you can cruise around and explore/race others. And on that front, i feel it suceeds</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2080455">Expand</a></span>

This isn&apos;t any realistic driving, anyone will be a fool to buy this game and play. I, myself, is a fool and regretted buying this game, it&apos;s a waste of money. The driving physics is just worst than any simulation racing games out there.</span>

In al this time, pretty much ever since the first Need for speed game came out have I wanted a truly free roaming, real to life driving sim that makes me feel like I am actually driving a sports car that I can&apos;t afford round the streets of a city. Test drive unlimited pretty much fails in every single aspect to deliver this. Even the free roaming mode is crippled by the lack of any handling physics at all. You cant even just enjoy &quot;cruising&quot; unless you like cruising in a hovercraft with a mind of it&apos;s own. Also, minimum specs for this game are a Gefore 8800GTX? Are you kidding me? With graphics this bad I&apos;d expect to be able to run it with my old Voodoo2. Test Drive 5 looked better than this. Lazy, lazy programing. MW3 runs great on my machine and yet this game runs like a dog with no legs.  I hate to slate a game, but this takes the biscuit. I&apos;m glad I only payed &#xC2;&#xA3;3 for it n the steam sale. Now I know why it&apos;s in the sale...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1973046">Expand</a></span>

Looked great, with its large selection of cars and its massive environment. What they didn&apos;t tell me, though, was the absolutely awful license mechanic, which forces you to repeatedly go through near-impossible courses in record time just to enter a race. Not to mention the abomination that is the handling. Cars, including the Aston Martin Vantage (one of my favourites in real life, I might add) spin out and do 360 degree turns seemingly on their own when you floor it. Slow down and you&apos;ll get left behind by the other Barbie-doll racers. And when (if?) you beat it, you have to go back to school, where you repeatedly fail the challenges as the teacher turns to you, smiles creepily, and says &quot;don&apos;t worry!

The way NFS makes you aware of the limits of physics and the car, in TDU2 the car, nor the physics seem to have limits. The story and cut scenes, instead of redeeming the terrible game-play, only add insult to injury because of their incredibly childish plot. Finally, the game lacks technically. It crashed for the first time during the installation by the downloader and the graphics look aweful because of the lack of support for my monitor with 16:10 aspect ratio. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this. Even if it&apos;s on sale, it&apos;s a bad buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2945186">Expand</a></span>

Now they seem to have sorted the servers to I&apos;m finding it much easier to connect to other people when playing online compared to TDU1. Theres still a couple of features that don&apos;t seem to load (TDU life) but the game seems pretty stable and pretty much bug free.<br><br>Very pleased with my purchase, the only regret I have was not pre-ordering it! I wonder if the people that hate the game got the same one as me or whether they expected the level of polish of Forza/GT on a massive 2 island scale which would be impossible (can you imagine GTs creators making a game like this and how long it would take?!!?!).

Add to that forced on social  that detracts from the driving, limited amount of tracks and game-modes, random crashes and a ton of other minor annoyances and you get a pretty below average game. The island where you can free roam looks nice and are quite spacey and varied but the subpar driving mechanics manages to take the fun out of that. Personally i did not have a good time with this game and i really cant see who really would. The hardcore racing guys should stay away because of the awkward driving and fans of arcade racers should stay away for the same reason plus the fact that the game really lacks the variation or speed that you would expect from an arcade racer. I would not recommend this game and i am sure that you can find a better racing game of whichever kind you are looking for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2951099">Expand</a></span>

All the fanboys excuse it by trying to force an idea that we expected it to be a sim. That is wrong: we expected the arcade racing from tdu1, maybe even slightly improved.<br>What we got instead is driving and sounds straight out of a flash game. This is by far the worst car-game I have played and I&apos;ve played some real budget stinkers from the 90s.<br>The second excuse fanboys pull is  that this game &quot;isn&apos;t about racing&quot;. Gee that&apos;s odd: lots of fast cars and lots of them things called &quot;races&quot; in this game. How the hell are you trying to convince potential buyers that this isn&apos;t about racing???<br>The &quot;plot&quot; in the game is ridiculous: written by a teenager for teenagers? The stability of the game itself is even worse and the devs are doing nothing: stillborn game.<br><br>So if you like arcade racers like flatout, grid, nfs... or heck basically any racing game at all: DO NOT BUY THIS. Most importantly of all: try not to listen to the fanboys.<br>If you however would like to play rich man sims - barbie house party then TDU2 is definitely a game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1550857">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now on to the bad. WTF is wrong with the handling physics? TDU1&apos;s physics was fine, why did they felt the need to change it? Now all the cars are have lots of grip, and yet they understeer like a mofo. The controller support is way worse than TDU1. I have a Betop C033 controller, it was plug and play in TDU1. But in TDU1 I spent hours trying to get it to steer smoothly, the car still feels very twitchy at high speed. I even went back and drove some cars in TDU1 to refresh my memory. It&apos;s either bad handling physics or bad controller support, either way, it&apos;s a step down from TDU1. The new social stuff is not fun either. I don&apos;t care how my avatar looks like, I don&apos;t want to spend money on cosmetic surgeries. Atari, you need to understand that we enjoy the racing social aspect, you got your priorities all wrong. In a racing game, physics is the most important aspect, you neglected that to improve the social aspect? WTF?! I really wanted to like this game, TDU1 is probably the second most played racing game for me (Right behind the GT series), but I didn&apos;t enjoy TDU2 at all during the 5+ hours that I played. If you guys ever decided to make TDU3, hire the team that made the first game back, fire the team that made the second game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1636387">Expand</a></span>

And this came along. BIG letdown. Graphics budget is way too taxing, even for some of the higher-end video cards, there are many instances of lag that affect the race at hand forcing a restart of the game as a whole, very very buggy game. As far as gameplay is concerned, dropping the pedal to the metal off a start doesn&apos;t always guarantee a surefire rocketing start and the car will sit there revving while your competition leaves you in their dust. Game physics seem to defy the laws of motion in this universe. Signs you knocked over reappear almost instantly. The plot is quite hokey but it&apos;s fun to play it through and amass all those cars and attempt to drive them with any kind of control and speed. The idea of customizing houses and cars is cool. Two maps to choose from is a nice touch and having all that land to scour is pretty awesome. All in all though this game is a big fail and is not worth the money. It&apos;s almost like it was rushed to just get it out the door in time. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SAVE YOUR BREATH TO COOL YOUR SOUP INSTEAD OF YELLING AT THE GAME BECAUSE IT SUCKS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1716866">Expand</a></span>

Well these guys never played the First TDU apparently.  Sure if you take this game on its merit alone and Forget that the first TDU ever existed  this is a great racing game, but as a fan of the first one I can not just wash off my experience with the first game. That said this one fall rather short of the original  in my opinion.
<br>
<br>The Good:
<br>
<br>The graphics have been updated  the game (except for the original island) looks better than the original game&apos;s.
<br>The off road really adds more depth tom the experience.
<br>Nice learning curve with the driving assistance.
<br>more character customization options.
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>
<br>world seems hollow compared to the original.  Gone are the hitch hiker missions, the package deliveries, and the car deliveries that made the first game seem so alive to me (maybe I have not gotten far enough along in this one yet  but from 6 days playing it  the world just seems empty with not as much to do outside racing championships. The discovery mode is poor replacement for  hitch hiker missions  on buying new cloths. I felt like exploring the first game more often knowing that about every 5 to 10 miles there was a npc that I could do a mission for.  finding junk cars  just not that enticing of a reason to go exploring even with the bonus cars they unlock.
<br>
<br>Less cars from what I&apos;ve seen  and what cars I do see about 1/3 are DLC purchases. seriously if some one knows where I can find a modern corvette that doesn&apos;t cost real money PLEASE let me know. this whole game seems engineered around nickel and diming us on dlc. sure its not much (about 1 dollar most cars). but its the principal of the matter  this is a TEST DRIVE game. sell extra BS  but cars should not  be DLC.
<br>
<br>Missing radio  this one I have to mention and it is  worth 3 marks off this game imo.
<br>there are only 2 crappy radio stations  and one seems to advertise for music it just doesn&apos;t have?? are you serious when the radio host talks about sacrificing goats while listening to their station  I expect REAL hardcore metal  not wuss rock and electro tunes.  to ad insult to injury the first game offered users the ability to create their own radio stations  with their own mp3 collection,  well guess what  they ripped that right out of the sequel.  then have lied about how they will add it back in in a patch ..its been a year or more since this game came out  when I bought it and still NO USER RADIO.
<br>
<br>Last I&apos;d like to say  I HATE the license test system this is TDU we shouldn&apos;t have to go through hellish license test just to get to the good bits of the game  which are never as big of an a-pain as these test are any way.  again just a poor feature meant to fill the void of them not having other mission types in the game  and again it does a poor job of filling that void. Maybe some of you guys like this,  but I find the test more annoying and game pace breaking to me than fulfilling.
<br>
<br>Other thoughts:
<br>
<br>I&apos;d go back top TDU 1 except Atari shut down the servers some time in 2012  not sure if I can even get in game with out the servers being up?  as for TDU 2 i9&apos;ll stick to it for now  a 5/10 in my book is an ok game for fans of a series  I&apos;d not recomend it to non driving game fans though.  for driving game fans that never played TUD I&apos;d say its a 7/10 a good game to introduce you to TDU  but really TDU 1 offered so much more with less blatant money grabbing dlc.  Maybe Atari will make it right on TDU3 we can hope.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3249093">Expand</a></span>

Of course, the player ends up crying their eyes out when this game spits and vomits in their face right after it slaps them with the cold, disgusting truth of how bad it really is.
<br>
<br>From very poor audio design to awkward handling and physics so bad you can&apos;t even make fun of it, to completely atrocious voice acting to low quality graphics and visual effects, Test Drive Unlimited 2 is not even worth being at the butt end of any joke.
<br>
<br>When you drive in this game, it feels like your moving a hunk of rock on broken wheels on ice. The car physics are such a disgrace to every racing game ever made to the point that we almost puked blood out our ears. The racing licenses you have to complete in order to continue racing in the official races are complete garbage, being absolute useless half the time and seem to get extremely hard (due to being really strict on times, not just what you have to do) really, really quickly.
<br>
<br>The graphics are bland and feel colorless half time, and are not very appealing. Like, jeez, was it that hard to add some saturation and contrast?
<br>
<br>The car selection isn&apos;t too bad, they including cars and vehicles that are not in many racing games, but still included common cars. Not too much to say that&apos;s bad about the selection, though it is a tad bit small.
<br>
<br>When you explore the islands, all you will find are old car scrapes that you can get money for finding, but that&apos;s basically it. There&apos;s miles of grass and fields with nothing in them. What a waste. You can see buildings and trees and things that look nice, but there&apos;s nothing really cool to actually find, like hidden treasures and cars and such.
<br>
<br>The voice acting in Test Drive Unlimited 2 can make anybody&apos;s ears start bleeding from the horrible acting and the extreme awkwardness. None of the &quot;characters&quot; have any depth and they all act very dumb. We&apos;ve seen socks that are more intelligent. Also, the player races against the same small group of racers in the ENTIRE GAME. You have the ability to challenge any other driver to a dual race (similar in Need For Speed: Underground 2), but of course, the other drivers decline your offer. Every. Single. Time. With no actual reason either of course. This might have been made only to work online, but the servers that players use to go online almost never work for some strange reason.
<br>
<br>Our question is this: what in the world went wrong? The developers had a really good idea going: a paradise-styled racing game, set place on two big different islands, fancy sports and super cars, various events and races to compete in, and even various houses to purchase and a few things you can find while exploring the islands. We are stunned at how much polishing this game requires before it can be considered being even simply priced at $30.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s almost heartbreaking to see a good idea go to complete waste. We are so disappointed in the developers that actually thought this was a great game in the end. Here&apos;s some words to describe this game:
<br>
<br>Bland.
<br>Repetitive.
<br>Boring.
<br>Low-quality.
<br>Underdeveloped.
<br>Strange.
<br>Disappointing.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: this game is a big pile of you-know-what on the face of the entire racing game genre. For the love of goodness, stay away from this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5187566">Expand</a></span>

If you can manage with the other issues, this game provides a good long joyful experience. Its completely online, which is pretty cool, at times. And at others you will find yourself picking up annoying microphone noise. It has some interesting features. But when the base of the game is racing, and the cars drive like pure crap, it just cant be given a great review. This is a social racing game, dont buy it for its gameplay unless you have amazing patience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1755715">Expand</a></span>

I am a long time player of the Test Drive series, TDU1 was ground breaking with its game play style, however it was very buggy online. Besides the online friends disappearing all the time the game is pretty solid (TDU1). Now as far as TDU2 goes, it has been a buggy mess since release day and I am not even going to mention  it all now there is just too much. Yes they have patched the game quite a bit, but the game still is lacking in many areas. The cars selection is weak, seriously no Lamborghini? WTF! Umm yeah, that&apos;s just one huge downfall IMO. There are many more cars the game is lacking that TDU1 had, but again I will be writing a book about how much was left out the game. Also there is no car trading like in TDU1, and you cannot sell your cars straight away, you must fill the garage then try to buy a new car to get rid of an unwanted car, lol.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1532342">Expand</a></span>

Online play works fine, in-game things like clubs are working and the troubles with the casino&apos;s are gone. The cars are impressive and the environment look good. The sound is nice but the driving itself still has flaws and the cars are not always easily handled. I guess they focused a tad too much on everything around the driving experience which is a shame cause that is the biggest part of the game. Overall it is definitely not a bad game but Eden games should have waited a little longer before releasing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1536343">Expand</a></span>

The appalling singleplayer driving tests that you are forced to endure in order to progress, are a shocking and unforgiveable experience that just leave you wanting to quit the game after a couple of attempts. Whoever was responsible in creating these tests should be sacked for ruining what could have been a classic game. The handling on a lot of the cars leaves a lot to be desired and all these problems contribute to ruining the overall experience. If you have the patience of a saint, you might be more willing to persevere but for most, this game will leave you wanting to take a hammer to your computer! A great shame because with just a bit more thorough playtesting, these faults could have been rectified.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1723604">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s amazing number of cars and the huge are to explore is what kept me from rating this game lower. The bad part is the handling of the cars. It is almost impossible to turn and stay in control. If you are looking for a game like TDU 1 (my favorite free roam driving game), do not look here.</span>

However.....<br>After the 2Nd off-road championship i started to get bored<br><br>The horrible steering was the main problem getting in the way of my real enjoyment. Also another problem i had, was the championship structure of races. I think the game would have been a whole lot more fun with separate races, it also helps with the sense of progression.<br><br>Graphics wise.. I like the new game engine. But as you start to play you do start to notice graphical issues and blemishes. For example there is quite a bit of pop in. And some of the textures are lacking in quality.But worst of all, the cars, they are not at all detailed! The models in the 4 year old first one looked better!. The character models are horrible as well the speech and lip movement is terrible!. The environments overall look a bit lacklustre in detail; you start to notice the same house models all over the island after playing for 5 hours. Driving them becomes boring. Overall the quality of the island is a bit muddy; there are some nice vistas, but a lot more work could have gone into really making every town look adequate<br><br>I have not used the social networking features though, so this review is based on the offline gameplay<br><br>The first one was SO Much better. More fun, better graphics and overall more polished. If you want a good racing game look into the need for speed games or codemasters games. There REALLY fun to play. One word to describe TDU2: Numb. No real immersion or enjoyment. TDU2 goes straight back on the shelf after just 5 hours of game play<br><br>Overall 5/10 absolute max-. I found these glitches totally ruined the game experience, although if you can get past them you MAY enjoy tdu2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=2278190">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is good,but could be better if the game also had a couple of more tweaks to keep it fun for hours. A lifestyle game like this also need to have &apos;&apos;real-life&apos;&apos; actions. It&apos;s weird that you can drive a car,walk along,but can&apos;t walk along the roads.I know that this is not the Sims,but it would be more realistic if you can enjoy a virtual rich life.

<br>Atari has done it&apos;s best,but the game could be better if the game came out a few months later and if there were more &apos;&apos;real-life&apos;&apos;-things.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3191501">Expand</a></span>

Now, it ain&apos;t perfect, the graphic&apos;s are not a massive leap from Test Drive Unlimited 1 (Which I was  a huge fan of) but they do their job well, and I feel the car&apos;s are well reproduced in this game. Sometime&apos;s the engine sound cut&apos;s out during a single player race which is odd, but this is not very often for me luckily.
<br>
<br>There are only two radio station&apos;s which is slightly disappointing but was not too much really. The character and house customization is a lot better than the original title, especially the latter. Some people I heard said about the handling being bad, but I personally find this to be somewhat subjective as to me they are spot on. They also put in the car wash&apos;s in, which was planned for the original but never put in, which is a nice touch.
<br>
<br>Over all I think what they did with Test Drive Unlimited 2 is what they wanted to do with the original but in the original possibly rang out of time. It make&apos;s for a intriguing game, and one that has kept me coming back in my spare time for time for month&apos;s. I like this game a lot, hope M.O.O.R genre pick&apos;s up and more games like this are made would be nice!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3348899">Expand</a></span>

Some features of TDU1 are missing, some are added, overall it does fall a bit behind the first game, like all sequels do. But it&apos;s worth a try for the fans of TDU.</span>

Decided to pick it back up off the shelf, after getting bored with Forza Horizon 3&apos;s end-game grind, and at least there you can reasonably reach end-game!
<br>
<br>First of all, even though the world is open-world and even a bit pretty in its own right, the gameplay is EXTREMELY linear and layered. You need to acquire specific licenses before you can get the cars requiring those licenses in order to win races to make money which then is used to purchase properties and clothes which are only unlocked once you reach a certain level of exploration, etc.
<br>
<br>So, here&apos;s where the problem begins, which gets even more complicated given how unstable and buggy this game is (especially if attempting to use something like ENB to try and make the graphics look a bit more reasonable and not quite so dated). The licenses are the biggest bottleneck... they remind me so much of the Stuntman games and why I completely abhored that entire series and am glad it faded away into the lost and forgotten games of the past as a learning experience on the mistake that it was.
<br>
<br>The license tests are so abysmmal in the fact that after the initial license tests, they give JUST ENOUGH time to get all the way through from start to finish... meaning you can&apos;t over-skid, you can&apos;t bump anything, you have to do each test 100% perfect more or less with only perhaps a 1% spacing for even slight error. Which then each test couples in their own challenges, from a timer, to having to dodge and/or not hit other cars, along with having to navigate barrels/barricades. Some will have time-penalties for going off the road too much, but others are instant fail... if another car hits you, or you just BARELY graze a barricade/barrel, it&apos;s instant failure and having to start back over from scratch. The instant failure and restart might not be so bad on smaller tests, but when you&apos;re in a test with 49+ checkpoints, and you happen to barely graze a barel or a barricade (even when it doesn&apos;t look like you do on your screen) due to even a slight hiccup for any reason... you have to start back over from the first checkpoint. (Also worth noting that each of about 9-18 [the categories with different tiers to each] licenses have 8 test or so each!)
<br>
<br>Another huge issue is completely borked physics and handling. Even with a mod that&apos;s supposed to make the handling like TDU1, there&apos;s still so much constant fussing with the sliders to try and get the perfect handling for your experience, and it never quite hits the mark. From vehicle to vehicle it changes... so for one vehicle where you might need steering dampening all the way to the right, for others you might need it in the center, or all the way to the left... then the same applies to the other 5 or so sliders to fine-tune your control... ultimately to deliver one of the biggest cluster-!@#!s in a racing-game to date.
<br>
<br>Furthermore another huge issue is the fact the world seems SO empty compared to TDU1... perhaps I&apos;m recalling TDU1 incorrectly, but the world felt more alive with more to do. There&apos;s something like 4 or 5 clothing stores, several car dealerships, Casino, real-estate agencies, safehouses, and other bits... but the fact they seperate them into different categories so only so much shows on the map at a time, along with the fact the maps are huge with having them so far spread out... it sadly has a Just Cause &quot;empty lifeless village&quot; feeling pretty much everywhere. Becomes even more painful when you hit lvl10 and start going to Hawaii from the airport... you drive through the hugest city area of Hawaii and actually have to drive aimlessly for quite sometime before you find even one point of interest, which is a massive shame!
<br>
<br>Was also rather disappointing that they had finally added motorcycles to the game, but was more just for vanity, as (unless I&apos;m completely missing something) there doesn&apos;t seem to be anything single-player/offline to do with them... haven&apos;t found any way to paint/sticker a motorcycle, no way to improve motorcycle license, no motorcycle races, no motorcycle tuner upgrades... the motorcycles just seem to be there, and for anybody that&apos;s a massive enthusiast of motorcycles like I am, it&apos;s VERY disappointing!
<br>
<br>Then there&apos;s the issue that there are SEVERAL cars (as well as the motorcycles) that are locked behind cash-shop purchases (DLC) that require tokens. Not sure if the website still sells tokens, but luckily I was able to buy the Harley Davidson before the official shutdown. In game, I seem to have the option to purchase the other motorcycles if I wish, but come across several cars that say they&apos;re a DLC purchase and download, yet the source/download appears not to be available... so you get to stare at a car model that you&apos;ll never be able to access!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7379327">Expand</a></span>

<br>.
<br>Cons -:
<br>1.Bad NPC And player models : this is to be expected from a racing game since they don&apos;t usually do models for Human NPCs  and by that i mean most don&apos;t even have Human NPCs but those that do have human npcs generally looks really bad but the NPC models in this game is fairly Decent for a racing game atleast.
<br>
<br>2. a bit sensitive steering : well the actual turning isn&apos;t  that sensitive or easy but a slight turn to the left or right for a few cars can really be extremly sensitive
<br>.
<br>.
<br>Pros -:
<br>1.Large huge sprawling maps : The map is extremly large especially for a racing game, the world map makes it looks really small but trust me the map can take a huge amount of time  to get from one place to another and it isn&apos;t all empty you might find other NPCs sprawling around the map so you don&apos;t feel alone.
<br>
<br>2.In-game Social Interaction: well i couldn&apos;t really fiqure out what to call it but what it actually is in brief you can buy houses, make friends, customize your house etc. you wouldn&apos;t exactly expect this from a racing game but they added these interactions and such and it adds to the gameplay it makes it really enjoyable.
<br>
<br>3.Nice Varied Amount of cars : this game has maybe like 180+ Vehicles all varied, theres super cars,off-road SUVs,Classic old cars Etc.
<br>
<br>4.Mod Support : you already know what this means.
<br>.
<br>.
<br>
<br>in general this has been one of the most fun racing games i ever played (only rivaled by NFS Most Wanted) buy this game and you won&apos;t regret it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=4564303">Expand</a></span>

Sadly, it didn&apos;t deliver. The voice acting is all over the place, the physics are some of the worse Atari has ever done in the Test Drive series, and the police are beyond brutal when being chased. Granted, the police aren&apos;t too much of a threat, even when you blast past them on the wrong side of the road at over 200mph, but when you do want to take part in a police chase, the ai are basically solid objects, and don&apos;t be surprised to get caught within 10 seconds of starting a chase. I haven&apos;t even mentioned the amount of bugs there are with this game. By NO means is this a &quot;finished product.&quot; Some people out there will be lucky if they make it past the first loading screen. If you even manage to get the game working properly, you&apos;ll find that the main attraction here isn&apos;t particularly racing, but cruising around and finding others to hang out with. The problem is, multiplayer is gone, so we&apos;re left with this feeling of loneliness, and even though there are ai cars driving around that you can challenge to a race, you&apos;ll still get that feeling of being alone. One of the main things that really made me upset about this game was the lack of cars. The list of cars in the first TDU was amazing. I thought they were going to add onto that list, but nope. Instead, they scrap cars like the McLaren F1, the Voltwagen W12, and even the beloved and broken Saleen S7. So what cars did they add? Well, they added &quot;off road&quot; and &quot;classic&quot; car classes to the game, which feature different vehicles you can drive (some were just recycled from TDU 1) and events you can take part in, but they&apos;re such a small part of the career compared to the &quot;asphalt&quot; class that they might as well not even be a thing. The driving is a bit of a let down, as it feels more towards a simulation than it does an arcade racer...at least, in some areas. But wait, it gets even better with DLC! DLC that you can&apos;t download because all servers are shut down, so there&apos;s a few cars that you&apos;ll never be able to drive, like the Ferrari F40, or the Corvette C7. So if the car list sucks, the driving feels off, the acting is awful, the physics are unspeakably bad, the police system is broken, the multiplayer doesn&apos;t work, and the single-player is lonely and gets boring after a while, than what makes this game better than the first TDU? Well, the only &quot;better&quot; addition to the game would be that they made an entirely new island to cruise around on...I guess. It&apos;s not much different from Hawaii though so why even bother? At this point you&apos;re probably asking yourself, &quot;Should I buy Test Drive Unlimited 1, or give Test Drive Unlimited 2 a try?&quot; If you&apos;re going to take my advice, buy Test Drive Unlimited 1. It&apos;s Multiplayer is still inoperable, but the game feels amazing, the list of cars is great, and the driving is beyond TDU2. But hey, if you&apos;re still looking to buy this game, just remember that Steam refunds is a thing, and you could always change your mind. Steam gives you 2 hours to play a game before it can be refunded, so go ahead, and waste your time. Now if you&apos;ll excuse me, I&apos;ll be playing TDU1 and thinking to myself: &quot;Man, I am so thankful to be playing this other than TDU2.&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/test-drive-unlimited-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7603938">Expand</a></span>
