<br>The best cases where some of the best gaming i have ever done. The houers just fled buy and the frustration of having to relay work to get the facts right. And when the story started to make sense you felt like well Sherlock Holmes.
<br>
<br>Sherlock Holmes is not about the best game play and at time you can get a bit frustrated of the devs forcing you to follow there steps. And all the hints of where you are to go can get very annoying in some of the cases. But then you get to play the well written well thought out case, all the anger and frustration is gone. The pipe and the hat is one and you have a case to solve.
<br>
<br>For fans this game is the best Sherlock game ever made. For the people dreaming of being Sherlock, this is you&apos;re game.
<br>
<br>And for the devs:
<br>GIVE MORE CASES TO SOLVE if not ill take up Sherlock Holmes habit and its youre fault!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sherlock-holmes-crimes-punishments/user-reviews?user_review_id=4575761">Expand</a></span>

It was a great game, for me it would hav been enough to polish it a little, ad some new cases, more freedom and it&apos;s a 10 game. Sadly C&amp;P took a new turn and a step back in many regards. I didn&apos;t finish the game yet, but I think my opinion would not change too much after have it done.
<br>
<br>The cons:
<br>- Sherlock gets to be more and more a console game, now we have checkpoints. Sh.tty checkpoints... Why can&apos;t I save my game as I used to? Is it really so hard to program it?
<br>- No translated voices - every game in the series was dubbed up to this point. This was almost a deal-breaker for me. (The only reason I still bought it is to support the devs, so maybe later they can make a perfect Sherlock game.) There was some &quot;explanation&quot; for the missing dub on their website, but it is pure BS. They say they didn&apos;t translate voices, because lip-syncing would be an enormous job... Who believes that? Every Sherlock game had been dubbed, besides hundreds of other games. This is no excuse. I think they lost many consumers there....
<br>- Besides and this is the funniest the eng dub out of sync! Many games come out with only english dub and unsynced lips for other languages. No problem: the fans who don&apos;t understand english still can understand the game without reading subs. The devs could have just put the dubbed voices over the english lip-sync, no one would have noticed - now we have the unsynced result, but without foreign dub... Smart.
<br>- The game eats up tons of resources. On a rig that runs Crysis3 on high around 20 fps, C&amp;P delivers 15-17 and C3 looks 5 times better, with grass, big areas and monsters fighting with you.
<br>- Looong loading times, I didn&apos; experience such long ones since The Witcher 1, and that was the worst.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Long loads, but at longer travels you can use your notes to prepare yourself during the wait. A really good idea.
<br>- Overall good/great ideas for detective work, this is a great game, or at least there was the potential to be one of the best games ever, if they could just somehow not scr.w up almost everything around it. The puzzles are great, playing the detective is also fun. I&apos;ve never would have written so much on the subject if I&apos;d thought C&amp;P was an average.
<br>
<br>So this is not a bad game, but it could have been soo much better. The devs should go back to the oldschool pc save, polish the framerates and have dubs again. There are literally hundreds of bad console games, don&apos;t try to make one yourself too. Now Sherlock is one of a kind. If you go on the console path, it will be a featureless, unremarkable, one of a thousand game. I still give it an 8 and hope there would be a better one next.
<br>
<br>UPDATE: Measurement puzzles are still a chore... What is the point of it? You measure the same 100 times and then it just clicks and you&apos;ve found a clue you knew from the beginning, it just didn&apos;t measure it. Anyone betatested this?
<br>There is alway around 10 m2 where you can move around, after that you just stop - I mean it was loading for 2 minutes! What was it loading. In ACIV they load a whole town in 2 mins. BTW I have 16 gb of RAM - the whole game could fit into the memory, TWICE! Still it loads for ages. What kind of abysmally bad coding is this?
<br>Watson is ridiculous, dumb and always blocking the way - Sherlock&apos;s scornfulness and disdain for him is not surprising... He is just a pain in the a.se.
<br>You can Alt+Tab out when loading to do anything else and the scene still loads - dissappointing solution for a game to be enjoyed, but works.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sherlock-holmes-crimes-punishments/user-reviews?user_review_id=4555320">Expand</a></span>

The game leads you along and it&apos;s basically just a case of clicking on everything, and exhausting all of the conversation options with everyone you meet.  You are not allowed to make your own deductions, you have to wait until the game lets you.  Here is a ficticious example (not in the game) that shows the kind of thing you will experience:
<br>
<br>1) Someone has been stealing cats
<br>2) A man says he hates cats and has no interest in them
<br>3) You find &quot;I love cats&quot; magazine in his house, he has cat food in his cupboard, and you find he is a member of the cat lover&apos;s club.
<br>4) There is no option to challenge him about any of this.
<br>5) You speak to his neighbour and she tells you &quot;i&apos;ve heard meowing from his house&quot;
<br>6) Only now can accuse him of liking cats and deduce that he may have been the cat thief.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately I found myself sitting at a loading screen for a large proportion of my play time.  As you are shuffled through the story of each case, you are sometimes required to travel to a location simply to pick up an item and bring it back.  That is two loading screens worth of time just to do a chore that an NPC could have done instantly.
<br>
<br>On your &quot;clue&quot; screen, you are invited to connect pieces of evidence together to make deductions.  This seemed nice at first and I began to think about the clues, being careful to only make links that I thought were valid.  However, If you click on two items that are not related, it simply tells you they don&apos;t go together and marks them as such.  So this aspect of the game can be reduced to simply clicking every clue on the list until you find a match.  Where is the risk here and the chance to fail and affect the story?
<br>
<br>One of the most promising but poorly implemented features of the game occurs during conversations.  Sometimes you are invited to challenge the person with some relevant piece of evidence that contradicts them or confirms what you are saying.  You are presented with a selection of options, one of which is &quot;right&quot;.  If you dare to click the wrong piece of evidence, you are simply told &quot;YOU PICKED THE WRONG ONE, TRY AGAIN&quot; and the conversation resets so you can attempt to pick the right one.  Again, you are not allowed to fail and must answer correctly before the guided tour continues.
<br>
<br>The game looks pretty anyway, and the audio is nice.  Thats why it gets a 5 rather than a 3.  I was going to say that this game would be good for someone who likes interactive stories.  But I am not sure I would even say it is interactive.  It is more like a story that is interrupted by loading screens and clicking on everything in sight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sherlock-holmes-crimes-punishments/user-reviews?user_review_id=4557455">Expand</a></span>

I can hardly find any fault with it. You are the detective and you make the decisions. You decide on the outcome and what your actions shall be. If you are a veteran when it comes to this genre then you might find it easy . . . . cause lets face it - you played them all, you read books, you watch CSI and to appease you is impossible (I actually consider myself a veteran in this genre). If you are a novice you will find this game &quot;very hard&quot; or perhaps you just went with every 1st conclusion that popped up instead of looking further.
<br>
<br>Now about the game: There isn&apos;t just 1 conslusion that ends the case, there are a few and it is up to you to choose one. So ignore all reviews and comments saying that this is a linear game as linear would indicate only 1 answer was availible. The graphics arn&apos;t tripple A, but they are still gorgeous and really draws you into the world. Another thing that I love is that it isn&apos;t just ONE story, but multiple stories, more than one case that needs solving. There were times where I had the conclusion, but still had to go back to my notes as to pick the &quot;right person&quot; who actually done the murder. Great acting, great animation. Laughed at certain points and frowned at others. This is the most accurate Sherlock Holmes I have ever come across outside the books
<br>
<br>Bad points: I really can&apos;t find any bad points to be honest. Loading times arn&apos;t bad except for when the maps where rather quite large and while the game is loading you are watching sherlock driving in a cab with whoever he brought along. Like the game knows if Sherlock is driving alone, when he brought the &quot;best nose in the empire&quot; or with Watson. Now the Map doesn&apos;t just appear right after the loading has finished, no you have to click, which is nice as it makes sure you don&apos;t miss anything but at first I was reading the hints, waiting for it to load just to find out it already loaded and was waiting for me to click it.
<br>
<br>This game helps you along the way, but it doesn&apos;t spoon feed you. If you hover over something it will notify you that you can examine it, but it will not highlight everything across the room with the click of a button. I can&apos;t say that the &quot;mini games&quot; like lock pick and such were very challenging, but still interesting. The &quot;detective mode&quot; isn&apos;t really well thought out and I think it should have been better if it was just removed entirely - more like a clone of X-ray mode from the latest batman games.
<br>
<br>I give this game a ten as I am wanting more. Perhaps drop the &quot;detective mode&quot; (you know where you press &quot;T&quot;) and add more challenging &quot;mini games&quot; but keep everything else the same.
<br>The best review I could find that I agree absolutely with is: http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/sherlock-holmes-crimes--punishments-review--no-cumberbatch--and-nothing-elementary-9762682.html</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sherlock-holmes-crimes-punishments/user-reviews?user_review_id=4566675">Expand</a></span>

<br>- - - Cons - - -
<br>1. Lots of travelling between locations = very long loading times (fortunately you can make conclusions and check evidence meanwhile).
<br>2. Some minigames (rope walking) and puzzles are annoying,they can be skipped,though (but quick time events cant).
<br>3. Controls and camera are very limited (no key bindings,no zoom - just set 1st/ 3rd person view).
<br>
<br>If you like immersive interactive movies/ adventure games with strong narrative and detective feeling like L.A.Noir, Beyond: Two Souls or Murdered: Soul Suspect, then this game is for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sherlock-holmes-crimes-punishments/user-reviews?user_review_id=4566955">Expand</a></span>

I have played may Sherlock Holmes games since the 1980&apos;s and there were a few great ones for their time. This one though, WOW. So well done. From every standpoint, this game is excellent. From the examining of a person to profile them, to looking for clues and the locations and speaking of locations, the graphics are beautiful and the animations are so real and have such depth to them you&apos;d think they were real people. Right down to the pores in their skin. The voice acting is spot on and the story is classic Sherlock Holmes style. I positively loved this game from the first 20-30 min I played it and I am hooked. Really good game and well worth a look!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sherlock-holmes-crimes-punishments/user-reviews?user_review_id=4609244">Expand</a></span>

Then you click &quot;x&quot; when Sherlock is suppose to give his response to the person or persons to tell where this investigation is going.  So, it&apos;s point and click to unlock the story.  God help me, I was so bored.  Below-average graphics, below-average voice acting.  Horrible loading times invade you when your asking questions!  What?  Considering this game is only 3.5 GBs, expect a low-low budget experience.  This belongs in the &quot;B&quot; game bin,or the $5 bin.  I can&apos;t imagine what the people on the PS4 thought of this experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sherlock-holmes-crimes-punishments/user-reviews?user_review_id=5119235">Expand</a></span>

<br>this games is a great detecting/solving crimes game if you played L.A Noire you&apos;ll like this one for sure.
<br>
<br>it offers you to choose who are the crime murderers based on your conclusions and your thoughts of the cases.
<br>
<br>the gameplay is fun you can choose between 1st person or 3rd person view with nice atmosphere and high quality designs of objects,the soundtrack is good too.
<br>
<br>Crime and Punishments is an enjoyable game and you should def. play it if you are a Homes fan/detective games fan.
<br>
<br>with some flaws and annoying things-long loading times between locations for example- and little bugs it gets a 7 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sherlock-holmes-crimes-punishments/user-reviews?user_review_id=4586693">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are very nice, and you can switch freely between the third person and the first person points of view. Having said that, those that have played earlier Sherlock games (especially The Testament of Sherlock Holmes) may be a bit disappointed seeing the monotonicity of the lock picking puzzles. But, again, the game is about the story, so it&apos;s pretty easy to forget about this weakness. All in all, I&apos;d like to see more games at this high level, and I hope that this series of Holmes games will continue for a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sherlock-holmes-crimes-punishments/user-reviews?user_review_id=4808726">Expand</a></span>

Obviously the actual detective work is over-simplified, all you need to do is explore and interact, then interrogate some suspects and piece together the clues. Except for one other thing you need to do, which for me, personally, dragged the entertainment/immersion factor down considerably. The PUZZLES ... are very frustrating and annoying. It&apos;s possible to skip them, but others you can&apos;t. They are tedious, and completely counter-intuitive. Other mild criticisms include: having to wait about 10 seconds every time you change location (even on an SSD), Watson is useless, and finally I guess this down to personal taste. But I would have preferred to have a the case completely solved correctly, rather than just making a guess based on the evidence.

<br>This was my first Sherlock Holmes game, and I admit I didn&apos;t get past the fourth case, but I would consider looking into the next one, if someone could please kill or radically improve the annoying puzzles!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sherlock-holmes-crimes-punishments/user-reviews?user_review_id=5378801">Expand</a></span>

Aside from some inconsistencies and one or two investigations that I feel didn&apos;t gave enough information, I have nothing wrong to say about the game. Character design, voice acting and general setting is very good, graphically the game looks very good and is very significantly improved from previous game, also it has much less annoying parts then The Testament and is a bit more friendly for player and more realistic, not throwing puzzles at literally every step. Thanks to 6 standalone investigations and stories the game is much more diverse, environments differ a lot, as well as characters.
