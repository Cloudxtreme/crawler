                                        <span> The game is really horrible. The graphics are 3D, but not fantastic, and you have almost no control of what goes on. I bought this game for 45 dollars because it was made by the same people ase Close Combat, but it doesnt&apos; even come CLOSE to measuring up. Wait till it&apos;s in the bargain bin, if you&apos;re going to waste any money at all.</span>
