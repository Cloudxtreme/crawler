Unlike the previous game (played it when it came out) this one is actually playable without any nasty game-breaking bugs. That being said the game was enjoyable but it overstayed its welcome. I know they wanted to make the game last a while and have a long campaign but this was too much. The NPC&apos;s remind of those people from shopping channels that always go &quot;but wait there&apos;s more&quot; because every time you solve a quest they always have a bunch more lined up and stupid ones at that and it never ends. You have 3 playable characters to choose from so there is replayability (only if you are a fanatic). The units are pretty much the same, nothing really new about them. Mostly a variation of existing ones. Most of the spells are useless. Teleportation is a welcome addition. Some islands weren&apos;t that interesting. Two of the distant islands were pretty empty and pointless. Playing a villain (or from their point of view a hero) is a welcome change but the game lacked the charm of the first two games. If you never played one of KB games before I suggest You play the The Legend and Armored Princess (with expansion) since those are the best ones.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-bounty-dark-side/user-reviews?user_review_id=4437388">Expand</a></span>

The Heroes of Might &amp; Magic franchise was getting worst and worst and no one else seemed to care to develop this strategy genre. KB changed all that and quickly climbed to the top of my list of favorite games.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately every subsequent release has offered little more than a different campaign, never adding any more depth or perfecting gameplay (actually downgrading it on a few occasions). So, playing Armored Princess, or Legends, to me, pretty much felt like playing the same game all over again. Redoing pretty much the same tedious quests (i should say &quot;errands&quot;), fighting with the same units, conjuring the same spells, etc, etc, etc.
<br>
<br>KB Dark Side follows this great tradition of boredom and fear of change, adding yet more hours to the never ending KB campaign. This time however the little creativity there was on previous titles has completely extinguished. Bottom of the barrel stuff. The story is so infantile and the dialogs so horribly retarded i found myself feeling like i was playing a toddler&apos;s game. On a game entirely cloned from its previous installment (again, with almost zero new units, spells, weapons &amp; armor, environments, etc), the only redemption would be its narrative.
<br>But no, even that received the same half-assed treatment - there&apos;s simply no redeeming qualities to this title.
<br>
<br>Regarding bugs, i&apos;m very surprised to hear people consider this release better than previous ones. I don&apos;t remember having these many issues with all other titles *combined*: Broken quests (plural!) and overall very bad information on dialogs and quest log, crashes, item buffs that don&apos;t work, serious combat glitches (enemy units becoming invulnerable to attack for a turn). If you managed to finish the game without coming across one of these issues, i must be the unlukiest guy in the world.
<br>
<br>As much as it pains me to bash a strategy game in this depressing age of Action and FPS games, unless you&apos;re really into doing menial tasks and enjoy riding a virtual horse up and down a narrow path for hours on end, stay the hell away from this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-bounty-dark-side/user-reviews?user_review_id=4581806">Expand</a></span>

Your choice of character determines which units will be available to you throughout the campaign - demoness does not have many orks or undead available at the shelter.
<br>
<br>The beginning of the game is rather repetitive - a lot of human troops, I must&apos;ve killed 4000 guardsmen before level 14, and hundreds of knights.
<br>
<br>There are new talents, new spells, some of which are quite overpowered, for example diversions places up to 3 traps on the map, and this stacks with the traps medal, meaning there are a lot of traps on the battlefield.
<br>
<br>Now being level 31, I find that my army did not change much from the beginning - I still have cerberus, scoffer imps, red dragons and executioners. Later on I added archdemons or executioners. There isn&apos;t really much need to experiment with anything else. While there are &quot;traitor&quot; troops, they are exact copies of the light side troops (archers, guardsmen, inquisitors, etc).
<br>
<br>I liked the quests, they require quite a lot of running, and even some googling for solutions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-bounty-dark-side/user-reviews?user_review_id=4780992">Expand</a></span>

It started with Warriors of the North and has reached a low with Dark Side. I like the idea of Dark side and I like that they kept the GUI and combat system the same. What I don&apos;t like is the sloppiness of how the quests are written. I never got stuck on any quests in King&apos;s, or Armored Princess. The explanation was straight forward. They told us what to do, where to do it and generally kept it on the same area that the quest was given. Yes its simple, but it was fun. You could tool around an island, clear it out and move on.  Sadly that is no longer the case. I have gotten stuck on many quests and have been unable to find help on them either. So the game is a big waste of money. I will try it again in six months. Maybe then the walk through&apos;s will contain some help.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-bounty-dark-side/user-reviews?user_review_id=5006897">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>New skills sound good but many of them are quite useless, same issue with new spells.
<br>Rage abilities - why can&apos;t they ever be balanced? Once again - you will use some of them extensively and ignore the rest.
<br>New units - great, but I&apos;m still using the old ones. Few special abilities got re-balanced as well.
<br>
<br>Quests are now more complex but it comes with a price, too often we&apos;re not given clear explanation what to do next. I got stuck a couple of times, some of them are very unintuitive and we end up either checking online for solutions or just visiting every single spot on every map.
<br>
<br>Dark Side has some pros and cons, but at the end of the day it&apos;s still a very solid game. If you finished every other KB title, give it a try. Combat is still fun and challenging and that&apos;s what matters the most for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-bounty-dark-side/user-reviews?user_review_id=5110542">Expand</a></span>

Your special units are very limited at the beginning, so you&apos;ll only have a handful of these to make do with until later on. To flesh out your army, the game has a lot more spider and snake eggs for you to pick up and use, as well as some bottom-of-the-pile troop types at the first safe castle you get to. Apart from that, there is also a new system where you can sacrifice prisoners to create new demon and undead troop types, but it looks like you need to have a LOT of prisoners to create anything really good. Your rage powers are now provided by a strange looking little companion creature named Blackie (though thankfully you can change this name), who can also teleport you to various places in the game as well as handle the sacrificing of unlucky prisoners to create new troops. Character skills are now structured slightly more differently - there are about 5 or 6 levels of skills from the top down, with only the corresponding class having access to the last tier of skills; eg. only the warrior character (the Orc) will have access to the last tier of Might skills. I tried all 3 characters and it seems easiest to play (at least initially) as the Demoness character (owing to her higher Leadership score and the more powerful demon units she has) and hardest as the Orc (lack of offensive magic and decent missile units). However, the Demoness&apos; last tier of skills (in the Spirit tree) do not seem all that great compared to the last tier of skills in the Might and Magic trees. The storyline seems a bit dull (though this may change later in the game) and involves you fixing a sudden imbalance which has come about between evil and good in the world, though each of the characters (the Orc, Demoness and Vampire) has a backstory of their own which makes the game a bit more interesting.
<br>
<br>Pros - same enjoyable tactical turn-based combat as the previous titles, different experience playing as a villain.
<br>Cons - little overall difference in graphics or gameplay from the previous games in the series, more difficult (at least in the early part of the game) than any of the previous games, still some minor translation issues in some of the in-game text, playing as a villainous character might not be to everyone&apos;s taste. Game also still suffers from a number of bugs (crashes to desktop occasionally when playing for a long time and entering a new area or starting a big battle, or enemy units&apos; attack, defence and initiative scores inexplicably get reduced). Game seems overly long and gets tedious after a while and certain quests are poorly done, eg collect certain items with no indication of where to get them. I have spent over 120 hours playing as the Orc where I reached level 53 but have given up owing to boredom and frustration with the bugs. Have revised score from 7 to 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kings-bounty-dark-side/user-reviews?user_review_id=4762363">Expand</a></span>

The locations are just boxes with a couple of enemies, there is no decoration at all. The game is heavily disbalanced, it&apos;s very tough at the beginning and not interesting at all as you have no possibility to avoid plot fights, can&apos;t get extra spells and can&apos;t change your army.</span>
