<br>Very repayable, a few levels that offer an array of challenges, based on situational, realistic difficulty, nothing artificial.</span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-The game does not hold your hand. You need to figure out how to escape on your own and you also need to figure out what you will need to complete your plan and where you&apos;ll hide those items while you bid your time.
<br>-Sims-esque as you have a routine of eating, showering, working out, reading, working, spending money, all while coming up with a master plan behind the guards backs.
<br>-Money management, crafting, and limited resources help build tension as you pray your plan works. Some of the most satisfying moments to be had in gaming is seeing your plans come to fruition and finally escaping.
<br>-Inmates say funny little one liners as they walk by. I got a few chuckles and one hardy laugh out of it.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Graphics could bother some. It didn&apos;t bother me stylistically however I did feel more eye strain than normal.
<br>-Realistically if you want to save time and frustration you should consult a wiki for all the items you can craft. Collecting blueprints in game and randomly trying to mash items together to see what fits takes too long and wastes valuable resources. Some crafted items also don&apos;t seem very realistic. Did you know paper mache and ink will build you a fake wall? I did not.
<br>-While it is cool to be able to name all your prisonmates and guards I think it would be a lot cooler if your inmate pals had any real personality and background.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: A game with a great premise and a good execution that I pray is harbinger for a bigger better sequel with a great premise and an even greater execution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-escapists/user-reviews?user_review_id=5063888">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros:
<br>Great Concept
<br>Brilliant Gameplay
<br>LOADS OF ITEMS TO USE AND ESCAPE WITH!
<br>The AI is really good
<br>Nice 8bit graphics
<br>Groovy Soundtrack
<br>Friendly Developers and Community on Steam
<br>Alot of stuff already on the game and coming to the game
<br>And just a brilliant and awesome game overall
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Does get a bit repetitive
<br>YOU NEED ALOT OF PATIENCE (which I do have) but seriously.... you will need as much patience as you can.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve had this game since December and i&apos;ve put in about 31 hours and yes you may think of that&apos;s like nothing... well while your playing you will probably only play the game for about 3-4 hours daily or 1 every two days..... but TOTALLY WORTH IT!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-escapists/user-reviews?user_review_id=4996608">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Besides when you try to escape through the vents at night sometimes it just shows up with &quot;They noticed you left your cell and flushed you out&quot;, Why cant that actually be a thing instead of a box with text telling you this with a button &quot;Okay&quot;, Seriously.
<br>
<br>During roll call you can just go there and leave in a instant without them knowing, because of this if they say you need a cell search you can just go over to you&apos;re cell and grab your illegal items, then they don&apos;t search you&apos;re cell at all.
<br>
<br>and now you&apos;re putting up a dlc for 99 cents AKA $1, why not just put it up there for free because people that own the game are just waiting for more content to be added, because of there poor efforts.
<br>
<br>What a bout selling things? you can buy but not sell?
<br>
<br>Whys the game $17 ... there is honestly no legit answer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-escapists/user-reviews?user_review_id=5044840">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game has a great concept, interesting components for gameplay, and a good enough art style. However, the positives end after the idea of the game.
<br>
<br>Once the novelty wears off, this game is not just repetitive, but full of incredible bugs, horrible game mechanics, and utterly frustrating time sinks.
<br>
<br>One example is that a guard will see through two layers of walls, find your hole, and then confiscate 10+ items. Items which took you forever to find because of a massive waste of time grinding away trying to find very few items. Items which are only sold on 1-2 characters, and only change a few times each day. All randomly generated, with no intelligence by the developer (No procedural generation to lessen the grind). So you may go through a day and see 12 chocolate bars, never finding any duct tape, and on some maps it is as if a crowbar is impossible to find. Have the crowbar? Too bad, you can now never find any magazines, even though you found them plentiful for the past 7 days.
<br>
<br>Once the guard makes an irrational or totally unrealistic &quot;caught you!&quot;, no matter the reason it is always the same punishment. So even if you get caught for something entirely different, they close all your holes and take all you stored in walls, holes, everything.
<br>
<br>The developer is incredibly lazy. From making it just take all items to simple popups &quot;You were caught! Haha!&quot; to the irrational design decisions (clearly he has no idea what good game design even is), this game was rushed together by an amateur trying to cut as many corners as possible. Screw a quality game, screw game design or good ideas, rush ASAP for profits!
<br>
<br>The worst part though are the levels. Horrible level design. The game&apos;s core design encourages you to choose a multitude of ways to escape. Many of the levels literally force you to only escape ONE, maybe two ways out of that multitude. This is just pure idiocy on the part of the game designer. The game forces something contrary to what it encourages. Not all the maps are like this, but most are. Even worse, you won&apos;t know it sometimes until you spent days trying to escape, only to find out that your method is literally impossible (ex. CANNOT dig out, ever.) resulting in you wasting all that valuable duct tape you grinded for hours on shovels you can&apos;t use to win.
<br>
<br>Wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the developer was either very very amateur (barely knew how to program or make games), very incompetent (knows about all this stuff, but is extremely lazy or a HORRIBLE game designer) or very greedy (rush to profit; fast release for money at the sacrifice of everything and anything).
<br>
<br>Overall, the game is fun for the few few missions (before novelty wears off and things get repetitive / frustrating time sinks) and it&apos;s addicting because of the challenge. Unfortunately, too many bugs and flaws make it feasible to enjoy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-escapists/user-reviews?user_review_id=5225286">Expand</a></span>

<br>The idea of this game is awesome, but it doesn&apos;t pull it off very well. It&apos;s worth to pick up at 5 or 10 dollars max.

Every mission is to get out as quickly as possible while making allies and maybe pissing off a few guards. The best part of the game is taking everyone&apos;s clothes.
