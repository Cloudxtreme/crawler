Clever puzzles, easy inventory system, expanded characters and fighting options - everything you could possibly want. Nice graphics upgrade since the first game too. Really enjoyable and at 1/4 the cost of a big-name release game.</span>

<br>So why would anyone want to play the old way that gives you a headache?
<br>
<br>If this is a walk down nostalgia lane, then maybe some old ways are better of buried and forgotten.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4609455">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Some traits are wasted opportunities to make a good party, are they traps? (for example: Rage sounds good for a barbarian trait, but 4 dmg more or less doesn&apos;t give you any gameplay change).
<br>-Why can&apos;t I use a light weapon and a shield and have masteries to unlock on this type of combat ??? (you either go for heavy weapon and shield, dualwielding light weapons or heavy weapon + staff/orb)
<br>-I must agree that some puzzles and secrets are clueless-ly hard to find (use the net to solve them), but that doesn&apos;t change the fact that you are rewarded possitively when you go on a treasure hunt exploration.
<br>-Was interesting in Grimrock 1 to receive stats (dexterity, will power etc) in order to unlock abilities.
<br>Anyway Grimrock 1 was and still is a great game, Grimrock 2 is even better at everythig that was good with the first one...but some developer choices are stupid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4915490">Expand</a></span>

<br>It attempts to bring the Eye of the Beholder (EOB) series into modern day. However the EOB series had some additions that I was hoping LoG 2 would include. In LoG 1 we brought back to life Toorum, but in LoG2 we can not play as him or can we have chance encounters with any other NPC&apos;s. I recall during the EOB series that you at times may have found other adventurers and then you decided if they were to join or not. This was a great facet as you could alter your party during game play if you thought you made an error from the start.
<br>
<br>I like the many of disgruntles found this game really challenging, but that is exactly what I want. Leave the mindlessness to the DA series. If anything I would like more of an emphasis on the value of living rather than resurrecting. This game has too many resurrecting points and healing methods.
<br>
<br>The combat and spell casting took me a bit of getting use to but I beat those &apos;special attack&apos; demons. The spell casting is unforgiving. I like the rune concept but I am so slow with my intricate mouse movements that I struggled to cast numerous spells with 2 magic users. Made me wish I had another fighter/missile-refer above about NPC.
<br>
<br>The skill points and ability trees seem a bit limiting compared to LOG1. With spell casters I found you had to bank some skills and wait till you found spell scrolls to know which branch to follow, and then not all spells were known until much later.
<br>
<br>Having to work out how to get to certain places and find hidden buttons, with the aid of clues added to the uniqueness. I tired easily of back tracking to find puzzles I didn&apos;t conquer, then I realised I could mark maps and alike and so partly my fault for not exploring my &apos;tools&apos; properly. I wished I had used the interactive map from the beginning.

<br>The best magic users weapon is only available once the game has been completed.?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4893402">Expand</a></span>

A few new elements, some new functions with alchemy and optional use of guns. They&apos;ve made it work both in dungeons and outside which is really cool. The square-walking fighting system has been enhanced a bit so that it isn&apos;t just enough to sidestep and hit over and over anymore. Some monsters will jump behind you, some will hit to the side if you sidestep them to their sword-arm side. Little things like that. Still, the main objective remains the same: don&apos;t ever get surrounded.
<br>
<br>Only negative point at all is that a few of the puzzles sometimes seem a bit too far out, so to speak. And they can be a bit annoying more than clever but it&apos;s very rare. Usually, you can work the solution out from clues and all together the balance between too difficult and difficult enough is accurately struck.
<br>
<br>The game ending seems to lead to the next game in the series and so it can feel a bit unfinished, perhaps. The final boss fight comes a bit out of nowhere, it feels, but it&apos;s actually a good boss fight. It&apos;s tough, sure, but it&apos;s not just about learning all the mechanics from replaying it 100 times, it&apos;s actually just about fighting well. So all in all, a very nice game. Into RPG? Buy it, simple as that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5295878">Expand</a></span>

<br>I played LoG 1 and it was an excellent game. When I bought the second I thought I was too prepared to be challenged. I was wrong. This one improves everything in the franchise (I hope it will be a long franchise), even the puzzles. Yeah, this is mostly a first person puzzle game with RPG features and it excels in every aspect you can think of. Just stay away if you want an easy game, in LoG2, you must think in and out of the box. Otherwise, go buy it now. Thank me later.
<br>Note: I strongly recommend the use of the map (Dont check old-style mode), I did not use one in LoG1 but in this one I&apos;m lost the whole time).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5142371">Expand</a></span>

<br>Didn&apos;t try and do what many sequels do, it stayed true to what made it so popular the first time and enhanced and tweaked it.

No.  Epic loot, involved character building in the context of meaningful team/party development, interconnected level design, unique enemies and challenges, intense dungeons, excellent graphics and ambiance.  As a negative, some puzzles are obscure and paths/treasures hidden by unclear means; but, overall, I highly recommend.</span>

Designed with nostalgia in mind, but also sleek and shiny with modern graphics and great sound design. Better than the first game in every way, and worth it if you&apos;re even remotely interested in this kind of game. Play the first game before this one to help you ease into the mechanics and appreciate the improvements.
<br>
<br>The challenge level is steep but fair, and difficult enemies can be taken down through tactics and manuvering rather than brute force. There are tons of secrets to find and an overall sense of mystery and wonder in every dungeon and area. Atmosphere is thick and the sound really makes the world feel alive, and threats ahead can be anticipated with keen ears. Overall the presentation makes for a immersive experience coupled with solid gameplay and combat.
<br>
<br>The puzzles are mostly logical and can be figured out with a little thought and experimentation, though a few are so unclear that guesswork is almost neccessary. I&apos;ll fully admit I had to consult a guide for a few spots, and while some solutions made me feel stupid, a few just made me go &quot;really?&quot;. It&apos;s much more satisfying to work through the puzzles yourself, but some of the nastier ones can get frustrating enough to encourage cheating.
<br>
<br>A few minor balance issues made me rethink my initial party and start over after a while, but I&apos;m terrible for that in any game like this. Almost any party combination can work, but some weapons are simply found more often and in better quality than others. Consulting a guide or a friend before setting out with your party can help a lot, especially since a few of the classes don&apos;t necessarily work the way you might expect them to.
<br>
<br>Being out in a bright, open world makes the grid-based movement seem a bit strange, where it mostly made sense in the confined halls of the first game. It&apos;s not just there for nostalgia though - the movement system and the logic that governs it is central to the combat and puzzle-solving systems and removing it would have required a complete overhaul in design. The game wouldn&apos;t work otherwise.
<br>
<br>The more open-ended design makes for a lot more exploration, but it can be overwhelming. Puzzles that need keys or information from elsewhere to solve don&apos;t always indicate that clearly, and if you leave the game for too long and come back to it, you&apos;ll likely be hopelessly lost. The progression path isn&apos;t clear, but that could be said to just be part of the game&apos;s philosophy. Here&apos;s an island full of monsters and traps and secrets, good luck.
<br>
<br>Nostalgic, polished, immersive, and challenging enough to deter some players, this is almost everything you could possibly want in a dungeon crawl and one of the only modern examples of the genre. Worth the purchase, and then some.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5665696">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is a bit challenging. On normal I&apos;ve died quite a few times, and I&apos;m a pretty hardcore gamer (dark souls &amp; dark souls 2 vet). It&apos;s never cheesy though. Most traps won&apos;t kill you outright, but some put you into very bad situations. However, traps are easily visible if you&apos;re cautious. Personally, I enjoy the level of difficulty... dying to something makes me want to beat it more. I didn&apos;t customize my party (I completely missed that option, I thought the game was a roguelike) at the start, so if you min/max it might be a bit easier. If you enjoyed Dark souls, you&apos;ll probably love this game. It doesn&apos;t hold your hand.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s tons of collectables and optional loot, which is fantastic. I was the guy in Diablo 2 that had to destroy everything in case something good dropped. There&apos;s a shovel, and you can dig EVERYTHING.
<br>
<br>My only complaint would be that some of the puzzles are a bit unclear, particularly ones that involve signs. It will tell you an adjective, and you&apos;ll get 3/4 of them, but the last one just doesn&apos;t make sense (happened to me in 4 plagues, thought &quot;cold&quot; should be some type of elemental item). Most of them are fun and understandable, though, so I can forgive that quirk.
<br>
<br>The grid movement will probably annoy some people, and it can be a little frustrating at times. However, once you get used to it you won&apos;t even notice it anymore. It&apos;s well done, and feels natural in most of the game.
<br>
<br>Overall I would give the game a 9.0/10 if this were sold for 50-60$, but selling the game THIS low should be a crime.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4609646">Expand</a></span>

<br>The depth and detail of this game is astounding. I have rarely felt such pleasure and sense of discovery in a game than in LoG2. Every secret found or puzzle solved adds to the joy and there is SO much of it. The developers have built a game that bridges old school dungeon crawling , RPG, and adventure gaming genres, and melds them into a classic game that should be on everyones &quot;Must Play&quot; list.
<br>A word of caution. This is an extremely addictive game so warn your partners: you can expect to put in 50 hours plus on this one, and will still have only completed a fraction of it.
<br>Where I have issues with the game, they are quite serious ones. Any mismanagement of characters skill points can create problems later in the game. As a hangover from the first LoG there are annoyances with micro management of food and gear loads that get in the way of game flow.
<br>The big question is : Would I have completed this game without the help of the fantastic online community of Puzzle solvers, Map makers and Strategists? The answer is No ( big shout out to those people). It strange that the games big positive of Discovery, is tempered by its difficulty. But in my opinion some of the puzzles are too cryptic with not enough information to solve, and some of the Big Boss battles are frustrating as hell if you haven&apos;t been prudent with your character development.
<br>However. None of this stopped me losing myself for weeks in the world of LoG2 and playing till the bitter end(s)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4661941">Expand</a></span>

<br>We&apos;re living in an (crappy) age where games are scored based on their visuals, details in their textures, animations, explosions, system requirements etc... But trust me, those things are not important. I too didnt played old school dungeon crawlers and I too got pissed of by the movement system of the first LOG. That caused me not start playing LOG for long time. Now I regret every second of it... I could have played that piece of art instead of wasting my time with those visually stunning but s**ty games...
<br>If you have never played old dungeon crawler games (like me) then you have to be open minded about LOG &amp; LOG2. You have to prepare yourself to learn their rules. It&apos;ll be a little boring at first but all the best things about LOG will come to you once you adapt to their playstyle. Then you will realize that its unusual movement system is the best kind of movement system, and its not even among the things that makes LOG so epic...
<br>After you completed LOG &amp; LOG2, feel free to to hate Almost Human for making most of the other games look/feel crap and boring...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4615374">Expand</a></span>

<br>There is tons of stuff to explore and puzzles to solve and they are all really rewarding!

                                        <span>Absolutely amazing game from the guys who brought you Legend of Grimrock. Although I thought there wouldn&apos;t be a sequel they managed to top themselves and bring out this jewel of an indie game.
<br>
<br>The puzzles are great, the combat has depth and is very dynamic, and overall clearing an area full of monsters and mysteries feels really rewarding. Easily worth sinking tens of hours into.</span>

Grimrock 1 was a critical and commercial success, the dev reinvested the money into this game and it turned out much bigger, much better and much more diversified. The dungeoneering is top-notch in terms of exploration and atmosphere, and now there&apos;s a large overworld to explore as well, which smoothly transitions into the caves and dungeons. The puzzles people loved in the first one are back and are just as devious, only there&apos;s much more to go around.
<br>The game has Steam workshop support as well as a level editor (the same one the devs used to make the game).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4605080">Expand</a></span>

Outdoor areas, character creation options, and a detailed map are a few of the things that caught my attention during the brief time playing it. For fans of the old RPGs I would certainly recommend it. And best of all it can be had for next to nothing.!</span>

That love has stayed with me into adult hood. It is so nice to see a modern take on the these games of old. While the game does have some minor flaws and does little to change the formula, it does hit all the high points that a dungeon crawl should.
<br>
<br>Graphics: This is probably the biggest issue I have with the game. The graphics themselves are good but nothing revolutionary. The design of the game is a step up from the first game as I always like to see in a sequel. The only reason that the graphics and design do not rate higher for me is that I feel a number of the design elements of the game are kind of flat. But since everything regarding it is better than the first I do want to show it some love.  8/10
<br>
<br>Gameplay: This game does little new regarding gameplay when it comes to this genre. But that is okay. It does everything right! The controls are tight, the combat is fluid. The only downside is that it doesn&apos;t introduce anything new or revolutionary but in this case I think it works for the better for it. 10/10
<br>
<br>Story: The sad truth is that this genre usually lacks compelling story. In this case I would say that the story is not the strongest point of the game but it does well to still compel you to move through it. 8/10
<br>
<br>The average is 8.6/10. As I always do I try to be far and not change to much so we will be rounding up to a 9 on this one. If you are fan of the dungeon crawl this game is for you. It does almost everything right for what it wants to be and makes no apologies for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4606377">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect but I am blown away. I can&apos;t believe how good the game is. The puzzles are fun and mostly make sense (a few exceptions where I thought they were poorly done and too convoluted). The combat is challenging but not that hard on easy as long as you read about the classes before making your party (taking an alchemist makes the game much easier). The boss fights are so much fun, probably my favorite part of the game. The environments and atmosphere are impressive. The music is unbelievable, frankly couldn&apos;t believe how amazing the music was in this game (especially the last 2 boss fights and credits music). It sounds like Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars meets Pirates of the Caribbean.
<br>
<br>The character creation and customization is great. I can&apos;t WAIT to see what they have in store for Grimrock 3 (I&apos;m assuming they&apos;ll make one!!) I&apos;m hoping for even better environments, more balanced combat, and more classes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4795931">Expand</a></span>

This is the kind of game that is very possible to beat without looking up a walk-through. If you want it to be harder though, the game gives you that opportunity in many places. This is most certainly the best game that came out in 2014.</span>

<br>It looks like a pretty good game, and it is for the most part, but I think the puzzles are worse than the first one and too irrational/nonsensical and kind of reminded me of Broken Age. Maybe I just don&apos;t like RPGs like this anymore. I&apos;m finding it more and more that I think I will like a game based on way-in-the-past preferences that just don&apos;t hold anymore. I used to love Might and Magic but I don&apos;t like this. I used to love RTS like Warcraft and Age of Empires, but I don&apos;t like them anymore either. Hell, I think I used to like Grim Fandango, but when I replayed it, it was very poorly designed actual game around a quirky and interesting story.
<br>
<br>I think I want my RPGs to be far more Witcher 3, Dragon Age Inquisition, Skyrim, Mass Effect, and Shadowrun. Not this. This was slow, boring, and tedious. I know others disagree, but such is an opinion. I&apos;m avoiding games I thought I would like such as Legend of Grimrock and Pillars of Eternity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4955530">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Though there are still some similar problems as the first game.. some schools of magic are still totally useless, as with the first game (good luck popping invisibility or poison shield during the quicker combat!).. and to be honest, I don&apos;t ever see myself playing this again. While already a complex series and again a larger game and even more open, I just can&apos;t see my experience being that different on another play through.
<br>
<br>This might just be me.. I am a firm believer that the RPG experience needs a reactive and intelligent dungeon master (and well actual roleplay, yadda yadda).. but this is still a fun dungeon crawl and puzzle game.
<br>
<br>Enjoyable and in the right direction, but not ace.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4643610">Expand</a></span>

Also lacks the charm and personality of Might and Magic X - so if you&apos;re craving an old school RPG fix I&apos;d recommend MMX over this.</span>

From that opening moment of taking my first steps in the dungeon that reminded me instantly of old school dungeon rpg&apos;s like &apos;Eye of the Beholder&apos; and &apos;Lands of Lore&apos;, to working my way to &apos;discover&apos; what was lurking at the bottom of the dungeon and thus unraveling the story, the game was enjoyable from start to finish.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately I can&apos;t say the same for The Legend of Grimrock II.  Yes it is certainly a polished and improved version of the 1st game, and I did like the outdoor environments and greater diversity of locations and areas to explore, but the game was a letdown in so many ways.
<br>
<br>The story was pretty much non-existent.  You only clue up to what is going on right at the end, there is very little early or mid-game to keep you moving.
<br>
<br>While I did enjoy solving &apos;some&apos; of the puzzles, there were just too many. For me it got to the point that by the late 3rd of the game I was simply using Google to figure out how to solve the puzzles or complete an area to move forward in the game versus enjoying exploring and figuring it out all bit by bit.
<br>
<br>The final kicker for me was the end boss fight, the &apos;real&apos; end, not the alternate end fight.   I couldn&apos;t beat the main dude as I got to the point in the game where I did not have enough healing resources to complete the battle.  I attempted it time and time again and used different tactics, in the end, and I&apos;m a bit ashamed to say this, I had to use the console cheat to generate some healing crystals, enough to survive the battle and win.  So it was not a good game ending experience for me.
<br>
<br>That said, I&apos;m glad I played the game and cudos to the indie development team for a doing a great job.
<br>
<br>If you are curious about the Legend of Grimrock games and you have not played either of them, I&#x2019;d definitely recommend playing the 1st game versus this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4784002">Expand</a></span>

<br>Time saving protip: the first plant boss fight is a good test. If that seems unreasonably difficult or frustrating, just give up.  It doesn&apos;t get any better.  If you love that and breeze through it, this is your type of game, go forth and conquer!
<br>
<br>Movement: ancient, clunky, limiting.  Tap-tap-tap for hours on end.
<br>
<br>Combat:
<br>Clunky, unintuitive DOS keyboard style, yet no keybinds for attacks (right-click for your life on little squares in the bottom corner of the screen), long cooldowns even on basic attacks, challenging enemies, some enemies are very fast, all in real time; no pause function.  &quot;2x2 step&quot; block based combat seems silly and old after a while.
<br>
<br>Puzzles:
<br>Unreasonably time consuming, good chance of getting stuck for hours retracing your steps all over the map with no discernible way forward.
<br>
<br>Starvation mechanic: irritating nuisance factor.
<br>
<br>You can of course mitigate all this with console cheats and internet walkthroughs, as I started doing near the end.  But then, what&apos;s the point?  Where&#x2019;s the fun?
<br>
<br>The high aggregate review rating seems to reflect 1) nostalgia and 2) special allowance since it&apos;s an indy game, small dedicated dev team etc.  Beautifully made game and a respectable achievement, absolutely.  But time is precious and I wish I&apos;d listened to the few negative reviews as well as the warnings in some of the more objective positive reviews.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4879847">Expand</a></span>

<br>So theres more classes, weapons and skills? Who cares, if you wanna beat the game you&apos;ll only use Mages and blockers
<br>Ok, the map is bigger... but half of the time I spent in the game was wondering where to go next, there is no guidance whatsoever, at first it seems cool, but then it gets annoying and frustrating. I doubt someone beat this game without the help of google at some moment (Different from the first game)
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t enjoy the new &quot;open world&quot; environment. The fact that you could leave the dungeons and see the &quot;calm blue sky&quot; or watch the waves at the beach tells you that &quot;Everything is alright, everything is Ok&quot;. While in the first game you felt like you were really locked in that place, surrounded by &quot;menace&quot; and the only choice was to go depper and more threatening, in the dungeon.
<br>
<br>Somehow the first game&apos;s boss was more charismatic than this one&apos;s. I don&apos;t have any argument to support this, but thats how it feels.
<br>
<br>The battle system - that, in the first game, was already a **** - is even worse. Since the monsters can attack faster than you, you are constantly moving and spining around like a retard to avoid being hit.
<br>
<br>Monster and food respawning (fishes) are a good improvement =)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4644428">Expand</a></span>

<br>Great game overall if took from oldschool game or clasiic rpg dosent matter its just cool.</span>

<br>If #1 is your idea of a great RPG, stay far away from this game (Go buy Wizardry 8).  If the idea of having no choices, no other characters except the player&apos;s party who don&apos;t matter, and no plot at all (solve puzzles on a mostly-empty island), then Legend of Grimrock II is game of the year.  Sad, really, since the game engine is great, and could be used as a vehicle for great story telling.  Wait for bargain-bin sale ($5 maximum)...this is a puzzler, not an RPG.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4658733">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Advancement is useless, skills are pointless and the enemies always overpower you. With the constant cooldowns and micro management needed the enemies quickly overwhelm you every time. In these types of situations you&apos;d retreat but you can&apos;t in this game because enemies tend to spawn around you, there is no place to corner and you&apos;re injuried. At the end of the game I felt just as powerless as the start.
<br>
<br>The game should have been called Legend of Micromanagement because that is what you do the entire game. From the continual need to eat to the continual conservation of ammo and energy you are constantly drinking potions during combat. On top of that most enemies do crippling damage making you unable to attack. You end up sitting there watching enemies take you apart in a couple of hits while you wait on some cooldown or fumble with the horrific inventory system to find a potion.
<br>
<br>The only thing this game got right is the map.  It is probably the best map implementation I&apos;ve seen. But everything else is simply poor game design.  As such I will not be playing any more of the Grimrock games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5580178">Expand</a></span>

In the first few chapters, I really believe they were right. The graphics were much better and the puzzles much more logical although the &quot;move and fight as a group only&quot; frustrating interface remained. But soon, the authors reverted to their first love of inane, clueless and totally obtuse puzzles with a &quot;you better be quick on the keyboard or else you fail&quot; gameplay. Your foes also get more accurate, stronger and so powerful that the only way to defeat them (And they come in multitude) is to use a glitch where they get caught somewhere on the map and can&apos;t fight you. Otherwise,
<br>a shot or two and it&apos;s &quot;game over&quot;.

<br>They&apos;ve kept what made Legend of Grimrock great, rectified some of its failings and generally expanded much on variety and content. The latter brings a failing new to Grimrock. Some of the puzzles and their clues span the game world and can require quite a bit of backtracking if you missed some clue along the way, or didn&apos;t bother writing it down.
<br>
<br>But these incidents are few and far between compared to all the goodness this game has to offer. New dangerous-looking enemies make it harder to dance around the less-than-up-to-it AI of the first game. I won&apos;t spoil it for you, but some enemies were just genious. The new environments, including outdoor ones, are varied and beautiful. New puzzle elements bring spice to the old formula, allowing you to feel different kinds of clever upon solving them. (Or different kinds of stupid!)
<br>
<br>Class and skill systems have been revised, with additional classes and a new race - the ratlings.
<br>
<br>In short, if you liked the first one, you&apos;re gonna love this one. One of the smartest games in existence. And it&apos;s nice enough to hope you&apos;re smart as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/legend-of-grimrock-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4640073">Expand</a></span>

Also the best point is that the game focuses less on super hard puzzles and makes smaller more pleasant ones and also adds more action and boss fights. This time I actually hope they make a sequel.</span>
