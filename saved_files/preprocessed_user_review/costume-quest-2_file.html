<br>Since I really liked the first episode, I should have appreciated this one; because once I have found an engaging gameplay, I really like to play it again in sequels. But in a strange way, Costume Quest 2 had a complete opposite effect on me.
<br>
<br>Maybe it&apos;s because of the long launch, the counter-intuitive main screen, the &quot;knock on doors for candies or combat&quot; part or the &quot;too-fine / too hard&quot; controls, I don&apos;t know. I felt the pleasurable experience from the first Costume Quest somewhat vanished.
<br>
<br>Even if I do appreciate hard and punishing games that presents tough challenges, doesn&apos;t help you a bit, and reward your efforts with mastery; I wasn&apos;t expecting Costume Quest 2 too challenge me that much when I only wanted a laid-back, relaxed play time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/costume-quest-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5584343">Expand</a></span>
