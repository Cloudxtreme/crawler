The company (ArenaNet) took some chances with this game. They went for a bit of a different skill/attribute set and a lot of other things. They really stepped out of the comfort zone and threw away the traditional MMORPG **** And guess what, it worked well. There were a few dull areas but those were overthrown by the glorious rest of the game. The missions were fun and enticing, the gear was visually appealing and could parts mixed and matched. The graphics were very good for a companies very first game. At release this game was magnificent, the cities were overflowing with people and the PvP arenas was a place to be. Now, not so much. The game has aged and the majority of players can be seen on the later expansion packs or winds of change one of the newer updates. So in all honesty, I wouldn&apos;t purchase the game based on those facts. Wait for Guild Wars 2, which still has no monthly fee. That game will be well worth the wait.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=2056778">Expand</a></span>

The fetch quest PvE content is sometimes bland but the main storyline quests are very good. The music is good enough but the sound effects sometimes are wanting. *clang* doesn&apos;t always cut it these days. Graphics are very good and GW runs well on older computers. The interface is great. You can make your own to suit your needs in game with very little hassle. ArenaNet makes updates, patches etc, very painless and you hardly notice. The technology behind the game is quite awesome. There are some gripes. Targeting needs to be improved. And sometimes you can get tripped up on invisible geometry. No jumping sadly. If you enjoy PvP there is no reason you should not check Guild Wars out. Everything else is icing on a very sweet cake.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=380412">Expand</a></span>

This game is the cure for your wallet, it&apos;s an engaging experience that won&apos;t burn your money. The PvP is one of this game&apos;s most stable and well-designed features, make no mistake this game does have PvE as any MMO game should. Also keep in mind this game is pure perfection if you do not mind instances when out questing. If you don&apos;t know what that means is, whoever you take with you whilst leaving the city/outpost, is all you&apos;re going to have with you. No random people coming in to yoink your xp gain or kill the mobs you set out to kill. They&apos;re all there, at every load. 1. Updates&gt; This game since release has had a variety of changes from classes to balancing.<br>2.The World&gt; The expansions add rewarding content is persistent for each of your characters, you can visit any continent as long as you&apos;ve reached the area to travel to it, the visuals are different everywhere you go, its always nice to have some new colors.<br>3.Since navigation is so simple and streamlined, the minimap also shows where you&apos;ve walked, making it easy for you not to get lost.<br>4. PvE combat&gt; PvE is well done, the mobs are easy to find and a wiki feature in the game makes it easy for you to find what you&apos;re looking for.<br>5. Questing and Progression&gt;This game is extremely quick to level in, what makes your character stronger is how you build their skills and set their gear. You&apos;ll reach max rank in no time, quest, do missions and your time shall not be wasted. Missions progress you through the storyline of each campaign (that is if you have the other expansions) but if you just own Prophecies it&apos;s the same deal.<br>6.End Game&gt; Since leveling is so quick, the true content of the game is its end game, you&apos;ll have a variety of missions and titles to gain and due to Guild Wars 2 on the way if you own Eye of the North, you will get rewards for completing them if you get the next installment. Raids, dungeons, (Speed clears) are all in the game, know your role and get moving.<br><br>This game leads you to have a much different experience at each turn, each class feels different, and a second play-through known as hard mode can get you some cash.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=2115912">Expand</a></span>

Well, the synopsis up there didn&apos;t mention that its FREE to play online, as opposed to some other massively online games. The missions and quests are genuinely fun to me, not just a thing to go through to level your character up. And the pvp is awesome. The thing that really appeals to me about this game the most I think is the freedom of choice it allows you. As a general rule, you can do what you find fun. If you just want to PvP (Player versus Player), you can create a maximum level character and get right into it, not to mention the ability to play against anyone in the world (If youre #1, youre not just #1 on a server, you are the best in the WORLD). If you like going through the storyline (which is also good, I might add,) and exploring, you can spend as much time doing that as you want. If you like to RP (Role-Play), the instancing sytem in GW has the added benefit of keeping people not in your party out of your perception. If you like planning and character building, this game has many different skills/spells with a wide variety of different affects, strengths and weaknesses for you to build upon. If you enjoy grind, you can choose to spend hours looking for the best items in the game, but that will have little affect on your performance in combat. Speaking of combat, it honestly is more about teamwork, strategy, personal playing skill and adaptability than any other game of this style that I&apos;ve played. Well Done, ArenaNet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=380346">Expand</a></span>

The storyline is fun and extremely interactive. Arenanet has made an extensive efffort to monitor this game for offensive language and content, which is a relief compared to so many other games. I&apos;m sick of playing with 10 and 12 year olds and having someone join the game only to go off with swearing and sexual references. Kudos to the Guild Wars crew regarding keeping the T rating in place. Most of all this game is designed for ultimate team play. The complete focus on Guild creation and growth is mesmerizing. I really can&apos;t say enough about this game. It is hands down one of the best games I have ever played console or pc. Thanks to all the Guild Wars team for making this game one to last the ages.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=380441">Expand</a></span>

Sound is, well, fairly nondescript - the music is pleasant but unmemorable, and effects are fairly generic for the genre. Now, onto the game itself. Guild Wars has garnered widespread critical and public acclaim for its skill-based gameplay, instanced PvE areas and (most of all) the lack of monthly fees, and I kinda enjoyed the beta weekend, so I picked it up shortly after release. Since then, I&apos;ve played it about 6 times in total - I reckon I can&apos;t have put in more than a few hours in total. But that&apos;s only because the game seems so directionless that it&apos;s difficult to feel any motivation to play. Admittedly I&apos;m a solitary gamer and tend to have an unfairly biased view of MMORPGs, but NCSoft claims there is incentive for single player play. If there is, it certainly didn&apos;t rear its head within the crucial first two hours. The gameplay is reminiscent of Diablo - click on an enemy to start attacking it, and you&apos;ll slug it out until one of you is dead. Whilst you&apos;re attacking you can use your various skills by pressing the hotkeys - typically these will deal extra damage, heal your wounds, or work in combination to produce even more powerful effects. The profession and skill system undeniably adds a huge amount of depth, but the system is intricate enough to totally put off RPG virgins such as myself. The game seems built around a mission structure of sorts, where you talk to people to receive quests as is standard for RPGs. Thus far, most of the quests I&apos;ve done (I haven&apos;t really touched on the main story arc at this point) have been &quot;go here, kill these monsters/rescue this attractive young woman/recover this artifact, then come back to me and I&apos;ll give you this item/these items/this amount of experience&quot;. If this is the standard by which MMORPGs are judged, then it&apos;s a genre I do not ever want to go near again, ever. I&apos;d say rent first, but this isn&apos;t an option, so instead I&apos;d suggest playing at a friend&apos;s for at least a few hours before you make the decision. I wish I had, in retrospect, then I wouldn&apos;t have wasted my money. That&apos;s not to say Guild Wars is a bad game - it&apos;s clear that a great deal of work has gone into creating it. It just doesn&apos;t appeal to me in anything more than a very superficial way. (Besides which, people are scary.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=382098">Expand</a></span>

Firstly, the game itself is great fun and a blast to sit down and play no matter how much time you have. 30 minutes? No problem, there&apos;s a lot you can get done, even if you feel like at the time you didn&apos;t. Gameplay is very good, and the scenery is breath taking. I used to play this game when everything first came out in 2005-2006 before I got really really into WoW. I gave up WoW for a year and went back but I have finally said no to WoW and decided it was time to play this game again. When I first played this game I wasn&apos;t all that great at it because I didn&apos;t try to link skills together, I just used what I felt was the most powerful skills. Now I have sat down and really looked at the skills and I have to say it is way better that I have taken the time to because honestly, I kill things that much faster. The instanced hunting grounds yes are boring with no one else there but I don&apos;t care. Crank up my music and turn me loose and I can hunt for four hours and not get bored once. Meeting people is easy if you are willing to go out of your way to try to get to know some of the people around you in town. Quest are a breeze, and with a mini map that guides you to the quest, why would you complain about not being able to jump? WoW, good luck figuring out where the crap you are supposed to be heading. Yeah some of the NPC&apos;s tell you a general direction, but that could be a huge swath of the zone if you&apos;re not careful. I can&apos;t speak for the PvP in this game because I have never actually tried it out. I do enjoy the PvE a lot but that is because I am determined and dedicated to getting what I need, no matter the ammount of time required to get it. No need for teir whatever gear to hunt? Oh yeah, that&apos;s what I&apos;m talking about. No monthly fee&apos;s? Yes please. Ability to mix two classes together to become an even more deadly fighter than you already were? Sign me up now! Downsides are yes it can be difficult to trust someone you meet on the game because there is a high potential that they will be a dick or try to scam you. It can be monotonous doing the same thing over and over, but that is to be expected with every game you play, so everyone can stop griping and get back to playing the game. No jumping. Yeah okay, I know I said it&apos;s not a big deal but it is true, who in the world can&apos;t jump? I say it for believability and natural ability of a human being, not because I want to be able to jump. Those are the only two major complaints I have for this game, and the jumping I view as a minor thing because it seems pointless to jump when your playing the game to go in and hack things to pieces. And trusting someone over a game you may never meet in real life? Not a reason the game lost points either of these things, it lost the points because I think that while the instanced hunting grounds are awesome maybe allow a few other people into the same one as you. A minimum of 20 so that way if a group of people hunt together that means there is still room for 16 others. I think the chance of seeing someone else out there doing the same thing as you also would give you incentive to team up and compare what quest you both need and that would form a bond of trust and a friendship that would allow you to know you have a friend in the game you can look for to hunt with. So over all I rate this game an 8 because yes it has a lot of plus factors, but there are still a few things that could really potentially be improved, even with the greatness that this game already is. On a more personal level for comparison, WoW and GW are nothing alike. They are two completely different games that were developed by two different companies. WoW has it&apos;s own perks, one of which is not graphics. GW to me is better than WoW because of the pure individuality that you can have with the 8 skills that you put on your bar that allow you to play however you want and not only that but the ammount of skills that you learn means that you never run out of combinations and chains of skills that you could potentially set up to use for a very very long time. Great game, and to be honest, so very glad I gave up WoW to get back into this amazing game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=1651331">Expand</a></span>

I have never been a fan of tiresome PVE, that leaves you feeling like the devs of the game are trying to waste as much of your time as possible. Guild Wars has fast, fun gameplay and the skill based system gives each class limitless build possibilities. The only people I&apos;ve found that just downright don&apos;t like the game are people that hate PVP, or were duped into playing another &quot;pay to play&quot; MMORPG, and are mad Guild Wars took all their players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=381650">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are insanely good for a game that doesn&apos;t need a ludicrous amount of processing power and the speed of the online gameplay is great with very little lag! The sound is nice, the menus work great once you get used to them and apart from the odd nonce, the game is very friendly. The first party I formed with another player has already forged a good online virtual friendship. I&apos;m only concerned that there might be limited story mode and then a bit of an annoying player v player aspect once you&apos;re done.

                                        <span> makes me laugh people who think this is a bad game or that wow is better or something, they obviously have not played it for long enough to realise how crack addicted they have, or will become. play this you enjoy it, you dont feel the frantic need to get gear or level or something, very very well made with no fees. (also pvp requires skill :O not just gear imagine that)</span>

That being said, its fun for what it is..but its not a WoW replacement or whatever your favorite MMORPG is.. it just doesn&apos;t have the depth that will keep you coming back for more or the character development that really makes you care about your character...honestly i can&apos;t even remember my characters name or what he looks like. If they could take some of those amazing interactive quest that make you feel like your making a difference in the gaming world..(like the catapult quest against the Charr for those of you, who have played the game) and blend them with more of the exploration, discovery and character development of WoW...I&apos;d be sitting there now playing it, not writing this review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=381634">Expand</a></span>

The developers took the standard online grind and turned it on its head. it cut out a lot of the grind and gave us the freedom to do what we want. After being converted, you&apos;ll ask of other MMPORGs: Why can&apos;t we teleport between towns? Why is time grinding more important than skill? This game cuts the fat and leaves a lean and enjoyable experience.</span>

One can easilly have upwards of 400 hours of playing time and still not have been to all the places, or tried all the skills, or completed all the quests - that&apos;s excelent value for a $45 game with no fees. The game is easy to play, but difficult to master.</span>

The dual class system is a really good idea for an mmo and the PvP isnt as bad as people say it is, they just need to discover the PvP server. This MMO is by far one of the farthest from being like WoW, which to me is a good thing because all newer mmos are either WoW related or crap. The reason why the game is so cool (for me anyways) is that theres no one to steal kills while you are on your high adventure, the entire game is instanced, you dont have to go alone, there are henchmen you can chose from, or just go with a group. Awesome game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=424533">Expand</a></span>

One: No Subscription Fees! Two: PVP ZOMG!!! This game is really heavy with PvE and PvP, so you have a good balance of the two. Think of the PvE part as your &quot;training&quot; for the PvP arenas. Most major skills that you obtain are arquired through the PvE portion of the game and usually allow you to experiment with different environments with monsters that all react differently. PvP is more about preparation rather than running in swinging your hammer ( though that usually works for warriors hehe). Teams in Random Arenas usually never have a good team set up since it is RANDOM. Team Arenas offer the ability of forming a team so you have a tactical advantage since your team SHOULD function as a team but usually doesn&apos;t since everyone goes solo and everyone dies and blames the healer in the group (lol). There are more arenas but I&apos;ll leave that up to the player. One thing about Prophecies or Guild Wars, is that the original, which is Prophecies, Is VERY long and difficult. If your the type to solo a mmo then you&apos;ll have no problem reaching cap. Though you will hate it once you find out that every other enemy is 2 to 10 levels above your maxed level and that you will have to rely on either your henchman (mindless AI) or human players (mindless-at-times-but-better-than-nothing AI) to help you get through a mission or quest or just to reach the next town. And remember, always point fingers at the groups healer for they know what is their job...to keep you alive and then fail miserably and have you start the quest or mission all over again. Overall Guild Wars is good, but not the holy grail of mmos and hey you won&apos;t have to worry on paying a fee every month if that&apos;s your thing. I give it a 9 since it&apos;s what I started on and still enjoy spamming &apos;WTB UR MUM&apos; on the public channels. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=83634">Expand</a></span>

But, my wife and I, who are serious role-players, each got a copy of this the same day a while ago and we haven&apos;t looked back. The graphics are stunning as well as the game having a decent storyline so far. Add the fact that there are no monthly fees and there is continual updating going on to add balance to the game and I&apos;d say you have one heck of a product here. We look forward to seeing this universe expand as time goes on and will be loyal fans for quite some time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=383676">Expand</a></span>

This is probably the one and only MMO that has successfully implemented a story into the game. It really feels like you&apos;re really taking part in the history and further development of this world. There are tons of quests with a variety of objectives. The graphics are absolutely beautiful. The PvP arena system is quick, easy and fun. I really cannot say enough about how awesome this game is. I only have 2 complaints. My first complaint is some of the people who play the game don&apos;t seem to notice that it is an MMO and they&apos;re never willing to help anyone unless it&apos;s also in their best interests. I actually had someone deny me help on a quest because he didn&apos;t have it so he thought it would be a waste of time to help out a fellow player. My other complaint is a very minor one, but it&apos;s still there. There are still a couple bugs in the game which need to be worked out and the game needs a little more balancing for the solo players. Seeing as the first complaint has nothing to do with the actual design of the game and the second complaint is so minor that it never really takes away from your amazement from the rest of the game I have to give this game a 10. Simply amazing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=380329">Expand</a></span>

I flat out love this game because its amazingly easy to just pick up and play. I have a wife and baby and I still get to enjoy this game without having to spend my life on it to have fun. The pvp is definately awesome and all the impatient whiners out there won&apos;t be disappointed if they just stick it out to get that lvl 20 character. The pvp is insanely fun even moreso than the pve which is top-notch despite some minor quibbles that you&apos;ve all read about. The one thing that I&apos;m not crazy about is that there really is no sense of community or spirit of helping new people like I&apos;ve seen in some other games I&apos;ve played. Now I don&apos;t know if its any different in like say WoW or any other mmpog but this game for some reason brings out the selfish moron in alot of people. Even though you can&apos;t solo, people seem to just party for themselves and not the party. But when you do get a solid mature party which for me has been more often than not, its really great and well worth it. To date, this has been the best game I have ever played. WoW almost sucked me in.. I almost coughed up a monthly fee for that one and I almost got sucked in by the hype alone, but I guess what turned me off were the cartoony blocky graphics I saw in the screenshots. I read that most people praise that game for its graphics, they just didn&apos;t grab me personally. Now if I wouldve been able to play a demo of WoW like I did with GW, then perhaps I would be playing both by now. But GW wins my money and the developers should be praised for putting out such a polished great game that so many people can enjoy regardless of their experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=380763">Expand</a></span>

Leaves room for a lot of strategy planning and combinations (kinda like Magic TG).</span>

If you love PVP and dont mind paying monthly fees, go for Risk your Life, wich has the best PVP system in my oppinion. Now if you&apos;re looking for an addictive RPG, balanced economy, awesome graphics and gameplay and what is very curious about this game, there arent many kids playing, wich means its not so hard to have a good conversation or finding help, you&apos;ll love this game. I&apos;ve played all kinds of RPGs so far, from Tibia to WoW, and I can assure you GuildWars is a good reason for you not to pay to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=380884">Expand</a></span>

IF this IS indeed the first chapter THEN I cannot wait for the next installments, so long as they keep doing an excellent job. Unlike WoW or most MMORPGs, GW has no monthly fees... and is actually a great play. The game skill system and two profession really makes it shine because it means you can balance out your character and still suit your playing style (Unlike WoW whose only powerhouse characters are Shamans and Rogues... bleh!). Warriors are actually real good in this game. And so are the rest of the professions. What downside they have you make up for it with your secondary profession. Warrior has no range? Choose Elementalist or Ranger. Wish your Monk healer could do more then just heal? Get a Mesmer or Necromancer as secondary profession. What&apos;s more this games&apos; 8 skill limit allows to create diffrent build strategies. For example I have monk/mesmer and I already have like three builds prepared and more coming in the way as I study the skills and create combos in my 8 skill limit. Kind of like playing Magic with 8 combo cards. This game&apos;s graphics are amazing to say the least. GW has a fan. And if their installments make this better they sure won their money here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=381764">Expand</a></span>

I have had a little experience with Ever Quest, and a WHOLE lot of experience with World of Warcraft. Guild Wars should continue to be better with updates, fixes, balances, and expansions, just like every other persitent online game. Guild Wars sets itself apart in a few good respects: -The updating is painless. No need to download huge patches. It patches small parts of the game as you load different areas. Very nice. Nothing worse than jumping on to play a little of your game to realize that you have to spend the next 30 - 60 mins downloading and patching before you can jump on and play like in WOW. -The gameplay is fun and tailored more toward skill. You do have to spend some time leveling up your character if you want the best of the best, but it is the same in ANY MMO out there, it&apos;s the whole point of giving you something to keep doing and goals to achieve. One of my favorite things is the rewards for completing quests. You actually get skills for completing quests. This to me helps get rid of the desire to &quot;grind&quot; for levels. As in WOW, it is actually quicker to just &quot;farm&quot; or &quot;grind&quot; in a specific area for experience to level than to do the quests. All you get from the quests in WOW is weapons , armor, or items that are most likely (%90 of the time) worse than what you already have. Also with GW it is nice not knowing when or where you will actually be getting your next skill from. I know that sounds wierd, but in WOW you get &quot;new&quot; skills (&quot;new&quot; is usualy just upgrades for the skills you already have, you will have %60 of all the skills you will ever learn by lvl 20, %80 by lvl 30, and %95 by lvl 40) every &quot;even&quot; level. And it could take a good 3 hrs to get to the next level, if all you do is grind. So you play for about 6 hrs killing the same thing over and over again to get small upgrades. And you keep doing it cause you know you have to to get that new item, armor, skill, etc. With GW since you don&apos;t have that whole level crunching to get what you want thing, you are enticed to explore the world. -And the world is nicely detailed. It could use a little more fleshing out, but over all it is nice. It really is no different than any other MMORPG. The land is vast with small pockets of towns, and is sparsely populated with NPCs. The same with WOW. But what is nice with GW is that once you get to a main town/outpost, you can teleport thier instantly. In WOW you might spend 20 mins just flying/running to get to where you need to be, and that is only once you hit lvl 40 and buy a mount (wich is no small feat or small amount of cash). With WOW before you are lvl 40 you could easily spend 30 - 60 mins. Depending on whether or not you have gotten the right &quot;Flight Paths&quot; to get to where you need to be. -The Quest sytem is nice in GW. It&apos;s easy to understand, and you get a friggin green arrow that tells you where you should be going next, what instance to go into, and where on the map you need to be. In WOW, good luck, you will probably be looking it up in an Online Database, or asking around. Wich is not such a big deal, but you will be amazed at how much more time is spent actually playing instead of runing around looking for stuff, and how more efficient you can plan your questing adventures. A few mins spent in GW you can see how many quests are in a certain area and plan to do those so that you can kill more birds with one stone. Thank you for that Anet. -Once you get to the lvl Cap and have gotten all your skills (there are &quot;elite&quot; skills which you can only get by learning them from enemies) you can do the PvP portions of the game, wich are fast paced and action packed. I&apos;ve read a lot of things about how hard it is to compete in PvP because you can&apos;t find a good group of people to play with. Well it&apos;s the same in ANY online game RPG or FPS or RTS. It takes some time to find good people to play with, but once you do it can be a lot of fun. At least in GW you have the options to join a PvP game by yourself, or with a group you&apos;re with, or do guild vs guild. And the system matches you up with like experienced/leveled/Rank people. You can kind of do the same thing in WOW, with the battle grounds addition (wich was just added about mid year 2005), but the long que waits (about 20 - 45mins depending on server population) might be kind of tedious for you. Especially if your lvl 60 with not a whole lot to do otherwise. And with GW if you don&apos;t want to do the questing part of the game you don&apos;t have to. You can imediatley create a PvP only character. Your PvP only character will not have all the perks of a character that got to lvl 20 by questing, but you can still have a lot of fun, you just won&apos;t be the best of the best. At least you have the option. -As far as GW not being considered a MMO: GW in my opinion is more MMO than any other MMORPG. With WOW you pick a specific server to build your characters on. You can have many characters on several different servers, but if they are on different servers you can&apos;t play with people on other servers. Wich might not be a big deal, but if you find you like the people better on a certain server or want to play on the RPG servers or PvP servers, you have to be lucky enough for them to offer transfers from your server to those servers. Wich they don&apos;t seem to do until a specific server is being over populated. Where as with GW you are automatically logged on to a specific &quot;district&quot; and at your whim you can change districts. Even internationally. This way ANYONE that plays GW can hook up with ANYONE else that is on at the time. That to me is closer to &quot;Massively Multiplayer&quot; than the server specific variety of MMO&apos;s. -In relation to the whole MMO thing. Everything outside the main towns/outposts is instanced for every specific group. I love this. As in all MMORPG&apos;s there is a lot of quests that require you to spend time traveling in the unknown wilderness to get something, kill something, etc. Few things are more bothersome than going to do such a quest and finding several like powered individuals doing the exact same thing. I thought I was supposed to be unique, I thought my quest was uniqe. WOW fails misrabley here. You will always be on the same quest as someone else, if not many people. You might even have to wait around while the enemy critter(s) respawn, or even fight with someone else over who gets to kill what, or just get ganked. This is not an epic experience to me. So what if I&apos;m a powerfull &quot;Hero&quot; there are going to be thousands of the exact same type of hero out there with you. The &quot;World&quot; of Warcraft is populated more by &quot;heroes&quot; than normal peole. In GW it may be the case as well, but at least you don&apos;t have to see them all the time. -There is not a lot of emphisis on item collection for other than profit/sales. This I know a lot of people dislike, but in my opinion it adds to the gameplay. Instead an endless struggle to get a new axe with a +2 to strength instead of a +1, it doesn&apos;t really matter in GW. You will be just as effective, and they are there for the item needy person, but the game doesn&apos;t revolve around it. It&apos;s all WOW is about really, getting a better version of what you had before. -The skill system is really nice in GW. You only get to take 8 skills into battle. Wich can be frustrating at times, where you wish you would have taken another skill instead, but over all it forces you to be specific on what type of character you are playing. Wich is also nice because there are more than one use/roll for your character now. The duel class system is cool, you get to choose from two sets of skills, but only the first class you choose lets you alter thier main attribute, wich does make a difference in you character. And the abillity to change you attributes at will is very nice. Now you can only change skills/spells and attributes in main towns/outposts, but the frustation is minimal for the freedom to tailor your character so many ways. -The rank system for new items is nice to me. It gives the long term player something to shoot for. And it is no better or worse than WOW in my opinion, both are a pain for the casual gamer and a pain for the consitent gamer. It rewards time spent gaming. Same with WOW. -I really like the story of GW. It could be a little deeper, but it&apos;s nice. I also like you the land changes with the story. Right now there is only the two settings, or time periods, but at least I felt that I went a long with a change in time for the game. I also like how the main characters of the story are also interactive with most of the main quests. When you are called to help the prince with pushing back the enemy, he is there with you fighting along side. Also seen in many of the &quot;side&quot; quests with the everyday folk. Or when you complete a quest that called you to kill a Leader or find a group and lead them back, if you go back to the same spots later the people or leader are gone. Giving you a sense of actual accomplishment. Good luck in WOW to see any of this in WOW. Very few NPC characters actually physically come along with you, and if they do then that means someone else can&apos;t interact with them, and vise versa for you. Not one time in my whole WOW career did I ever see any piece of land change or NPC character good or bad change, wether or not I completed a specific quest 10 times. How epic is that. The biggest reason for this is because there isn&apos;t a whole lot to do than the same thing over and over again in WOW, that&apos;s why so many people have logged in so many hours in WOW. They took half a game, spread it out over twice as many levels as they should have, and charged people for it. Wich leads into my biggest rant. -GW is free to play online. They update it regularly, with new content as well as fixes. WOW charges you $13 - $15 per month to play (depending on whether you pay monthy or in 6 month blocks, both reacuring automatically), wether you play at all or all day everyday. And that&apos;s not the worst part. WOW was released before it was complete. So you payed $50 for half a game, I already said that I know, but one of the biggest reasons Blizzard said the cost was so high per month was because they would be updating it constantly for free. Well guess what, a year later they are finally to the point the game should have been when it was released. This is not an opinion. You can&apos;t honestly tell me that such big things like the PvP ranking/honor sytem was something they just came up with, or the battle grounds addition. These where things they had planned that just didn&apos;t get in to the release. And there is more updates comming. Now for some numbers. 5 million people have active accounts on WOW, most are paying accounts, some are trial accounts. Lets go back a bit and cut the number in have just to be conservative. Lets say 2 million people have been playing and only half of those were paying customers, and lets say they all payed in 6 month blocks at $13 a month. 1 million times $13 a month = 13 million dollars a MONTH, with equals 156 million dollars a year. If that isn&apos;t absurd to you then you have a bigger problem than what video game to play. There is no way that it cost that much to keep WOW servers running or fix bugs. And that number is not including the original profit from the sales of the game, (remember each paying active account also bought the game) or the profit from the merchandise they sell, and there is a whole lot of merchandise to buy and or being bought. So with all that cash they are just finishing a game and guess what, they are going to charge you another $20 - $50 to buy the expansion 1st quarter 2006. This is the main reason I quit WOW, I can not support such a greedy company for a product that is lower in quality than one that is of higher quality from a company that does just as much if not more for thier game. -On some less positive notes for GW: Jumping would be nice. I know it doesn&apos;t really do anything for you and would mess up the PvP arenas (they could disable it there) it is just nice to jump, small con in my opinion. A little more content on the RPG side of the game would be nice. More scripted quests with NPC&apos;s would be nice. Over all just small cons that could be or will be changed/fixed with updates and expansions. All in all this is a very good game and has shown it is impoving. It is the best MMORPG out there in my opinion, but that doesn&apos;t mean it will satisfy everyone out there. And another game is sure to come alone to take your time elsewhere. At least with GW when the time comes for that other game you will still have some cash in your pocket :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=384914">Expand</a></span>

I beta tested it long ago and it didn&apos;t fail to impress.  Most people who say they hate this game are fanboys of other MMOs which I will not mention, and just don&apos;t get the whole concept behind the game.  It&apos;s not supposed to take months to reach a ridiculously high level, then hours of killing monsters to get ridiculously overpowered weapons and armor.  It is meant to be heavily based on tactics and skill.  The low level cap and the ability to get &quot;maxed&quot; weapons (weapons with maximum stats for that particular category) about midway through the main story forces players to really build their character with different skills that complement each other, then use them right.  If you like grinding, raiding, and games that are based much more on having an incredibly high level or incredibly powerful equipment, Guild Wars is NOT for you.  It isn&apos;t a perfect game, with limited support and a bit lacking in an MMO feel, but it certainly isn&apos;t anything close to a bad game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=1730211">Expand</a></span>

Recently I decided to give it a second chance when I was offered the opportunity to play it again, and I&apos;m glad that I picked it up for a second go.  Once I got into the game, I became immersed in the story and the characters.  The gameplay is slightly awkward for somebody who isn&apos;t used to it, but once I started to get the hang of things I really began enjoying myself.  You don&apos;t have to party up with people if group work isn&apos;t your thing, and I like that a lot.  I can play with friends if I want to, or I can just do things alone.  I don&apos;t have to team up with total strangers that could potentially ruin my experience.  Granted, I have met some nice people and the community seems to be nice overall, which is a good thing.  Really looking forward to finishing up the campaigns in this game, and especially looking forward to the sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=2195397">Expand</a></span>

Now, after having spent much more time with this game I have found it to be a very good game overall, with a very very bad death penalty system.  Taken as a whole this game and all its additions (3 campaigns, linked as smaller parts of the bigger story and one expansion to the larger story) is very well done.  The engine is old, 6 years and counting, yet the graphics are still decent and when compared to the king of MMO&apos;s (Warcraft, terrible game that it&apos;s become) they are better.  Landscapes often look like art, as if you are exploring a giant painting.  The characters are very nicely modeled and no two look alike.  This game allows a player to fully customize their appearance through the use of gear and dyes so you can look exactly how you want to.  There are also optional costumes for purchase should one so desire.  The quests are typical of any MMO or RPG and should be easily recognizable to anyone who has ever played one.  One thing I particularly like about this game is the monsters, of endless varieties, are not pushovers.  Combat is actually challenging.  You have to think before you pull, do it wrong you die.  But, then enters the worst thing about the game...the death penalty.  You die 15% is taken off your health and mana.  That pretty much stays unless you kill A LOT of mobs or have some potions (which I&apos;m told exist, but have yet to see one).  Kill a world boss, you get 2% taken off the 15...not much and the bosses are that much harder.  Death in what are called &quot;missions&quot;, the larger quests that actually tell the story reset the entire mission and could waste an hour or more of your time.  Dieing in this game sucks, period.  The abilities and different &quot;builds&quot; you can create are vast, allowing you to choose from a pool of tens, if not hundreds of combat moves and spells.  The possibilities are really endless.  The guild and communication interfaces could use a modernization and the UI doesn&apos;t give as much info as I would like, but those are minor things.  The game would score a 9 or best MMO type game available from me, except the death penalty really really pisses me off.  Played carefully, its a great game.  Oh, and for around $40 you can get all the content the game has and there&apos;s no extra cost necessary, ever.  Best MMO style game value in the industry, hands down.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=1615884">Expand</a></span>

You can grind out titles which do nothing besides increase your e-peen or grind out materials for armor which have no better stats than armor you can get for cheap - again increasing your e-peen but no real benefit other than that.<br><br>(3) No worries about making a mistake with your character - it&apos;s very easy to change out what you use. Fitting the no-grind theme of this game.<br><br>(4) Perfect way to deal with death imo - you fail the quest but you don&apos;t lose anything like experience or items. Plus you only fail the quest after dying multiple times.<br><br>(5) It&apos;s fun!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=2286931">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve watched as the staff at ArenaNet busily work toward the big &quot;E3 for Everyone&quot; demo I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve already downloaded the installer for, and I see so many great additions that my jaw literally drops.

Once I got it and put it in, I was a bit underwhelmed. It seemed like it was just a pretty game with little actual substance. This changed within a couple hours of play. An event called the Searing- this is not a spoiler as it&apos;s in the frickin&apos; game manual- changes the challenge level and removes the &quot;fetch this item&quot; quests that plagued the first hour or so. This game is full of enjoyable experiences, but it must be said that the field that it completely revolutionizes is PvP. The team-based PvP experience is so unlike those of other games as to render comparisons useless. Teamwork and strategy are emphasized, preventing the game from becoming an exercise is overcoming level differences. This game is excellent. If you take the time to read the comment below the lower reviews yyou will find that they have been placed there by people who either a) offered no reasons for their low score or b) based it off something other than the game itself, like the fact that they did not understand the pre-order system and how it would be put into effect. This game offers a huge amount of very enjoyable playtime and is well worth the price of admission. Have fun, guys.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=380433">Expand</a></span>

Its hard to get a group of 4 people together and go on quests, so that u r left to do things alone (With the help of AI NPCs)(I talk about European Servers) The PVP might be good, but not as good as games that are designed exclusively for this. the fact that they dont have seperate servers for different language areas makes it worse. (Again, european servers)</span>

The feature of how your character auto follows your opponent (wow real skill) is incredibly annoying.  The game is worse than SWTOR when it comes to being on &quot;rails&quot;.  I am excited for GW2 but if it is anything like GW1 I will not be purchasing.</span>

When I first bought the first one, I completed tutorial island hoping it was going to get some more action, but I was proved wrong, and still it was mission after mission.. Cutscene after Cutscene. The ONLY compliment I have is that it is cheap, but definately not worth it, if this game had a monthly payment, then literally no one would play. It is an awful game, it is tedious, the graphics are nothing special, I could never see the fun in playing this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=402835">Expand</a></span>

Sadly one day arenanet decided to go &quot;hey, let&apos;s completely destroy all PvP in the game, and then make the PvE grind the primary interest of the game&quot; Now PvP is filled with unskilled noobs that think grind = skill (I just recently watched a couple of obs, not a single person in any of them knew how to qstep) You are forced to either use builds fully automated bots can play better than you, or end up being significantly weaker then your enemy. Arenanet entirely fails at balancing the game, only if a skill is so unbalanced it literally gives permanent immortality (Shadow Form) is it even fixed, and that&apos;s after A WHOLE YEAR of people abusing it. I don&apos;t think I need to say much about PvE, it&apos;s fun the first time you complete it, but after that it&apos;s just pure grind. It was a great game 5 years ago, and probably would have been now if PvP wasn&apos;t destroyed. I&apos;ve spent a lot of fun hours in this game, RIP original Guild Wars</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/guild-wars/user-reviews?user_review_id=1396849">Expand</a></span>
