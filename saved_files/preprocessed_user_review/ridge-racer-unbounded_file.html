                                        <span>It takes elements from NFS, Split Second and Bournout. And that is a good thing! Oh this game is so cool with the oldskool Ridge Racer drifting in it! I really like it. Unfortunatly it is a bit simple and linear. And also does not feel very polished. But its fun in a box, just be sure not to pay more than 20&#xE2;</span>

First I&apos;d like to say that I wasn&apos;t big fan of Ridge Racer brand so partially that was my fault because I expected to be more like Flatout serial (because of Bugbear). It runs smoothly, it has lots of content, but it feels somehow outdated at least for the PC. I hated that console menus and obvious lack of config options. Lighting effects can be annoying sometimes but generally they look cool. What about driving? It is ok - arcade like, when you get grip you can easily  maneuver your vehicle. However I didn&apos;t like drifting, it&apos;s kind of unrealistic but as I have found out later it&apos;s main feature/characteristic of RR games in the past. What I expected to be better are car physics and car destruction, FO UC is much better in both and I thought that creators of that game can do only better, but I was wrong. So if you like to play Flatout stick to it, don&apos;t waste your time on RR, it&apos;s quite different game (as it should be).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ridge-racer-unbounded/user-reviews?user_review_id=2427030">Expand</a></span>

The cars all control like bricks, when you try to go around corners without drifting you go straight into a wall, when you try to go around corners drifting you go sidewalls into a wall, the &quot;smash through things, big explosions&quot; features do almost nothing about the actual race progression, and the races are either super frustrating (when you get stuck on a wall you thought you could smash though because there&apos;s no visual distinction between destructible objects and indestructible ones) or easy as cake (when you manage to take the corners in some way and you run kilometres in front of the competition) to the point where the last races in the game feel exactly like the first ones (including the difficulty level), only in a different district. The relative shortness doesn&apos;t help either, and the track editor is so unimaginative that you start assuming that the actual game race tracks were built in it. The icing on this bitter cake is a soundtrack that consists mostly of repetitive techno. If you want to see a game that does pretty much every single thing much better go and get Burnout Paradise.<br><br>P.S.: As I long time Destruction Derby and FlatOut fan I can assure that it&apos;s absolutely NOTHING like these games (pretending that FlatOut Ultimate Carnage doesn&apos;t exist because it was almost as awful as this game).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ridge-racer-unbounded/user-reviews?user_review_id=2301784">Expand</a></span>

The only thing &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; about this game are the light trails when boosting. Although RR:U does not match the quality of the mechanics from any of those games, mixing those mechanics ensures the game still reaches the same level of action that is still fast and NON-STOP (non-stop chains of drifting, environment destruction, and fragging - your mileage may vary). Watch the Steam trailer, because what you will see is actually what you will get. Even the music from that video is taken from the game. User created tracks ensure longer replay value, but multiplayer competition is, as of now, non-existent. It may not be unique like the games that it seems to emulate, but it&apos;s still a great addition to anyone&apos;s virtual racing collection. Oh, and it runs at a smooth 60fps with vsync on as long as your PC can handle it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ridge-racer-unbounded/user-reviews?user_review_id=2280259">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You need to destroy things or tailgate to boost your nitro which you can only use when it is full. But if there is nothing to destroy, no one near you and no big turns to drift, you have nothing you can do.
<br>
<br>And then there is the frag detection on you and the other guys. It seems to just decide randomly it seems. I can be going full speed into something that would get destroyed if my nitro was on but a millisecond after it runs out and I crash into it instead of drive through? How is this fair? It should be based on speed not if my nitro is still running. Also, when I ram into another car and they have nitro on but I am the one doing the ramming, why do I get destroyed?
<br>
<br>On top of all that, the drifting is horrible. This is a staple of the Ridge Racer games, is it supposed to be arcade style drifting? I don&apos;t get it. I tried really hard to understand it but if I can take a turn without drifting a lot better than if I did drift, or if the other cars can turn on a dime while I have to drift directly into a wall to make the turn every time, that just isn&apos;t good.
<br>
<br>Maybe I am missing something but that drifting problem alone kills the enjoyment for me. Top it off with those dead zones where there is no possible way to get boost...

Yet you can destroy pretty large targets - like stationary lorries, or even an entire petrol station, which completely negates any comment about logic.

<br>Not the best Ridge Racer I&apos;ve ever seen. In fact, I would not even begin to think about recommending it.
<br>Tries to be a lot of fun, but I didn&apos;t think it was a lot of fun, not least because I thought it perhaps wasn&apos;t intended for gamers of my spritely age (no I&apos;m not telling you, yes I&apos;m probably old enough to be your dad or your grandad).
<br>Graphically, it was okay, I wouldn&apos;t say it was the best I&apos;ve ever seen, but it was presentable.
<br>In terms of control, well.....keyboard control always seems to be a...bugbear ?...with what look to be obvious console ports, and this is no exception, you either ARE hitting space to drift, or you are NOT. And then what ensues is a maddeningly horrible display of skidpan chicanery. I would really not buy this game if you are too seriously into the &apos;grown up&apos; version of racing (NFS Shift 2 / F1 Twothousandandwhatever) but if you really do like just having fun and don&apos;t mind losing an immense number of races to get anywhere because you don&apos;t have a gamepad, or simply because you aren&apos;t that great at it, then &apos;Shatter Bay&apos; (hardly imaginative title), is probably a good place to be, but I wouldn&apos;t bank on it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ridge-racer-unbounded/user-reviews?user_review_id=3945481">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros
<br>+Variety of type of races and events including Domination Race, Frag Attack, Shindo Racing, Drift Attack and Time Attack all across seven different districts
<br>+Innovative gameplay to the Ridge Racer series includes destruction of vehicles and buildings
<br>+Create your own track mode allows you to create your own race map/level
<br>+Online mode includes Multiplayer and the ability to create/do challenges
<br>+Includes cameos and custom cars dedicated to Pacman, Tekken, Soul Calibur and other Namco series
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-Plays nothing like Ridge Racer since its made by the FlatOut development group
<br>-Soundtrack not as good as other Ridge Racer games
<br>-Level design is quite limited and almost feels like you are in the same map/level
<br>-You are limited to what cars you can use depending on the event
<br>-Controls especially with drifting can be frustrating
<br>-Difficulty and learning curve is a bit high</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ridge-racer-unbounded/user-reviews?user_review_id=4895843">Expand</a></span>

There is plenty of user made maps available in a convenient way and the map-creator should provide quite a bit of fun for those into that. It is also possible to control the game with your keyboard without getting a headache. The game do sadly have quite a limited selection of game-modes and cars. The maps do also get kind of samey despite the map editor since its all based around the same map-buildlng blocks. The options menu is also quite bare and i have personally not been able to find any multiplayer opponent to race against so far( New maps are however added all the time). But there is still enough content in the game to satisfy and i would definitely recommend this game for racing fans. I should also mention that the game is quite tough for an arcade racing game which might scare some people away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ridge-racer-unbounded/user-reviews?user_review_id=2943056">Expand</a></span>

At first I was a little annoyed at the fact the the drifting was utter crap and the game itself was WAY too hard, but then I started to understand how to play it properly, I stopped thinking the drifting was horrible, I realised it was a game that needed patience to play, because it takes a while of getting used to.
