It wasn&apos;t too much of a problem in beta but now its horrible There were also sound changes, like the choppers sounding like lawnmowers. If you want a fps to play if your PC cant handle the likes of BF2 or even CS:S, play this. Its pretty good.</span>

The sound you were referring to was probably when it was so farked... That has been fixed. It isn&apos;t the best but I don&apos;t see what the problem is now. War Rock, on a competitive level, is a GREAT game. Too bad there&apos;s only one &quot;real&quot; league that hosts it (ESL) and they don&apos;t allow US players on ESL.eu, but then they fail to promote ESL-America. I wouldn&apos;t mind pumping money into a league that supported the US and also promoted itself to anywhere but the EU. Sorry, got on a rant there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-rock/user-reviews?user_review_id=422360">Expand</a></span>

I know that the game does not run on a dedicated server system like cs or bf2, but the lag really deducts from the game play. At the time of this comment, the game has been out for retail for about 4 days and the lag and problems have gotten worse than when the game was in beta. You may be getting 30 ping when you connect to the server, but when you are in game, the lag is unbearable. You will see people teleporting all over the place and the kill display system isn&apos;t even working properly. When you kill a person with an m4, it says that you killed them with a famas instead. Personally, I don&apos;t think that this game was ready for retail especially since the game has more problems in the retail release than in the beta version. The website says that they are working on patches to fix the problems, but a retail release shouldn&apos;t include the horrible lag and bugs in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-rock/user-reviews?user_review_id=395739">Expand</a></span>

If you want truly massive, go play Planetside, which has been out for years now! And why on earth would I want to PAY to get guns CS:S gives me for free, without the lag and crappy graphics. Nice try, but needs serious work.</span>

Weapons are not realistic when compared to their real versions (m4 is better than famas realistically) but they are balanced, so it eliminates the need for realism in the weapons. the game updates based on what people ask for, when they asked to install a lag meter nexon did. however, it seems that they don&apos;t care enough to listen to the good ideas unless there&apos;s 60 people making posts and everyone agreeing on each post. seems like the updaters are lazy and do the bare minimum of what they have to. the servers crash often. and I mean OFTEN. almost once a day now unexpectedly and there&apos;s a planned crash on Wednesdays. there are also bugs and glitches yet to be worked out, hacking seems to be easy for this game also. mostly lhacker wannabes using win RAR and getting infinite stamina and unreleased weapons and such. they arent cracked down on hard enough so those people are not rare. options for premium members are not diverse enough, and are either a cheap but a bad deal or an expensive proposition for a few in game dollars and an exp boost. however there is a certain rpg addictiveness that the game has going. weapons are fun to use and each class&apos; pros and cons are emphasized (for instance iron sights are not added to give the snipers an upper hand to create balance) what most are concerned with is &quot;OOH i dont wanna pay for in game items when i can just play counter strike for free&quot; -- you do not HAVE to pay for in game items. they come with permanent *YES I SAID PERMANENT* dinars collected throughout several games that allow you to lease weapons that you can keep for up to a month. all free when it comes to real life money. so in ways WR is better than CS:S. but in other aspects such as lagg (laggy players have the option of playing once they are able to get into a game no matter what their current ping is) and the class of players roaming the battlefields and game parlors. (usually very whiney, quick to call someone a hacker even if their k/d ratio is .5) who like talk smack. A LOT. If the players were filtered out instead of the language and the issues that need pressing were fixed the game would be great. A for the game D for the administration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-rock/user-reviews?user_review_id=396989">Expand</a></span>

They have way 2 much bugs and even if they fix them the game would still be a second rate counter strike.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-rock/user-reviews?user_review_id=397828">Expand</a></span>

Now when I play it again with the new updates. I only see 2 types of soldiers in the server; anti-tank and scout. All infantries will be sniped by snipers and all vehicles will be knocked out by anti-tanks. Assault - no reason to use this since assault is used to kill other infantries, and scouts can kill assaults from miles away without them knowing what hit them. Medic - unlike BF2 where you earn points when you heal somebody, here nobody would even care about other people, since healing them wouldnt do anything for them. Engineer - just like medics, nobody would bother to help their teammates. Also mines are never as efficient as rocket launchers since the mines looks too different than the terrain even for a blind person to step on. So only with the AT and scouts, normally in a game of warrock, all you&apos;ll see is trucks and tanks driving all over the place and scouts hiding everywhere in the map. Sometimes even tanks would camp outside a base and nading everything they see that just spawned since it&apos;s almost impossible to hit a tank with a rocket launcher from a long distance. Overall, I wouldn&apos;t recommend this game unless you don&apos;t like playing with vehicles and only play small maps. But of course, if you really want to play that, CS, day of defeat, and many other games are way better choices than this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-rock/user-reviews?user_review_id=397944">Expand</a></span>

Me and a friend played this after playing CS:S for a couple of months. I suddenly started to see the difference between the two games. This didn&apos;t feel tactical at all, in fact, it felt a complete mess. The server lag is incredible, it&apos;s almost hard to play the game at all. On one occasion I ran straight past the enemy shooting them, but they couldn&apos;t see me and they wouldn&apos;t die. So I&apos;d carry on running and suddenly I&apos;d be dead. Then, all of a sudden, 20 seconds later, 2 of them would be dead with me getting the kills. This lag also accounts to many of the deaths and therefore fun being lost in this game. Grenades are, for some reason, sometimes invisible, meaning you can&apos;t move out of the way them. These grenades, even if they are quite a way away from you can kill you in a hit which gets quite annoying. This game also allows you to go prone, which is good in some circumstances but it does tend to slow the action down with people using it to spawn camp. I also found that when ever in a direct 1 on 1 battle, as people tend to spray their guns where ever they are, people just automatically go prone and before you know it you&apos;re shooting at thin air with the enemy on the floor shooting right next to you. Pretty realistic, I think you&apos;ll agree :) The rolling feature is also used a lot in this game. This is because when in a straight 1 on 1 you can sprint and roll into cover, or just roll to the side of the enemy and shoot them, which is incredibly unrealistic and what most War Rock players tend to do. There are many other little things such as the leasing of the guns, the sound, when you hit an enemy can be heard from anywhere in the battlefield, so you can hear whether you&apos;ve hit your enemy where ever you are. When on the bomb planting team, any one of the players on the team could plant the bomb, which is a far worse than the one on Counter Strike, which is far more tactical. The game modes, are in fact quite promising. Battle Group would be pretty fun, if it wasn&apos;t completely unplayable when there is more than 4 players. These and many other of these little things lead to the eventual downfall of this game. After playing this game on and off for about 2 weeks, I just couldn&apos;t help think it was a failed version of a mix between Counter Strike and Battlefield 2, which are far superior.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-rock/user-reviews?user_review_id=401129">Expand</a></span>

Weapons, Counterstrike owns war rock on that area, everybody knows why, graphix, WAR ROCK takes CS1.6 and CS CZ but do not manage to take on CS:&#xB4;S, they dont have a powerful engine like that. but this game is very good to play.

One part that all of these reviews missed was the hackers... and although the latest update has prevented most hacks, banned users (who may have been banned for no reason) created VIP hacksites specially devoted to hack the game.. now that is rediculous.. you know a game sucks when there are numerous sites that are being funded specifically to ruin the game. The sounds are meteocre; in fact, i replaced my sounds with my own voiceovers just to make it sound better. The stock set of sounds are just plain funny; it makes you wonder how they even made the sounds. The hacker reporting system is a good idea, however it only works when people genuinely report hackers and unfortunately, there are pre-pubescent (or they act like them anyway) &apos;kids&apos; that report people for having a good score. Bottom line, gameplay is frustrating and the idea that one has to pay for an advantage over another is just stupid. Sure, itl keep you entertained for a little while, but when you find out that itl take your whole life to get to the level where you can unlock &apos;the good weapons&apos;, ull just want to literally say &apos;farg&apos; this. Thankfully, the game censoring has changed the censors to asterisks (*). It perhaps was the worst part of the game and would anger people even more when they saw what they typed; in fact many would dodge the censors successfully just by adding in a bracket or two in the middle of the word, thus, proving that their attempt to censor words was compeltely useless. Getting back to the levels; supposedly when you reach level 100, everything is unlocked and you play for free; its too bad you will never reach it in your lifetime, and thats no exageration. Leveling up in the game isnt worth it, for you get a meager 2500 dinar per level. As you level up, it takes longer to reach the next level, but the amount of dinar you recieve for it never increases. Also, the ERSB rating shouldn&apos;t even be valid for this game because its always online and almost never is played as it should (with the ineffective filters and whatnot). From its start to now (almost 5 years), the game suffers from horrible server lag and a horrible in-game team collaboration effort, (rarely will you find teamates who are willing to help/support) not to mention a completely irrelevant story. On alberon, if you are part of the green team, the breifing says to find a crate marked GG - problem is, there is no crate marked GG, that is if you can even make it down to the derb side. In addition, instead of restricting certain weapons on maps, they remove vital components to the game. To eliminate usage of the barrett in close quarters, they removed prone from the game, as if to say people cannot go prone when in a close quarters battle. It is a horrible, half-ass decision on their part because they could have restricted its use another way. In addition, posting against their decision to do this on their official forums gets you banned. Not a good way to treat paying customers at all. The only good thing about this game, is perhaps the map design. It seems that the maps were thought out well and there are plenty of cover spots. The texture qualities however, ruin the map effect and make the game look like it was made for a commodore 64. (ok maybe not that bad... but lets say psp) The game is bugged with glitches and cheats and provides a player with an overall frustrating experience. If you&apos;re looking for real gameplay, stick to battlefield, CS (which i dont like much either), or consider transitioning to COD4. One review stated you get what you pay for, but in fact, you do not. You get less, much much less than what you pay for. The game is not fun unless you have gold premium, which is 15 a month. The worst part about their purchasing system is that you can only puchase twice in a given period - so you have to buy premium once and g1 credits and then wait like 3 weeks before you can purchase again. The fact they they make weapons available on the online store that are not available in game really kill the gamer experience as well. They also offer promo codes for unreleased weapons to premium auto-renewal customers.(it automatically charges your card every month) The unreleased weapons arent bugged or anything, they just do it to give people even a more unfair advantage. Don&apos;t even get me started with the stupid weapon leasing system. The initial concept wasnt a bad idea; to lease them, but when they tied it with real-world money, it crossed the &apos;fun-line&apos;. It really takes away from the experience, if there even is one. Addicts will pay more than the premium fee just to have their advantageous weapons. In addition, weapon stats will noticably drop when a new weapon is released so as to make the new weapon seem as if it is amazing. In addition, there are certain maps such as cantumira where the helicopters will drive you crazy. Some amazing pilots can dodge anything, and there truly is no defense against them. Sure every now and then someone will snipe them out with a barrett, but its very rare that people even have one, considering one has to pay online with real money to get it. The stingers are ineffective against a good pilot and its rediculously annoying when you can&apos;t even spawn without the helicopter raiding it. Experiences like these put this game down into the sewers. This game is entirely an economic scam - There are hackers that advertise hacksites and publicly (in-game chat) claim that hacking the game is more fun that playing the game itself. As a sidenote, you even have to pay just to change your crosshair! That is a standard feature in any game, but not in War Rock. I could write a novel on how bad this game truly is (if i haven&apos;t already), but I think you get the idea. In short, it is a quick-high economic scam that will rob your wallet of all of its money and give you half-ass fps quality, gameplay, absolutely no satisfaction, and no sense of progress; ironically, it costs much more than any other fps, and the game isn&apos;t even fully developed yet. They need to finish making the game before it is released commercially, or leave it permanently in beta stage because it will never be comparable to a real FPS. If you want a game where you&apos;re bound to get angry from unfair gameplay, horrible lag, for the most part an unfriendly community, possible random banning from punkbuster, and horrible customer support, play it; otherwise, leave this one in the bottom of the dumpster where it belongs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-rock/user-reviews?user_review_id=415741">Expand</a></span>

You need to pay to get some weapons, which may expire in some time! Is that a joke? Apart for this, this game would get a 3, because it&apos;s still bad: boring and very bad gameplay, as well as the multiplayer, graphics and sound. Also, MP is very closed.</span>

<br>Joined the lobby for a game and this was when I was beginning to hate it. You would join a game and you would either get kicked from it or the host would not start the round. I&apos;d heard about people hacking in this and was a bit worried, thought it would be just little kids whining about getting beat. How wrong was I! I&apos;ve been playing these types of games now since 2001 but when you see people getting headshots all the time you start to wonder. There was even a guy spamming the chat channel with a link to a hack site for this game. Even if you want to report them you have to have video evidence of them cheating otherwise they won&apos;t do anything about it.
<br>
<br>If I was you I would avoid it at all costs, not worth installing onto your system. You would be better paying a few quid extra and getting either Counterstrike: Source or Counterstrike: Global Offensive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/war-rock/user-reviews?user_review_id=3850599">Expand</a></span>
