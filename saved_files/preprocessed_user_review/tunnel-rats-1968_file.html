The graphics first of even on the highest settings are like a game from 2003. The voice acting is terrible. The game lags. I shot a man at point blank range with a full ak47 clip to the head and he didnt die. Then he stabbed, yes stabbed me to death... Hand to hand combat also is terrible and doesnt work. The traps are faulty. The grenades dont work. And its also highly priced and so not worth it... I mean &#xC2;&#xA3;16.99 thats about $18 I think. My advice to you is leave this game, dont buy it and dont look back!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tunnel-rats-1968/user-reviews?user_review_id=1359600">Expand</a></span>
