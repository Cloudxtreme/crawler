I couldn&apos;t be more wrong. This ancient &quot;strategy&quot; game makes it frustrating for one to control numbers of soldiers of any significant size, and it fails miserably at presenting ancient warfare in any realistic manner. Roman legions are given commands moving about in mobs and not in any orderly fashion whatsoever, representing barbarians more than any type of a civilized empire. Now I have the problem of trying to sell this title knowing that I wont get even a quarter of the price I paid for it. Boy, did I screw up! The game is a let down, but the cover looks cool!
