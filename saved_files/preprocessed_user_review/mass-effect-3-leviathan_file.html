<br>
<br>The animation of the key NPCs made them look like a 1970&apos;s Disney &quot;wax faced&quot; animatronic show. &#xA0;The overall graphics wasn&apos;t too bad and the game play was pretty good, and couple of times the facial animation was actually acceptable&#xA0;(the look of the indoctrinated was quit effective in making the hairs on the back of my neck stand up)&#xA0; Sadly though...
<br>
<br>That was about it.
<br>
<br>I am now about as disappointed as I can be with this disastrous game. &#xA0;A story isn&apos;t anything without a good ending--that can either be the monument for a great work of art...or the weakest link in a chain. Leviathan didn&apos;t make the game any better, it just sprayed a bit of Rustoleum&#xAE; on the link in question.
<br>
<br>Thanks, Bioware!

What did I think unbiasedly decent DLC but really just shows that the game was broken from the start. Origin is spyware and its up to the user if thats what they want on their P.C this is not my opinion its the opinion of everyone who has looked more closely at the Origin game launcher. Origin having the worst customer service score on the net again not my opinion google it. After Origin/Bioware blocked my access to a game I purchsed from them I got Paypal to get my money back from them which they did. So If you note Paypal rarely find for the customer against large companies yet they did in my case.

And since you basically can only make one choice (which by now we know is ultimately irrelevant anyway) I don&apos;t see much gain in playing it because watching it on YouTube offers the same entertainment experience.

A lot of the scenery was great, too. The cutscenes and the plot were the weaker points of this DLC. A lot of the cutscenes are sloppy. For example, there&apos;s a part where Shepard turns around and shoots a burst. Thing is, they only made the weapon firing for assault rifles, and my Shepard shot a burst with a sniper rifle. Aha. In another scene, one of my companion is shooting at an area where there are only 2 enemies, and they are attacking each other. The plot, while it seems fascinating, is riddled with plotholes, and contradicts the first Mass Effect several times. The DLC also doesn&apos;t interact with the ending as much as it should. I say if you can ignore the cutscenes&apos; fault and the plot&apos;s mistakes, it&apos;s quite enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-leviathan/user-reviews?user_review_id=2591310">Expand</a></span>

I was really hoping the underwater portion with the diving mech would make up for all that but no. Pretty cool concept with a shallow implementation. So I get o sit in a sub and walk around underwater in a predefined path, nothing special here. Basically it comes down to a shooter with maybe a sentence&apos;s worth of plot. It&apos;s clear where Casey Hudson and EA are going with this franchise. Regret purchasing it for my PC, certainly won&apos;t purchase for my PS3 as well (which I will do for really good games/DLC). Ciao EA/BioWare.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-leviathan/user-reviews?user_review_id=2688993">Expand</a></span>

Boy do I wish it was more than that.
<br>
<br>In my opinion, the entire Levi DLC is masterfully done, and I was on the edge of my seat for some of it. there are some reveals throughout that tie up loose ends from ME 1 and 2, like who was controlling the rachni etc... as far as value goes, its worth the 10 bucks. it even may have some replayability, who knows.
<br>
<br>What this DLC does wrong, is that it only reinforces to the hardcore fans of Mass Effect that the ending of ME3 was a half-baked disaster. The leviathans should have been the answer to the reapers, along with all the races that you united, not the obscure and left-field catalyst &amp; crucible bull****. It&apos;s heartbreaking when Bioware can make content that is beyond excellent, and yet at the same time defend the worst ending in gaming history. It&apos;s like Bioware has two heads... ;)  As a DLC itself, if you can put aside that it is yet another middle finger to anyone that dislikes ME3&apos;s ending, Leviathan of Dis is the best ME DLC since Lair of the Shadowbroker. aside from the part where you realize its just an increase in Gaylactic Readiness, everything else is well done, well polished, and fun to play. There were even a few times where I forgot I was Playing ME3, and thought It was a ME2 DLC. that in itself is a sign that something was done right.
<br>
<br>Overall, I Can&apos;t justify giving this DLC less than a perfect score. After all, I am rating the DLC, not the full game here. Its just too bad that paid reviewers are now talking about the ending in the review of this DLC, and rating this DLC on the ending of ME3. if they were worth their salt, they would re-rate the actual game itself instead based on the ending, instead of trashing a great DLC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-leviathan/user-reviews?user_review_id=2616694">Expand</a></span>

<br>To be honest, i was absolutely mind-blown and stunned when i saw that underwater scene with Leaviathan showing up.  (Their race is called Leviathan)
<br>Its amazing because i never expected the first race of the galaxy to be alive and be organic, but they are there deep in the ocean and they are hiding from their own synthetic creation that turned against them and its harvesting every civilization every 50.000 years.
<br>
<br>All in all this DLC is way beyond awesome and its well worth the money, they did a tremendous job with this.
<br>This is exactly the kind of content that i been looking for so long.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-leviathan/user-reviews?user_review_id=2590956">Expand</a></span>

It gives a tight, engrossing mystery of a plot to unravel through a mixture of typical ME3 shooter gameplay and some neat new game mechanics (think LA Noire in space), a few new guns and mods, and a lasting impact on the universe of ME3. The quality and effort put into the DLC is evident through small touches such as new unique dialogue and interaction with each squadmate/love interest (something I always thought was missing from previous DLC&apos;s) and in the level of detail put into each new environment you explore. The shooting and standard Reaper killing will feel overly familiar at times, but the focus of the DLC is the story and the new game mechanics it experiments with. And the story? Its a reeeeally good one and I won&apos;t spoil a moment of it because it needs to be played. Lets just say, it feels like the first step into something grander, while giving a ton of fascinating backstory to the Reapers.
<br>Which brings me to the elephant in the room; how the DLC affects the much maligned ending of the game, if at all. No, Leviathan is not a major reworking of the games ending as some fans are holding out for. Yes, it adds new layers and dephs to the Reapers and to the final decisions you make. And reportedly, this DLC results in new content and dialogue at the end of the game. If you are absolutely determined to not accept or try to understand Biowares ending to the ME universe and allow this to color your enjoyment of the series on a whole, this DLC will do nothing for you. If however you are interested in enriching and deepening your Mass Effect universe while enjoying some new in game missions along side your squadmates, Leviathan is a great piece of content for the price its at. Its implications, story wise, should not be ignored. And if you are losing faith in Bioware as a company of story tellers as I am, this DLC just may be the first step to them winning you back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-leviathan/user-reviews?user_review_id=2590101">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This DLC is not worth 10$ imo though, seeing that it raises just as many questions as it answers and is also rather short. The only interesting part of this DLC is the last 5 minutes anyway - The rest of the story in the DLC is just &quot;filling&quot; that is not very well written and as such does not even make much sense (the writers had trouble trying to write a path to Shepards destination). It would probably be better to wait until they finish all they DLCs and but them as a package at a reduced price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mass-effect-3-leviathan/user-reviews?user_review_id=2598595">Expand</a></span>

Contains a lot of back story and promises a lot but doesn&apos;t really deliver when it matters and doesn&apos;t feel like it has any real impact on the rest of the story once it&apos;s over  its own self contained story driven mission.</span>
