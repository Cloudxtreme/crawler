It&apos;s not that it&apos;s impossible, nor is it even complicated. Rating a game based on how complicated it is is just silly. If you can&apos;t understand it, it doesn&apos;t mean someone else can&apos;t. Chess is complicated for many people. That doesn&apos;t make it a bad game. No, what I mean by &quot;clarity of understanding&quot; is simply how well the game explains it&apos;s complications. For instance it&apos;s a bit tricky to navigate your way through certain menu options. At times it&apos;s a bit like shopping at Lowe&apos;s hardware. Certain items simply are not the aisles you would expect them to be in. The same seems true at times with X3: Reunion. I spotted a review from a user giving this game a zero (0) rating simply because the controls &quot;could not be reconfigured to invert the mouse X axis.&quot; I&apos;m sure Glen looked for that option, and probably didn&apos;t find it, but it does in fact exist in the game. The problem is the way the menus are broken down it&apos;s not under the heading most gamers would look for. For game play itself, the actual flow of the game and the abilities of the player to immerse themselves in the universe of X3, I&apos;d say the game is impeccable. During play there is a sense of really being there. And when reality becomes suspended I personally feel &quot;if only it could really happen!&quot; Now that is suspension of disbelief! Another downfall of this game, and it can be a major one, is the tricky messaging system. Some messages that one would feel are key are left out of the message log. Now, most players will complain about this, and even I find it annoying as I have been spoiled by games like &quot;Fallout 3&quot; and &quot;Oblivion&quot; as well as others that keep very detailed &quot;quest logs&quot; The thing is us old school gamers should know better! We should be keeping notes on important quest details! (I&apos;m 42 myself and I&apos;ve been gaming since ZORK was a baby!) In fact I think the designers did this intentionally. No, not to make some of us moan and whine. I think they did it to make us THINK. You remember when gaming took thinking if you&apos;re older than 25. If you&apos;re younger than 25, I apologize, but yes at one point we actually did have to think to play computer games. We had to take notes by hand on paper with pens in order to remember what important things NPCs had said, or what details we had read in some note or on a sign. Other than the fact that this game has some glitchiness with the quest system at times (for instance your quest targets simply not being there when you get there and n o explanation then or later as t to why!) it really is worth the money you pay to play it. Speaking of which, I see a review by a man claiming to have pirated this software to try it. You know, I&apos;m probably not the only member of law enforcement who reads these boards. Fortunately for you I&apos;m just a local patrolman. Finally, in parting, let me say this: Reviewing a game you haven&apos;t even done more than play an hour of is not really a fair rating. Please keep in mind that when you read individual&apos;s reviews. Many of the people who rated this game on this page simply got frustrated within a few minutes or hours because they couldn&apos;t understand the game. That is not reviewing. That is ranting. And while some of those rants may help people, at least try to be fair. Granted, it may save gamers with low tolerance for thinking from buying this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=739688">Expand</a></span>

It takes some getting used to, don&apos;t expect to learn it in a few hours - it takes most people a few weeks to learn, but if you stick with it, it affords an amazing experience of trading and fighting all in real time. It will certainly challenge most people if you want to trade properly as well as fight. People with low intelligence and or concentration will soon find that they cannot get past the first few hours, become frustrated and give up due to the complexity of the game initially, however, once you have spent some time learning the millions of controls, it becomes second nature and is the only game/simulation I have found which keeps people riveted for years. I know people who have been playing it for more than 2 years and are still thriving on it!

X3 is the only game I know which allows you to accumulate a fortune properly. It&apos;s hard work, very slow paced and at times VERY VERY BORING, but once you have enough money to buy that new Station or Destroyer, it&apos;s worth it. It can be more satisfying than any other game out there, but to get to it you have to dedicate hours of your life- weeks, even. The controls are appalling. I managed to get 10,000,000 credits on X2, through weeks of play. I had an armada of ships, but not nearly enough money for one of those 40,000,000 credit beasts. THIS IS A GOOD THING. I&apos;m fed up of games which become easy once you get the best the game has to offer. This game will reward you time and time again for your hard work. What was today&apos;s achievement was yesterday&apos;s aspirations. When I moved from X2 to X3, I was bewildered by everything again. It really feels like an entire world and it will take a good 6 or 7 hours to get accustomed to it. The graphics is amazing and the voice acting is terrible. The infamous Starforce protection system has been removed in the latest patch. It runs with out a disc, so there&apos;s no reason for you not to give it a go. You&apos;ll need a beast of a machine to play it on highest everything, but this isn&apos;t the sort of game where frame rates matter- most of the time you&apos;ll be staring at spreadsheets and figures. Please, give this game a chance. If you have the patience, you&apos;ll be rewarded. It makes a great deal of very little, but you won&apos;t care. You&apos;ll spend hours watching massive tankers drive past, then suddenly you&apos;ll have enough money to buy one of your own. You&apos;ll think about your next moves when you&apos;re not playing it, and whilst you are playing it, more and more possibilities open up to you- where do you explore next? Is there a lucrative profit to be made in a sector? This game is unlike any you&apos;ve ever played before. If somebody could merge this with Elder Scrolls Oblivion we&apos;d have the best game ever. There would be armies fighting in real time about the map, massive businesses opening up, and a 500,000,000 gold sword for sale. This game is an aquired taste. You won&apos;t enjoy it straight away. You&apos;re dropped in the deep end and you&apos;ll have to find a rock to save yourself. Once you learn the ways of the universe, you&apos;ll begin to appreciate it, and exploiting this game is the most satisfying thing of all. It&apos;s a shame that some people can&apos;t appreciate these elements, though I agree that it&apos;s a VERY time consuming game and that some people would rather have a quick online game on Face2 or De_dust2 . Although this is only single player, it feels very alive. Nothing is static in this universe and there are plenty of things to see and do.

The graphics are fantastic - worlds, ships and effects and it&apos;s not the system hog I was expecting and I&apos;m running at res. 1600x1050 (P4 3.4Ghz, 2 gigs RAM, Geforce 6800). The frame rate does drop for a split second when an enemy ship ship explodes (oh and strangely the cut scenes are a bit jerky) but other than that the frame rate is fine and frankly dropping the resolution would probably cure that. Dog fights are great fun using either the mouse or the joystick (I&apos;m using a joystick). Only downside is at the moment I still don&apos;t really know what the hell I doing in terms of trading etc (and a lot of buttons to memorize). It&apos;s a real nice change of pace from everything else I&apos;ve been playing, I do think this game is going to become extremely addictive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=384453">Expand</a></span>

Because the small ammount of Problems at the Moment (v 1.4.03) will be fixed and only the small ammount of battles InGame avoids a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=390227">Expand</a></span>

As others have noted, the game shipped originally as a Beta, choked with bugs, CTD&apos;s and missing content. Now however, thanks to Egosoft spewing out patches and addons, it has finally become the game it was meant to be. Update 2.0 will make it game of the year for me. Sorry Bethesda.</span>

Learning curve is astronomical, but once you understand the method to all the maddness, the controls ARE intuitive, gameplay IS immense, and you will realize how stupid those game reviews really are. It&apos;s like EVE Online, a rather unknown MMO, not for the dull witted or the un-educated player. This game requires basic economic understanding to &quot;build&quot; a profitable business in-game. Ship combat is somewhat frustrating at first, but when you build a fleet, it gets interesting (macro/micromanagment). The game is sporadically buggy, game saves sometimes do not save/load, and other random crashes to desktop, in addition, the hardware requirements are relatively high for best results. If you do buy this game, i suggest googling newbie&apos;s guides to X3, as there is a large community base for this game, it will ease the burden.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=390456">Expand</a></span>

A final note to the impetuous - if you are fickle enough to present criticism to a product because yo don&apos;t have the patience to do real research don&apos;t bother casting comment - this game is not meant for you as you lack imagination and creativity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=399957">Expand</a></span>

The only reason I do not give it a 10 is for the learning curve, if I had not known a friend who has gotten very far in the game, I would most likely not know as much as I do now, and it could have taken me days to understand.</span>

StarForce has NEVER crashed a game on me, I have never seen another person&apos;s game crash because of StarForce and StarForce offered $5000 to anyone who could prove otherwise. StarForce is the best protection on the market, and using it signifys quality. It is true that the game lacks the &apos;good&apos; tutorials from X2. I personally believe that the reason for this was people hated doing the repetitive slow, borring, &apos;how to move&apos; tutorials. This makes the game only &apos;slightly&apos; harder to play, but it is pretty standard. I am customizing my keys because some of the changes form X2 to X3 are just redundant or stupid (I found out how to do that in only 5 min on my own.) Although X2 and X3 ARE ill explained, there is a wonderful fourm community for both of them. Use it. I have a 1.8GHz Sempron and ATI 9600 Chipset with 512MB Ram. The game runs perfectly. I have since determined that people are trying to run the game with &apos;all it has&apos;. My old windows 98 computer can run HL2, so that doesn&apos;t make any difference, what does mater is that HL2&apos;s graphics is primarly its 512 textures, there are so many &apos;different&apos; graphical enhancments besides textures. Of course using programs to skip the load screen is probally why you didn&apos;t notice the &apos;graphics&apos; button. Also, Autopilot is primarly for long distance control or travel. You, are expected to fly the space ship (something I noticed in X2, you can get somewhere quicker by using human intuition then the autopilot.) And it is NOT the year 5000, it is a different time measurement. And yes, Egosoft really DOES need to reiterate the story a lot better, but the don&apos;t, so deal with it.) FInally, you are not a programmer so you have no clue how these engines work, Eve doesn&apos;t sync every ship, at most it is syncing 50. If they claim otherwise they are only transmitting little data. Either way, they &apos;syncing&apos; is so minor it doesn&apos;t even matter. Oh, and only idiots have 1600x1200 resolution on a size 1024x768 monitor. But the game does issue many &apos;sucky&apos; problems. Primarily, I noticed massive amounts of old &apos;stuff&apos; being used in this version of the game. Let alone the vids have a tendency to &apos;break&apos; (or show an flash of something &apos;else&apos;). The aiming system feels even harder to control, (those who never played X2 probally don&apos;t know where to aim) and while reprograming my controls, I broke most of the keys. I haven&apos;t &quot;progressed&quot; much into the game, primarly because I am fixing a few things, but I do notice how similar the game feels to X2. My primary reason for purchase was to break away from many of the X2 failures. X3 does not fix these, instead, it mearly adds massive visuals and appeal. If you want the visuals and customized key arrangments, go with X3. I, on the other hand, am prepared to stick with X2. There just isn&apos;t enough reason to play X3 except for the continuation of the story and the better graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=393044">Expand</a></span>

One could live with a bit more adrenaline, and a dedicated tutorial definitely needs to be implemented. Let&apos;s face it, many gamers don&apos;t bother to check websites or play previous games in a series; in addition, many casual gamers would be immediately frustrated upon attempting to learn the controls of X3. However, if one can get past the non-existent interface intro, and the (somewhat realistic in my opinion) fact that you won&apos;t be in combat most of the time, the game is worthy of at least grabbing the demo on. If you&apos;re a fan of both space sims and other open games such as Oblivion, this is definitely a game for you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=394029">Expand</a></span>

Beautiful and some time unbelievable graphics, nice music rapped up with average sound effects (especially for EAX owners) and a fair amount of lovely gameplay are what this game is all about. However, its premature release and very high requirements in personal life-time and system components surely effect this game very negativley. Having finished it however (the missions) my feelings were generally positive.

I hate games that cost you $50 and only gives you 6hrs of play. X3 has a learning curve that almost looks like a U-Turn, but it is well worth it. This game is not for the timid, and it WILL consume hours and hours of play. What do you expect? Technically, the game has no end unless you attempt to control each sector, which would require you to build an immense amount of resources. I can&apos;t understand how people can say it is boring. This game requires a HUGE amount of constant maintenance in order to build your empire. Looking for a good dogfight? Then start hunting down the bad guys. Still not a challenge? Then try to take over the sector occupied by 100+ pirates. Still bored? Try to take over the Xenon sectors which, in total, probably equals to over 200 ships. Still not interesting enough? Then give it a go in the Kha&apos;ak sectors who make the Xenon look like pretty pink bunnies. This game is jaw dropping.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=396353">Expand</a></span>

I really did love the idea of the game, and really wanted to like it, but I put it on the backburner as I didn&apos;t have the time to overcome all the frustrations. Now, a couple months ago I decided to boot it up again, and actually make a concerted effort at it. I can&apos;t believe how amazing this game truly is. I would definitely recommend heading to the egosoft forums and reading through the various &apos;newbie&apos; guides. This will make X3 life so much more enjoyable, as the documentation and &apos;tutorial&apos; is rather lacking. The game is a pandora&apos;s box inside a pandora&apos;s box of things you can do, none of which is even hinted at upon first glance. Don&apos;t be turned off by the rather steep learning curve, if the idea of this game sounds like fun to you, it&apos;s definitely worth it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=396363">Expand</a></span>

However, if you like to be carried along in a story or have waypoints lead you everywhere this game might be a little too deep for you. Performance wise I have not had a problem. If your computer can run games such as Doom 3, Half-Life 2, and Prey and full or good settings you shoudn&apos;t have any trouble at all. My friend however is having problems getting his Radeon graphics card and this game. The framerate is less than average and he has to run the game at 1024x768 for it to be playable. Suppose it&apos;s the universe&apos;s way of telling you all to buy NVidia.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=390063">Expand</a></span>

I think that the reason for the low score is that the game is so deep and most people just don&apos;t have enough time to get properly into it. However, once you start going there is just no stopping this game.</span>

Whoever has posted a low score on this game here is an impatient person, who can&apos;t sit down for a few hours, adn learn how to navigate the easy menus. Yes, they&apos;re cumbersome, yes, they&apos;re a-plenty, but they are very easy for at least an intelligent person like me to navigate. Patched to the latest version, bugs are nearly nonexistent, and quite contrary to the previous posters who need somebody holding their hand every step of the way, the freedom is quite refreshing. No doubt about it, this game is the KING of freeform. Also, for those who say it takes hours just to get somehwere, how about checking out how to turn on time acceleration (SETA)? The economy is very lively and realistic, revolving around an extremely well-simulated law of supply and demand. (Not simulated...AI traders actually trade products based on the law!) You can waste hours in this beautiful game (only part of which will draw you in being the entrancing New Age soundtrack), and if you&apos;re a learner and are successful, combat will come quick and often, the money will come floating in, and every ship in the universe, from light fighter, to corvette, to destroyer, will be yours to command. A unique game, indeed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=395337">Expand</a></span>

Unfortuntly, X3 Reunion does have faults, it does have a few negative points, but, the positives outweight the faults, and that in my opinion, earns this game a healthy 9... It is a complex game, and you need patience, intelligence and the ability to adapt to the games very in-dept interface which at sometimes, can be frustrating. What makes X3 great, is the fact that your placed inside a universe that revolves around you. Not only is this universe stunning in fantastic detail, but your left to your own devices to make your own destiny. Whether it be a commercial empire or militant empire bent on destruction, or maybe, a-bit of both? Some would say that this is an illusion, that the universe doesn&apos;t revolve around you, its just all cleverly scripted... thats a blatant lie. I&apos;ve had many moments in X3 that made me go &quot;wow&quot;, one such moment involved an asteroid being blown to bits due to a fight, that had nothing to do with me, and said asteroid crashing into my station and well... causing alot of financial damage, ehem... But that wasn&apos;t scripted. This wasn&apos;t part of the plot, it was random, it just happened, and a little mis-fire ended up causing me some credits and I felt good about it! Thats why X3 is one of those games that you have to look beyond the clumsy interface thats before you. X3 has alot of gameplay in it, and for those who are patient, plenty of replay value. To get the most out of X3 though, a MOD is required. And quite possibly the best mod that you can get right now, for X3 Reunion, is Xtended. A mod that not only adds tons of stuff to your game, but adds valuable features too it that makes you think how you could ever play it without such a feature. If you love space games, if you want a good space simulator thats not too easy, and not too hard, then get X3 Reunion, and go for the mods once you do the story! If you want an easy game to get into, without much hassle, then X3 might not be for you, perhaps a more simple game...

Yes, the game really did not play at all... for anyone, out of box. The game needed almost a full month before it was stable enough to be called playable and by then the reviewers had already skewered this game in the reviews and rightly so. Even I am deducting 1 point from this, otherwise stellar game, due to the poor condition it was in at release. It was unacceptable.
<br>
<br>On to the game in its current condition.
<br>
<br>The Good:
<br>
<br>- Huge Open World
<br>- Excellent Economic Simulation for a Video Game
<br>- There are tons of ships... so many I cant keep count
<br>- Ships have different designs and usages
<br>- You can fly all the ships!
<br>- Tons of awesome mods! Many are professional quality.
<br>
<br>- You can play how you want to play. Kill an alien race that annoys you. Build an economic empire with factories, freighters and trade routes. Invade enemy sectors. Be a pirate. Capture ships. There is tons to do.
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>
<br>- Blatant copy of X2 with very few to no meaningful upgrades except to graphics
<br>- Quests are too few and very repetitive
<br>- The main plot remains buggy to this day
<br>- Plot remains poor with little to no attention given to it
<br>- AI is not good in combat and needs serious modding help
<br>- Learning curve is steep and tutorials are non-existent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=4876710">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve been playing it since the release, and didn&apos;t get bored of it. Those who gave it low scores simply don&apos;t realise that this isn&apos;t a game where you push &quot;Start&quot; and suddenly you&apos;re the &quot;supreme ruler of the universe who is best in everything&quot;. This is not an FPS where opponents die after one shot but you survive everything. X3 takes time to get into, thanks to the huge universe, the variety, the freedom etc etc. Storytelling is a &quot;bit&quot; clumsy, but you don&apos;t have to follow it. I have high expectations for games and X3 jumped over it and flew straight to the stars. This is not Elite or Privateer, nor EVE; this is X. Comparing it to other titles is useless, and comparing it to EVE is stupidity at its highest..Egosoft was always friendly eversince I registered there 5 years ago, and always helped me (unlike other developers who say &quot;I&apos;ll get on in ASAP&quot; and never respond. So, if you don&apos;t want a GOOD, but the BEST space game, then I recommend Reunion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=745026">Expand</a></span>

Economy makes no sense..buy from chock full factories at very low price, go to sector where factory is stopped because they don&apos;t have the commodity you have bought - go to sell it to them and make a loss !!!! Where&apos;s the supply/demand structure in that ??? Graphics STUNNING , don&apos;t care what people say, messes all over Eve (BIG time) BUT Get into a battle and frame rate (on my 2 week old rig) drops to 4 or 5 (yes tried every trick in the book to get it working - options / Mobo / Rivatuner / Tweaks / &quot;unnoficial&quot; patches to lower pedestrian traffic etc - still need Deep Blue to get the flipping thing shifting.

After playing, or trying to play, for several days on end, I&apos;ve pretty much given up on it. Instead of writing pages upon pages going into minute details on how I feel about it, I&apos;ll summarize it with a quick Pros/Cons list: Pros: Decent/good graphics, inexpensive (I purchased it for $19.95 via Steam), X-Universe seems large and like it would take a lot of time to explore it all. Cons: Stability (even with the latest drivers, clean system, and every other game I owe working fine, this game just wouldn&apos;t stay running longer than an hour or so. Crashes weren&apos;t consistent, sometimes minutes into a game, sometimes an hour, sometimes when docked, sometimes when engaging a hostile. But, one thing was for certain, they are a game-killing element.), boring (the possibilities for open-ended gameplay seemed great, but I actually found myself bored many times, just trying to find work and/or hostiles to engage; when I did rarely run into hostiles, they were almost always equipped much better than my ship, and quickly out-gunned me. The large systems which at first seemed promising, instead ended up being a chore to traverse, taking what seemed like forever), controls (the interface is much more complicated than say Freelancer... at first this seemed useful since honestly, Freelancer is somewhat lacking on depth of interface/controls, but ended up being too complicated... too many keys to remember), camera/view (again, perhaps swayed by my previous experience with Freelancer and other Space Sims, really was looking for a &quot;dynamic&quot; third-person view of my ship... can switch to external view, and manually rotate the camera POV via the number pad, but a &quot;turret view&quot; where the mouse would freely rotate the camera would be much more appreciated.), cheesy voice acting. Overall, the stability problems I encountered (and couldn&apos;t resolve), along with the over-complication of some game elements, and lack of more practical features, ended up making this a disappointing purchase. Its sad that there just doesn&apos;t seem to be a truly modern Elite/Privateer Space Sim that delivers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=409865">Expand</a></span>

How about reading a lot of murky science-fiction-based manuals and procedure lists?  If so, X3 is the game for you.  If you don&apos;t like to read, you&apos;re going to get frustrated in a hurry with X3.  The learning curve is steep, thanks to a convoluted user interface in the game, but also thanks to the X-Universe, which is largely persistent from the games of which X3 is the sequel.  The X-Universe is more or less a compilation of every sci-fi cliche since Star Wars, but re-written so that most of the important nouns have made-up words, like cahoona and mazura.  Trying to figure out the economy of the game, where you are trying to figure out if a SQUASH mine factory needs energy cells can be frustrating, unless you do your reading.  There&apos;s a manual that comes with the game, and a revised manual that was published on-line, and you&apos;ll need to read both.  Then, there&apos;s the patches for the game, which do help a lot, but which also require some research to apply.  
<br>The complete saving grace of X3 is the on-line forum at Egosoft, where many friendly people are willing to answer all sorts of questions on X3 gameplay, and some of them are talented modders who make X3 gameplay a more enjoyable experience.  But, be prepared to spend more time reading than playing if you join that forum. 
<br>
Lastly, there&apos;s even an X-universe novel, translated from German of the &quot;Leelee heaved her three alien bosoms inside her space-bodice, thinking deeply that she needed revenge for the death of her father at the hands of the Evil Overlord&quot; variety (note that this isn&apos;t an actual bit from the book text, but to me, it seems to be a lot along those lines), which could be read to gain more backstory on the X3 game.
<br>
<br>As it goes, X3, like many games these days, has way more backstory than actual plot.  There is a plot in the game, but it&apos;s as loose as the elastic on your grandfather&apos;s underwear, and the character acting and models that propel said plot are about as amateur as any you can find outside of an elementary school.  Good thing that you can abandon the plot at will, and that the spaceship and space effects are really nicely done.  
<br>X3 is woth picking up for cheap (if you can even find it on the game store shelves), provided you have the patience to do your reasearch and your patching -- the patches are as large as the Egosoft patch server is slow.  In some ways, it&apos;s more of a challenge -- and a thrill -- to get X3 up and running on your computer than it is to actually play the game, but once you get it going, there&apos;s many things you can try out in the game.  It&apos;s as open-ended as a video game can get where you are the only person in the whole galaxy with free will.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=57775">Expand</a></span>

Bad points: Cookie cutter design! So the ships and objects in the universe look great, but sadly, after the first 10 hours of play everything in the universe starts looking the same, all the gates are all in the same condition and look perfect and new, evern though they&apos;re supposed to be &quot;made by the ancients&quot; This game fails visually. period. Terrible Introduction Path: As someone who had only played X1 ages ago, and skipped X2, I had forgotten all about the details of this universe, so with the sparse details on backstory behind the game it was hard to become immersed in the world. In fact, I wasn&apos;t. I was too busy learning the controls, looking for explanations of what kind of ship is which, and why 95% of all the purchasable content in the game was not available to me. I learn a few new games every week, so after I downloaded a user tutorial (yes, there is no tutorial in the game of any value), I was up and running and working through the interface after a couple hours. Cudos to the community for putting out content that made the game playable to a new user, sadly, Egosoft fails here too, miserably. Learn 2 tutorial egosoft... Interface: The method of control in this game past the basic first person combat is absolutely unrefined and pathetic. Sure, you have many options, you can control fleets of ships with great accuraccy, trade from afar, while you&apos;re off fighting pirates, BUT, I found that some very basic commands took up to 9 screen selections to complete. Example- [sending a wingman to protect my ship]: Hit [ENTER]/Personal/Property/[Select from ship list, may be pages long]/Command Console/Combat/Protect Me And voila! One of your ships will try and protect you! If I actually had to command wingmen and the like in a hurry, I&apos;d be in huge trouble. This interface does not need to be streamlined, it has to be torn down and replaced with a much better one. I&apos;d be happy to design one for you Egosoft, just send me an offer with a solid advance, and I&apos;ll get started. AI: The enemy artificial intelligence is predictable and at no time did I find myself trying to out-think the computer. Many good games get away with this, so I&apos;ll let Egosoft off the hook here even though they could have done better. The part that really irritates me about the AI what it does with your allied ships, ramming them into space stations, asteriods, the sides of jumpgates, or anything else they can find. I know a lot of work probably went into the mildly retarded AI that is in this game, but they should have kept working. With dual processor systems, and the average gaming system including 2gb of ram or higher, there&apos;s plenty of headroom for the computer to start crunching real math. Plot: Terrible. After the first 10 missions I still didn&apos;t care about any of the characters, didn&apos;t know why my character was involved with any of these people, and if there was something I&apos;m missing from X2 (like this plotline continuing, etc), there was no way for me to find out what that might be. Utter failure here, I&apos;d be happy to write a branching structured plotline for the right price, I&apos;d just call it my ninth novel. Cutscenes: Pathetic. I personally know animators who have done better over a long weekend. Voice acting was terrible too, and the lack of music through cinematics left them hollow and bland. Couldn&apos;t wait for them to be over. Backstory: I seriously don&apos;t know all that much about it, and after 50 hours of play I should. Egosoft fails here too, there should be more information presented in-game to the player, I shouldn&apos;t have to visit their forums, play through more of their terrible plotline, or read franchise novels that I expect even less from to learn more about it. Oh, and the gate system being built by &quot;Ancients&quot; is some thing that has already been done right several times, Egosoft is once again proving plotline and backstory ineptitude by leaning on this very old fallback. A Galaxy of Little Boxes: Seriously, this is just lazy. I understand that space is so big that it would have to be divided into sectors, and a faster than light travel system has to be implimented into a space flight/combat/trading game, but the poposition that the only method of travel between any inhabited area in space will always and forever involve a jumpgate, and that each area fits fairly neatly into a little box on a very large sector map is so unbelievable and limiting (vissually as well as conceptually) that it was one of the major turn offs in the game. No Conquest Zone: So, it&apos;s a trading/building/space flight/combat sim with great big destroyers, carriers and bases but I can&apos;t take over a few sectors and call them my very own Deadly and Profitable Private Territory? The fact that I can&apos;t plant a flag somewhere, or capture a base, but I can be hated by every race out there if I want to be may work into the backstory, but it is a major detraction point to the entire game. Domination would be fun, and I&apos;d love to stand up and say; &quot;I am the supreme ruler of the entire galaxy!&quot; Nerds like me love subjugating digital people, it&apos;s almost as good as the joy we see in the eyes of a hot neighbor accross the way after we&apos;ve fixed their computer or cellular phone. Almost. They could have done better: It feels to me that they grew X2, and forgot that someone, somewhere would buy just X3, and may now virtually nothing about their little franchise. I&apos;m not a fan of the X1/X2 series since I didn&apos;t know anything about it, didn&apos;t have anything against it either, until I bought X3. The incredible number of sectors is nearly meaningless, since the travel is boring (even with jumpdrives), &quot;scenery&quot; is cookie cutter, the layout and conceptualization of travel as well as the depth of design is lazy. What they did design looks great, but it&apos;s stretched waaay too thin over way too much playtime/play area. Menu systems are clear, but there isn&apos;t a software designer in industry and few in gaming or information technologies that would actually sit back and be proud of a selection and function system that makes you go through more than 5 screens / selections to do anything simple, X3 forces you through over 10 at times, and on average 7-9 for simple functions. I brought the box, DVD and manual to a used game shop and got $10.00 credit for it because he already had 11 copies sitting on the shelf. I also handed him a DVD with the latest Xtended, and he thanked me profusely since it might help him get rid of a few copies of X3. Egosoft has the makings of a great game here, but dropped the ball. Try harder, if you want help from someone who can 1) write a good plot 2) provide you with the actors you need and 3) design a concept for an interface that works, drop me an email, but it won&apos;t be free. I don&apos;t like the game enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=406923">Expand</a></span>

I started reading the manual, which was pretty annoying too because half the stuff they mention in it seems to be written for people who have played previous versions of this game, and not for newbies to the series. So I started playing anyways. The graphics are pretty nice, and the amount of customization really excited me at first, but... wow, it got soooo boring. I would never call this game fun. Maybe if I eventually learn to play it, it could turn into a nice experience, but never into a fun game. I stopped playing after I tried to make one of my ships land on the same station my main ship was in, but suddenly it blew up to pieces. I mean, wtf? I guess the best thing about this game is that it makes 15 year olds feel smarter for having the patience to play this, hehe, no offence. Anyways, I&apos;ll try this game again someday (when they fire me from work and I have more time in my hands) but for the meanwhile, I&apos;m gonna play fallout 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=420779">Expand</a></span>

I was calculating the speed - 10 km in 1 Minute. Thats 600 km / h. EVERY Fighter Plane on earth is faster than that. A Space Shuttle has to fly 30 000 km/h to stay in Orbit.....whatever.

Good developers finish their games before release. Good publishers let their developers finish their games before their release. And they also trust their customers by NOT putting programs like Starforce to crash the hell out of people&apos;s computers on it. It was like I was opening a jewelry box that was supposed to contain a diamond ring and instead got a fat piece of sh%t with FU written in it. Don&apos;t buy this game unless you get it from Steam.

The interface is too cumbersome and not intuitive at all (double-click buttons?? who invented that?). Labels look like expandable containers, scrollbars are hard to see. It doesn&apos;t allow you to save the game in space (you know it would be very easy if they would have done that!). But regardless the game crashes so often so you become a regular of the last station you docked. Very bad design decision. I don&apos;t want you to give me 10 save slots just don&apos;t forget where I was last time that would be enough. The gfx is relatively slower compared to EVE Online (which is an online game and shares it&apos;s CPU time with network handling and synchronizing with 17776 players online at the moment). Navigation and commanding interfaces are too complicated if not everything in the game. You have to memorize many keyboard shortcuts and the fact that some of the rectangular objects on the monitors can be &quot;menus&quot; actually. There is a tutorial which says &quot;you&apos;ll receive rest of the tutorial in messages&quot; but it doesn&apos;t tell you how to read them so you need to explore your screen until you figure out a 8x8 icon in your 1600x1200 resolution. It&apos;s year 5000 but still every ship needs to explore the universe once again from scratch. Just plain stupid. That same high technology invented an autopilot which doesn&apos;t recognize an asteroid before almost hitting it and makes 90 degree uncomfortable turns for ship&apos;s passengers. The game starts with a simple patrol mission around your home planet but accompanied with a &quot;Victory March&quot; soundtrack? What the hell dude, we just started the game, relax. Intermission screens are simple flash-like animations with embedded Robot Chicken quality 3d characters. Disoriented gate jump effects, lousy station dock interfaces (and design), almost everything makes playing this game a painful experience. On the bright side, atmosphere moves separately than the planet itself. But planets are only props, you can&apos;t land on them, you can&apos;t interact with them. So even that is not a plus I think. Fortunately there is a time acceleration feature to shorten the earth minutes you spend on this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=392032">Expand</a></span>

But honestly every time I went by the game shop, I stared at the box, and finally gave in. I knew X2 was a hit, so figured this would at least follow in it&apos;s footsteps. Wow. I have a machine with specs high enough to play Half-Life 2. Battlefield 2. TES: Oblivion. All at decent framerates (at least 30+ FPS in Oblivion), with alot of pretty eye candy. Fire this up and... What a joke. This has got to be the crappiest smell I&apos;ve had in my nose for years. The instruction manual was amazingly... Misinformative. Tons of typos and bad grammar. Some items were listed twice (Page 11, ). X3 has so much going for it... But it just falls short. Because of laziness. And greed. Oh, don&apos;t even get me started on the fact it uses StarForce protection. That simple fact right there shows that Egosoft just wanted money. The story is like one of the worst B movies I&apos;ve seen. Good idea, badly put together. Then of course the fact that there is no way to really change any options. The in-game video changes system codecs... Which teed me off. If I try to play X3, then exit and go to play Battlefield 2, without restarting... It forces the game to run in 16bit color, and all the background movies cease to exist. Why should we have to shut down explorer to play a game? I mean, on some systems, that don&apos;t meet minimum specs, I can see this helping greatly. But for a system that *EXCEEDS* specs?! C&apos;mon. I have to spend 3 minutes shutting stuff down, and running a few tweaks (I revery these every time, only reason I have to do them again) just to get mediocre performance from a game. Because they force us to play with bumpmapping on everything, without the option to turn it off. Pure and simple- this is crap. I&apos;m holding onto it though, just in hopes that it won&apos;t be abandoned, and future patches will further improve performance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=390103">Expand</a></span>

On release in UK it is still the brilliant game idea X BTF was, it has fantastic graphics..so that&apos;s really good yes ?? Well......? Firstly, it&apos;s not really much more than any of the previous games, a lot of the features are not (yet) present. (Mobile Mining - User Bases etc etc) and the graphics while very nice, make even reasonably good systems splutter. People with 3.5Ghz processors and 256Mbyte cards are getting very poor frame rates after what is, after all, a game set predominantly in space... I mean what is there is very well done, but theres a lot of black empty space in the mix as well. When it&apos;s released int he states it will have the 1.2 (and maybe 1.3) patch included. Without them the game doesn&apos;t really play at all (Patch was released on game release day in the UK) Egosoft blame it on publisher pressure for release date, as the end customer that should all be completely transparent to me. I couldn&apos;t give two hoots what a publisher wants, I have paid for a working game with the features as advertised. This is not what I get. Like the X2 USA release in 2003, Egosoft will fix all/most of these issues in time. and this may well be the game of the year. I love X games, and haver a lot of respect for Egosoft, just release games that are finished please lads, not ones that need a patch on release day just to get more than 10 mins play before COTD.

Funnily enough ran on my laptop (Pentium IV 3.6 Ghz but just a Mobility Radeon 9700 with 256Mbyte video ram) reasonably well. Wanted nothing to do with any of my other systems, I have 4 systems above minimum spec for this game and perhaps 30 computers or bits of computers in all. The laptop was the only one that produced playable framerates (FRAPS average 27 at minimum settings). My AMD 3700+ with 2x 6800 GT (SLI) was so poor even the menu stuttered all over the place. And before some smart pants says - Yes ,.. I know about keeping DX up to date Can easily handle CODEC management Can flip around a BIOS and understand every setting, Use current patches Can install graphics drivers without leaving old DLL&apos;s everywhere. Can disable features with Coolbits/ATI Tweak Knows how to turn off other services to preserve CPU time etc etc etc So PLEASE don&apos;t just suggest these (or the 101 other things I&apos;ve tried) It&apos;s the game - not me Having said that some people have no issues with this game. MANY knowledgeable / experienced / computer users simply can&apos;t get the game to function at all. Try the new rolling demo before you buy to see what camp your in! Because the game seems worth it if it works.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=385350">Expand</a></span>

My pc is not shabby to say the least and yet it practically crawls through sections. The storyline is not worth doing- I could not hear half of the dialogue and it looked ameteurish. I think i could do better with a few flash cartoons. Worst is the in game functions. the autopilot turns itself off at random times, meaning you crash into objects ad-nauseum and the computer cannot be trusted to control your assets. I have watched a Centaur I paid 10,000,000 credits for simply fly itself into an asteroid repeatedly until it was nothing but space debris. some weapons are good but once the frame rate drops they become useless. They are lucky the graphics are so fantastic, because you get the chance to study each frame very carefully once someone fires a psg (one of the area effect weapons). In summary, if they were rushing this one out for christmas, it would be the gift Santa would give the bad kids.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x3-reunion/user-reviews?user_review_id=386156">Expand</a></span>
