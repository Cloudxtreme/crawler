<br>
<br>You can jump straight into any car you want and if you want to start racing in Formula 1 you can do that... all races, championships and cars are unlocked.... and like I said there are no upgrades (but lots of settings of course). The game also focuses quite heavily on racing cars, there are very few to no normal cars. It&apos;s pretty much all racing specials and historic racing cars. I don&apos;t know... the whole experience feels kind of cheap to be honest... I took the McLaren P1 for a spin and then it&apos;s like... now what do I do? I already have the best &quot;real world car&quot; in the game, I can&apos;t customize it and I&apos;m not really that into racing lap after lap just for the sake of racing.
<br>
<br>Some people (simulator fans) may like this game, the graphics and gameplay are very good. But for me as a car enthusiast coming from Gran Turismo it&apos;s just not what I was expecting. I was hoping this would be like Gran Turismo for the PC but it&apos;s not that kind of game. I really wanted to start from the bottom and work my way up and build and customize my garage along the way but the game isn&apos;t designed for that. Maybe in the future they can build the game that I was hoping this would be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5236624">Expand</a></span>

<br>I think only young people excited graphics so highly appreciate this product. I read the reviews on various websites and I laughed because unfortunately most do not know what he writes. Confuse basic knowledge about running cars. Tests do not include pads steering settings, etc .. all thrown into one container.
<br>
<br>Crudely made production of strange and artificial rules and limitations. Full collision of objects errors, bad control and artificially multiple options.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5237677">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Control is not very good on a gamepad, these are the same developers who made the Shift games, which also had problems on controllers and they haven&apos;t learned anything from all the many complaints from gamepad users in those games.
<br>
<br>When in a race, you can&apos;t quit via the controller, you have to use the mouse to click an X in the top right corner. Same in the main menu to quit the game.  The menus overall are unattractive, messy and complex.
<br>
<br>Very little content, few cars, everything is unlocked from the beginning, single player career is bland and pointless, no feeling of progression or achievement.  No Steam cloud support.
<br>
<br>I feel that this game has been massively overhyped and I would go so far as to say misrepresented by the developers and its &apos;early access&apos; supporters.  Buyer beware.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5236263">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>No matter how many tweaks I&apos;ve applied from various sources it&apos;s not possible to get it right. You feel disconnected from the road surface, FFB is inconsistent. You hit a car and nothing, you go over a kerb and it&apos;s like an earthquake. Their is no discernible corning feedback, the game physics feel incomplete and it spoils the game. But besides this, vehicles seem ever so slightly disembodied from the road surface. Sort of hard to describe and you do get used to it, very noticeable when you play other racing sims and compare.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m loathed to give this game a bad review as it has so much going for it in all other aspects, but it&apos;s massively flawed as a simulation. Cars do behave differently as you should expect, but driving just doesn&apos;t feel authentic and I don&apos;t even mean it&apos;s arcade-like, you just need to see for yourself and you&apos;ll understand.
<br>
<br>If you have a chance to try Assetto Corsa and compare the same car and track then it becomes very clear. Assetto Corsa have nailed the physics, but Project Cars crucially has not. I&apos;m using Assetto Corsa as a comparison, but even driving sims from years back are superior to Project Cars in this respect.
<br>
<br>The professional reviews are all skewed as they all rushed their editorial to hit the day of release, fell for the shiny graphics and failed to really get a feel for the game. If SimBin manage to fix these flaws then it will be the awesome game it&apos;s meant to be. Until then be warned, below the beauty lies some major gameplay flaws.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5339288">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So the Game is released now just 1 Example
<br>
<br>Assetto Corsa : release Date December 2014 ... 68 Pages of &quot;Wheel Trouble&quot; Postings @their Forums
<br>Project Bugs : released last month already created 72 Pages of &quot;Wheel Trouble&quot; Postings @their Forums
<br>
<br>Project Bugs : Made by 80.000 People (thats how they advertise that)
<br>Assetto Corsa : Made by 8 People
<br>
<br>After asking the Devs why they did not work together with the community who really want to improve their game i got a Ban @Steam Forums (and they posted a picture of an &quot;professional&quot; race driver ((Rene Rast)) who plays &quot;Project Cars&quot; while actually holding a Gamepad :D) i asked how good the FFB feels for him on the Gamepad (think that was enough for the Devs xD) and i dont want to Bash Gamepad Users, but this just showed me how much the Devs really understand in Sim-Racing. Nothing
<br>
<br>+ The fact they say AMD did not Work together with them and thats why AMD PC&#xB4;s have not so good Perfomance, for me this is a Scam to the Gaming community ... PS4 Xbox One ... all AMD Part&#xB4;s?
<br>
<br>The Lack of Perfomance is not AMD&#xB4;s fault, thats lazy developers who just want to make a quick buck. I Read sometimes over AMD Users &quot;U got what u pay for&quot; ... for me its a shame that people spending more money on their GPU just to have more unoptimizied Games, and then bashing other people who will not spend that much money on their hardware just because developers decide to go the Money way :)
<br>
<br>Just Watch Crysis 3 Benchmarks ... it should not matter if its AMD/Intel ATI/Nvidia ... Crysis 3 is an Perfect example to see how good Games would work if Developers doing right
<br>
<br>For me Project Cars is the biggest &quot;Scam&quot; in 2015 :)

AMD users shouldn&apos;t be penalized for something like this. You say that nvidia isn&apos;t sponsoring you sure.... but you sure as hell being biased for nvidia. It&apos;s one thing delaying this game 3 times before the release date... but you have to destroy the amd users for poor optimization. Disappointed for this... I was really excited before this game came out. But all that excitement was worth for nothing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5338897">Expand</a></span>

There are a lot of cars to choose and a great variety of tracks but the main aspect of the game, the driving, is utter ****.
<br>
<br>Also, the force feedback is crap.</span>

And they really do a disservice by being way too excited. The game is not great, but it&apos;s not bad either.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t trust those saying the game have the best FFB ever, it&apos;s flat out a lie. I was a junior member, played the game for over 3 years (give it or take it) and I know it very well. FFB is one the worst out of the box and to this day I still haven&apos;t found the right setup with my Logitech wheel. The game is riddled with annoying, show stopper bugs. The graphics aren&apos;t great - except for lightning and weather - and they are really badly optimized. Steer clear if you own an AMD and are not sure if it&apos;ll run the game ok. Worst yet about the graphics, it looks weird. Some cars are well done, but most others just off proportions and strange to look at. Rain effects on the windshield is cartoonish at the best.
<br>
<br>The physics... it&apos;s another mixed bag. Some cars are fun to drive (Escort MK1, for example, quite a joy) but most others have an unfinished feel (Mercedes DTM, some of the worst physics I&apos;ve seen in a game calling itself a sim). Nonetheless, can be enjoyable if there&apos;s no show stopper bugs while driving. But it&apos;s by far not the revolution most fanboys say it is. Not at all. It&apos;s a passable racing game, like a NFS Shift with a little more feel. Nothing special.
<br>
<br>The worst technical offender is probably the sound though. The worst sound I&apos;ve ever heard from a racing game. It&apos;s loud, almost deafening loud on the engine. Every car sounds like their engine is straining so hard, like it&apos;s about to blow. Awful. And everything else sounds canned or is inaudible (windshield wipers are almost silent, for example).
<br>
<br>Yet, we are not on the worst part: the community. They are mostly zealots, probably backers or just stupid, bashing anyone who doesn&apos;t profess his love and faith for the game, SMS and Ian Bell. Beware if you are buying this game for multiplayer.
<br>
<br>After all this, would I recommend this game? Yes if it&apos;s on sale. With a generous discount on the price tag it&apos;s well worth it. It&apos;s an average game with some good moments every now and then. There are much better options around to justify going for this one on full or next to full price: Assetto Corsa, rFactor 2 and - heck - even console stuff like Gran Turismo and Forza series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5319501">Expand</a></span>

But the extremely biased engine, which cripples any AMD users on purpose is a BIG minus. This is not acceptable. The PC was always a platform standing for equality and freedom for everybody and developers crushing these principles should get punished for it.</span>

Hope it succeds in its wild ambition. Physics are accurate as can be and you can cut all driving helps until it is a real challenge (real as in reality). At this point you will need a wheel - at least I can&apos;t race without helps with a controller, this is no Forza with hidden steering helps (I played a lot of Forza 2 and 3). At least you can chose how you play regarding hand holding (which newcomers WILL need). The same can be said about a myriad of other aspects. This is a game to invest time learning, even for simcade veteran racers, I don&apos;t really advise buying it for casual racers. who just want to have a occasional race once in a while.  But I highly recomend it for those who want to go into sim racing even for the first time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5244814">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re unsure try before buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5236480">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What I don&apos;t like is firstly there aren&apos;t a lot of cars. The cars that are there are great, but I&apos;m missing a lot of cars Toyota&apos;s Ferrari&apos;s corvettes. And I have a problem with the AI under normal conditions I have an easy time getting past the AI but when it starts to rain the AI doesn&apos;t slow down where I do. The AI isn&apos;t using the same physics as you have which is distracting you can&apos;t always take the same line through a corner. These are some minor gripes to an otherwise great game that I&apos;m going to play for years</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5238616">Expand</a></span>

This is the racing game of a lifetime. All other racing sims before this were merely tech demos. Project CARS was built from the ground up to help all steering wheel owners ascend into something greater than mere mortality of the human flesh. Upon thrusting the throttle you will soon realize that you are now under a mental state known as robust intelleterpreted confusion. This confusion is caused by a skepticism of reality vs. the virtual. Some call this phenomena &#x201C;virtual reality,&#x201D; but don&#x2019;t be fooled; this IS a video game, but a video game has never been something like THIS before. Before clicking on the .exe of this game, I would recommend taking out your diary, and getting a good look at your surroundings, because your life will never be the same. If you commute to work every day by car, be prepared to be underwhelmed by the lack of simulated immersion that your car has always given you (I swear my Nissan just doesn&#x2019;t corner the way it should). Have your tissues ready at hand; because you will be going through every emotion that your heart can handle, from belligerent joy, to incessant sadness, to rock hard frustration, and even drunken horniness (don&#x2019;t forget about those tissues). If you haven&#x2019;t already bought this game, I demand you punish yourself by buying this game twice, and giving the second copy to a loved one. If you HAVE bought this game, then let god have mercy on your soul, for you are no longer a mortal man. See you on the racetrack, you god among men.

<br>
<br>Some of the cars are truly magical, like the Ford Capri or BAC Mono. Sure, more cars would be lovely, but most important is that there are so many tracks. I tend to get sick of tracks - not cars, so it&apos;s a good thing there are so many. I can drive the Ford Capri all day.
<br>
<br>FFB is good out of the box, but it&apos;s a matter of taste what you prefer. Do you want realistic FFB? Or FFB that compensates for lack of forces normally felt through your body?
<br>
<br>I would personally like a bit more detail in the FFB (with a G27), but there are so many FFB sliders to tinker with I&apos;m confident I&apos;ll end up with something that will feel perfect to my own personal preferences.
<br>
<br>The single player seems a bit tacked on for me at least. I find it better than other sims but is still a bit plain and simplified. I&apos;ll stick to hot lapping and online multiplayer.
<br>
<br>All in all a great package, and I predict a move for many from AC and rf2 to Project CARS -- it&apos;s just that good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5236237">Expand</a></span>

<br>Amazing graphics, (nuff said).
<br>
<br>Challenging, yet rewarding handling. Or, challenging to the point of severely frustrating. If you&apos;re not into realism then having to repeatedly tap the accelerator or use manual transmission to avoid spinning out will just piss you off. Plus, while the cars certainly do go incredibly fast, the speed you need to pull off a lot of the tight turns feels like you&apos;re a snail stuck in mud. Not very epic. But realistic.
<br>
<br>Highly in-depth customization as far as tire pressure, force feedback, pit stop strategies, etc. But... if you&apos;re like me you just don&apos;t care or have any inclination to fine tune stuff like your brake duct.
<br>
<br>Everything is unlocked. Awesome! Unless you like unlocking stuff...
<br>
<br>The game is meant to be played clean, but it&apos;s perfect for playing dirty. It doesn&apos;t take much to spin someone out or simply ram them from behind into some obscure oblivion off the track. And no one is better at it than the AIs. Sure, it&apos;s unintentional, (I think). But when you&apos;re cutting tight turns on the inside and you&apos;re constantly surrounded by 13 AI cars. Well, one of these turns you&apos;re going to be spinning in circles while cussing at your TV. The simplest solution to this is to master a track, come first in the qualifying round and proceed to first place your way around the track as if no one else is on it. But then, why bother playing with any AIs on it? Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s perfectly feasible to pull off some clutch breaks through the ranks. Just saying though. When one bad spin out, caused by a rear ending AI screws you over for the rest of the race it kind of sucks.
<br>
<br>Lots of maps. Lots of cars.
<br>
<br>Bottom line though is. Unless you&apos;re really into the style of driving this game gets stale pretty quick.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5326414">Expand</a></span>

You can race on around 40 different tracks maybe more, with dynamic weather conditions. If you want to mess around you can put the AI on about 70%, if you want to have a challenge then you can put them on 93% and have a great and challenging race. Or go Online and race people from around the world. Feedback from my G27 is great, still getting used to how the FFB settings work. You can start from the bottom (Go Karting) and make your way to the top (LMP1) and race in 24HR races. From time to time you will receive invitations to special events as you progress through your Career. A nice addition to the game, makes the career longer and more fun.
<br>10/10 from me, sim drivers will enjoy this game a lot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5237075">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve seen the developpement process, and man, let me tell you that they have come a loooong way!
<br>
<br>-graphics is excellent (texture, lighting, particule effect...)
<br>-sound is one of THE best i&apos;ve ever heard in a racing game (GTA, Forza, DriveClub, iRacing, Azeto...)
<br>-Option man! they have option for option for option. This game is more flexible than any other game out there.
<br>--Content... Oh you&apos;re in for a treat! Selection of cars is amazing. You have it all, from carting to GT racing, to exotic, to formula one, to retro cars...  And they are all pretty damn well modeled.
<br>
<br>-Only one bad thing for me... They UI is **** You get confused. They have to fix that. They want to throw soo much information at you that trying to do they simpliest task is hard.
<br>

<br>But now on to my review.</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">First of, I can only shake my head about people giving pCARS a bad score because it isn&apos;t what they expected it to be. It was never advertised as a car collecting game. It&apos;s a race driving simulator. You guys inform yourself before you buy something, now don&apos;t you? Or do you really buy a sports car and expect it to be a camping van? Please, grow some brain.
<br>
<br>But now on to my review. Project Cars is a great achievement. I come from several years of iRacing experience and while pCARS isn&apos;t quite there yet when everything is set up correctly it gives me the closest feel to what I am used to from iRacing...much better than Assetto Corsa can do but that&apos;s just personal preference.
<br>
<br>But it is the whole package that makes this game such a great buy. It gives you the possibility to jump into race cars you won&apos;t ever be able to drive in real on race tracks you won&apos;t ever be able to drive on. Then there&apos;s the visuals. They are the best in the  market with day/night cycles and dynamic weather changes. The immersive sound does its part to suck you in and there&apos;s even 24 hour racing if you have the stamina/endurance to do so.
<br>
<br>People not interested in multi player races have the opportunity to play their own single player racing career and guess what...the career mode is about driving a race car and working your way from racing series to racing series like a real race driver would. No tedious grind for cars to find out that the newly unlocked car drives exactly the same like the one you had before.
<br>
<br>There are things that are not implemented yet like animated pit crews or safety cars and it needs some polishing in other areas but SMS is going to deliver additional content and fixes with DLCs. Project Cars will be supported for at least two years.
<br>This is not your standard Activision, EA, Ubisoft game where they don&apos;t fix anything and just keep selling you a copy of more or less the same game a year later with the fixes for bugs you wished haven&apos;t been there in the first place.
<br>
<br>Regarding performance this game is demanding. Don&apos;t even think about playing in 4K with Ultra-settings, full starting grid of cars and dynamic weather when you don&apos;t have a high end system (fastest CPU, multi-GPU setup). It could be considered as Crysis of the racing sim genre and will probably keep even next gen hardware busy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5238976">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Its not a game for people who use a Potatoe keyboard or controller
<br>
<br>If the game is to hard for you keep trying get a steering wheel learn how each input you give the car/steering wheel react
<br>
<br>The settings you cant acces during racing is kinda meh for configure your racing wheel to make it
<br>feel good is the only point i dislike so far.

Especially when using dk2 + simXperience, the physics &amp; sound makes this THE greatest racing game to date. Been a driving fan since pole position on atari 2600 btw.</span>

<br>
<br>There where times when personal computer users where discriminated by not having any proper sim type racing game (i don&apos;t count rFactor or Live for speed etc, because of abysmal graphics and lack of official content), i was looking with jealousy at youtube videos of Forza, Gran Turismo, which seem to me a bit too arcade-ish though...
<br>
<br>But not anymore!!! At last we PC users have proper racing sim/game with proper physics, graphics, sounds, online system, lots of tracks, damage system, wheather system, cars, (what else you can ask for???) and it is called Project Cars. My G27 wheel now can be used to its full potential (after some tweaking ofc), my blood pressure is being raised a lot these days because of intense online racing, well it is basically most what i care about in racing game is - RACING! This is where pCARS shine, so many variety of different vehicles you can actually race with online, not like Assetto Corsa where you can race only GT3 mostly, have some boring so called track days where people just randomly cruise around...
<br>
<br>Mods...pCars don&apos;t have them and what a blessing it is, usually 99% of mods a pure ****, i admit there are some good ones, but the problems arise with different versions, updates, rarely you could race them online, divides online community into many different almost empty servers, so no sir! Let the AC have the mods but pCARS will offer official as much as possible perfected content which i prefer!
<br>
<br>Bugs...yes there are some, but they are there not because of bad/lazy attitude of devs, i mostly blame the sheer complexity and the scope of the game itself, there are so many detail and complexity under the hood that it is insanely difficult to make it work perfectly. You can set whatever the weather, whatever the time in whatever the track (there are A LOT of them), add into equation absurdly deep physics system (just check how complex tire model alone is http://www.virtualr.net/inside-project-cars-seta-tire-model )  and a decent amount of uniquely fine tuned cars, rather small dev team and you have a perfect environment for bugs!
<br>Give them time to fix that, they are working on that, but you can&apos;t concentrate only on bugs when evaluating game according to bugs which will be fixed! If you get sick, do you consider yourself as &quot;bad and useless&quot; or you just cure yourself and become &quot;good&quot; again? :)
<br>
<br>Controllers...well i play with a G27 wheel, but i tried it with keyboard and it is perfectly fine even with all assists off, with them activated it is absolutely enjoyable.
<br>
<br>Conclusion...this is the best thing since bread in racing simulation if you want real racing experience, not cruising  (you can do it as well though), bodywork/engine upgrading, career unlocking experience. This game introduced some new features in the genre (like weather system) which will be followed by competitors in years to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5264171">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The graphics were way up to date, and how the cars move are accurate as what people could drive with their cars today. A little note though, there is a notice of glitches along the way, and gamemodes aren&apos;t that quite entertaining. So far, you may get yourself addicted to this and the longer you play. The better it gets.
<br>
<br>Just a note. Don&apos;t buy if you&apos;re not used to cars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5244254">Expand</a></span>

I have a 4way SLI system with 3 screens and the game make good use of my 4 cards. The AI did not seem so bad imo. The lack of coop championship is a big miss.A good advice: buy Assetto forza . its better than this, and at a lower price. If u want a good multiplayer gameplay with f1 cars :buy f1 serie from codemaster! Personaly i prefer f1 2013 wich i play online in coop mode. The damage system is less impressive than in project cars but i prefer beeing on the track more often than in pits for repairs. If u want just driving fun :buy dirt 2 . But if u want to setup cars and you re a car freak who like tuning a lot and have 60 buck to lose: buy project cars!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5236898">Expand</a></span>

<br>I think this game has raised the bar as to how a racing game should be, if your a novice you can play it with whatever assists you need and if you are a pro when all assists are off its a real challenge with some of the cars.</span>

It&apos;s the first racing game to present fully dynamic day/night cycle, weather, and track (grip changes based on traffic, weather), combined with advanced tire and car physics that not only rival but actually exceet of kinds like Assetto Corsa or even Iracing. Starting from tires that react not only to track temperatures and cool/heat up based on the track temperatures but also by the temperatures of the brakes (that properly simulated by heat and wear) and rims that function as a heatsink, tires age and blister physically if abused, flatspots can lead to punctures and hitting walls or other cars hard causes the tires/suspensition to misalign. Volumetric throttle that is affected by weather/humidity and altitude is just one component of so many that are so highly detailed and simulated that once you grasps and feel the difference it makes when you drive with cars in this simulation at the limit, that it starts to immerse you to a whole nother level.
<br>
<br>The amazing graphics and sound vastly help bringing and aiding the immersion and the sense of speed is incredible. Project Cars is very well optimized and runs exceptionally well even on older Nvidia GPU&apos;s however AMD GPU drivers still need a lot of work but that is a common problem.
<br>
<br>Another highlight of Project Cars are the incredible cars. They are the most detailed and best build cars in any racing game to date. The game is worth a purchase just for the cars and their amazing sounds alone and with the combination of the previously mentioned top-class physics.
<br>
<br>The racing tracks, which most are laser scanned, are build with huge attention to detail and passion and easily compete with reference racing tracks from likes of Iracing. Even the ones that are not laser scanned have realistically placed bumps which bring your Forcefeedback to life.
<br>
<br>Forcefeedback is another area where Project Car shines and leaves it&apos;s compeditors in its digital dust. It&apos;s highly adjustable/configureable to tailor anyones preferences and no sign of canned/faked effects but instead full of details that immerses you further to another level. The FFB is class leading beating already great Iracing FFB.
<br>
<br>The racing AI is excellent, aggressive but respectful of your car if you respect theirs. Give them room just like in real life, they will give you room as well. Side by side racing is not only very possible with that approach but happens all the time.
<br>
<br>The sheer amount of content you get in form of cars and tracks make this a great buy and highly recommendation for any racing/driving game fan! The level of immersion by graphics, sound, physics is something that can&apos;t be described by words but HAS to be experienced on your own.
<br>
<br>A mild warning, once you go to Project Cars and get fully immersed, you can&apos;t really go back to other simulators, it&apos;s that GOOD!
<br>
<br>Enjoy racing everyone!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5269114">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m on PC using a xbox controller and I can tell you that it handles like rubbish.  I&apos;ve turned the sensitivity down to 1/100, but you touch that stick a little too much and you&apos;re going off.  I have patience I played for Forza for hours on end, but this is just frustrating. I&apos;m forever dealing with over steer and under steer.  The problem lies with the feel of the game you can&apos;t tell the car is getting out of shape, not until it&apos;s too late and that&apos;s my issue you&apos;re not really in control of the car. There is no feel to the game it feels stiff and unrealistic, somehow forza gave you feedback when you slide, this gives you nothing. I&apos;ve driven many tracks for comparison and this is just dead to me.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a hardcore sim racer it will probably appeal to you and your living room cockpit with complete car interior pedals and wheels, but if you want to race a realistic racing experience on your couch with a controller, forget it. I will not be buying this game for my own collection it&apos;s just not fun.
<br>
<br>The control is one issue.
<br>
<br>There is only 80 cars over many classes.
<br>
<br>Track list is ok, but as always many variations of the same thing.
<br>
<br>Career mode is dull, and uninteresting.
<br>
<br>I would recommend you wait til Forza 6 lands, or some other PC racer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5247453">Expand</a></span>

I have played the gran turismo series since the first release, and then all the forza games, and I have owned many cars. I even used to participate in amateur kart series, with really high horsepower to weight ratio karts. I have done track days on 500+ horsepower cars. I have even reviewed two cars for a magazine.
<br>
<br>Fair to say I know my cars. and my car games.
<br>
<br>But when you first get excited by a name as seemingly exciting and cool as PROJECT CARS, you would think this game wants to end all simulators or at least general car games.
<br>
<br>You would be very very misled. and Disappointed. DISAPPOINTED like kevin sorbo.
<br>CAR CUSTOMIZATION IS VERY MUCH ABSENT
<br>apart from some sliders on camber (limited to a certain range on each car) suspension brakes gear ratio, etc.
<br>
<br>No Parts that you can buy and install. You don&apos;t like N/A? Want to turbo? nope. Maybe supercharger? nope. What about engine mods like race cams, lighter pistons, race valves? Nope nope and nope.
<br>What about at least painting the car NOPE. Bodykits is even MORE A BIG FAT NO.
<br>
<br>There is nothing you can do to the car in terms of customization. No parts, no rims, no whatever you can call any modification.
<br>
<br>So there is no &quot;Project&quot; at all. In fact, the name of the game is misleading- the name is only chosen, from my point of view, because it sounds cool and will make you dream of stuff this game DOESN&apos;T DO.
<br>
<br>So the most important bit at least- How do the cars handle?
<br>
<br>LIKE A SACK OF ROCKS is the answer.
<br>
<br>Yes, some bits &quot;seem&quot; realistic. Like a lot of effort was put into making the game realistic. But then you realize why good car simulators are few and far between- Either only the really well funded and serious into the genre can do this well- due to their commitment and drive, Cue Gran Turismo and Forza.
<br>
<br>The realism wanes when you realize that everytime you tune the car, sometimes the effects are completely the opposite of what the tuning is supposed to do. And the tuning affects similiar cars of the same drivetrain VERY differently, as if separate people were put into making the physics for separate cars; so in short not only is the physics not realistic, they are not consistent between cars, as if each car has a separate law of gravity affecting them.
<br>
<br>Fishtailing under torque happens A LOT even if you adjust the settings of suspension and differentials- and using computer aids. And unlike in real life, where tapping the acceleration to try and roll the tires and brake pulsing and all the tips and tricks the fishtailing in this game is UNRECOVERABLE from the first uneven L/R suspension compression under &quot;excessive&quot; torque.
<br>
<br>Many weird physics like that just ruins any fun from the game. Yes I have finished first in races. But fun moments are very few and far between.
<br>
<br>There are also very few cars, which is a blessing as driving these cars will undoubtedly make you drive like a retard if you tried those moves on the actual cars in real life.
<br>
<br>This game is disappointing. Yes, there a few cool features, like OCULUS rift support, good graphics, great sounds for some cars, and sort of cool and slick menus.
<br>-BUT- the many ways this game is just a shell and seems rushed shows under the &quot;features&quot; and exterior. if the game is at least just fun to drive, that would have bumped the score up by 5. but the game isn&apos;t. Hence the name &quot;PROJECT&quot; cars is sort of accurate, if this game is just some sort of High School project given a video game budget and shelled to look impressive like an actual cool car game. Except its not.
<br>
<br>Stick to Forza / GT. For extreme fun, try Forza Horizon 2, which is a step in the right direction. If you feel like torturing yourself, WASTE YOUR MONEY ON &quot;PROJECT CRAP&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=6301535">Expand</a></span>

It all goes downhill from there unfortunately. If you are a casual gamer on a pad you will probably like this game. If you prefer simulation racing (Assetto, iRacing, rfactor2, yes, all three have flaws but none like pCars), stay away from this over-hyped buggy mess. The AI are suicidal or slow (on highest difficulty), 3-4 car pile up of cars one on top of another at the grid of some quick races (pancake stack), handling feels like a limp celery, force feedback is either notchy or bland with an enforced deadzone (even if preset to zero) and don&apos;t expect to feel the rumble strips even if firmly grasping your steering wheel. WMD missed a great opportunity. This game had so much potential but it missed the mark by a country mile. I fell for the hype of the glitzy pre-release videos and incredible reviews. Don&apos;t fall for the sweet bootylicious eye candy, once you scratch the surface the old lady with rotten teeth, smoking a used cigarette, with a  pockmarked face, receding hairline, a bald patch and a wooden leg starts to emerge. The overwhelmingly positive reviews are posted by graphically overwhelmed casual racers (have fun with that), fanboys, vested interest investors of the game or just generally people who have no idea what a simulation racing game should deliver. pCars over reached big time and underdelivered in spades.

<br>The problem with PCars is that you can&apos;t tell wether it want&apos;s to be a game or a sim. It tries to appeal to an audience as broad as possible and by that it isn&apos;t exactly what they are looking for both groups.
<br>
<br>It is basically like modern day Formula 1. Trying to please everyone and by that pleasing no one while having no real identity.

<br>+ Weather, at last! But too bad for pcars that driveclub have been released because comapred to driveclub, weather conditions in pcars don&apos;t look that good, it looks jsut ok. But at least they are here, that should be a generic feature in every racing game (arcade or sim) with day/night cycle.
<br>+ Driving sensations can be good....but to demanding for my tastes.
<br>+ Driving karts is fun
<br>
<br>- Replays are terrible
<br>- Graphics are far from what was shown on trailer (and i play on ultra settings so i can&apos;t imagine what it looks like on consoles) and not what we could expect from a 2015 racing game. Project cars is very far from driveclub graphics (a game from 1 year on PS4 at least 2x less powerful than my GTX980...). I don&apos;t understand those who are imrpessed by the graphics of pcars, only cars are good to look at (so are the cars from driveclub and forza 5), how can we not see the same thing? Maybe those impressed by pcars graphics never played a game these last years.
<br>- Driving too demanding for my tastes, i much prefer more arcade driving (not like NFS or the crew oviously) like PGR, driveclub or GRID, it&apos;s just much more fun
<br>- Very few cars and selection is terrible (no ferrari, no lambo etc.). 95% of the cars i don&apos;t gie a sh** about and don&apos;t make me dream. Terrible selection of cars and brand.
<br>- Quickly very boring. But honestly, i always found that boring to race on closed real tracks with boring and repetitive scenery (same on each track) seen 10000x in other games. I like to race in cities or with a gorgeaous scenry on my right, tracks from games like PGR, GRID and Driveclub or even Gran turismo which at least offer a mix of boring real tracks and original ones. In pcars, you get only 2 original tracks (the only track interesting for me)
<br>- Bugs (all thes postpone and the game is released with bugs....)
<br>- Very badly optimised for AMD to what i&apos;ve read
<br>- Driving sensations with a wheel are disapointing.
<br>- The IA is sooooooo stupid. A really terrible IA.
<br>- Boring career and progression
<br>- No cusomisations for cars
<br>- No &quot;atmosphere&quot; each tracks (except the 2 original ones) feel empty (but well, these same tracks most of the time feel empty on other games too)
<br>
<br>Huge disapointed for me, i&apos;m returning on DriveClub, which at least give me fun and amazing graphics. I&apos;m glad i bought the boxed version of the game, i would have been angry to buy oin steam and couldn&apos;t seel it. Time to sell project cars, 3 days was enough to confirm my disapointment.
<br>
<br>Sorry for my english, it&apos;s not my mother tongue.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5239482">Expand</a></span>

I tried to provide some constructive criticism to the development team and it &apos;hurt their feelings&apos; so I doubt any criticism I post here will make much of a difference to either them, or their fanboys. While it&apos;s not completely tragic, it&apos;s no longer worth my time or effort.</span>

First of all because some cars behave just good and many other (especially the road cars) behave not even close to good.

<br>
<br>If this was the target, then in my opinion, they missed the target..
<br>
<br>First of all because some cars behave just good and many other (especially the road cars) behave not even close to good. Physics are not in the &quot;simulation&quot; class by any mean. Physics are just acceptable for a racing title. Not for a simulation.. The worst of all is the wet physics. Its not even close to real.. I&apos;ve driven in wet track in reality and I can assure you that this is not how a car behaves.
<br>
<br>Secondly the car list of this game is poor. Its poor in numbers in comparison to Forza and Gran Turismo and it is poor in choices too. Few cars are desirable. The rest is full to LMPs and fictional cars. The absence of Ferrari or Lamborghini cars is very bold too.
<br>
<br>Then, the way career mode was designed is totally wrong for me. There is no progress and no target. You just jump into any category you like and race. You can start from Formula A (Formula1-like) or LMPs right from the start of your career. Created to be boring in other words...
<br>
<br>Graphics are among the best you can find in PC, although they are not that exciting as the screenshots leaks were showing during development. In addition there are massive performance issues. On the other hand weather effects are impressive and generally car models are very accurate. Tracks are great but they are not laser-scanned as in Assetto Corsa.
<br>
<br>Sound is good but not perfect and the absence of some effects like tire squeal is making things worse. Just acceptable palette of sounds in this game.
<br>
<br>Last but not least, this game feels unfinished in so many terms. Some cars physics were built in less care than some others and bugs are everywhere. Just search the internet and you will find countless issues reported so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5237934">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There are some major bugs in this game, the biggest I have encountered so far occurred only with 125CC Karts. That bug would make my car steer in the opposite direction I turned the wheel (or analog stick, tried it with both). Normally this would happen at the first turn of the race, and would be fixed by restarting the race. But for those people who have restarts turned off, this would be a game breaking bug.
<br>
<br>The sound is the worst part. Anyone that has two functional ears will hate this game. The game mixes samples from all nearby cars and plays the samples alternately (best way I could describe it). The result is weird sounding vibrating sound that makes absolutely no sense.
<br>
<br>This game has a lot of potential, and if they release some patches fixing the bugs, graphical issues, and sound&#x2026;for the love of god fix the sound, it happens on both PC and console&#x2026;how did this terrible sound make it to print?!?!...If they fix these issues the game would be an 8&#x2026;.but as it stands right now, I can&#x2019;t in good conscience give it more than a 5. It is worth a play for the hard core sim racing crowd, but just wait until a price drop or patch 30 something hits.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5245105">Expand</a></span>

<br>I highly recommend reading user reviews on Steam of users with high play-time. The 80% recommendation is missleading, as most of the positives have 150h.</span>

My feeling with those games was that they had it all, but also one bad problem that spoiled it all. Steering lag. The games took too long to respond to the steering input. Making it impossible to race fast cars, because you see the corner, respond and nothing happens till you missed the apex. There is no excuse for that. Even sluggish real world cars respond immediately to a steering wheel albeit in sluggish way. Project cars has the same problem. No matter what your settings, you steer nothing happens and between 025 and 0.5 of a second the car responds. And that spoils everything. I&apos;ve spent days trying to get rid of the lag with the shift games. After losing half a day with Project Cars. I&apos;ve decided to play other racing games that don&apos;t have this problem. I don&apos;t need Slightly Mad. They have cool ideas but  can&apos;t get the basics right, others can.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5982999">Expand</a></span>

Moreover, the developers have openly set their eyes on surpassing Gran Turismo and Forza. While I know these games don&apos;t exactly have the precise simulator physics that some high end PC titles have but no one can deny their fun factor. I personally haven&apos;t played a lot of Forza but I&apos;ve been playing Gran Turismo for a long long time and so I will be basing this review in comparison to that because it&apos;s physics won&apos;t allow it to be compared to actual sims like iRacing, Rfactor, Assetto Corsa, etc.
<br>
<br>The Cars:
<br>The variety of cars available is probably the biggest weakness in Project CARS. I understand that they want to focus only on the purpose built race cars and only the cars that fit into the various classes that are featured in the game. Sure enough, a rally-spec Impreza or a JGTC R32 GT-R would be completely out of place in a game like this... but even in the given classes, there are usually only one or two cars to choose from. Just how is Ferrari not in the game? They don&apos;t make enough racecars for you? Gran Turismo may have had hundreds of JDM clones hidden in the roster but it still hands down destroys Project CARS in terms of variety.
<br>
<br>The Racing:
<br>I have to admit, I loved Gran Turismo&apos;s physics.. they were very fun to drive with and I was hooked for hours, knowing fully well that it may not be realistic but that doesn&apos;t mean it can&apos;t be fun. However, Project CARS physics are definitely more on the hardcore realistic side (Although not quite there yet). Project CARS takes this one.. as a sim, it is bringing the realism a bit more authentically. Still, I feel that it&apos;s very inconsistent.. the Karts in particular have **** physics and while some cars handle and work beautifully (That P1 maaan), some others have weirdly janky physics that just don&apos;t work. I&apos;m sure they can patch this up though along with the car list without constantly pushing in DLC.
<br>
<br>The Courses:
<br>There&apos;s a very interesting selection of racetracks in this one, a lot that I haven&apos;t seen in Gran Turismo even. While I do enjoy the various original tracks and city circuits in GT, Project CARS boasts a better collection of authentic and prestigious race courses around the world. Again, it does lack the variety GT has along with the many more disciplines.
<br>
<br>The Sounds and Visuals:
<br>Gran Turismo has been well known for it&apos;s impressive graphics but it&apos;s no secret that the much more recent Project CARS surpasses GT6 in this field for sure. If you have a powerful enough machine, you can admire the fantastic models on the precious few vehicles in the game along with very life like lighting effects and reflections. The damage works better and is more convincing than GT at least. The Sound too is surely better than Gran Turismo engine sounds (Which they REALLY need to work on).
<br>
<br>Progression:
<br>Well.. there is none. No sense of progression whatsoever. I know, I know.. &apos;all we wanna do is go around and just enjoy setting fast laptimes~~&apos;. Not everyone is satisfied with just that. A lot of modern racing games have this problem now actually. I enjoyed collecting money through the many different events that I normally wouldn&apos;t be bothered to try and then saving up to buy and drive a car that I desired. It always felt so great. GT gave me that and also the many many different themed challenges that were really fun to beat, very very exciting. However, while Project CARS does have a career, you get to start from any point.. you can literally just start from the LMP class cars and race a few generic seasons in your car of limited choice. It&apos;s really not very different from just picking a car and taking it out on a quick race a couple of times. The only difference being some boring &apos;emails&apos; from your team after the race and some social media feed on the side which gets very repetitive and very annoying.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>There are two kinds of car people. The people who play the games to collect and admire all kinds of amazing cars that they love and the other people who care less about the car and more about the raw adrenaline of racing to the limit with precise inputs and mechanics while fine tuning every detail of the machine to get the best possible lap times. It&apos;s easy to guess which game caters to which kinda player.
<br>By no means is Project CARS a bad game. It&apos;s a brilliant game and all of the fun lies in the driving itself, which makes it strong as a racing game.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t have a Playstation anymore, I only play on PC now so I was overjoyed when I learnt that someone out there is looking to outdo Forza and GT so I do want to like it. However, I hate to admit that I am really disappointed. It is surely a great racing game for the PC but it&apos;s not the Gran Turismo killer that they said it would be. I am a Gran Turismo fan and while I may be a bit prejudiced, I am the kind of person they need to convince.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=5398613">Expand</a></span>

But the game trys to give you that feeling. Fail! The Carreer is very boring. you start with cart racing and drive sometimes on the same tracks. later it becomes not more fun. The Tracks looks cold and dead and you dont really get the racing flow.</span>

I have a geforce 970 and top of the line 35 inch monitor. Anyone not experiencing photo realism with this program is missing out. Realism is the name of the game plus physics. For the time of my life, I have been having with this GAME????, I would pay $1000, 10 years ago. Pcars is the first simulator to achieve photo realism for home use. They need to be applauded for this accomplishment. I would love to see the coding, because no other company has done this. With the updates and new coding, the program is getting to be perfect. Before Pcars, I was enjoying AC, but there is no comparison between the two in physics. I understand the difference in teams producing the two programs, but AC is thinking too much about consoles for a small team. I am not biased in anyway on this review. I just want people who race cars to know, with the right equipment, this program can achieve incredible realism???????</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=6026596">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Project Cars even with it&apos;s many flaws is still the most casual friendly racing sim on the market, it caters to both audiences, the casual that just wants to race and the pro that wants to tweak everything to his or her liking, the racing is solid also and can make for some intense racing battles and add the fact that the game is absolutely stunning to look at you really can&apos;t go wrong with projecr cars, especially while it&apos;s on sale :).
<br>
<br>9/10, better than the console version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=6296465">Expand</a></span>

The AI is the worst i&apos;ve seen and the Physics are like Collision between Player and AI Racer ---&gt; add Rotation Force to Player Car. This is making the Career mode like driving as first place and winning with 20 seconds advance or starting (if u start at last place in your 2nd race because you won the Qualifier and the first race) and getting sandwiched by the AI Cars which happily go back to their railroad path leaving you in a wreck behind. Absolutly no fun. In Indy 500 which was like 30 years ago i was able to wreck the AIs cars wiht alot of Polygons flying all over this place at least. Sorry but i din&apos;t find something to have fun in this game. I give 3 Points, because it has good graphics and supports VR.
<br>For Multiplayer Simracing purposes I prefer Iracing over this *&#xA7;&amp;!%$* of !*&#xA7;*%?*.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/project-cars/user-reviews?user_review_id=7515383">Expand</a></span>
