Plot is also nice, nothing new but still good. I was afraid of this conversion but it has only minor bugs nad glitches. And the biggest plus for this part is main character. I wish there will be more female assassins.</span>

<br>
<br>Pros:  Enjoyable.  Get to see another part of the AC story.  Some interesting new ideas
<br>Cons: Some interesting new ideas (nice try but not next time).  The  graphics do feel a little heavy after playing Black Flag.  Needs bigger maps.
<br>
<br>Overall:  A far port at a fair price.  If you enjoy the series then get it, there is more game here than it first appears.  But remember that it is not Black Flag, but still a lot of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-liberation-hd/user-reviews?user_review_id=3930829">Expand</a></span>

I thought Black Flag became the worst game in the series, but developers surprise me again.
<br>
<br>This game is very similar to AC3, but graphics seems worse, the battle system is too primitive, moreover Liberation HD has more annoying bugs than AC3. The idea to wear different costumes which changes the gameplay is pretty well, but of course, in the game it doesn&apos;t work, so gameplay is still sucks and doesn&apos;t matter in general which one you wear.
<br>
<br>The worst park of the game are story and characters, no doubt. It&apos;s so foolish and illogical, that only way to continue playing is to ignore all that rubbish. I suppose, that characters from Quake 3 have much more in common with real people, than characters from Liberation.
<br>
<br>The good part of the game is the gameplay of missions, which are better, than in AC4, and you won&apos;t be forced to play the same missions again and again, but there are no great or fresh ideas, too. I also like the sound, the actors are pretty well, but the dialogues are similar to the story, very bad...

<br>Unfortunately, i didn&apos;t play the Vita version and hoped to have at least some fresh gameplay with female alter-ego, but almost every aspects of the game are quite bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-liberation-hd/user-reviews?user_review_id=3921942">Expand</a></span>

<br>The remake is one of the best, almost all textures changed. They don&apos;t do that on other HD remakes.
<br>If you don&apos;t look closely, you won&apos;t notice that it&apos;s not a full AC title.
<br>
<br>For 20euros it&apos;s quite a deal, even if it is a smaller game.</span>

<br>Being originally a PSV game, it&apos;s better than I expected. Worth an 8. And I&apos;ve decided to be generous to give a more positive score to the game which gave me some pleasure playing it. Though short and unchallenging, it&apos;s not monotonous.</span>

Making basically the same game or even TWO per year while maintaining all the problems that were present in the very first game doesn&apos;t help it. People are simply tired of that.
<br>But I&apos;ll try to be impartial. By itself, AC: Liberation is a good game. Easily worth of 8, but I gave it one more because some of the ratings here (0?) doesn&apos;t make sense, sorry. It is true successor to the very first (and in my opinion - the best) AC game with Altair. First AC game in a long time I finished at 100%, while done every side quest, opened the whole map and even gather SEVERAL collections.
<br>It has good pace and normal length. AC became very boring with the same mechanics again and again, so keeping clever length is important, otherwise people get demotivated to play and finish even the main plot, not talking about side-quests and all.
<br>And of course we can&apos;t get away from comparing this to another title of the series - AC: Black Flag. Personally, I liked AC: Liberation more and I really believe it&apos;s a better game. Technically, AC: Black Flag can&apos;t even compete. It&apos;s a crying shame what Ubi did with optimization and polish. AC: Liberation is a complete opposite of that - runs smoothly while maintaining pretty beautiful graphics. And controls, CONTROLS. AC: Black Flag was simply frustrating. Making character jump from the 1 meter fence was a real challenge. And I didn&apos;t have a single issue with AC: Liberation controls. Why there is such a difference is beyond me. Another thing is plot. Both are lacking. But at least AC: Liberation has a main character that is appealing and with strong motivation. Edward just a money whore without ANY reasonable motivation that would make him sympathetic. Gameplay. AC: Black Flag has sea battles and that is ALL the game has. The missions on the islands are all the same and goddamn awful. On the other hand, AC: Liberation has missions that actually differ from one another. And that is even true speaking about side-quests. Also, it has some interesting additional locations. The combat in AC: Liberation has some variety at last - in all other titles I actually finished all the games by defend+left click SPAM. This game forced me to use tools (something all other games meant to do but failed) - pistols (in close combat, I mean), smoke bombs, whip, multi-killing-combos. And of course, it had BLOOD, plenty of it. The censorship in AC: Black Flag is laughable at best.
<br>All in all, Ubi tried to make additional port to make some more money. But suddenly it ended up being a better game than their main title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-liberation-hd/user-reviews?user_review_id=3927670">Expand</a></span>

If you want a female protagonist to have that &quot;epic&quot; feel (which is really hard to generate) like Ezio or Connor or Altair you need to present the character animation as such... it is hard to get into the groove of the game with the protagonist  looking like a stick figure weighing no more than 50kg...and portraying her as a hardcore assassin/killer with a touch of &quot;model&quot;. It doesn&apos;t fit well with the game (at least for me), All that was needed was a bit more mass and height...

What he keeps forgetting is that ITS A BLOODY REMAKE. Its not supposed to do anything different except fix the bugs and improve the visuals which this game did. I will admit, the vita version was no very good. But this game has improved on it in so many ways. The vita version had hundreds of bugs and glitches from broken trophies to even one broken mission I encountered. In this game, they were no where to found. The ONLY glitch that they hadn&apos;t taken out(which really annoys me for some reason) is the butter knife glitch where Aveline looks like shes holding a butter knife the wrong way when she does double counters with her machete. Everything else is fine. While the story has plot holes, their mission wasn&apos;t to add more to the main story! And they even helped out the player by reminding them what was going on from time to time in an un-interruptive way. There are literally 2-3 tailing missions. And you don&apos;t get detected right away, they give you a good amount of time (at least 20 seconds) to hide. The missions in this game have a good pace to them but there are some plot holes that leave you wondering. The combat system is the same as AC3 and AC4 except the sound doesn&apos;t glitch off all the time like in the latter. It has all new amazing sword moves as well, only the machete moves are copied from connor. This game has also brought back stealth, which is the strength of the AC series.
<br>
<br>The slave and lady personas have also been improved as they have new mechanics that help you blend in plain sight. I think they should have implemented them more in your efforts of releasing slaves (lady pays for their release, slave sneaks in and releases them, assassin fights slavers etc..) but there are moments in the game when you do this!
<br>
<br>The checkpoints are also spread out in a moderate way as well. They aren&apos;t great, but they definitely aren&apos;t horrible. I honestly think it deserves at least an 8.5 for:
<br>+Amazing protagonist
<br>+improved combat
<br>+Improved graphics
<br>+Improved mechanics for the personas
<br>+improved tailing
<br>+A variety of new soldiers from the vita version that provide more of a challenge when fighting
<br>+Sound is VERY much improved
<br>-no new ways to use personas to liberate slaves besides hiding in plain sight
<br>-some boring side missions
<br>-Graphics aren&apos;t up to par with AC4, though they are on par with AC3
<br>-plot holes
<br>-Some bad voice acting
<br>I strongly recommend you get this game. I think this game will be worth your while.

I&apos;m giving it an 8, because I enjoyed playing it, but there is a strong possibility that this game is not for you, so please read the review before deciding.
<br>
<br>First off, the reason that this game is difficult to give a numeric score is that it is a HD remake of a game for the Playstation Vita. I didn&apos;t play the original on the Vita, so I can&apos;t say how this one does or doesn&apos;t stack up to it. So those of you who are expecting this game to be in the same league as the recently released Black Flag, you&apos;re going to need to temper your expectations. This is not that game. Fortunately, it also doesn&apos;t cost as much as that game would, either, so there is that.
<br>
<br>Liberation originally launched as a companion game to Assassin&apos;s Creed III, and the HD remake feels like it - it plays rather similarly, and, like AC III, represents kind of an awkward growing phase in the series. Like AC III, it tries out a lot of new ideas, some of which work, some of which don&apos;t, and some of which probably could work with some more polish, but don&apos;t yet.
<br>
<br>The biggest example of an idea which could have used a little more polish was the &quot;persona system&quot;, a gameplay mechanic in which Aveline switches between three different modes of play, each with different strengths and weaknesses. When using the Lady persona, Aveline can blend into crowds easily and use a unique charm mechanic to bypass guards, but cannot make use of her freerunning skills due to her heavy and restrictive clothing. When using the Slave persona, Aveline can also blend easily, and can remain inconspicuous in restricted areas by pretending to be a worker. She can still freerun in this mode, but she is weaker both offensively and defensively than the third persona, the Assassin. The Assassin is of course the most well-armed and armored persona, but also the one that guards most easily notice. Overall, I think the idea of having different gameplay modes for different personas has potential as a mechanic, but the execution here is flawed, and it is especially noticeable if you&apos;re a veteran of previous AC games. While I appreciate having unique mechanics for each persona, each persona also has some portion of the core Assassin&apos;s Creed functionality stripped away from them, so instead of making us feel like we have three different powerful toolsets to solve our problems, the persona system usually just makes me end up feeling like I have three different Assassins who are all crippled in slightly different ways. Good idea, poor execution. I know a lot of people wanted to see this changed in the HD version, but I understand that the mechanics for it are so deeply embedded that it would be hard to do that without basically recreating the game from scratch, and that&apos;s a bit too much to ask for a port. I just hope they learn from their experience if they decide to use this system again.
<br>
<br>That gripe aside, the rest of the game is pretty decent. The graphics are obviously not up to Black Flag standards, but they&apos;re pretty good for a remastered handheld game. They&apos;re somewhere in the Brotherhood/Revelations neighborhood if run on comparable settings. The combat system is largely the same as the one from AC III, and it works fairly well here. The story isn&apos;t one of the best in the AC canon, but it is far from the worst, either, and the lack of intrusion by an annoying &quot;future timeline&quot; character is a big, big plus in my book. The game&apos;s environments are fairly small in comparison to some of the previous games, but remember, this is a port of a handheld game, and if viewed in that light, they&apos;re not bad at all. Similarly, this game is shorter than a traditional AC game. It normally takes me about 20 hours to run through a main series game to my satisfaction, but this one only took me about 12.
<br>
<br>Finally, for those of you out there who are completionists, AC Liberation HD does include the extra missions that were previously only available when connecting the Vita version of Liberation to AC III on the PS3. However, they need to be unlocked through Uplay, and are not available by default.
<br>
<br>So, all in all -
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Full-featured AC game
<br>- Decent graphics for what it is
<br>- Good storyline
<br>- Intrusion of stupid future storyline kept to a minimum
<br>- Tries lots of new ideas
<br>- Cheap
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Some new mechanics aren&apos;t prefect
<br>- Is a port of a handheld game, and despite all the polish, still shows it
<br>- Kind of short
<br>
<br>All in all, if you&apos;re a fan of the AC series for reasons not related to it having the flashiest graphics at the time of release, give this game a try. At the very least, pick it up during the next Steam sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-liberation-hd/user-reviews?user_review_id=3928488">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, the GUI is a step backwards: takes seconds to open the map (high end machine with SSD), can&apos;t use the mouse to set markers, no fast travel options and I found the running-swimming in the swamplands tedious after a while. The trade minigame was interesting, but If I spent too much time on it, the game freeze or crash; I&apos;ve lost a hour of work. Sometimes, the mouse clicks didn&apos;t register so I had to click around until it finally accepted the click on the buy goods button. From gameplay mechanics perspective, it has the usual overwhelming tailing and instant-failing missions, and lacks instant replayability in case I didn&apos;t succeed with the optional objectives: had to wait 15 minutes of credits to go back and try some of the final and toughest fights. I was curious about how G&#xE9;rard and Aveline&apos;s relationship evolves, but the game didn&apos;t elaborate on them further on, sadly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-liberation-hd/user-reviews?user_review_id=4292993">Expand</a></span>

<br>Underrated greatness.
<br>I didn&#x2019;t expect much going into Liberation, this game originally came out on vita so I expected a small handheld game with very linear and cheap gameplay, but this isn&#x2019;t what I got at all.
<br>Assassin&#x2019;s Creed Liberation is a full-fledged Assassin&#x2019;s Creed game
<br>But at the same time is probably the most video gamey game in the series
<br>This is the first time since Assassins Creed 3 where I didn&#x2019;t rely on the story alone to drag me through to the end
<br>This game was in development at the same time as assassins creed 3 so this hd remake reminds you of the great things assassins creed has lost over the past 3 years
<br>Combat is swift and satisfying, nearly identical to that of Assassins creed 3
<br>Missions are actually fun, greatly varied, and mix in environmental stealth, social stealth, and combat beautifully.
<br>I really wasn&#x2019;t expecting such fleshed out missions.
<br>There are of course a handful of cinematic style missions like Assassins Creed 3 introduced, but still there are great infiltration and social stealth AC2 style missions and tons of ac 1 style assassination missions to an extent.
<br>I say to an extent because while every assassination mission is built up, this was originally a hand held game, the missions are still pretty linear, but nowhere near as linear as black flag for example felt.
<br>Liberation tries to add a new mechanic to social stealth with its personas system
<br>You switch back and forth between assassin who&#x2019;s notoriety rises the quickest, but has the most weapons at its disposal, slave persona that allows you to blend into workers and slave areas and a lady persona who&#x2019;s notoriety increases much more slowly and allows you to bribe and charm guards to take them away from post
<br>Each persona also has their own set of side missions such as contracts and investigations and their own collectibles.
<br>Collectibles do unlock clothing items, but these items don&#x2019;t do anything but look nice.
<br>It would&#x2019;ve been cool if they actually added perks.
<br>You can also buy clothing and weapons, and you can use a trade system to buy and sell goods for profit to ensure you always have enough cash for what you need.
<br>Where I did however find disappointment is in the story and locations.
<br>There are 3 main locations in liberations and sadly these locations are very small
<br>As an original handheld game, understandably cities aren&#x2019;t really the star of the show, if you&#x2019;re buying liberation, you&#x2019;re buying it more so for its story which honestly isn&#x2019;t really that great
<br>The story is mildly interesting from an outside perspective, but nothing that leaves you craving more, the story content seems very filler in terms of pertaining to the AC universe
<br>Theres always atleast one thing that happens in an Assassins Creed game that makes me stop and think,
<br>I unfortunately didn&#x2019;t experience this in my time with Liberation.
<br>And despite the smaller maps, newer additions such as fast travel not being here is massively annoying.
<br>While this may not be the greatest Assassin&#x2019;s Creed game, this is still a great overall game that features many aspects that the games are now missing and introduce some features that you might recognize from a certain pirate game.
<br>If you&#x2019;re a fan of the series, Assassins Creed Liberation is definitely worth your time to play through
<br>
<br>For what it is
<br>
<br>Action Adventure Stealth Game:
<br>8.5/10
<br>
<br>Overall:
<br>8.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-liberation-hd/user-reviews?user_review_id=5401351">Expand</a></span>
