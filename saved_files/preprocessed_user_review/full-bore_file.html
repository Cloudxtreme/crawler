If you have a strong sense of curiosity and love exploring, this game is for you. If you don&apos;t like exploring for the sake of exploring and require constant directions, then this game may not be the best for you.
<br>
<br>The level design is constantly strong and it is motivating to know for a fact that you can solve every puzzle the moment you see it. The feeling of seeing an unexplored part of a room and making your way over there to discover a hidden doorway is INCREDIBLE.
<br>
<br>The story is brilliantly told through background art and computer terminals hidden throughout the various levels.
<br>The art and animations are adorable and the music fits the game perfectly.
<br>
<br>The only reason I gave it a 9 is because of the spelling/grammar errors and the fact that, even after completing all the endings, I was left with more questions than answers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/full-bore/user-reviews?user_review_id=4178734">Expand</a></span>

Just like mentioned The Swapper, game&apos;s puzzle design very consistent and relies on the solid mechanics around different kind of blocks and level geometry rather than some ominous abilities &quot;you will get later&quot;. Every puzzle in the game you see  you can solve anytime. Well, if you are clever enough, hehe. With time, each new puzzle you encounter teaches you some new mechanics about the block you were sure knew everything already. And the combinations of these blocks can make puzzles quite, quite complex despite the fact there aren&apos;t that many of these blocks. And solving hem gives you well-deserved satisfaction. In some cases I&apos;m sure you will feel like a genius.
<br>But puzzles are just a tip of the iceberg. Game features quite charming animations and lovely graphics accompanied by amazing soundtrack that organically fits game&apos;s atmosphere.
<br>
<br>In short, it is one of these awesome and unexpected indie games that happened once or twice per a year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/full-bore/user-reviews?user_review_id=3646097">Expand</a></span>
