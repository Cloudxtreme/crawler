You can easily immerse yourself in your investigation - mostly due to the fact that there is not much to distract you. No walking around, no action - just you as yourself.
<br>
<br>Of course this feels a little like &quot;work&quot; kind of - but work that you can enjoy because you are making a difference. Now - what difference you make is something you need to think about very much. You are interpreting - but so is your supervisor based on your findings. You have a direct influence on what conclusions and actions are being taken (well..... more or less anyway).
<br>
<br>What i did not like about this otherwise very good game is that there are certain key findings that MUST be delivered - otherwise the story will not proceed. So you do not have the option to actually let a suspect simply go. (so the open-world/free choice really is more of an illusion)
<br>
<br>The game is very mature in its mechanics and presentation. You need to read a lot and need to actually be interested in the subject matter to draw any kind of enjoyment from it. It is also a game that i like to turn on ... in short to medium bursts ... so to say. It can become kind of exhausting to go on for longer - but then - making pauses pulls you out of the immersion making it fairly hard to get into it sometimes.
<br>
<br>Artstyle and visuals are very nice - and have a unique charme. The low polygon style is not exactly new that is... but fits the sterile and unpersonal feeling of being distant to what your actions might provoke.
<br>
<br>The music is soothing - and puts you further into a mood of being uninvolved - with certain consequences making a sharp impact on this feeling.
<br>
<br>I would have wished for an &quot;expert&quot; mode (likely too hard to do though...) where you would not decide on pre-marked key notes but instead freely mark and interpret stuff yourself ... because more than once i read passages and informations that i would have loved to proceed - but was not supposed to use due to the game engine.
<br>
<br>I can highly recommend this game to the probably rather small target audience of past time investigators that want to take the subject matter a lot more serious than 99.9% of any other so called &quot;investigative game&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orwell/user-reviews?user_review_id=6886993">Expand</a></span>

<br>You</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Orwell is an investigative game akin to a visual novel. You play as The Investigator, someone whose job it is to use the powerful Orwell surveillance system to solve crimes &#x2013; or in this case, solve a particular crime. You see, a bomb was set off in Freedom Plaza in The Nation, killing three people, and it is your job to try and catch the bomber before they can kill anyone else.
<br>
<br>You start out with a single person of interest &#x2013; a young woman who left the Plaza shortly before the bomb went off. She was a protester who had been arrested for attacking a police officer, but who wasn&#x2019;t prosecuted for it due to lack of evidence. It quickly becomes clear that not all is as it seems, and it seems unlikely that she personally was the bomber &#x2013; but she has past associations with a group known as Thought, an anti-government group which often engages in extremist rhetoric. But are they really the sort of people who would kill people? Or are they just innocent bystanders coincidentally caught up in the investigation?
<br>
<br>Orwell is a very ambiguous game, and it is precisely this ambiguity which really makes the game work. Thought is upset about living in a surveillance state, but it is clear from your perspective as The Investigator that the system is designed to be humane in many ways &#x2013; the investigator passes on information to someone else, whose job it is to analyze the data. You cannot investigate people who aren&#x2019;t targets &#x2013; unless someone has been designated as suspicious by actual data, you cannot collect data at all them, nor are you allowed to go snooping through their things. But if they are a target of interest, you have nigh unlimited authority to go snooping. And while the state is clearly a bit authoritarian, it is also clear that the system works &#x2013; crime has gone down, and you can catch several criminals over the course of the game who really did do bad things. The person on the other end, who helps to determine whether or not the data is really indicative of wrongdoing, is a genuinely nice person who cares about people and who urges you to collect more data. The leader of The Nation appears to genuinely be trying to help out neighboring states.
<br>
<br>But all of this is muddied with the ambiguity of the fact that not everyone in the government is nice, and the general sinister nature of your surveillance. Your actions do have consequences, and it is clear that if you made the wrong decisions, you could potentially feed people bad data and get people put in jail &#x2013; and the choice of whether or not to feed people bad data, and the impression you leave the government on people, is dependent on what data you give them.
<br>
<br>The game, thus, is a combination of an investigation and a moral choice system &#x2013; you are not only investigating who might be the bomber, but also deciding what is and is not relevant, what should and should not be part of the investigation, and you have the power to wrongfully put people in jail or put people in danger. The very simple gameplay of choosing what pieces of highlighted information to put into a database from various documents, webpages, emails, and phone and text conversations thus takes on a great deal of weight, and makes you think about what you&#x2019;re doing in a very different way from other investigatory games, as you think of it not only in terms of true/false, but also whether the information morally belongs in the hands of the government.
<br>
<br>The game&#x2019;s gameplay also shows how a system like that can lead to paranoia, as you see people engage in a lot of extremist rhetoric and it is easy to jump to conclusions and morally convict someone in your mind who didn&#x2019;t do anything worse than complain, as well as how easy it is to prejudge someone in the opposite direction as well, making you think more positively of them than they truly deserve. And it puts stress on the player as well &#x2013; you cannot take back your actions, so if you incorrectly present someone as a dangerous criminal, you can&#x2019;t fix it and have to live with the consequences.
<br>
<br>How humane the system is &#x2013; and who is in the right and wrong &#x2013; is a complicated question that the game ultimately doesn&#x2019;t answer for itself, but which the player answers via their actions throughout the game. Like &#x201C;The Lady or the Tiger&#x201D;, the way the player responds to the story really reflects as much on the player&#x2019;s own evaluation of humanity, and how they weigh the risks and benefits of a system like that. Rather than being preachy about how evil the system is, the game also shows why people might like a system like that and want it to be implemented. It is perhaps the most even-handed presentation of the subject matter I&#x2019;ve seen, and it achieves this by putting the player in the seat of someone who might be a part of such a system and showing just how ambiguous the system can be and how much power they wield, both how dangerous it can be if misused but how beneficial it can be if used appropriately.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orwell/user-reviews?user_review_id=7578189">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So who is it for? I guess that&apos;s the core question for an indie, niche production such as this so let&apos;s get right to it: Orwell is for the player looking for a contemplative, narrative-driven challenge that you can play on your own time. If you like unravelling a mystery carefully, if you like narrative driven games or if you really like surveying people, then this is definitely for you. Who&apos;s it not for? It&apos;s not for players looking for explosions, fast-paced action or who don&apos;t like to read. You read in this game, quite a lot. It&apos;s not like reading a novel but expect reading.

<br>In Orwell, you take on the role of an analyst who&apos;s trying to unravel a terrorist plot using the governments newest super-surveillance tool, Orwell. The system highlights &apos;datachunks&apos; in POIs internet activity, chat activity, phone activity, anything really, and it&apos;s your job to decide what information is pertinent and what isn&apos;t. You build files on suspects while you slowly expand the network of POIs and what you choose to include is what decides the &apos;system&apos;s&apos; attitude towards groups and individuals. Of course, the question soon beckons; should you be doing any of this?
<br>
<br>As the story moves forward, the player is confronted with many choices and they have real consequences for the story, not merely symbolic ones. Furthermore, while the system highlights important information, some decisions can only be made accurately through the players own memory and deductions from text pieces that at the time perhaps seemed inconsequential. It&apos;s a game that rewards the player for keeping up and thinking for themselves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orwell/user-reviews?user_review_id=7436033">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have played through a few chapters and was bored at that point.  The story does not develop.  You are spying on very boring people and there is no subtlety at all!
<br>
<br>Severely over hyped and pretentious!
<br>
<br>Very poorly programmed and NOT optimized...This little visual novel uses about 1.2GB of memory and takes forever to load a game (80 secs).  In fact, upon loading, its fake browser acts like a 14.4k modem.  All this game does is display images and text, so I cannot believe it takes as long as it does to load and uses THIS much memory.  I have built complicated business analytic solutions which process terabytes of data use less memory.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orwell/user-reviews?user_review_id=7575804">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>It was an enjoyable and unique game. It definitely makes you consider our current surveillance in the world and how it&apos;s all headed to exactly what George Orwell predicted in 1984. There is a LOT of reading, so if that is not your thing, then this game is absolutely not for you. I wish it had more replayability and I wish it was longer.</span>

Whilst some actions do have consequences, most players will just be uploading information as soon as it appears, especially in the early game. Whilst the game does probably think that it&apos;s cleverer than it actually is with its literal Orwellian references (see title) it does sometimes revel too much in its own sense of smugness over what the developers no doubt thought were biting social comments. Never-the-less, Orwell manages to provide a novel gameplay experience, enriched by the lengths the game goes to in order to immerse you in its story, like sending you emails in the real world. Worth checking out if only for the chance to see a different approach to storytelling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orwell/user-reviews?user_review_id=7473989">Expand</a></span>

Just feels like there could of been a little bit more there in terms of how it turns out or the impact you have. Worth a look though.</span>

<br>
<br>This may sound a little bit boring and, indeed, early on it is. At times, there are so many pieces of information involved that it almost feels grindy and overwhelming. However, the game does a great job at gradually raising the stakes, and towards the end, the tension and sense of urgency is almost unbearable.
<br>
<br>Overall, as far as story-driven detective games go, this one is pretty good, and the writing really pushes it over the top. Looking forward to see more from these guys.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/orwell/user-reviews?user_review_id=6881239">Expand</a></span>

I fell into a pit of four hours of a gaming non-stop. I couldn&apos;t stop till I had finished. I was engaged in the story and with the characters. Sure, they weren&apos;t perfect but if you think enough they are three dimensional, for the majority of the characters at least. It actually managed to evoke feelings. The first time around it hit me like a brick, what had I just done? Though i was just wanting to give data to help the program twists it into all sorts of things I didn&apos;t mean. I didn&apos;t want the game to end. I wanted the story to continue. I highly suspect the sequel isn&apos;t going to give me that closure I want.  My only compliant is the comments every single time I collected data, I just wanted a certain person to shut up so i can do my job without being interrupted. If there was a way to turn that off I would. Give me a short tutorial then let me go at it and make my choices without feeling like it was a never ending tutorial to the end where all your choices pretty much limit your choices. It also glitches sometimes depending on choices you made where you can&apos;t move forward, that is always so irritating. But it&apos;s worth buying and is very thought provoking. If you have any background in government or psychology it&apos;s really interesting and eye-opening.
