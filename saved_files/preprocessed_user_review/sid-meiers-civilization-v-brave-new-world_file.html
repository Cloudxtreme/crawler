For a hefty price of $30, Civilization V also gets a slight aesthetic refinement for the interface.
<br>
<br>One of my main complaints with Civilization V Gods and Kings was the amount of multiplayer bugs the game contained and how boring late game can get. With a recent patch, multiplayer actually runs much faster. From loading times to turn times, there was clearly optimizations for multiplayer. Late game is also a lot more interesting. Firaxis has completely retooled how Ideologies work, how the culture victory is obtained, and has reintroduced the World Congress (UN in Civ IV).
<br>
<br>Ideologies are now obtained by building three factories which signals the industrial era for your civilization, or reaching the Modern Era in the Technology tree. Ideologies now play a big part in civilization. From diplomatic relationships being strained, to unhappiness in your civilization, to revolution. It&#x2019;s entirely what the game was lacking, and this retooling of ideologies really adds depth to the late game. There tends to be a lot of bickering between the AI as a result, which leads to very interesting gameplay. My first game in Brave New World resulted in a world war. Something also noticeable is no longer does each political ideology have 5 social policies to adopt, but a dozen or more. In fact, each social policy gained from your specific ideology only grants one bonus, instead of several like in Gods and Kings.
<br>
<br>It requires significantly more culture to get all the benefits from a ideology tree, but this isn&#x2019;t a problem. It&#x2019;s very easy to obtain culture, with the addition of great writers/musicians/painters. All of which can create great works, which can bring in tourism from other civilizations. This leads into the new Culture victory, with the goal of being culturally influential to a specific number of civilizations. This is by far one of the best changes in the expansion.
<br>
<br>The World congress is a more in-depth UN from Civilization IV. You can enact trade embargoes, ban specific luxury resources, enact a world ideology or religion, or even ban nukes. Depending on how you tell your delegates to vote on a issue, can result in some hatred from other civilizations. I once was given the option of voting for a world fair, adopting a world religion, or abstaining my votes for that session of congress. I places all my delegates for the world fair, and as a result I got denounced by the majority of civilizations in the game. It was quite interesting to see who my friends were after that, and this is by far a great addition to Civilization V.
<br>
<br>Some other noteworthy additions is the inclusion of trade routes, which allows religious pressure, gold, science, food and production to be traded amongst your cities or other civilizations. Spies have the option of being a diplomat, which grants the same abilities only they do not steal technology and they can increase tourism to your cities via propaganda.
<br>
<br>Overall, the expansion is well worth the price. Most of the additions help late game, although features such as trade routes can help with early expansion. Brave new world also introduces the features very slowly, in such a pace that it&#x2019;s easy to quickly understand the new gameplay mechanics. This might be the best Civilization to date.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3273859">Expand</a></span>

This is a very good expansion and fans of the game should run forth to buy it to support their beloved developer. However I find $26 pretty rich in the ongoing saga of repairing a severely deficient experience. As another reviewer said: it&apos;s quite sad that Fireaxis and 2K made us go through two main DLC before we can have the feeling of what should have been Civilization V at start. I recommend holding off on playing the game till they finish it and bundle the whole thing as a single price title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3273526">Expand</a></span>

I was hoping this expansion would do something about that  it didn&apos;t. It really don&apos;t see what is so special about the content in this game. The trade function is nothing incredible, if you completely ignored it, it wouldn&apos;t make much difference I think. The art and music element is just absurdly poor, you get a little box to put in a little slot, do it the right way and that gives you slight cultural bonus of some sort but it doesn&apos;t feel like it adds any real meaning or enhances the gameplay. I played a couple of large custom games, bored me to death, I&apos;m positive I won&apos;t come back to this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3859488">Expand</a></span>

<br>Despite the fact that the world editor cannot be in-game, which is sort of disappointing, but it&apos;s the only down-side I like to mention.</span>

For those die-hard fans of the most current version this is certainly a worthwhile addition. More depth in the form new systems including risky trade routes, more expansive cultural victory play-style, more Civilizations and a rework of the policy tree all help round out an already well developed game. Surprisingly, the added systems do nothing to diminish those already in place, and aren&apos;t overwhelming for more casual players. Stubborn fans of the older Civilization incarnations will still find that the game strays from its predecessors but that is the intention and shouldn&apos;t be expected. If you&apos;re looking for some new tweaks and added depth to your Civilization V experience then that is what you&apos;ll get. The price is high, which is expected from past expansions and may be worth waiting for a sale if you&apos;re only a lukewarm fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3272600">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only downsides are dumped AI (as stupid as in previous game releases) and for me quite stupid time speed when later on you don&apos;t even have enough time to use new units, because before you ever use them you&apos;re ready to upgrade them again (but this again is not really fault of the expansion, but rather strange concept of original game).
<br>
<br>There are other things that were added (civs, wonders, techs...).
<br>
<br>Overall great expansion that almost makes CIV V new and without a doubt much better game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=4072522">Expand</a></span>

They must not have played Civ IV. It barely adds anything to civ, whereas it takes away about half of the tech tree AND diplomacy. WHY CAN&apos;T I SEE WHAT A RULER THINKS ABOUT ANOTHER CIVILIZATION. There are basic diplomatic necessities they&apos;ve completely removed from the game. I guess I&apos;m reviewing Civ 5 more than I am Brave New World, but Jesus Christ it&apos;s only worsened because the game basically came out in 2 different parts. At this point you&apos;d have to spend about 80 bucks to play Civilization in full. Sure, you can spend 30, and then get about half the civs, plus NO RELIGION. Civ 4 had religions, albeit much simpler than in Brave New World. Why the hell isn&apos;t that in Civ 5???
<br>Here are some other things they added to the glorious Civilization franchise: every unit can become amphibious now, God knows how, they just turn into boats and sail across a lake, cities can directly attack marauders (no more pillaging, sorry!), no stacking units (I could understand a unit stack cap, but only one per tile??? WHY? Now my entire army not only costs a massive amount of money, but I can&apos;t find a place to put the bloody thing). Seriously, if you&apos;re a Civ 4 player, can&apos;t you imagine how difficult it is to move EVERY SINGLE UNIT SEPARATELY IN AN ENTIRE ARMY. The game  sucks, I don&apos;t understand the reviews at this point. I&apos;m going back to Civ 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3642912">Expand</a></span>

The generalization that Gods &amp; Kings addressed the first half the game while Brave New World fixes the second half is somewhat true. The new civs also offer dramatically different play styles, which makes this expansion more than a mere evolution but less than a full sequel (say, Civ VI). Worth buying, 100%!</span>

<br>I&apos;ve been playing CIV games since I was 17 (from CIV I onwards)  and I feel like aside from few details,
<br>the game is the same (graphics dont count)
<br>If you haven&apos;t played CIV in a long  or never played, buy this one.
<br>Otherwise, I guess buying it on sale.</span>

                                        <span>Brave New World is definitely a contender for best PC game expansion of 2013. The expansion reinvents how culture works in Civilization V and offers more interesting gameplay when it comes to trading and diplomacy. The only real criticism you could make is that they should&apos;ve had these in the game in the first place! But that&apos;s just the way it is with Civ expansions isn&apos;t it? :)</span>

Aside from adding more Civilizations, wonders, buildings and units the game introduces some new mechanics that change the core experience greatly. The introduction of trade using merchants is an interesting addition that makes it easier to obtain large amounts of gold, gain science or to spread your religion among other civilizations. Diplomacy now has far more depth through the means of a congress system where you and other civilizations vote on issues that will drastically affect the game. It helps to be tactical with the voting because a certain affect may benefit you, but at the same time it may upset other civilizations and tarnish their relations with you and can even lead to war. The game also adds more great people such as great writers and musicians which can create great works for you and help to increase your culture output, aiding you in achieving a cultural victory. All these new additions are great and help to create a more tactical Civilization experience. This expansion is a must!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3829853">Expand</a></span>

Since buying BNW however, I find myself often, drifting to &#x201C;something more engaging,&#x201D; like Free Cell.  I am a little amazed that I seem almost alone in getting bored with BNW.
<br>Civilization is a great franchise and I&#x2019;d love to join the cheerleading team for BNW but can&#x2019;t.
<br>The source of my boredom appears almost trivial but it&#x2019;s killing the game for me.  So that I don&#x2019;t appear to overstate the case, I will put that up front before moving on to what I consider genuinely critical improvements to the game.
<br>As I read, I see that even huge maps are smaller in BNW than in previous iterations. The first effect is that in the dozen or so games I have started, I have been immediately hemmed in by other civs with barely room for strategic expansion, short of whipping together an army of warriors and archers and going on a do or die attack at the expense of measured cultural and scientific development. (I play Marathon/ Huge Map/ Abundant Resources).
<br>BNW&#x2019;s trend to fewer cities and smaller maps also appears to create issues for mid-game strategic resources.  I don&#x2019;t enjoy the nasty surprise of reaching Industrialization, (coal), Biology, (oil) or Electricity, (uranium) and finding no reasonable access to critical resources, possibly apart from declaring war on a &#x201C;friend.&#x201D;  (I completed Biology after circumnavigating every continent, exploring my own completely and found only three visible, onshore sources of oil  none in reasonable access,  requiring either that I forego Combustion, ie modern ships, planes, tanks,&#x201D; or mounting an overseas invasion with Industrial Revolution military resources).
<br>Thus, I haven&#x2019;t bothered to finish a single game of BNW.  I WANT the military option and while open to Diplomatic, Cultural or even Science Victory I don&#x2019;t want the choice forced upon me when faced with an exercise in futility acquiring strategic resources.
<br>This expansion has taken important steps, huge steps that are absolutely necessary for Civilization to achieve its full potential.
<br>The Cultural game with Great Writers and Great Musicians added to Great Artists, showcased in cultural edifices like the Louvre,  the &#x201C;architectural digs,&#x201D; and World&#x2019;s Fair all stand as clever enhancements to the cultural game.
<br>Diplomacy in previous iterations was plagued, either by pointless interruptions from other civs, &#x201C;trading&#x201D; on the ridiculous demands of other civs and finally the asinine Diplomatic Victory achieved through bribing city states in Civ 5 or G&amp;K). With the new World Council (like the old UN) and the potential for collective action the Diplomacy game in BNW has taken a long stride forward.
<br>The Science Victory, virtually unchanged since I started playing (Civ II) needs similar renovation.
<br>The key here is that while all these innovations are great, we are not there yet.
<br>I believe, Civilization will become fully evolved when the Diplomatic, Cultural and Science elements emerge into their own.  Each needs to become a stand-alone option with move and (especially) countermove, planning, strategic choices, flow, and the other factors adding to a great gaming experience. That is not the case now, they are textures and adjuncts. Nobody will buy Civilization on the strength of the evolving but  fledgling Cultural, Diplomatic and Science elements.
<br>Civilization needs to ensure that its &#x201C;new strengths&#x201D; are fully secure and stable before it drifts too far from its old strength. I hope for some patches to rebalance the game. I am looking for mods to see if I can still save this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3362895">Expand</a></span>

Also, the world congress has been added, so you can force all other civs to do what you want them to do, if you have enough delegates. Happiness has also been made more important.

Before, the game was always a slog once you started to get into more modern times.  There weren&apos;t many interesting things to build or compelling bonuses to acquire.  Not that the end game was terrible...more like, it peaked during the renaissance and after that, you just kept playing because you needed to win...it was ok, but not nearly as cool as the early empire building.
<br>
<br>BNW changes that, making late game diplomacy and &quot;ideological&quot; choices much more complex and relevant to the game.  If you are diplomatic enough, you can use your clout to pass &quot;UN&quot; style agreements that can really tilt the game in your favor!  Also, the new trade system is such a huge improvement!  You now get to make real choices about trade that have a large effect on your overall economy...before it was just &quot;build a road from A to B to make a trade route&quot;.  Now it&apos;s much more complex and interesting.
<br>
<br>This is far and away the best DLC I&apos;ve played for Civ V.  If I could give it an 11, I would.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3387945">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Now with G&amp;K and this, we have a full game worth a 9/10. &quot;-But you gave it a 8!&quot; &quot;-I know I know&quot;. I remove 1 point for this not being in the game in the first place. It was planned, so put it in the game from the beginning, and you&apos;ll earn my point.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not a huge fan of the Ideology system in offline mode, because you&apos;re pretty sure you&apos;ll have to change it if you&apos;re discovering it first, but it is a good end-game bonus.
<br>
<br>Conclusion : DLC system is crap, but full game is a success ! Try to get it all at a low price if you&apos;re new to it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=4294657">Expand</a></span>

<br>Civilization V has finally evolved into the form it had endeavored before expansions but failed  incredibly layered whilst simultaneously straightforward without intricate micromanagement or obfuscating design decisions.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: From a straightforward but shallow experience of the base, Civilization V BNW has expanded the entry into both depth and coherence  a very difficult feat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3293418">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>2K games participation with Valve in bilking preorder customers by putting the game on sale at a substantially reduced price immediately after release is shameful.  Their further thowing old Civ IV copies at those unhappy is insulting.

The new ruleset provides a whole new gaming dynamic that focuses less on war.  I have always tried for cultural diplomatic and science victories but found myself resorting to domination most of the time.  Fantastic game!  I won&apos;t even dock a point for the whole Steam preorder fiasco.</span>

<br>Strictly speaking BNW should have been the first expansion pack. Even if BNW is a good one, I cannot forget Firaxis milked us by releasing an incomplete game (vanilla Civ5) and asked us to pay up to fix what was initially broken.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3277196">Expand</a></span>

This expansion does to civ 5 what beyond the sword did to 4. It is a completely different game and the changes are phenomenal. The tourism and world congress are amazing, huge, changes that completely revolutionize the game and it&apos;s strategies. I was a level 7/8 difficulty player but I have had to ratchet it down to 5 and I&apos;m STILL losing about half my games just because the world congress and tourism effect the way game plays so much. It is the perfect expansion to the game and completes civ 5 (just like bts did to 4) into a masterpiece.  If you even slightly liked 5 you owe it to yourself to get this.
<br>
<br>The only downside is that I think most of the new civs are really uninteresting gameplay-wise. But that is entirely opinion based on how you like to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3276398">Expand</a></span>

From almost every angle, it delivers what it promised to deliver, which was more exciting late game gameplay. With the new culture system, the biggest overhaul in the game, you have to be more active about gaining culture, otherwise you might go 30 or so turns between adopting a policy. And with the new ideology system, that can really hurt.
<br>
<br>The ideology system allows for the player to choose between Freedom, Order and Autocracy. However, these are much more customizable than before, with each ideology going far above a normal social policy tree. Take my word for it, you&apos;re not going to want to skip out on culture.
<br>
<br>Trade routes are extremely well done. You can trade with other empires and spread your religion and gain gold and science, or trade within your empire to gain production and food. It&apos;s a near flawless system, and  it works extremely well.
<br>
<br>The world congress is a nice addition to the game. You can ban luxuries, nuclear weapons, embargo civs, start world projects such as the International Space Station and set a world religion or ideology. It can be an EXTREMELY strong diplomatic tool if used correctly, and if you get other civs to cooperate with you. Gain delegates (which act as votes) by hosting the congress, trading them with other civs, researching internet, and allying yourself with city states.
<br>
<br>The culture and diplomatic victories are much much more fun to win.
<br>
<br>Happiness is much harder to earn. The zoo replaces the theater, which only gives +2 happiness. The stadium also only gives +2 happiness. However, these are made up for by ideological tenets that grant extra happiness as well as several new policy trees (aesthetics and exploration) that can also help out with happiness. This makes keeping your empire happy in later eras FAR more difficult than it was before.

<br>The multiplayer UI, as well as the look of the general UI have been completely overhauled. These are some nice aesthetic touches that shouldn&apos;t go unnoticed. They finally replaced the theme song.
<br>
<br>There are some additional units and buildings added, not to mention the 9 new civs, of which Venice is my favorite, and the most unique. Venice cannot buy, capture or produce settlers in any manor. They cannot annex cities. The twist is that they get double the number of trade routes (really big deal) and they can take in city states with one of their unique units, a Merchant of Venice. Venice can purchase in their puppet states as another civ could in an annexed city. Their double trade routes can grant an amazing amount of gold per turn, to the point where I feel pathetic playing as another civ. This is a fun, different civ to play as.
<br>
<br>My only real complaint is that the AI is still extremely irrational. If you&apos;ve played civ before, you know what I mean. Getting angry for no reason, denouncing you for no reason, etc. That happens to have more effect now that there&apos;s the world congress.
<br>
<br>To sum it all up:
<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>New culture system rocks
<br>Trade routes are a welcome addition
<br>World congress is a pivotal tool not to be taken lightly
<br>Ideological tenets make your civ unique, each time you play, more so than before.
<br>New UI looks great.
<br>The 9 new civs are great to play as. My favorite is Venice.
<br>City states are more important.
<br>Overall late game is much better and more robust.
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>Expensive
<br>AI still sucks</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3275556">Expand</a></span>

The expansion didn&apos;t help this boredom much and it still felt a lot like the old game, and the biggest change I really saw was the trading. I wouldn&apos;t even call this a DLC, just a glorified &quot;patch&quot; they didn&apos;t add much to the game for it to be $30 honestly.</span>

On the Steam Holiday Sale I bought Civ V Gold + BNW, and I really like the new features in the game. This was my first time playing the Civilization series in years. When I first got into Civilization by buying Civ III I didn&apos;t know what to do, but I got the learning curve and I was able to go smoothly when I bought Civ V. Here&apos;s what I see here:
<br>
<br>-Culture and the cultural victory: Everything has been changed, and there&apos;s now an option to spread your culture to other civs and dominate everyone else. Great artists, writers and musicians can make masterpieces and can be placed in museums and other culture-related buildings. You can get matching bonuses such as if all the masterpieces belong to the same civilization, which brings in more culture.
<br>
<br>World Congress: You can make your own version of the UN in this expansion. Host cities for the World Games, pass embargoes, ban luxuries and even become world leader.
<br>
<br>Archaeology: Send archaeologists to investigate sites, and you can either turn into historical artifacts and place them into museums or build a landmark which increases culture.
<br>
<br>Trade routes: Build caravans and make money and science off of them, and spread your religion too.
<br>
<br>Policy Trees and Ideologies: There are two new policy trees in the game: Aesthetics, which enhances your civilization&apos;s ability to spread culture and Exploration, for overseas expansion and trade. Ideologies are also a brand new feature. Ideologies are almost to the end of the game, can can be used to enhance your civilization and gives you more bonuses with tenets.
<br>
<br>Overall It was worth the $15 (It was half off), the gameplay mechanics are stunning, it feels it&apos;s like how a Piplup evolves. BNW is the Empoleon!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3947498">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s really funny how you can have virtually no army, and if you get swarmed
<br>by the enemy, you can just build a few, and survive. In my previous game, I took
<br>out 20 cities using only six units, at the same tech level as my opponent.
<br>
<br>The problem is how amazingly stupid the AI is. It makes so many mistakes,
<br>which ruin the experience for me.
<br>
<br>Big tip if you want to take down an empire with six units, is having four landships, and two artillery units.
<br>With that you can annihilate your enemy with ease, if you make sure to retreat every now and then,
<br>to heal up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3376909">Expand</a></span>

While that may sound somewhat dry to the uninitiated, culture play in Civ 5 up until now was a very dry affair. You simply built as many cultural buildings as you could, and kept your empire as small as possible, and hoped to fill 5 trees with Policies (talents) before another Civ clenched victory.
<br>
<br>The culture changes really tie culture into the broader game. Furthermore, diplomacy is greatly improved. It&apos;s no longer just an issue of making friends with enough city-states to get votes. You can now combine city-state relationships with some good old fashioned bribes and threats.
<br>
<br>The one full game (difficulty level 5  King) that I was able to get through since release was as Dondolo&apos;s Venice. This is one of a handful of new Civs, and in this is probably the most interesting Civ yet. The racial bonus is the ability to acquire City-States with Great Merchants (called &quot;Merchants of Venice&quot;). Also, E Dondolo can only have ONE city plus puppets, though he has the special ability to make purchases through puppet cities (buying units and buildings with gold). Thanks to the new Caravan system I was able to amass an enormous fortune which I could use to quickly erect an army at any of my acquired city-states as needed.
<br>
<br>Interestingly, I actually won the game diplomatically by getting myself elected World Leader. I did this in a game with Alexander in it (he specialized in City-States) buy taking over his city state allies, thereby depriving him of all of his world council votes. Fun and interesting!
<br>
<br>When looked at as a whole, Brave New World finally makes Civ5 feel complete. The paths to victory outside of domination are far more interesting than they used to be. The game feels more dynamic. It may have been specific to my game, but it seemed to me that other Civs were more willing to engage in trade. Furthermore, it was fun to enact a trade embargo against Rome (the tyrant in this particular game).
<br>
<br>There are some minor complaints. For one, the UI from Civ5 could really use some tweaks, and BNW brought nothing new. Also, some of the new talents in the Freedom ideology were pointless, and although I was able to unlock the whole tree I felt like the last few points were wasted. No actual choice  if you have enough culture you can eventually buy them all. Also, some Civs were WAY too easy to bribe into voting me world leader. When I have a pile of 25,000 gold, it seems almost silly that Isabella was willing to vote me leader for 500.
<br>
<br>Overall though I am in love with this new expansion. I look forward to many more playthroughs and I will update my review accordingly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3275945">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Well I can honestly now say that this DLC expansion basically fixed that for me. It&apos;s DIFFERENT, definitely. It still has certain things I don&apos;t necessarily agree with such as the happiness system or  replacement of flexible civics in the form of rigid socal policies. But I can honestly say that it is now a very good game indeed on it&apos;s own merit. Perhaps the most accessible game that you could apply the terms &quot;Grand Strategy&quot; or &quot;4X&quot; to, it certainly lacks the cataclysmic depth of titles like Europa Universalis yet still keeps a veteran of the genre like me playing, that&apos;s gotta mean something </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3290982">Expand</a></span>

It must have been designed with the explicit goal of giving the player an ulcer. Sure it&apos;s feature-rich, but the gameplay itself is layer upon intricate layer of nuisance. You have to keep track of dozens of different factors and events at once and every possible way the game could be made more difficult has been done. All this makes Sid Meier&apos;s Civilization V: Brave New World, about as entertaining as trying to solve a Rubix Cube (with a broken elbow). Firaxis has sucked the fun out of the whole series. After playing more than 20 times and not having one enjoyable game, I think my ten-year fanship of Civilization is over.
<br>
<br>A precis:
<br>&#x2022; Firaxis powered the holy hell out of Barbarians. Expect to spend half the game fighting them off left, right, up and down, and for encampments to respawn exactly where you just cleared them, and to spin off a new Barbarian unit every two or three turns, it feels like.
<br>&#x2022; Firaxis changed most Social Policies, essentially making them complex and useless. If Social Policies were your security blanket for Happiness and Gold, get ready to tear your hair out.
<br>&#x2022; What the &apos;World Congress&apos; usually does is &apos;ban&apos; your luxuries one after another, devastating your Happiness and causing civil war.
<br>&#x2022; Firaxis has definitely made unit upkeep more expensive. After even a few units you&apos;ll find that deleting one saves 5-7 gold per turn. Ridiculous. Try to keep a good standing army for all these Barbarians and the highly arbitrary declarations of war, and you&apos;ll run a deep deficit, mess up your research and then find your units spontaneously disbanding.
<br>
<br>In short, this is a game you&apos;ll need to play for about 400 hours before you figure out how to have any fun. It&apos;s honestly just a way to stress yourself out. Now you know why there are walkthroughs the size of encyclopedias, instructional YouTube channels, and obsessive message boards all dedicated to gaming nerds who make it the object of their lives to beat Civ V. If you&apos;re not willing to make that commitment (which most normal human beings are not) throw the CD out the window and never buy a Civ installment again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=4128342">Expand</a></span>

Beyond the normal addition of civs, buildings and units, it completely revamps the cultural minigame (which was sorely in need of it), adds several new mechanics and fine tunes others.  Trading is far more realistic and in depth, with you needing to initiate and guard trade caravans to get their benefits.  Tourism is an interesting subcategory of culture.  Religion has some minor changes, such as new policies and beliefs, while espionage adds diplomats, a sort-of spy that doesn&apos;t steal tech but can watch and influence your neighbors in other ways.  All of it does an excellent job of bringing the different aspects of Civ into one complete package, where everything feels interesting, but nothing seems overpowered.  The only (minor) issues I have with BNW is that it doesn&apos;t really address the inherent flaws of the AI, and a lot of the mechanics feel like they&apos;re designed for larger games with many players.  If you play with 2-3 others you&apos;re probably going to miss out on some fun.  So, the burning question on everyone&apos;s mind is   whether or not Civ V now measures up to Civ IV: Beyond the Sword.  I was pretty hard on Civ V at release, and G&amp;K didn&apos;t really do much for me, but now, with all expansions, I can confidently say that Civ V lives up to it&apos;s predecessor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3273151">Expand</a></span>

If you can get it on sale, this is definitely worth picking up.</span>

Following in the footsteps of Gods and Kings, an expansion that did a pretty good job at expanding the early-to-middle game via religion, and an empire&apos;s worth of new features. Brave New World does not add as many small tweaks, but it adds and refines until Civ 5 is pretty much gold.
<br>
<br>The major thing that the expansion does is that it refines the peaceful methods of the game, culture and diplomacy. The expansion also adds trade routes, ideologies, and many other things that make the game excellent. The one complaint I have is that the American Civil War scenario removes much of the things that make Civ 5 great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=3391948">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Best Strategy game on PC. Played now for close to 600 hours. The new Culture Victory mechanics in Brave New World is fantastic and extremely clever.
<br>
<br>Civ 5 has always been a game that makes you think about what your opposition is upto behind the fog of war. Brave new World adds more to that intrigue. End game just got a lot more interesting.
<br>
<br>Reccomend this one for any TBS fans.</span>

                                        <span>This expansion makes the game incredible. It&apos;s sad that it seems that it takes the devs three versions of the game until they make it right, but if you can buy on sale then get all the DLC. I&apos;ve played over 500 hours of Civ V because it&apos;s just so relaxing. Experimenting with the many different civs and victories gives the player a lot to do for their money.</span>

<br>
<br>If you gave up on Civ 5 then this will turn it around for you.  If you have not bought Civ 5 then buy this with it or you will regret it later!</span>

<br>
<br>CONS: - Wars were never balanced &#x2013; Only 1 viable early game strategy &#x2013; City governors gone from this entry
<br>
<br>REVIEW: First things first: this game, as a whole (all the DLCs are required to make a single complete game so you won&#x2019;t find me reviewing other &#x201C;parts&#x201D; of CiV and if I were feeling petty I&apos;d take off points for this). Furthermore, as a sequel, this game can never stand truly apart from its predecessors; good and bad, it will always be compared. My personal favorite entry in this series was actually a player-made total conversion mod with more diversity of units for Civ IV called &#x201C;Fall From Heaven II&#x201D; so my review is actually best read in light of the complexity of that game, rather than any of the &#x201C;vanilla&#x201D; civ games of the past.
<br>
<br>The greatest strength of this game is that it has a larger and more active modding community than any other that I know of. Hate the AI? There are mods that try to address this (though no good ones I can immediately pinpoint for this expansion). Want another playable civ, rule tweaks or other maps? There are mods for these, too. What this means is that my rating for the base game could be different from your experience, depending on the mods you install. This game has the potential for some really thoughtful strategy elements (though like all strategy games it streamlines some things), such as putting citizens in just the right &#x201C;building specialist slot&#x201D;, forcing a city to work a particular hexagonal tile, stopping city growth to limit empire unhappiness and so forth. Most importantly for me, the wars are (somewhat) more intelligent than previously because you cannot stack units, so positioning units correctly for battle becomes more important than it was (although there is a mod that allows unit stacking if you are crying about this omission).
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, this does not mean that combat is actually very good (IMO war was always the worst part of the Civ series so an improvement does not save this poor mechanic). Now instead of bringing &#x201C;stacks of doom&#x201D; (where a huge number of units was more important than type or era) the AI will bring a &#x201C;carpet of doom&#x201D; (i.e. a swarm of units over many hexes) to try to kill you. However, the movement limitations of the new style usually wins and loses battles and the AI doesn&#x2019;t actually seem to understand this well. As a consequence a defending human-controlled range unit from a present or future era (vs the attacking unit) can dominate a much larger AI army. The closest thing any of the DLC&#x2019;s did to re-balance war was to give the units 100 hp so that minimum damage and healing rates could be influenced, which really doesn&#x2019;t do anything to make the AI more dangerous militarily-you&#x2019;ll mostly struggle when trying to take same-era cities with lots of defensive buildings, since the AI units will all die easily. Another problem is the lack of early game variety in strategies for success. Most players agree that there is one first tech to research and one first policy to adopt. Granted, things open up a lot after that, but it suggests that the earliest techs and policies are unbalanced. One thing that personally makes me crazy is the omission of city governors from previous games (they weren&#x2019;t perfect, but they were better than nothing). If you conquer an enemy city you can &#x201C;puppet&#x201D; it for a hands-off city that manages itself (although it will auto-build maintenance consuming buildings you don&#x2019;t need), but you cannot control which tiles it works or its growth rate. If there were a way to direct the computer to build only a certain type of building (e.g. only economic buildings only when available) large empires would be manageable; as it is having to choose every single building project makes empires of more than about 6+ cities unwieldy.
<br>
<br>Is this game fun? In my opinion it is, and there is plenty of fan-content to extend play. Am I pissed that the game was only partially finished until this DLC entry? Absolutely. You can bet that when Civ VI comes out (you know they won&#x2019;t be able to resist money for a sequel) I&#x2019;ll be waiting until the inevitable DLCs flesh out that game. In the meantime, CiV has finally matured enough to warrant purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=4282542">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you are going for Culture, you are at a major disadvantage...period. You have to out last everyone to nearly the very end with BnW.  Warmongers are at a bigger advantage and if you miss any key wonders you can kiss your culture good bye.
<br>
<br>It is not &quot;more challenging&quot; you never have any issue if you follow &quot;the formula&quot; it is just .... dull.
<br>Centuries of doing nothing. Literally nothing. Then you dig up some sites and hope for the best.
<br>
<br>It is not all bad.  The diverse cultural branches that you get MUCH LATER IN THE GAME are pretty cool and have some interesting bonus. To bad that as soon as you can, you just go Freedom and then buy the space race pieces you need with Gold while the other poor guy is still trying to scrape the culture together to win.
<br>
<br>Not a terrible expansion, but did not improve much on Gods And Kings imo.

The Ottomans speaks Turkish, The Aztecs speak Nahuatl, The British speak English, The Chinese speak Mandarin, etc.); New City-States which are smaller civs that you have to do favors for and if you ally with them they can give bonuses, units, resources, and go to war with you against your enemies, all of them have their own personalities which determine what kind of quests they give you, and they can act as buffer zones between you and other civilizations; can choose how many civs and city-states to play with and how large the map is(can delete city-states if you want); Deal with barbarians as always; New hex grid map that is better than the old square grid; can choose maps you want to play on (continents, archipelago, Pangaea, fractal(all 4 are prodecurely generated), or Earth with the same landmasses); 8 difficulties to choose from; Strategic resources are important to the game that can make new units, buildings, and also can be used for trade; Luxury resources are important for trade, gold, food, production, etc.); The cool Happiness system used for growing your empire; Can gain culture to adopt policies which give bonuses for what type of empire you want to have (Liberty is best for large empires, Honor best for military based empires, Rationalism best for science in empires, etc.) and can give great people to help with those policies; Use faith to create a pantheon of gods and then turn it into a religion(you can name your own religion); Gold used for trade, buying stuff, maintaining buildings and units, upgrading units etc.; Later in the game, the world congress starts and you can propose resolutions that can be voted on by you and other civs with delegates; Workers and Work Boats are used to make tile improvements(ex. workers can make farms, mines, quarries, etc. and work boats make fishing boats and oil rigs); Caravans and Cargo Ships are used to establish trade routes with other civs and city-states which increase gold and pressure religion to other cities; Units have increased movement on flatlands and decreased movement on marshes, hills, forests, jungles, and rivers; Can use spies to steal techs, uncover plots, and rig world congress elections; Can discover natural wonders which will give bonuses if in your borders; Can build world wonders use for huge upgrades in your civilization; No military unit stacking(adds more strategy on the battlefield); New ranged and and siege units that attack but don&apos;t get attacked back(ex. firing a catapult from a few tiles away, before it would attack like a regular melee unit face to face); Before battle the game will show you the outcome of the battle; Multiplayer functions; Beautiful Soundtrack with culture appropriate music for each civ and gets intense in wartime
<br>
<br>BAD: Scenarios are disappointing and force you to play the game a specific type of way like the Civil War scenario which is total war; There are a some missing civilizations in this game like where are the Sumerians, Khmer, or the Mali and that just names a few; A lot of times when I play, there is a bug that makes my mouse disappear which annoys the hell out of me
<br>
<br>FINAL VERDICT: This game back in 2010 is a 9/10, but this expansion in 2013 makes the game into a full 10/10! It adds so much and carries over the features from the previous expansion Gods and Kings. Civilization V: Brave New World is an ALL TIME LEGEND and is my favorite strategy game of all time!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=4369069">Expand</a></span>

If you have an audiobook running.  Get in Game of Thrones book 3 or maybe a Dresden files while playing Korea or some such and the game can work out.  But, what does it say that a person needs a book running to keep the entirety of their mind occupied here?
<br>
<br>Graphics don&apos;t make for a great game.  You need meat and complexity.
<br>
<br>Trade routes make sense.  That they can be pillaged also makes sense.  What doesn&apos;t make sense is you still can&apos;t trade technology.  Again, this reeks of the whiny crowd not liking other people getting a tech before them and then monopolizing the trade market  by trading it out before them.  Trading technology and having some exclusivity in these trades simply makes sense.
<br>
<br>Espionage still lacks depth.
<br>
<br>Religion lacks oomph.
<br>
<br>General and Admirals still don&apos;t do much, armies and navies not really there.
<br>
<br>Tourism adds but seems expensive social policy wise for the payout.  Producing archaeologists for +2.  Yay?  Yes, you can exploit this into more, but it still falls short.  Kind of lame as a &quot;win&quot; option, just like the science victory always was and still is.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m going as high as a 7 because with both expansions it&apos;s an alright thing to play alongside an audiobook.  Without the meat of a good book though, it&apos;s still a 5.  Bad form Fireaxis, you can do better, we&apos;ve seen you do better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=4283817">Expand</a></span>

The addition of trade routes is a game changer and when utilized correctly you can finally make tons of money which you can now quickly purchase units, buildings and land.  Range and siege units have been balanced so that they are now necessary and important in city attacks.  Espionage and more powerful civic choices in the late game make the final ages much more fun to play and can really help you decimate your leftover enemies.  I wish you could do a little more with spies then steal technology and rig elections, however.  The added resources are needed and fun.  The play styles of some of the new civs and their leaders are a blast to try.  A great well-rounded expansion that adds a ton of new elements to an already great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=5842444">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Civilization: Brave New World completes what is probably one of the most influential games I have ever played. Civilization V as a whole will always be what I consider my favorite strategy game and with Brave New World, I can happily say that every dollar of the $130 I spent on this game were very much worth it. From the new Ideologies to the expanded trade systems to the new Civs. This expansion really just made the game for me and for that, I will always hold the names Sid Meier and Firaxis to the highest reverence.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=4451850">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is much more polished and user friendly than Civ 4, and with all the add ons, it also has greath depth and replayability. Is it difficulty for newcomers? Well, if you ignore some parts, it is. And slowly, after hours, you get to know the other parts of the game. For example, I only started to mess around with tourism after 300h, and haven&apos;t done it much. But it is great! So there is a ton of potential hours still to go, especially with all the mods... God this game... It is no paradox complex game, but it is unique and so much fun.
<br>Should you not want to wait for the upcoming Civ 6, which should be less repetitive in the strategies ( I only play with 4-6 cities, always in Civ 5. Gets a bit dumn after some hundred hours, doesnt it?), you should get the complete edition. Sometimes its really cheap on Steam.
<br>Just buy it.
<br>Do it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=6686197">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The graphics are terrific, but I&apos;d prefer simpler graphics and a better a.i. It seems the only difference between the levels is that my units are not as strong as the computer&apos;s units and I cannot build as fast as the computer. That&apos;s not an interesting a.i. That&apos;s just muscle. Of course a stronger, faster producing enemy is harder to beat, but I can&apos;t enhance my production or strength. I can only try to outsmart the computer opponents. When I hit my head against a tree, I can&apos;t out-muscle the tree, and there&apos;s no way to use my head to out-think it. The tree/head competition is always going to go against the head as long as it&apos;s just a muscular competition.
<br>
<br>I am disappointed and frustrated by the time spent on glamor and the little time (no time) spent on improving the a.i.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-civilization-v-brave-new-world/user-reviews?user_review_id=4956105">Expand</a></span>
