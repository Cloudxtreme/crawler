<br>
<br>You can no longer import your hero.
<br>
<br>The battles have been reduced to a level of boringness (word or not, it works here) i didn`t previously think possible.
<br>
<br>Every map is the exact same rinse and repeat scenario of: take a low level hero with low level units and build them up only to have to start all over again once you complete the mission.......except with a different story each time. yay.
<br>
<br>Don`t buy it. Don`t even look at it. And if you feel the need to troll the crap out of Kalypso for releasing such an unfinished, unoriginal, and lackluster piece of **** as D3: tell them i sent you.
<br>
<br>And what appeared to be of purest silver turned suddenly to rust.

Beautiful artwork on the menus, decent hand-drawn backgrounds, might have you believe you are about to play a quality game. You might even start to believe it when you open up the build screen and see more pretty artwork and a selection of ways to improve your army and your minions. The crushing moment comes when you have your first battle and realize all you do is click on the bad guys... your creature comes up in to rotation, left click. That&apos;s it. That&apos;s the game. There is even an auto mode that saves you the problem of having to left click at all, you can just watch. And watch you will because there is no way to speed it up or exit the fight. You&apos;ll enjoy countless hours of watching your entire army get slaughtered, one tediously slow animation at a time. Or maybe your army will be super powerful and you still have sit and watch these painfully long boring battles; (where you do nothing remember?) because everything has over 9000hp and requires countless rounds to slowly whittle down 10 health bars. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve emphasized enough that the entire combat system consists of left clicking. Your dude hits for a set amount of damage be it range or melee and you can choose which enemy to attack. You can also move your units on a hex grid but there is usually no game benefit for doing so. There are no damage modifiers, or spells you can choose; you can&apos;t even directly heal units. Your only options are choosing movement or which enemy to attack, how is that even considered a game?<br><br>When you get to the part about upgrading your armies you can choose a few small trees of modifiers called buildings. Each one you own can have an effect on your armies, but there is nothing you can tangibly control during combat.<br><br>The bottom line is that this really isn&apos;t game. As a player playing a video game, I want to be able to make some sort of choices that affect the outcome. There are no meaningful choices in this game because you spend the majority of your time watching an automated process.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/disciples-iii-renaissance/user-reviews?user_review_id=1786324">Expand</a></span>

What a panning. There appears to be a great deal of comparison to HOMM 5, which, if you adore cartoon-like WOW-stylised graphics, may be more your taste. Scrap that - if you like that visual style, play &apos;Kings Bounty&apos;. Disciples 3 is a different animal - often gritty and beautiful, if busy, and takes risks by amending some gameplay elements (as opposed to HOMM 5 which retracts features and stagnates the formula). The battles are no more slow-paced than in HOMM or KB. It&apos;s recommended to switch the movement speeds up and turn off &apos;cinematic camera&apos;, which is twitchy. Indeed, there are translation issues and terrible dubbing, and the tutorials are confused. Slap-dash. However I doubt very much that the story was the reason we all played HOMM, or that many will care about tutorial implementation, and instead just jump into the main campaign. We play TBS&apos;s because of their &apos;just-one-more-turn&apos; addictive nature of game-play, which still remains here. To be clear - I award 10 as an effort in re-balancing. I would give 7 now and 9 when the Editor and the Dwarf &amp; Undead races are released. HOMM can&apos;t touch the visual flair of Disciples. I have encountered no technical issues with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/disciples-iii-renaissance/user-reviews?user_review_id=1393616">Expand</a></span>

<br>First bad news I read the inside descriptions of the box, turn by turn battles... I hope it won&apos;t be boring...
<br>Then I install it and after a very long wait, and a stunning 3D view of some falls as a menu... here comes a completely dull and stupid turn by turn adventure... have you tried counting your step during a whole day? here it&apos;s just like that, just image the hero may count it&apos;s steps when going to pee...
<br>But then, taking a deep breath and trying to go on... let&apos;s go to some castle (while the tutorial is bugging me with tutorial interface and video for explaining the interface) I think the developpers never thought about making a modern interface... but then I figure out the castle is just around 21 steps (3 turns) from the initial position... okay, middle mouse button to start spinning the so called 3D... conversation comes with a NPC... just to say it&apos;s just images and text... don&apos;t expect any immersion... I would rather read a book there... but you know what? BUG... no more mouse because the animation did not tolerate me using the interface while a conversation came to appear.
<br>After reading other critics I decide to get the game back to the reseller. END OF STORY</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/disciples-iii-renaissance/user-reviews?user_review_id=1371911">Expand</a></span>

The fighting system is in my opinion the best one in turn-based strategies. However  what holds it back is also the lack of mas to be used in both single and multiplayer, other games in this franchise had the abundance of them. There is also a serious flaw with the background being beautiful but not accessible. For this reason the game feels awfully scripted. The saving grace of this one is the combat system and the thematic world it is set  in  even if it&apos;s dulled). If you are not a fan of the series then you can definitely skip it but  if you like turn-based strategies or the Neveendar then it is worth at least some of your time. Disciples 3 is just one normal game with its own ste of flaws and advantages, nothing groundbreaking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/disciples-iii-renaissance/user-reviews?user_review_id=2967045">Expand</a></span>

Turn-based combat is, in my opinion, one of the worst ways to execute gameplay system. There have been two games I have enjoyed with gameplay like this. Final Fantasy and the first Paper Mario. But with those games, it had feel and story. This game lacks that. Sure, the graphics are pretty good, though lacking in optimization. When I launch the game, it crashes 95% of the time due to graphics. The story is MILDLY INTRIGUING. To have a game with such gameplay it needs to be a 100% solid and interesting story. The voice acting and other audio is atrocious. Now, I can&apos;t say I didn&apos;t completely hate this game. It wasn&apos;t to my fancy. But, again, I can see how some people can like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/disciples-iii-renaissance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3075859">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s really a fairly fun game right up until you finish the first zone and it hits you like a sack of bricks when you see that you &quot;start over&quot; each time you progress to the next area. And for this reason I finally offer up a rating. I just can&apos;t fathom this design decision. You create skill trees and spell books and buildings and a host of interesting units. And then you tell me that I can&apos;t play with them until I re-earn everything.
<br>
<br>Guess what? I don&apos;t want to move my stupid squire around the battlefield anymore, I&apos;m bored with him.
<br>
<br>So unless you honestly don&apos;t mind starting over every time you progress the story, I would pass this up. Had it not been for this single design decision I would gladly have given this game an 8+/10. It&apos;s just so demoralizing to have to play with the boring units all over each time.
<br>
<br>Imagine if you progressed to a McLaren in Gran Turismo and then you advance your career only to be told that you now have $10 again and have to drive a Sentra. The whole point of playing through the mundane part and leveling up your avatar/gear/etc is so you can have all the fun that comes with the new toys.
<br>
<br>Whatever, I can&apos;t get over it and because of that  it is once again, deleted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/disciples-iii-renaissance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3481194">Expand</a></span>

<br>Better take D2 and improve graphics, but it&apos;s HD now and much better then D3...
<br>Sorry for bad English...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/disciples-iii-renaissance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3877625">Expand</a></span>

<br>It is fun and well-paced combat, if you like the genre. The graphics are beautiful for its class. The narration audio is unfitting, I would turn it off though the story really isn&apos;t there-- but the voice acting makes it even worse. If you want enjoyable combat with nice animations it&apos;s a good game. If you want a great story and  a heavy strategic challenge, play something else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/disciples-iii-renaissance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3465329">Expand</a></span>
