<br>
<br>Sometimes, the simple mechanics of a puzzle are annoying, like the crane, where you have to keep rounding everyone up, or the wheel with the clothes. When you have to run up and down and all around to explore and figure out what you need to do is exasperating, but I would just tell my girls to look for things that might help them, and they would eventually get it.
<br>
<br>The guitar puzzle was fun for them. There was a long series of musical tunes to know, and after a long time and many mistakes, my girls finally got it and they were relieved and giggling.
<br>
<br>Once they have figured out a puzzle, my girls love to go back and &quot;solve&quot; that puzzle over and over again. This is easy to do with the saved steps in each saved game. It would be nice though to be able to name the saved games instead of trying to remember which one of the 4 games is whose.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not sure they appreciate how beautiful the game is, since it&apos;s their first puzzle/adventure game, but I love the looks of it and it&apos;s what persuaded me to buy it. I like that the story isn&apos;t too involved and you&apos;re just thrown into the search for Grandpa. It&apos;s a perfect game for kids.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lumino-city/user-reviews?user_review_id=4879917">Expand</a></span>

But what really drove me to keep playing was just the vast array of different art styles that were all so masterfully done in the game. For that alone it deserves a high rating.</span>
