I really had a blast playing this game. The story was engrosing and action non-stop. Above all, this game did what it was meant to do...ENTERTAIN. But playing this console port with a gamepad really is a must. I can understand why people are frustrated with the lack of mouse aiming and there is a mouse mod out there, but even so I have avoided it and played with a pad. I feel it may have made gameplay too easy with mouse aiming and tedious to play like the House of the Dead games on the PC. The pad proves quite vital for the essential dodging that you have to do too. What&apos;s more, RE4 is budget priced and together with a decent gamepad costs not much more than a full priced game...and that pad might come in handy for other games in your collection too! Even so, aiming is a little too sensitive with the pad and I don&apos;t know how it compares to the console versions, but it is a heck of a lot easier than playing with the keyboard. Graphically, it may not compare with the latest PC shooters, but they were atmospheric, everything moved nicely. And of course remember to add the patch for full effects ( the US version comes already patched) The game runs stable and the resolution CAN be altered. Unfortunately the cut scenes are low-res and not real time like the GC version. All in all, this is a great action game with good repeat play potential and what with the extras theres a lot of content to play through. If you don&apos;t have a gamepad and don&apos;t intend to buy one, then you might want to avoid RE4. If you do, this game is a joy to play. Thanks UbiSoft and Capcom for bringing this console classic to the PC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=399327">Expand</a></span>

Sound and visuals contribute a lot to a feeling of immersion. Graphics are a bit outdated. The original was build in 2004 and it shows. Stil it is very beautiful and the simplistic textures don&apos;t spoil anything. The sound isn&apos;t always placed in the right spot. Sometimes you hear someone who is already somwere else. Just minor bugs. Controls are a bit tedious. I use a gamepad but movement isn&apos;t analog. The joystick has one speed for running and for turning. The analog controls are there cause when you are aiming you can control the speed of the gun. But I don&apos;t feel very comfortable with it. After a while you get used but it isn&apos;t the strong point of the game. One strong point are the opponants. There are a lot of strange creatures that require different tactics to oppose. I remember battling a slow, blind man who swings large sharp blades in a cramped room! The other strong point is the environment. I found the finest creepy graveyard I ever met in a game. Buildings often have beautiful interiors (ugly&apos;s also). In the beginning of the game I just walked through a nice village with some peasants at work ... Looked very nice and peacefull at first. If you want to know what happens next than you should try it for yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=398703">Expand</a></span>

What with the light brown barrels and everything else GREY. 3. Cutscenes! Horrible FMVs with the crappest quality! But, then again, most of this can be fixed! MouseAim Patch: CHECK GameCube Graphics Patch: CHECK FMV Into In-Game Graphics: NO CHECK :( And no zombies! Isn&apos;t this what RE is all about? I mean, keep the new Camera Angle and Aiming (Not just UP, LEVEL, DOWN !!!) but make it a zombie game! This game is definatly more Action than Horror/Adventure. But all in all, given the Added extras, and mods, 8/10 is a sufficient rating. Good work Capcom, But Resident Evil 2 was just soo much better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=415989">Expand</a></span>

I had this game on GC &amp; would give that version a perfect 10. The PC version loses only one point from me, because yes I guess people do want a mouse control option, which it oddly lacks, and the graphics technically could be better. Having said that, it works beautifully with a gamepad (I use an XBox 360 controller) and the graphics are definitely superior to the GC &amp; any other console version of the game. They give you almost no gfx options to play around with (other than resolution basically) but as I said I think it looks significantly better than the very nice-looking GC version, and runs very well on my year-old, now mid-spec PC. Never slows down, loads very quickly &amp; everything looks crisper than it did on GC. In summary I&apos;m just confused why both the critics &amp; fans are generally slating this excellent PC game. People who haven&apos;t played / owned this on a console really should not overlook this very good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=398052">Expand</a></span>

Surprised at how many people are bashing this game thanks to a few minor (albeit inexcusable) mistakes on Ubisoft / Capcom&apos;s part. The dark texture issue has been resolved with a patch. Textures as a whole are pretty muddy, but not bad enough to send me running for the hills. The resolution is completely acceptable at 1024 x 768. Sound could be better, but does the job. And the biggest issue, the control scheme, is certainly aggravating at times (have fun aiming with the wasd keys as opposed to a proper analog device) but still acceptable. Played all the way through, and had a phenomenal time experiencing RE4 all over again on the PC. I feel that people are rating this game based on what Ubisoft could have / should have done with the port, and that&apos;s a shame, as it might scare away some PC owners from experiencing one of the best games ever made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=398044">Expand</a></span>

The characters are some of the cheesiest, corniest and lamest ive ever witnessed in a game, such awful dialogue. The graphics were terrible, missing many effects that completely detracted from the overall experience and no mouse support? Terrible, just terrible.</span>

Easily one of the best games of the past decade. A lot of people hate the PC version for the controls and the lack of mouse support. For me the controls add the much needed difficulty, that today&apos;s games are lacking (few exceptions of course). Mastering the gameplay and completing the story in professional mode for the first time was incredibly rewarding. I can&apos;t compare it to other versions, since I haven&apos;t played them, but I would still choose the PC version because I think it&apos;s the ultimate hardcore gaming experience (since then I played it with a controller too, but I still like to play it with keyboard as well). I also like aspects, like you can&apos;t move when you shoot and the realistic aiming. The level design is great, to be able to find the most efficient strategy against the monsters, takes a great deal of patience and trials. Needs a deeper understanding of how they work in their environment and you have to learn exactly where they are come from and how many of them in each level. This way you can learn, which kind of ammunition needs to be saved up for certain parts. The presentation is also great, with the eerie settings, chilling soundtrack and memorable and scary enemies. The story is not really special, but somehow it&apos;s very engaging and long too. This is the perfect TPS and a gaming experience that shouldn&apos;t be missed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=3016351">Expand</a></span>

Once the series made it to RE2, Capcom of course released RE 3, which wasn&apos;t hated... but it was boring. Which is probably the worst insult you can give to a video game. At least if you hate something you are mad because you wanted something else or something more. It was clear to Capcom that just using the original formula of survival horror wasn&apos;t going to work for RE4. This is where everything changed for the series, and quite dramatically, not minor.
<br>
<br>It was the first time ammo conservation was too easy, especially for a seasoned RE player. The voice acting in this one was quite bad, considering how it was their first triple A release. The Spanish characters speak using some generic English accent and often say &apos;bloke&apos;, which is an Australian term. According to Americans, all people outside of America (Capcom&apos;s translation team) are a conglomerate of random things merely outside of America.I  get that the voice acting in RE1 was horrible, but the funding was very low and it was a game from 1996, not 2005.
<br>
<br>The game was far from scary as it was trying too hard to entertain. Seeing &quot;zombies&quot; place traps and pick up chainsaws turned the initial (and anticipated) opening experience from bread and butter zombie fighting to just silly, over-the-top, juvenile attempts at horror. As the game progressed on, it shifted into an even worse, bad, pre-juvenille Halloween scare-show that your parents would take you to. Every monster was trying too hard to scare you, and that just defeated the purpose immediately. What made the originally RE games scary was the remote feeling of being left behind with zombies, not on some kind of freak show where monsters from every bad 80&apos;s movie keep calling you over to look at them like an attention starved drama queen.
<br>
<br>And the I think the worst insult I can give this game is that it was BORING. I couldn&apos;t bring myself to play it after 10 hours or so. Capcom just took a giant dookie on this game, and copied the same crap that Konami was doing for Resident Evil (&quot;epic&quot; boss fights against giants, cinema like cut scenes which make no sense in a survival horror game). It was Capcom&apos;s all out attempt to re-make a game that was amazing when it first came out and when challanged with making something new and good again they failed both times. First with RE:3, which was just a boring, hastily put together copy of RE:2, and then with RE:4 which was just a re-done franchise and almost near copy of every  generic PS2 action game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=4493947">Expand</a></span>

That and having trouble seeing past my character, not being able to turn very quickly, aim and move at the same time, and not being able to strafe. I don&apos;t mind some of the bad textures and transitions. What I care about is control, and this game simply does not give me that.</span>

I played maybe 30 minutes and got so frustrated I had to alt-f4. You have to actually make an effort to simultaneously run/walk and turn towards your desired direction; you can&apos;t turn around quickly enough to target a surprise enemy; targetting an enemy is a dreadful process. When you&apos;re trying to aim at something it sort of feels like the main character suffers from epilepsy: your weapon&apos;s laser keeps wobbling about like it&apos;s hell-bent on getting you killed. I tried with both and XBOX 360 controller and keyboard/mouse. Same result.
<br>This game really needed an auto-target function.
<br>It reminds me of how slow the combat mechanism was for Silent Hill 2 for the PC when I tried playing it, though these are definitely worse.
<br>There&apos;s something wrong with a supposedly horror game when most of your distress can be attributed to you not being able to get your character to do what you want them to do when you want them to do it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=80171">Expand</a></span>

To say I&apos;m disappointed is a massive understatement. This is a truly horrendous port from the gamecube, indeed it is the worst port I&apos;ve EVER played. Basically what you have here is a 1st person shooter without mouse compatability. Aiming weapons is impossible with any degree of accuracy and so the game falls flat at the very first hurdle. Another complete stinker in gameplay terms is the interactive cutscenes where you are urged on screen to press certain buttons at certain times. All well and good until you realize the developers haven&apos;t bothered changing the on screen commands to relate to the pc. SO now when you see &quot;press 1 and 2&quot; it really means &quot;enter and space&quot;. Its just lazy and sloppy development and results in you spending fifteen minutes at each cutscene guessing which buttons you should press. For all the games plaability issues you would think it at least has awesome graphics. It looked pretty good on the gamecube 2 years ago so you would think that would have been improved a lot for the pc. Oh dear oh dear oh dear. The pc version looks WORSE than the original! Texture are lame and choppy, with no option to change the resolution at all and the whole game in general is far too bright, killing any atmosphere. Even basic things like mist and fog elements whch were in the original have been dropped for this, leaving comedy moments were enemies, instead of running off into the fog, simply disappear into mid-air. To sum up this is a horrible port with absolutely no regards to pc players whatsoever and should be thoroughly ignored. If you MUST play this game, and believe me, it is an excellent console game, you&apos;d be better advised to buy a second hand Gamecube with it than waste your money on this dross.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=397155">Expand</a></span>

The camera angles are horrible...a third of the screen is permanently occupied by your character&apos;s shoulders. There is no mouse support, either, because apparently it would make the game too easy. It doesn&apos;t have the action of F.E.A.R., the atmosphere of Silent Hill, or the heart-pounding suspense of Splinter Cell and Thief.

However this port is just plain painful to play. For someone like me who has played the original versions, I was disgusted at what Ubisoft has done to my precious RE4. Not only having the prerendered cut scenes from the ps2 version which mind you were only there because of the ps2s limited hardware, but the dynamic lighting and the shaders seemed to have been lost in translation to the pc leaving everything with a strange white glow that especially in the later levels will make your eyeballs hurt. Coupled with the absense of mouse aiming that should be standard with any computer game hell even the pc version of the godfather had mouse aiming and the lack of vibration support which is just plain a bad move, esspecilly since anyone daring enough to risk their eyesight to play this game will be using a joystick adds up to a game that you should much rather burn than play. If you must play resident evil hop on amazon.com and pick up a Gamecube for $99.99 then get Resident Evil 4 for $18.99. Its almost depressing that a game that is is more than worth the aforementioned $118.98 to play could turn into a game nowhere near worth the fifty dollars they charge just by going through the ubisoft development center, which is causing me to fear for some of my favorite franchises such as Splinter Cell or Rayman. My only hopes is the reason why Capcom payed so little attention to those crazy europians at Ubisoft is because they are putting full force towards Resident Evil five. Bottom line is after reading this instead of buying this game promptly beat yourself over the head with the closest blunt object you can find then buy the Gamecube or PS2 or even the Wii version, I havent even seen the Wii version but aiming with the Wiimote would be a major improvment over anything this crap wagon can offer. And after you buy and enjoy RE4 like you should and want to see what you narrowly avoided, just dig up an old rabbit ear tv and cover the screen with tracing paper and laugh and feel relived that you did not loose fifty bucks to see it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=397202">Expand</a></span>

If they dont want mouse support, then, at least allow full configuration of the controls.</span>

In Silent Hill 2,3 and 4 you can walk/run and shoot depending on the weapon - so dont tell me it is because RE4 is a console game - the 3rd Person view is very disturbing, normally i always prefer 3rd person view to 1rst person view, maybe it is the distance or the elevation angle but i cant see sh.t ( games with better 3dprs. view are: Silen Hill 1-4, Max Payne 1-2, gothic I-III ....).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=400199">Expand</a></span>

Capcom continues to crap out unoptimized ports for the PC and wondering why nobody buys their games. Resident Evil 4 is one of my all-time favorite Playstation 2 games - good graphics, decent controls (for the PS2), less cheesy dialogue, and a great gameplay mechanic. Simply one of the best &quot;survival horror&quot; games around. This game had great potential on the PC, if they had implemented high graphics resolutions and color-depth, sound improvements like EAX, and given it a mouse-driven control scheme. Instead, they did texture conversions that make everything look repetitive, dull and washed-out; you need to configure a gamepad, or fight with keyboard controls for their headscratching decision to make almost all actions require two buttons/keys pressed, as in aiming with one button, and shooting with another. Why not change the game enough to use &quot;Quake Keys&quot; (WASD) and a mouse? Beyond your programming abilities, Capcom? The game is fun, to be sure, but it could have been superior on the PC, and it could have sold a good number of copies. As it is, it joins the long line of craptastic Capcom hack-jobs, all of which will only remembered for how poor they were. And finally, the game is renamed from Resident Evil 4 to Biohazard 4. Nevermind the fact that there are no Biohazards 1-3, but there were two other crappy ports of Resident Evil 2&amp;3 for the PC. This only confirms that Capcom is sloppy and hoping to sling its titles out for PC gamers who knew the games from console systems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=397497">Expand</a></span>

Resident Evil 4 on PC, is just like copying the Gamecube version, and putting in the PC, with the same controls tutorial, where in PC the controls are showed from Gamecube controls. Still, fun and addictive. 69 out of 100</span>

                                        <span>This game is fantastic. It seems like all I hear on reviews about the PC port is how much it sucks compared to a console, but really it isn&apos;t that bad. Sure it might take some getting used to, and the controls are a bit lacking but I learned it and it soon became second nature. That aside, it is one of the greatest games I&apos;ve ever played. It is very immersive and it&apos;s hard to put it down.</span>

Luckily I didn&apos;t because it turned out to be quite an enjoyable game. After you get used to the problems.
<br>
<br>So starting with the bad. The controls are awful - I mean they are in a classic resident evil style but somehow I expected it to be better. It&apos;s not that old of a game now. The camera is all over the place and the fact that it&apos;s moving independently from the movement makes it really frustrating at first. On top of that there is no strafing, meaning that dodging or avoiding enemies is a nightmare. And you can&apos;t shoot while walking.
<br>
<br>To top that off just after the intro you encounter one of the most difficult levels in the entire game. You&apos;re stuck with just your gun and a horde of &quot;zombies&quot; going after you which you have to hold off for a certain amount of time. Definitely not an easy task to do.
<br>
<br>But it gets better and once you get used to the controls and how to handle everything the game actually starts being enjoyable.
<br>
<br>The story is not worth mentioning because it&apos;s rather silly. You are a bodyguard trying to find the presidents daughter in assume what is Italy. You follow the rumours that&apos;s she is in a remote village. You go in. And you get to fight off hordes of zombies and monsters to save her. Well, not technically zombies but close enough. That&apos;s the whole story - silly but does the job.
<br>
<br>The level design is really nice. The enemies are varied enough to enjoy and the whole campaign feels just right in the length. There is always a sensation of you running out of ammo which makes you save it all up and use different weapons on different occasions. Apart from wonky controls and lack of ability to walk and shout, and strafing the combat feels nice and tactical.
<br>
<br>There is a problem where you can skip a very important item once or twice that makes the game extremely harder but having learned two hours later I was really not happy to re-do the whole thing and I pushed on. The ammo got even scarcer but I managed to get through it which gave me even more satisfaction. The game is hard on times but it&apos;s fair.
<br>
<br>Overall I really enjoyed it and I&apos;m glad I stuck out the first part out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resident-evil-4/user-reviews?user_review_id=6505177">Expand</a></span>
