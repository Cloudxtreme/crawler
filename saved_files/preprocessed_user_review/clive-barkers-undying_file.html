It is sad that it didn&apos;t receive the attention need because of poor advertisement, bad trailer and bad release dad, Valentine&apos;s Day and lets not forget other problems that happened in 2001, Undying is not a Holy Grail of Horror Games, locked away, forgotten even by EA Games, but once you find it you will love it, this games deserves that Multiplayer patch, deserves a sequel but most of all it deserves a HD remake, the same game only with better graphics, glitches and problems solved and it will be just perfect. While EA is giving us more futuristic space horror with Dead Space, they should try and give us some vintage games, players won&apos;t mind it, nobody minds Amnesia.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-undying/user-reviews?user_review_id=2946540">Expand</a></span>

A chilling atmosphere, haunting sounds and great dialogue all work together to make the hairs on your neck stand up.  The gameplay while navigating the corridors of the mansion are intense and frightening.  You&apos;re never quite sure when a Howler is gonna jump at you.  This horror concept has been done to death by now, but back in 2001 this was revolutionary and pants-filling stuff.  The game begins to suffer when you face human (or humanoid, in the last level) opponents.  The game becomes a much more predictable and standard shooter.  The humans don&apos;t spring from the shadows with a growl and a flash of claws.  They just kinda run at you until you shoot them. Yawn.  While the gameplay suffers during these levels, the atmosphere and writing remain top-notch.  I recently (2011-2012) replayed this title and was pleased at how well it has aged.

After all it was the end of the golden late 90&apos;s era of videogames, ridiculously good (and sometimes bad) titles were coming out left and right.  However, Clive Barker&apos;s Undying could&apos;ve had any box art or title it wanted, it was just one of those examples of how well an actual videogame can look, play, sound and &quot;be&quot;.  Even compared to the seminal Medal of Honor Allied Assault, which though equally brilliant and great when compared to Undying, it wasn&apos;t exactly as original.  So surprisingly original is Undying that its a little hard to believe more people don&apos;t talk about it, especially those that took the mechanics from it, ripped them like appendages off a lifeless corpse, then sewed them together into their games and pretended it never happened.  Well it did.  Bioshock wouldn&apos;t have been the game it was without Undying, same as anything else that &quot;borrows&quot; similar gameplay mechanics as well, but I&apos;m getting a little off topic here.  In the game you play as a real Irish-man Patrick, a man who has unfortunately been drawn into occult rituals, is able to use often spooky magical abilities without much explanation at all, and holds his pistol in his left hand- Single-handedly pissing off right handed players everywhere.  Now Patrick has decided to take his sweet time getting back to an old pal of his, (and if I were him I think I&apos;d know why) but he owes him a favor from many years ago as we are informed during the introduction- whilst Patrick takes a boat over to a rather large island where Jeremiah&apos;s mansion is located.  Upon entering the mansion that is only a smaller portion of Jeremiah&apos;s estate, its fairly obvious some bad juju is afoot and you are there to find out why.  Throughout the island you will fight all sorts of strange beasts, ghosts, demon&apos;s and accursed creatures.  You&apos;ll also have a lot of fun killing them with the wonderful assortment of weapons, spells and items you&apos;ll be finding as well.  I don&apos;t remember the last time a game had such a fun arsenal, not since Half life 1 at least.  You will gain new spells, unlock secrets, gain amplifiers to &quot;level up&quot; spells even and locate journals that expand upon whats going on as their isn&apos;t really much of a narrative after the beginning of the game.  In fact, it is highly recommended that you actually read what&apos;s going on, since its immensely well written for one, and for two- its going to make the story flow a lot better as you get close to the end.  Undying does just about everything right, from its level design, to its weapon design, enemy design, sound design and general aesthetics.  Its very hard to this day to find a game that possesses the kind of ambiance, tension and revolutionary game play all wrapped together with a great story and impressive dialogue.  It still bugs me that hardly anyone has played the damn game though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-undying/user-reviews?user_review_id=4172918">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story is well written and is typical Clive Barker.
<br>Its dark, its scary and it got a nasty twist.
<br>
<br>Its a horror show and the many eastereggs and hints you get in the game using your wits or your &quot;inner eye skill&quot; gives a huge amount of lore and content.
<br>
<br>I still remember to this day when i Scryed the full family photo of the coventant family and saw the &quot;truth&quot;.
<br>
<br>As a story game this is a clear 10 but the gameplay is suprisingly clever as well. There is a XP system that works great, and if you find allot of secrets and really dig into the game. you find yourself feeling pretty powerful by the end of the game and its satisfactory to really slaughter the enemies that killed you allot in the start.
<br>
<br>Since combat is fun, and there is always new scripted evens, it never gets boring using the &quot;overpowered&quot; melee weapon you will get , to really ravage the enemies. or use on of your many spells to ressurect fallen enemeies or blast them apart with living skulls.
<br>
<br>All in All, if you are a fan of games, Clive Barkers Undying will be worth 10 times what you will most likely pay for it.
<br>
<br>Buy this game, it will blow your mind</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-undying/user-reviews?user_review_id=5098526">Expand</a></span>

But it begins to lose it very early on when the player steps through a doorway in the house and ends up in another dimension. It&apos;s somewhat frustrating that this doesn&apos;t receive any reaction from Patrick Galloway who doesn&apos;t mention this to anyone when he returns back to the house. Later he creates a portal to the past and though this trip equips him with a key weapon, he didn&apos;t know this when he created it, so what was his motivation? The scrye spell was used well in the beginning of the game, revealing ghostly images and memories, but by the end of the game it hardly comes into play, and the game itself seems to forget that it is supposed to be a horror game when you reach &apos;Eternal Autumn&apos;. Scrying was also quite a wasted instrument, for instead of showing ghostly reinactments and memories that could have illuminated the game&apos;s back story and presented horrific scenes and images, instead its mostly used to show the ghosts of dead monks standing around an old cathedral doing nothing. This gets old after the 20th time. The game&apos;s story telling mechanisms are unfortunately bad. Apart from a few cutscenes and conversations, the story is almost completely told from diary entries. This is unfortunate if you&apos;re not in the mood for reading over dozens of entries or you just haven&apos;t picked up information that provides key details. Some of the boss characters I encountered, such as Otto Keisinger, were a complete mystery. I had no idea who I was fighting, even though he and Patrick seemed to know each. Though a few of the diary entries provide some information on him, I just didn&apos;t understand where he fit into the story or what his plans were. Maybe I couldn&apos;t find one of those key diary entries that provided this info. Some of the characters are poorly developed, particularly Bethany, who really is the least memorable character. The game even fails to provide details on the key antagonist, The Undead King, who is mentioned all the way through, yet we never know anything about him. What Patrick needed was another key character to interact with so that some of the crucial plot twists and details could have been told in cutscenes, which would have been more dramatic and memorable than scribblings on a scrap of paper. Overall, it&apos;s a good game but it could have been great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/clive-barkers-undying/user-reviews?user_review_id=85148">Expand</a></span>

Hint *Some of you might wanna put your two cents in as well to them :)* Hell, they can&apos;t think it wouldn&apos;t be a good game to redo! It would put them on the map both for, having the balls to actually remake a classic, and if done correctly, being THE best Horror game ever made. PERIOD!! What do you say folks?

It is a real gem that waits to see the sunlight. A real pleasure to play it, especially when you get tired of too much AAA s**t and want to see how a good game should be. What are you waiting for, EA?</span>
