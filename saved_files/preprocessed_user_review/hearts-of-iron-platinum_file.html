Yet, it is not a slavish servant of history and, thereby, can serve as a teacher as well as a toy. As the U.S., I spent from 1936 to 1941 convincing Japan to remain neutral and to become a democracy so that when the inevitable war in Europe came my way, I would be fighting a one-front war. Imagine my shock, anger and dismay when Japan, In April of 1942, attacked me for the sole purpose of seizing Guam and securing the only territory that I possessed within striking distance of the Home Islands. Having acheived this limited goal, she immediately sued for peace to keep her new gains. I felt much of the anger and betrayal that America must have felt on December 8th 1941 and refused to make peace.... I got to live a bit of WWII without being in the trenches.
