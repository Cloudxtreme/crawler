The world isn&apos;t stale like you find in many other MMOs.  I&apos;ve routinely had a goal in mind and been pulled into the world events.  I am a casual player and I like it a lot more than WoW.  I always hate to make that comparison, but it needs to be made.  The only downside I can specify right now is that the server gets laggy during larger events.  However, I suppose this will be refined as this game develops.  There are a lot of people playing which is a plus and most seem to really like the game.  I&apos;d also like to state that the game seems to be quite a bit more challenging on the PvE side of the fence which I personally like.  Overall this game is quite impressive.  A must buy for any MMO fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1489130">Expand</a></span>

It takes the best of those games and combines them into a highly-polished package. The multi-soul system is an improvement on WoW&apos;s talent tree; rifts themselves are an improvement on WAR&apos;s public quests. It has its completely unique features as well; rifts can spawn zone-wide invasions which require players to fight off hordes of monsters from other planes. Above all, though, Rift is polished to a level above any MMO released in years. All of the features you expect are here, and they&apos;re all well-executed. There&apos;s an auction house; public grouping; guilds (with advancement); even twitter integration. The client is stable and performs well, even during zone-wide invasions with hundreds of nearby players and monsters. The servers have been extremely stable during beta and head-start.<br><br>Not everyone is going to love Rift or abandon their current MMO. But if you&apos;re tired of WoW or disappointed by Warhammer, there&apos;s a good chance Rift has what you&apos;re looking for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1489064">Expand</a></span>

Servers have been smooth. Updates were done when necessary, addressing issues reported as soon as possible. Leveling has been interesting, although traditional and linear. Graphics look great even on my old computer. Quite a lot of people are playing it, so no shortage of players. However, three things really stood out. First, the whole class system is truly a work of genius. I love how I can mix and match my souls to experiment with different specs. There is no cookie-cutter build, and the strength of a character is determined by the skills of a player, not by whether she or he avidly followed someone else&apos;s guideline. Two, there&apos;s always something to do in the game. The game is so dynamic, having rifts and invasions all over different zones, not to mention Warfronts (PvP Battleground), challenging instances, and raids (which I&apos;ve not been able to try yet). You have the sense of actually getting involved in this imaginary world. Third, last but not least, it is fun. It&apos;s difficult to pinpoint and state exactly why it is fun, but, trust me, it is so much fun. The game definitely has great and lasting value for its price, so I suggest you run into Rift and try it out now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1489092">Expand</a></span>

The rifts and invasions are the most fun I&apos;ve had in practically any other MMO I&apos;ve played. GREAT co-op! Beautiful, addicting, easy to play, AWESOME! Play this game or else you&apos;ll always suck.</span>

I have been doing mostly warfronts, fighting rifts and dungeons. It is nonstop action. Lots of people to group with. Game has just launched, but everything is working smoothly. The questing does not feel like grinding, there is a good mix of stuff to do. The graphics are amazing. I&apos;ve tried 3 different specs for healing on my cleric already and they are all different but fun in their own way. I got the digital deluxe one with the ingame items. It includes a bigger bag and a cool, double-headed turtle mount which you can use as soon as you get near a mailbox, can&apos;t remember exactly, but like level 9 maybe. It makes getting around a lot easier so get that one if you can.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1489258">Expand</a></span>

The fanboi excitement reviews are just because they are bored with WOW or never played an MMO before. The first thing I noticed is the game is tooooo solo friendly and hardly anyone wants to group prior to level 50. The game is tooooooo EASY as I leveledup without worry and pretty much stomped everything in my path as I was beating mobs 4 levels higher than me quite early in the game all the way to 50. The death penalty is a joke. You don&apos;t lose anything but a small amount of time getting back to your corpse and a few gold coins to get your abilities back to 100%. The market is dead because the leveling is TOO FAST. I went to level 12 the first day. To level 30 the first 3 days and level 50 by the end of 7 days. There&apos;s no challenge in that and the combat is so repetitive you can roll your face across the keyboard and beat anything. The skills and spells are dry and just don&apos;t stand out like say an Everquest version. In Everquest I really felt I was my character and really felt FEAR of dying and losing stuff. There&apos;s not a bit of fear in this game and as I said the death penalty is a joke.
<br>The colors for characters are bland as well.. Too much BROWN and Grays. THe weapons are horrible looking and there&apos;s no procs so nothing stands out as &quot;OHHHHH I WANT DAT!&quot;. Boring colors, boring looking and just an overall boring game. To me this is a game for 8 to 10 year olds. It&apos;s that easy and then they can go...&quot;Looky Mommy I beat dah bad guy Look Mommy LOOK!&quot; lmao
<br>
<br>The community isn&apos;t really friendly especially on the official forums. I&apos;ve never seen so many negative comments on a game in my life. I mean this game really sucks it&apos;s that bad. You&apos;re better off waiting for Guild Wars 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1561533">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I first played RIFT at beta and early release before going back to my regular MMO of the time. I&apos;ve been without a regular MMO and despite waiting for elder scrolls, most of my friends are on RIFT. In short, RIFT was &apos;something to do&apos;. However.
<br>
<br>RIFT has the unique advantage of having an entirely original world, base, and story. At first glance the game world doesn&apos;t have the glamour and lore of a game such as LOTRO or SWTOR, but RIFT doesn&apos;t lack in quality.
<br>
<br>The content is very versatile and available from level 1 to cap. Low level instances are fun, higher level players can scale down to do content. The main concept of the game, the rifts, are random and open. As hordes of monsters enter the landscape, a global quest, shared by all appears for that area. Players have to defeat invaders and aid each other to close the rifts and defeat the bosses. Not only is this fun, it has the ingenious advantage of encouraging group play without being forced or non existent.
<br>
<br>The thing that impressed me the most this second time round of trying RIFT was the number of players in the starting and low level areas, in short, they are packed. Other games are devoid of players upto cap level areas, RIFT is populated throughout and the level scaling plays a great part in this.
<br>
<br>The character skill trees are extensive and work well, there is plenty of choice for building the role you want.
<br>
<br>The RIFT store is accessible by a small icon among the usual cluster of buttons for various menus you expect to see on the UI, it is not forced in anyway and functional. The reason I mention the store is for the way it entirely prevents gold selling. Players can buy a barter item for points which typically sells for a large amount of in game currency, not exactly my cup of tea however no gold sellers is a plus for an MMO.
<br>
<br>RIFT is well worth playing, and free to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=4090002">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game has its moments but the combat is sluggish by modern standards and Trion has clearly decided to put it in &apos;harvest&apos; mode: minimal support while they extract what cash they can. I&apos;d suggest thinking twice about any long term commitment to it but it&apos;s worth dabbling with.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=4363010">Expand</a></span>

If you are not fighting Rift armies you are fighting against Rift force fortresses that have been constructed by unchecked armies that emerged from unchecked Rifts. The world actually changes and progresses in response to play action or inaction. Love it! The crafting system is amazing, the professions keep you busy and the graphics are fantastic. Seriously, no other MMO has every kept me so engaged for so long. I just took out Patron Status (I am now a subscriber) and a game needs to be very good for me to do that. Also, it&#x2019;s quite cheap and flexible. A month costs less than $12AU. Really worth checking out. Head and shoulders above other MMOs and I have played many. Oh, and it&#x2019;s finished. Yep, it&#x2019;s a working game in which I have been forced to endure 0 (zero) bugs. I am still trying to finish the first FlashPoint in Star Wars Old Republic due to an end mission crash more than a year after trying the game and here is a fully tested and functional MMO. This game is what professionalism is all about. The Help Desk got back to me regarding an account question (my fault) in less than two hours, the community is amazingly helpful and the game is just plain fun. Get this game. Get it now. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=3939531">Expand</a></span>

Like a lot of MMORPG&apos;s it is very easy early on and you can get sucked into building  your character. But after playing for a while you realize that this game offers nothing more than a standard MMORPG experience and contributes nothing new to the genre. At least not anymore.

If you are bored and love the old-style MMORPGs then give it a whirl but don&apos;t buy any of the DLC or become a supporter until you have played it for several days. My experience was it got boring very quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=4744915">Expand</a></span>

<br>3. LvL 65 is Grindy as hell unless your Raiding, the majority of what you do is Grind for Tokens this is where the game got boring with Dailies and Weeklies.
<br>4. The game is centralized around making Cash so expect to Fork up real cash if you want to be Competitive especially if PVP is your main concern.
<br>
<br>The Pros.
<br>1. Good Story line.
<br>2. Lots to do if you like Achievements, Crafting and Puzzles.
<br>3. Plenty of Group Activity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=6005947">Expand</a></span>

The fights are confusing as heck, especially coming from WoW, and end game is very disappointing. The world looks AMAZING and the mounts and mobs are awesome, but the weapon and armor are completely &quot;meh&quot;, could use a Korean touch.  The rifts are super fun and always give you something to do, the quests are decent and engaging and world events are sufficiently fun - but the instanced encounters are a mess.
<br>
<br>And the community is both good and bad - they&apos;re friendly and helpful in general, it&apos;s not full of trolls like WoW, but in instances everyone treats it like a speed run and doesn&apos;t talk.  So you don&apos;t get a chance to learn anything unless you&apos;re doing guild runs.  I played for 6 months and gave up on end game, levelling the different classes is really fun but ends at level 60 =(.
<br>
<br>The game looks amazing and has excellent playability - from fully customizable UI to complex talent trees that can be swapped out and customized endlessly.  The game feels polished and well thought out, but boss mechanics need to be more transparent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=2807616">Expand</a></span>

So where does wow/rift go wrong?  It&#x2019;s a cookie cutter type game with no depth in gear, spells or abilities&#x2026; everyone has the same stuff.   A new expansion comes out, your: Int, Agi, Str goes up 20 points&#x2026; ooowee, how exciting!  These games are good for a while but you tire of them quickly.
<br>
<br>Rift figured it would copy WOW because they are successful, which is only partly true.  WOW is successful largely due to the fact that there is no competition for this genre game on the market, rather than it being an epic game to play.
<br>
<br>So instead of being creative and coming up with an epic NEW game, Rift sealed its fate by coping another game on the market; a game with more resources and experience in the market.  To add to their problems, their developers are not as good as WOW&#x2019;s (less cash to work with), they have not figured out a proper PVP balance between classes (big issue!), class/gear/dungeons have even less depth.  And selling gear and mounts for cash (US dollars) is simply a mistake in the long run.  Yes, you make some quick cash but this will come back to bite them later, as it creates major imbalances in PVP and spoils the idea that earn quality gear!  Rift definitely has some positive like good support, and sound on-line game play, but the focus of this post is how to improve the game.
<br>
<br>So the big question, how do you fix these games, or better yet, make a game that blows the competition away!  Think unique and individual.  Who wants to be the same as everyone else?  Instead of spending all that time developing PVE which no one plays in end game you build up a colossal gear stash 1st, a broad range of abilities to level (slowly), EQ&#x2019;s AA were very good.   I could say so much here but don&#x2019;t have the time or space to write it.  How do you make PVE fun?  Opportunities for reward!! (GEAR), make it challenging where you require team play, and easy group joining creates friendships, roaming rare monsters and again drops  worthy GEAR).  I&#x2019;d make opportunities for good gear equal whether it&#x2019;s PVP, PVE or Raid and almost everything would be drops&#x2026; very little purchased!  How about building your own weapons with special abilities, weapons that level with the character (30-40 levels minimum) so the gear drop really mean something.  More of the gear is tradable. And when gear drops is for your level not something you out grew five levels ago!
<br>
<br>PVP is based on skill, rather than level/gear so you avoid the unbalanced PVP matches.   And is it really that difficult to balance the different classes?  It must be because Rift does a horrible job of it, as of 10/2013 rogues and heals rule in PVP, mages are pawns and clerics, warriors do ok.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=3721945">Expand</a></span>

<br>Since a year the game is going downhill faster and faster in both gameplay and stability. On top of that, the Customer Support almost completely disappeared and don&apos;t be surprised if you report a serious bug and find it still there even after many months.
<br>
<br>That is, except when the bug causes less income for Trion (like too much exp of too many free gifts ingame) , because then they suddenly have enough capacity to patch within 12-24 hours.
<br>
<br>With the release of 3.0 the game lost even the last bit of balance and there is no point of doing the 1-60 zones anymore because of the low quality gear, low exp and the new &quot;sidekick&quot; system, which makes it possible to party with a lvl 65 and instantly gets your level set to 65 and run around in the new zone.
<br>
<br>i tried and level 1-50 now can be done in less than 3 hours (that is if you dont buy the instant-60 item that instantly makes your char lvl 60)
<br>
<br>Since the game became FTP, Trion has been slowly (and without even informing players)  removinig more and more items you needed to make the game attractive for Free players.
<br>Sneaky because these kinds of changes never make it to the patchnotes so after every patch you have to wait and see if they didnt remove or disable something.

<br>Now it comes to a point where you either have to grind low level dungeons for gear (good luck in finding anyone even willing to do low level dungeons now all dungeonrewards are removed from the game)
<br>or spend real money to buy gear.
<br>
<br>If you are planning to switch from WoW to Rift because it&apos;s Free to Play and thus cheaper, you will be in for a nasty surprise.
<br>
<br>On top of that, the number of gamecrashes increased dramaticly since the release of 3.0. Even with newer game pc&apos;s and graph. cards you can endup crashing every 10 minutes.
<br>That is, if you didnt already got disconnected because of the huge latency spikes the game is experiencing since 3,0 (and not will be fixed since Trion keeps telling us it&apos;s not a serverside problem)
<br>
<br>Conclusion: The game was great in the beginning, but Trion moved on to a new (and more expensive) policy, so it&apos;s time for the players to move on to another (cheaper) game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=4679383">Expand</a></span>

The graphics look great on any system, but if you have a high-end rig, it really looks beautiful. It has been awhile since a MMO has sucked me in like RIFT has. I highly recommend it to gaming vets and newcomers alike. Give it a chance, you might like it.</span>

A quick summary of why I gave it a score of 6: Technically wonderful with lovely graphics, smooth response and very minor glitches. However, gameplay feels a bit bland for long-time players of MMORPGs. Good effort from Trion.<br>http://www.hopelesslygame.com/2011/04/entering-the-rift/</span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_1825759"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Alrite guys I&apos;m going to break this down into simple sections based on PvP, PvE, whats available in the market and why I would give this game a 4 and why it would seem like a troll score compared to what others are saying.<br><br>1: PvP.  If you are buying rift for PvP, do not buy it.  I cannot stress this enough.  It is a PvE centric game with PvP tacked on in a horrible way that is horribly unbalanced.  If you send me a message I will send you a link to show me deleting my top rank level cap Warrior for PvP.  Warrior just cannot be used in PvP at end game.  Its that simple.  Other classes have had similiar nerfs/buffs completely changing your ability to play the game overnight with little to no community feedback before going live and even months after the change and hundreds of threads, they will not change a thing.  The Second part of PVP - Gear.  You gain gear by pvping, but the gear gap on the PvP is insane.  I have seen players go afk in the highest tier gear vs people who are FORCED to fight them because of no tier seperation and not die to lower tier gear players only to have the player return, use a potion or skill, and then go about killing the 2-3 players that were on top of him for the last 30 seconds.  You MUST go through this process in order to obtain gear and it can takeup weeks upon weeks of basically getting beaten from an unfair advantage until you are better.  That is statistics speaking, some may say it isn&apos;t like that, it really is.<br><br>2. PvE: For PvE, this game is not bad.  It has horrible graphics and really bad rendering problems due to the water in the maps but I&apos;m not going to comment on graphics and optimization because I&apos;m not a tech junkie its not what you want to read about.  The major draw for PVE is end game Raids and partying, and of course RIFTs what this game is named after. Raids: Simple, scripted encounters based on gear and hotbar setup just like other games of the genre.  Not hard, not easy.  Just a normal setup.<br>Partying: Very easy, not even required until end game.  Can solo most of the game and most players do.<br>RIFTS: These will seem very &apos;random&apos; and require a team at first.  After reaching lvl 30 and being competent in how you go about PvE, Rifts are no longer requiring a team except for the final bosses which are extremely OP based on what class you are.  The &apos;loot&apos; they offer and other shinys are next to worthless compared to forced PvP and Raid end gear.  Otherwise useless little things added to the game to try and attract people and if you play and enjoy rifting I&apos;m not meaning to hurt your feelings, just pointing out that its a content void, like a death rift.<br><br><br>What else is on the market:  There are alot of other games and if you haven&apos;t tried some of the higher rated more fan related and better % of happy player games out there, I suggest you would go for that one before this one.  This is a large mix of what is on the market, and while it is captivating for 50 hours, it becomes very stale.  The developers also have no ability to speak to the playerbase and do not attempt to help them out or listen to their concerns at all.  There are multiple posts with people deleting their highest tier characters and unsubscribing due to what they feel is unfair and the developers will not speak with the players or even attempt to fix anything.  They post feedback threads and delete actual feedback posts and stick with the players agreeing that its not broken.  I&apos;m not speaking of troll posts, I&apos;m speaking of posts of people who do the math and do care about the game.<br><br>So like I said, its a decent game worth trying if you have nothing else.  It is not worth staying subscribed to for long and I believe most of the 10&apos;s on this website are lies and fake reviews written because if these people played as long as they said they did and play right now, they would not be posting that.  Just check the public forums on the game site.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1825759">Expand</a></span>

The game world itself is extremely small. The biggest thing that really stunk is that the dungeons are very, very easy.. even in Tier 1 and Tier 2 and some raids, the boss fights are simply tank and spanks with one easy tactic. The dungeon finder as well as the PvP queues are very long as well. If your looking for a challenge with good quality to it you might want to look elsewhere, it&apos;s highly overrated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1712092">Expand</a></span>

It has a few interesting concepts: multiple &quot;souls&quot; (aka talent trees) to play around with, and world events in the form of rifts or gateways to elemental planes, which spawn monsters and must be combated.  The soul system at first seems like a good idea, but it quickly becomes clear that spreading your talent points between more than 2 trees actually hampers you, and there still is an &quot;optimal&quot; build that you should be using if you want to maximize your effectiveness.  It also suffers from talent point bloat, similar to WoW prior to 4.0&apos;s talent reorganization - you will spend 5 points to increase the damage of an ability by 5%, for example.  The rifts/invasions I felt were fairly well done, if a little simplistic.  Even if you shut one rift down, another will open in a short while.  I was disappointed when, after closing several footholds on a beach, I turned around to see the first one open again.
<br>
<br>The rest of the game, I&apos;m sorry to say, is horrible.  For one, there is virtually no replayability.  If you&apos;ve played one Defiant character, you&apos;ve played them all, and questing is crushingly linear.  Except for dwarves and bahmi, the races are virtually identical and consist of a fair skinned human and elf for Guardian and a dark skinned human and elf for Defiant.  Boooooring.  Questing is 100% the stereotypical &apos;go here, kill X, click on Y and talk to Z&apos; fare.  You will also encounter many instances of finishing a quest in an area, only to get a follow up quest that takes you back into that same area you just cleared.  Also, I hope you enjoy the way you look at level 2, you will be wearing that same outfit up through your 20&apos;s, not to mention if you are a pet class such as a beastmaster, that creepy purple cat will be with you throughout the entire game.
<br>
<br>In closing, you might find a few features you like, but they will be drowned out by the negative aspects of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1702876">Expand</a></span>

It is just the same WoW over and over and over again made by different company under different name with different world, races and classes, but the core is the same. The only innovative thing about Rift are those &quot;rift events&quot; which turned to be just another excuse to mob grinding...Crafting is poorly designed and unexciting, no open world pvp makes the game even more boring later on...It is just another WoW clone with total lack of immersion factors</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1695718">Expand</a></span>

Basically everything you would expect from a paid MMORPG is here. Also RIFT brings more things to the table, like multi-class system tree which allows for good variety of game play. Character customization is also more in-depth then most other MMORPGs. The rift events also add a good twist. Cons: The graphics and cities could be a major lag issue for people with less powerful computers. Even by lowing the graphics the mire presence of many players in fairly small cities could cause a major lag issue. The dungeon system is smooth, but they do not make key factors in boss fights easily recognizable (Which could be a con and pro). Rift events especially major ones cause such huge lag problems and can be chaotic with 50+ players attacking the same target, thus moving or even fighting nearly impossible. The armor and some weapons from level 1-40 are pretty much the same looking, 0 variety. The game also lacks a in-game re-customization of your character like WoWs and Lord of the Rings Online&apos;s Barbershop. It also lacks a dungeon finder leaving instances easily skipped to avoid the headache of spamming for LFG. Most of all the combat experience is smooth, but leaves you empty hearted and yearning for the &quot;I just kicked some butt&quot; feeling. That eventually leaves you bored and uninterested in grinding. Over all, this games a dud, but by far the best MMO to be released since 2004. If you like casual RPGs with low intensity leveling and combat. Rift is the game for you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1681023">Expand</a></span>

I mean Warcraft has 20 years of story and lore development from it&apos;s origins as an RTS, you can&apos;t beat that.  It&apos;s not a bad game, but it was never going to be a WoW killer. Trion should be congratulated on making a very polished game, and hopefully their future releases will start to veer off the path Blizzard created.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1781541">Expand</a></span>

However, game offers one thing that is different from any other MMO, a rift concept, which was cool for the first 20 hours or so and got incredibly old and tideous after that. Other than that, it is WoW... released 7 years later.</span>

Pros- beautiful graphics; great scaling with system compatibility; extreme character variety; smooth launch and updates; fresh take on PvP; non-instanced raids; takes the best from well-played MMOs and bundles them.
<br>Cons- the grind: same old linear quests; single player is far too easy, no one forms parties or even chats; PvP is chaotic and unbalanced-but at least it is not WoW garbage; horribly convoluted lore; character classes have too much variablility- I wanted to build a melee healer (Justicar) but the lack of abilities and DPS forced me to cast (Purifier) ranged spells all the time.  Most character builds oddly end up performing in a similar fashion despite the vast breadth of choices for development. ---I wish this game luck because WoW veterans (I started in 2004) have been starving for a decent MMO again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1592797">Expand</a></span>

Here it is a month later and I&apos;m bored to tears of the end game content, fed up with repetitive key mashing for DPS and lackluster PVP. It was a great idea of Trion to learn from their peers in the gaming world, to simply create a frankenstein game that just mashed together parts of others is a bit weak though. The leveling was a series of &apos;quickly get to the yellow ring and kill everything, never mind WHY I&apos;m doing it&apos; that was simplistic and short lived (thankfully). You are rewarded at endgame with tedious dungeons littered with trash mobs, weak loot and the never ending quest for items with purple frames. Trion did add new class structure and features, but these are not enough to overlook the boring old shell of a game this is. It&apos;s environments are generic and cliche, its encounters are the same old formula and the story is lacking on so many levels (as well as utterly unimportant), They had the chance to make something amazing, and instead spit out a WoW clone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1599439">Expand</a></span>

PvP is quite often premades repeatedly steamrolling pugs, and this is apparently working as intended. Both sides have what is basically a Warhammer Bright Wizard locking down the battlefield with mass AE and mass CC.
<br>
<br>- While the class structure initially looks great, it in fact is a nightmare of min maxing players vs. devs. Yo-yoing balance patches and random nerfs are pretty commonplace, but they seem to break more than they fix. - The Rift events (their signature &quot;thang&quot;) are either nonexistant or overly in your face, locking down entire zones with 12 total players in them with no chance against the NPC invaders. The loot from Rifts sort of sucks relative to other lvl 50 gear so its no surprise people dont really seem to bother.
<br>
<br>- The &quot;elite&quot; PvE instances (the ones you run to grind tokens for gear, just like WoW) are rehashes of the instances you see from lvl 1 - 50 with yet more trash to clear.
<br>
<br>- Crafting is a luck based system in which you grind dailies to get tokens to get uber patterns. So are some of the gathering &quot;recipes&quot; - random luck based drops off nodes. Yay for luck based MMOs.
<br>
<br>- The devs seem sort of out of touch as to what the players are actually doing in PvE, PvP and with the construction of their characters using the &quot;unique&quot; soul system. One example is that there are two main healing classes and the one that is the better of the two cannot even queue as heals using the (now in Alpha) looking for group tool. This is apparently working as intended.
<br>
<br>- While gathering or traveling expect masses of gray mobs to aggro you, slow you down, dismount you and force you to clear them. All while trying to get your luck based crafting daily done so you can once again not get a tablet that is necessary to get the good patterns.
<br>
<br>Try it if you gotta, but I highly recommend a one month sub because thats about all the gameplay Rift has in it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1604099">Expand</a></span>

When I made a new character on the Seastone, I said &quot;Hi, I&apos;m new to the game&quot; on local chat and everyone told me to &quot;GTFO.&quot;  So after giving this game 3 weeks of my time, I decided I&apos;d rather not play with a bunch of immature kids who bought time cards at Walmart because they&apos;re not old enough to use credit cards, and find something better to do with my time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=2337193">Expand</a></span>

It looks gorgeous on a high-end PC, but the game has little substance.  The setting isn&apos;t very immersive or memorable, and there is almost no attempt to provide any mission content beyond the bog standard &quot;hunt X of Y&quot; stuff.  The game is linear to the extreme; there&apos;s not much opportunity to cut your own path through the world.  The dynamic rift events turn out to be context-free grinding...chaotic and not all that fun.  The character customization is one of the more impressive features, but it is not as robust as it first appears since here are only certain soul combinations that are practical...a small minority of the technically possible combinations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1657586">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately that is about all it has above the rest because the rest is just good old fashion grinding and same old boring dungeon runs.  Yes you will have to grind reputation, many different currencies and the rift feature is also just another form of grinding and are just really quick public quests that aren&apos;t anything special.  You should be pulled into a rift, that would be much cooler :P  Even warhammer had public areas similar to the rifts so its nothing that hasn&apos;t been done.<br><br>If you are a pvp junkie (like myself) then Rift will let you down completely.  The potential for great pvp play is in Rift but with the amount of stunning, silences and confusion along with spammable &quot;polymorphing&quot; and severely overclocked souls pvp play becomes frustrating and boring very quickly.  PVP also has no affect on the game world as its just arena scrapping in small, chaotic and simple warfront maps.  Once again, even Warhammer has this beat as well.<br><br>Even though the game is all around plain and identical to the rest, the player base is very friendly and can be a lot of fun to play along with, so if your just a casual gamer this game is for you, but if your more hardcore and don&apos;t leave your basement often, I wouldn&apos;t recommend investing your time in it.  Even at 50, raiding is just the same old stuff, nothing new at all.  You will just once again have characters on a game that will eventually be behind within a year or two.<br><br>We need something original!  Rift gets a 3 for its effort at graphics, soul system and decent enough lore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1686956">Expand</a></span>

Ok so you start leveling your new character and quickly fall in love with the game: wow the character creation is outstanding, the graphics are really awesome you discovered the endless possibilities of the soul system, multi class at it&apos;s best yeah! and the rifts-invasions are just epic! oh glorious day you finally found a new home you are so happy and considering to pay 6 months in advance also that epic fiery mount looks yuummy so you should invite some friends to join the fun! right? no wait and read to the end! So you finally reach level 50 and you fell almost complete, so you decide to try some endgame...wait, most servers are not even bothering, and you realize even expert dungeons are an endless grind, if you pug using the LFG tool you also get a raiding token to get cool raid tiers! wow, uh oh... wait a second I get a token per run and I need over 500 tokens?! you gotta be kidding me! okay I&apos;m going to try a faction rep mount! they look so cool, wait a second, months of pointless grind? ok ok pvp was so cool in the lower tiers so it&apos;s time I join the battle once again, you have enough favor to buy the first epic set, here you go. And yes there you go... to hell, just like rift. Believe me Rift&apos;s lvl 50 pvp is just awful, it should actually get the award for worst pvp system ever in a mmo, yes you are going to grind your hiney for at least two months playing non stop to get nearly competent and until then you are going to be daddy&apos;s toy and yeah you are going to suffer , you&apos;ll see, DEVS thought it was a good idea to mix rank 0-1 new 50s with all mighty god mode ranks 8 you will be in a train my friend, in a train of pain, get ready to jump in to the most frustrant experience a game can give you around. It is unbalanced, unfair and very awful, but I have seen that in other moo you say, ok not like this I can tell you, the difference between a rank 1-5 and a rank 8 is so huge a single r8 (no matter what class) can literally wipe a group of 5-10 low 1-3 ranks and I am serious about it, so if you want to play RIFT go ahead but stay away from 50 pvp, at least until they fix the unbalance, I left because I was so sick of losing all day for months, yes Trion messed it up with an otherwise awesome game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1749714">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s about dungeons.. and lots of them. The way the game is sold is as an alternative to WoW but it&apos;s that only in the sense that fast food is dinner compared to a meat and potatoes meal. There is a TON of grinding for nothing but gear at endgame so if you were looking to escape from WoW because of that, you actually fell out of the frying pan into the fire. Rifts seem to be static loot pinatas that you whack every so often and coins for gear come out. Whack enough rifts and you get some really super average gear that isn&apos;t worth the time. the lower levels in this game are absolutely abandoned and if you start now, you won&apos;t be doing a lot of the huge boss rift invasions because of lack of interest from the community. most people are level 50 and play on alts which they are speedleveling to 50 to play with buddies, so noobs won&apos;t get the time of day. fanbois will say &quot;my server is packed and we do stuff all the time&quot; but that&apos;s everygame has one or three servers like that while the rest are dying. Rift has about 70 servers mothballed; not technically closed but not technically open neither. If you have a toon there, you can stay but if you start the game you won&apos;t even see the server on your list. There are plenty of folks who made homes on them only to have Trion shut them off from everyone else but you can transfer out. That ruined a lot of communities in the game and people quit. their sub rate is bargain basement (probably the lowest in the industry) due to falling subs so if you pay for a year in advance you can pay as little as $120. Pretty desperate but if it fills the game then good idea I guess. SWTOR and GW2 will be coming out soon (GW2 next year) so I&apos;d play consoles until then like BF3, GoW3, Madden, etc and save the 120 bucks for the big event games coming like those. RIFT will probably be going FTP by next summer so holding off would be wise while they try to fix the awful PvP balancing and at least give people something to fight for as now it&apos;s just arenaball with no ball. World PvP is non-existant. The game has good things like hit a button and sell all your grey loot, decent graphics (not AoC or FFXIV worthy), and low price. But the replayability is awful because there are only TWO starting zones.. that&apos;s right.. two. For a mmo launching in 2011 that&apos;s lazy. The armors look horrible (do a Google search for Rift armor and you&apos;ll see) and they repeat like.. level 10, 20, 30, 40 etc. So if you find some epic gear at 50 it will have 50 stats but looks EXACTLY like level 30 gear. Again, LAZY DESIGN. It&apos;s hard to believe they spend 50 million dollars on this and five or six years development. They didnt even have guild banks at launch. The mounts are all the same that repeat like CE mount: plain turtle. World event mount: Green turtle. Achievement mount: White turtle. LAZY DESIGN. The lore is pretty bland and mundane; it inspires nothing. You dont feel a part of the world or like your fighting to keep mobs from invading.. it feels like your grinding for loot because the story is canned. The game was few bugs at launch but as it&apos;s gone on, it&apos;s gotten more buggy. Notsure how that happens but things just get broke. Maintainence is pretty much almost every day and for 20-30 minutes at a time but you can have several of those.. sometimes back to back which is annoying. Better way would be once a week for four hours and then done but the piecemeal work is upsetting. The community is made up of 600k people from WoW (or was) so it was kind of immature to start but now it&apos;s just plain nasty with one or two nice guilds telling trying to convince everyone new this isn&apos;t &quot;their community&quot; even though they play their game. Amazingly funny that. Anyways, to recap: WAIT FOR THE SUMMER WHEN RIFT GOES FTP as they already have a cash shop in the works from their other game that they will no doubt switch over because the population is dropping fast. if you have other games you&apos;ve been wanting to try FTP now (Fallen Earth, DCUO, EQ2, LOTRO, AoC, WoW trail, Dragon Nest, Champs Online, Star Trek online) you&apos;d be better off spending 10 or 15 bucks once or twice in there and be done with it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1766044">Expand</a></span>

The in game community is both helpful and friendly.<br><br>The Bad:<br>The class system is still under development. It should have been handled in alpha. Itemization needs some work. Crafting system still needs some work as the numbers on the green gear are bellow  quest rewards and random green item drops.  Mats for some of the crafting tiers are sparse and are in zones higher than what your questing in.  End game is the standard grind dungeons and BG&apos;s for faction to get gear for next tier of faction grind. Gold spammers are a little more prevalent than I would like. Overall leveling was fun until about level 40. That is where it went stale for me as I did not see too many new quest types or mechanics. New MMO players will like it . Vets that expect something more might not.  If you have a interest I recommend the 7 day free trial before you drink the cool aid</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1616044">Expand</a></span>

If you played WoW, Everquest 2, or Warhammer, than Rift will feel very familiar to you. But is that necessarily a bad thing? In the case of Rift? Not at all. I&apos;m not a professional game critic, so I&apos;m not going to dive in to every aspect of the game. But, I will let you know right now that one of the aspects really that shine in Rift, would be the classes. There are four primary classes, Mage, Warrior, Rogue, and Cleric. Don&apos;t let the number four fool you, because technically Rift has thirty-six classes. Let me explain. Each class that you choose has 9 skill trees (souls). Each class can choose three of those souls to shove skill points in to. So lets say you&apos;re playing a Warrior, and you&apos;re going to be soloing quite a bit. Maybe you&apos;ll want a companion? You can choose the Beastmaster soul. Well, you got a pet now, but maybe you also want to be a dual weapon specialist and dish out lots of damage, you can choose the Paragon soul as well. Well, maybe you want to buff your weapons with elemental power. Then go ahead and pick the Riftblade soul as well.<br><br>So basically you&apos;re a dual wielding warrior with fire swords and a pet. And that&apos;s basically how it works. But remember there are still 6 other souls to work with, and one of them is specifically dedicated to the PvPer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1489360">Expand</a></span>

Yes it is a blatant rip-off of WoW, but there are enough differences to keep it seperate. I must say, I was disappointed for the first day I played, loved it the second day, now I am thoroughly enjoying myself. Be patient and give it a go and you will find yourself hooked.</span>

For the person who thinks this is a dumbed down version of WoW, he couldn&apos;t be more wrong.  Instead of one talent tree, you get three, the crafting system is silimar to WoW, but it has some options in it to make the items much more usable at your level.  The UI system is one of the best that I have ever seen.  It&apos;s very easily customizable and you can easily tailor it to your tastes.<br>2. For the guy who complains about questing, leveling up, dungeons, raids and rifts... its an MMO!!  That is what these games are played for!  Holy crap, if you are going to complain about that, play a different game!<br><br>Seriously though, I&apos;ve been playing World of Warcraft since its release and if there was ever a true WoW killer, this game is it.  I picked it up very easily without even having to look at a manual and was instantly impressed by the spit and polish Trion Worlds put into their product.  I highly recommend this game for anyone who is tired of playing World of Warcraft and wants something new.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1489465">Expand</a></span>

Sure, the graphics were pretty good but the combat didn&apos;t really set my world on fire.  But things have improved considerably since then and I&apos;m now an active purchaser/subscriber.  I&apos;ve played WoW since 2004 and while it&apos;s too early to tell if Rift is a &quot;better&quot; game, I will say that it&apos;s certainly one of the first new MMOs to come along that feels complete with tons of stuff to do.  The world is new and gorgeous, combat IS a lot of fun once you start gaining abilities, the soul system rocks, and the rift invasions are a ton of fun.  My initial impressions of the rifts/invasions were that they might be gimmicky -- but they&apos;ve yet to become a bore or tiresome.  As others have yet, the quest system isn&apos;t anything amazing, but the rifts really do help break up the monotony of leveling.  In fact, I would say it hasn&apos;t been monotonous at all!
<br>
<br>Rift is an excellent game.  For anyone to rate this game below a 7 hasn&apos;t really played it for any length of time OR is desperately wanting a next-gen MMO (which this isn&apos;t-- just an evolution of what we&apos;re familiar with).  If you are a new player to WoW I would say you&apos;d probably be happier staying with that.  But if you&apos;re like me and have played WoW for years and have grown tired of its &quot;same ol same ol&apos;&quot;, then give Rift a try.  I think you&apos;ll definitely enjoy your time in Telara.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1490677">Expand</a></span>

I really dont care if the game is WoW ripoff or reminds me something &quot;that I have done or seen befo..&quot; What matters is HOW its done. I cant really be sure about the whole game yet cause leveled my character just to lvl 20.  But.. I have absolutely fall in love with this game, its truly fabolous! I have been in headstart since beginning and its just good game. Everything works like a charm. You can feel the quality throught the game and of course after the time passes updates will fix problems. After you get out from your character starting area the fantasy world of Telara just suck you in with great graphx and sound design(wich are much superior when comparing to WoW). And after you become all the new things what there are in character development you will really starting to explore the fantasy world and feeling it! I just love searching artifacts and new places. Leveling is somehow more enjoyable than any mmo that I have played. Maybe this is because you char is not just a one &quot;thing&quot;, it can be warrior and mage and you can test new abilities all the time and not get bored. First time I feel that I can truly decide what kind or type my playing style is. So I dont know wnything about this game endgame but the game I am playing know contains so much doing its almost overwhelming. You must fight Rifts, dungeons, explore, find artifacts, level and adjust your char and many many many things.. Hey but enough of this. Im really happy that after a couple fo years I can enjoy good MMO. Maybe its **** after three months or so but hell with it.. Im enjoying it right now!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1489517">Expand</a></span>

It is about as much of a WoW clone as WoW is a clone of EQ, meaning they are similar games, yet Rift is the next generation. Every new generation starts out with a game combining the best elements of the previous entries of the genre, adding its own touch and refining the technology. I&apos;m not against WoW, I&apos;ve played it for years. WoW is a genre defining game, yet rift is the NEXT genre defining game. It takes the instances/raids of WoW, and improves them with its own signature style. It also takes the PQs of Warhammer (Rifts) and adds its own improvments to those. The PVP is a mix of every big name MMO. The questing is slightly boring, yet no more boring than any other MMO. I cannot name an MMO with more interesting quests, as every MMO&apos;s questing is fairly boring. If you like questing in MMOs, you will love Rifts questing, if not you won&apos;t. Rift is the new big MMO. It innovates where innovation was needed, and keeps tradition where everything worked. The technology is upgraded aswell, creating beautiful graphics and an overall immersive world. Might as well jump on the Rift bandwagon, because MMOs as a genre are going that way aswell.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1489616">Expand</a></span>

The game&apos;s overall polish and stability are legendary in a field where all too often players are ready to accept sub-par launches. Rift is the complete package - a fantasy mmo with all the trappings (pvp/crafting) with a system that will leave you reading skill trees for a long time. Its extremely fun to build your character in so many different ways and still have a great time. The public quest feature is extremely fun, allowing you the &quot;big game&quot; feeling on a smaller scale. You can close rifts throughout the world for rewards, and each rift feels like you are contributing to a larger cause.

Soul System: The soul system allows for flexibility when designing your character. Each class (Warrior, Cleric, Rogue, Mage) has eight souls for PVE, and one soul specifically for PVP. You can utilize any three souls at any given time. Mages can heal and rogues can tank.<br><br>Graphics: The Gamebryo engine does a good job of bringing high-fidelty graphics to computer systems while only requiring a DX9 capable graphics card. Textures are extremely detailed and do a good job of pulling you into the world. Spell effects are detailed and abundant but not overbearing so much that they overwhelm and detract from the beauty of the game world.<br><br>Rifts: The games namesake are randomly spawning events in which a tear between the game world and an elemental plane will open drawing through it multiple enemies. If left unchecked the rifts will continue spawning NPC&apos;s which will attempt to overthrow both defiant and guardian safe havens and quest hubs. The rifts create two things. First, they create a feeling of a living changing world, you might log out one day in a tranquil forest, and log in the next in the middle of a fire rift, the earth scorched and black, to promptly get your ass handed to you by multiple mobs. Pro tip: Log out in a town. Second, they require cooperation I have seen quest hubs overthrown and groups of complete strangers band together to overthrow the elemental usurpers. This required cooperation creates a sense of community.<br><br>Rift Invasion: At any given time there may be four or five rifts open in a zone (the number varies depending on the number of player characters in the zone). Rift Invasions tend to happen when the zone is very crowded. All of a sudden fifteen+ rifts will open up and hundreds of NPC&apos;s will spawn and attempt to take over the entire zone, destroying defiance and guardians alike, as well as their respective quest hubs and towns. The entire zone will be given a quest to repel the elemental invasion, and upon doing so will spawn a zone boss. The boss will require a raid of people (sometimes forty+ people) to defeat. Epic.    UI: The entire UI is completely customizable out of the box. There is no need for any third party add-ons to reorganize your UI. As a note, for better or worse, Trion has taken a stance AGAINST the creation of third party add-ons. I have yet to find a need, or want, for a third party add-on. Certain built in features, for example, the ability to search your inventory for an item by typing in its name (your bags open up and every item other than one you were searching for are grayed out) show that Trion took great pains to make the UI as user friendly as possible. One other neat UI feature, if you are alt+tabbed out of the game and are attacked your Rift tray Icon will blink red, if you are sent a tell it will blink yellow.<br><br>Combat: Very little new to see here, if you have played World of Warcraft, or virtually any current day MMO you will feel at home in Rift. You have an action bar(s) upon which you place abilities that are activated by clicking them. You find an enemy, target it, and wail on it, and your abilities until the mob is dead (or you are... maybe you should have healed yourself first).<br><br>Questing: Trion has not re-written the book on questing with the release of Rift. Quest for the most part are kill X, collect X, return to me and I will give you a bread crumb quest to your next quest hub. It is tried and true, and it works. I have yet to get bored with the questing, but I haven&apos;t been overly excited by it either. They have preserved the status quo here.<br><br>Launch: The games launch has gone extremely smoothly. Trion has added thirty+ servers in order to reduce queue times . Trion has been patching the game three to four times a week, downtime ranging from thirty minutes to an hour, with server maintenance once a week lasting four to six hours. Server performance has been stable even during rift invasions involving fifty+ PC&apos;s and even more NPC&apos;s. For those wondering, the US based servers are located in Dallas, Texas.<br><br>Bugs: There have been very few game breaking bugs since release, the only one of which I can think of required Trion to disable a tradeskill (runecrafting) due to a crafty player figuring out a way to exploit the profession. Overall the game feels polished far beyond its age.<br><br>The game in it&apos;s current form is worth a purchase for anyone interested in MMO&apos;s.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1490693">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This game is very similar to WoW. But why shouldn&apos;t it be? It took all the things that WoW has and added to them. A smart move by Trion. The class/ soul system is unique and allows for many combinations. Haven t been to end game yet but what i have done deserves a rating of 10.</span>

The game Looks amazing and the game play is just as good. The class system is so open-ended that it makes replay value pretty high.

If you&apos;re looking for a game like World of Warcraft only that&apos;s new and actually has the outdoor areas matter (thanks to Rifts and invasions), then you&apos;ll love this game. The soul tree system is also pretty interesting. For people who like this genre, this game is definitely worth a look.</span>

WoW kept my attention for over five years, but it has become rather stale, and it hasn&apos;t done much to address its core deficiencies over the years.  Rift made the wise decision to not diverge radically from the familiar MMO format, but rather offer new twists and variations that really enhance the experience.  This very well executed balance makes Rift a familiar but refreshing experience.  Environments are pretty decent and atmospheric, the audio and visual quality is good, and the class variation and customization is the most welcome aspect of this game.  Just about the only thing that annoys me about this game is how much it penalizes you for trying to avoid fights - if you get hit from behind while running, a harsh debuff stacks up increasing the damage you take.  Combine that with the fact that you get knocked off your mount pretty easily, and the fact that level gaps make no difference to an enemy&apos;s aggro radius, and you have an environment in which simply getting around can be somewhat tiresome.  It&apos;s an annoyance, but the game overall is a nice, refreshing newcomer to an MMO world that is abundant in quantity but lacking in quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1525262">Expand</a></span>

With a slogan like &quot;You&apos;re not in Azeroth anymore&quot;, you&apos;d expect Rift to be a game bent on trying to break the mould and perhaps change the MMO genre.  You&apos;d only be partly right.  You&apos;re not in Azeroth, no, you&apos;re in an even worse designed and staler world with much less to do.  Class system - One of the main selling points of the game is the versatility of the classes, but it doesn&apos;t really exist, except in certain cases.  The underlying theme in class customisation in Rift is similar to other MMOs - if you customise your character&apos;s talents in the wrong way or attempt to create an interesting build, you will almost certainly fail throughout the content, which seems to be almost the same philosophy of WoW, which Trion Worlds attempts to insist that they are not.  The Warrior:  the usual plate-wearing class which ends up being the only viable tank in the game, but also has the best overall damage by far, making it imbalanced.  The Cleric:  a hybrid class that can sort of tank, is great at healing, and only does okay damage, despite the majority of their talent trees being damage-focused.  Also, if one wishes to heal as a Cleric, there are very few options available as any deviation from pre-determined builds will result in many party deaths.  The Mage:  The typical spell caster with a tree for healing allies via damage done and some great support talents, as well as very good damage, but still worse than the Warrior.<br><br>The Rogue:  Easily the worst class of all to play.  Despite traditionally being a pure damage class, their damage is easily beaten by every other class, except for the Cleric with which they are equal.  They have a tanking tree, but you can only tank one target with it and have very little survivability.  They also have a support tree, but it is easily replaced by the Mage&apos;s support tree, which provides far more buffs, debuffs, and can cure allies, unlike the Rogue&apos;s.  Magi also have the option to switch to their healing tree for more healing intensive fights, or to a damage tree and easily outperform a better-equipped Rogue.  It is a truly useless class.<br><br>Rifts - The namesake of the game, they are events that spawn enemies and provide reputation and experience.  These are fun at first, but quickly become tedious and repetitive.  There are also Invasions and Footholds, which are essentially rifts that don&apos;t despawn after a given time and usually take hold of a quest hub and/or certain reputation vendors, at which point all friendly NPCs disappear until the Invaders an/or Foothold are defeated.  This wouldn&apos;t normally be a problem, but all too often 10 or more Invasion forces (individually they are solo&apos;able) will occupy one particular point, making it impossible to clear out by yourself and therefor make it impossible to turn in and pick up new quests without begging in various chat channels for help.  There are end-game rifts, however, the required tools used to summon them drop from dungeons which provide far better rewards, so it seems pointless to do them when the same time could be put towards running those dungeons again, or simply solo&apos;ing normal rifts if you desire the reputation rewards.  All in all, rifts are not really a fun and exciting community experience, but more of a repetitive nuisance.<br><br>Dungeons:  The dungeon experience in Rift is almost exactly the same as in WoW.  The only difference is that at end-game, Expert dungeons (same as Heroics in WoW) require one of the DPS to fill a support buffer/minor healer role instead of the typical 1 tank / 1 heal / 3 DPS, but that is honestly where the changes end.  Just as in WoW, you&apos;ll experience the same dungeons but at a harder difficulty with a couple of extra bosses and slightly different mechanics than the lower level version.  You&apos;ll also get better loot than the lower level versions, and you&apos;ll earn tokens from killing bosses which you can turn in for even better gear or certain crafting ingredients.  Sounds a lot like Azeroth to me.  Crafting:  The crafting is very easy in Rift but the trade-off is that the high end crafted items are worse than the random mob drops in Experts.  The only reason to take on a profession would be to 1) make bigger bags, and 2) gather materials to sell on the auction house, which other people won&apos;t buy because the random drops are better than anything they can craft.<br><br>Graphics:  The graphics and overall look of the game is quite lackluster, and brings nothing special to the table.  It&apos;s a very bleak and dead world with very few colours and little artistic work.  The comparisons to WoW are usually seen as unfair and irrelevant among the Rift community, but they are completely valid.  Trion made it clear that they wanted to be compared to WoW, and specifically on how different and better Rift is.  However, they&apos;ve merely produced an equally priced knockoff with nothing special or innovative.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1614087">Expand</a></span>

We needed a break and that is definitely what we found in rift.  The first thing I noticed when I stepped into the beginners zone was how beautiful the game looked and sounded.  I don&apos;t have the best computer but even at medium settings it looks great.  The class system is a nice fresh way to get different specs as well,  when you can mix and match what ever you would like to make a tank, dps or healer on nearly every class.  The random rift openings and invasions help to keep things fresh for a bit, and the fact that you can jump into a public group and take care of these events or even jump into a group to finish a quest is great.  But in the end Rift is still a MMO and you will still get a multitude of quests of go here and kill this many enemies and then take this letter to that guy three feet from me because I&apos;m too lazy.  Rift is a great game and if you enjoy MMO&apos;s or are curious to play one this is a good game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1553094">Expand</a></span>

So anyway, this game is basically a cookie cutter theme park mmo, but it&apos;s probably the most stream lined and polished one I&apos;ve played.  The rifts are the gimmick of this game and they are pretty fun, but can get a little annoying at times.  Still, it&apos;s a nice addition.  The best thing about this game - the developers.  Crazy thing I know, but it&apos;s true.  They pump out INSANE amounts of content, easily more than double or triple most other mmo companies, and it&apos;s not just crap content.  I have a lot of respect for a company like this, and they address what players ask for.<br><br>In general the game has a lot of nice features:  great UI, rifts and zone events are awesome, constant world events, collection system, nice exploration carrots like puzzles and so forth, robust achievement system with rewards, alternate advancement system, nice realistic graphics, world full of immersion with npc chatter and scripted activities, swimming, day / night, weather, creatures, etc (if you&apos;ve played SWTOR you&apos;ve seen the exact opposite of world immersion).  The game does have negatives though like only 1 starter zone each, minimal races to choose from and they are all humanoid, lacking pvp, generic quest types, typical end game mechanics of raid or pvp, generic questing, smallish community, etc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=2083471">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_1690897"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">It&apos;s a good few months now since the release of Rift and the flaws within it and the ineptitude, incompetence and sheer lack of experience by Trion in the MMO scene is so shockingly evident at this stage.<br><br>The PvP in the game and the state of it, is absolutely dire and has been since the start, with no effort from Trion to even show a modicum of change to set things right.<br><br>The instanced PvP (warfronts as they&apos;re called, similar to Wow&apos;s Battlegrounds) although fun for a while, get very boring and repetitive - I should know, my main character is Rank 6 prestige in pvp.<br><br>That boredom and repetitive nature of the warfronts (coupled with Trion inexplicably and inexcusably allowing premade groups to farm those that have joined the warfronts as solo puggers) makes your goal toward the higher ranks in pvp an absolute horrible grind - and after all that, there&apos;s nothing to aim for other than going back to those same warfronts to compete against those same premades again and again - zero fun.<br><br>In the latest patch (June 2011) 1.3 - Trion attempted to address the premades wrecking everyone else&apos;s fun in the warfronts by splitting the queue system, so premades had to play premades and the solo pug players could just enjoy the fun of the warfront and the balanced challenge that they bring without premades destroying it for everyone.<br>Lo and behold though, not a week passed with that patch being implmented when Trion reverted on their change to the queue system and we&apos;re all back to square one.<br>When the 1.3 patch first hit, the queue to get into a warfront if you were solo was instant, even in the early hours of the morning, instant queue, decent enough fun.<br>When Trion reverted the change in the subsequent hotfix 5 - the queues have gone from instant to between 10 minutes to an hour or more, worse even outside of primetime hours.<br>This was mainly due to players just giving up at this stage, having had enough of the incompetance shown by Trion and coupled with a large majority of players boycotting the warfronts or just quitting the game completely - it really is that bad and it really is that big of a deal. That Trion have failed miserably to even forsee this, shows how bad and inexperinced they are to the MMO scene and the contempt with which they view the majority of their own paying customers.<br><br>World pvp is almost non existent and that which does exist is baseless and tiresome. There&apos;s no goal to any open world pvp, no point and no fun. Trions response to this was to introduce some daily pve based quests, kill this mob, collect this stuff, lalala, oh and as your reward ? Here, have some free pvp favor and prestige points (WHAT THE HELL!!!).<br>Oh, there was one daily quest which required you to kill members of the opposite faction - though the point of same on a pve server seems to be lost on Trion as that daily and none of the others auto flagged a person for pvp - seriously, face, palm, wall, head, bang, repeat...<br><br>From a PvE perspective, there&apos;s a bunch of 5 man dungeons which you will need to farm constantly (yawn...) to get plaques/tokens for Tier gear, most just skip the T1 dungeons and go straight for the T2&apos;s due to Trion making them so much easier in a previous patch - bad mistake. The Dungeons were fine as they were, they were hard, they were a challenge - now they&apos;re just another boring grind, something you have to do to get the gear to allow you progress your character for raiding purposes.<br><br>As for the Raids, they&apos;re a challenge at the start but generally, they&apos;re also fairly boring and lacklustre.<br><br>There is no real end game in Rift, there really isn&apos;t, no matter how many Trion shills will post otherwise on forums et all, there is no end game. At this moment in time in Rift, there is no point and nothing to aim for after you&apos;ve hit 50, ran the required dungeons to gear up and got yourself into a decent raiding guild. Once you&apos;ve done the raids a few times you&apos;re left wondering what the hell do you do now ? So you dabble in pvp maybe ? Oh no, no no no, just don&apos;t go there. I mean sure, you can throw a guild premade together maybe and steamroll all over a bunch of solo players - but honestly, how fun is that after a few times ? There&apos;s no competition, no fun, no challenge.<br><br>Rift had an awful lot of potential but alas, as always it seems the case these days, the developers themselves kill the game off before it&apos;s even had a chance to settle down to pull in the required amount of serious followers.<br><br>Don&apos;t bother with this game, don&apos;t waste your time. It&apos;s just another poor clone of Wow, badly implemented, badly supported and full of utter fail.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1690897">Expand</a></span>

This is either a good or a bad thing, depending on your experience. For me, it was a bad thing. Right from the start of this game, I couldn&apos;t find any reason to care about the plot or my character&apos;s progress. After character creation you&apos;re given a very small piece of lore to explain whats going on, and then sent to the leveling treadmill. To be fair, the Defiant&apos;s starting zone was actually pretty cool, and their story works well. The Guardian&apos;s however, is just..... bad. So with little incentive to read into the thin plot, I found myself grinding levels, professions, rifts, etc... then I realized that I&apos;d already spent 100&apos;s of hours doing the same thing in WoW - and honestly this game just convinced me to go back to WoW (which I haven&apos;t played in over a year). Seriously, with the time I&apos;ve invested in WoW and how many friends I have there, Rift offers absolutely nothing extra to make me want to make a permanent switch.<br><br>Anyway, great game engine, designed well, but absolutely no originality and therefore no lasting value.

The Soul engine is a nice addition to RPG, but it does not work very well and it confuses players ranging from newbies to mmo veterans. The crafting is an absolute joke, there is nothing new here, the same professions you can find in any other fantasy mmo and leveling them up is a child&apos;s play. The quests add nothing new to the genre, same kill X, gather Y time intensive tasks to keep you more in game. The gear and items are basically the same as in most mmos, I encountered dozens of profession items that have the same icons and names and probably even prices wow has.  I have to admit the Rifts are probably the best addition especially because it really makes players group together via the auto grouping feature so at least they are trying to not make it another solo rpg. All in all it is not worth it, either if you want an alternative to wow (and I&apos;m comparing it to wow because Trion marketed this game as a better, more polished alternative to the giant). So in conclusion this looked to me as a game especially made so that Trion can grab a big share of the mmo market and grow some capital. Honestly, you get more atmosphere and involvement from LOTRO (which is free) that this game. On the other hand, I am more curious on their upcoming game Defiance, I hope it will sur class this yet another second hand fantasy mmo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1710956">Expand</a></span>

Anyway, somehow I had enough patience to level up my character to maximum level  after that, I never regret that I did it!
<br>
<br>First of all., rift is completely different game than Wow. Talent system (soul system in rift) has been taking whole new level. Every 4 class haves several &quot;souls&quot; which are like talent trees (there is like 7+ soul per calss) and you can use 3 soul at the same time, for example: You can make your mage to be, warlock, chloromancer and necromancer at the same time! Soul system works great and its definitely one of the best things in rift.
<br>
<br>Also there is plenty of raids in rift, hard raids and then easy raids  something for everyone. Anyway, since storm legion came, people havent actually done old raids... Everyone is focusing on the new ones and that is such a shame for a new players.
<br>
<br>Rift came few months ago f2p mmorpg, so if you want to try and enjoy every aspect of this game  go on their website and download it. No more trials. Of course there is people who thinks that game is ruined now since there is coming huge flood of casual gamers, but there is still hardcore guilds.
<br>
<br>Now lets talk littlebit about how it runs on my computer. In my computer it doesnt run very well, I got pretty old computer. Game is pretty heavy to run, so you need good computer to run it ultra.
<br>
<br>I could write alot of rift, but Ill let you guys try it and decide do you like it or not. Sometimes its better to try it, than read reviews. I highly recommend rift for everyone  casual, semi hardcore and hardcore players. Theres is alot stuff to explore and most probably,  you who are reading this will like it </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=3474716">Expand</a></span>

The launch was pretty smooth and the game felt alot more finished than many MMOs at release. All great stuff.  Unfortunately, its so like World of Warcraft I just got serious dejavu all the time.   Now that might sound like a good idea but consider that Wow is something like 10 years old now.  It just feels out of date.  The PvP in particularly is a disaster.  World pvp has no integration or objective so in reality your just harassing people which soon gets boring.  There is a lack of end game content and for the first weeks until recently to hide this Trion just made the game harder and harder.  People started to leave in frustration, both at the lack of content and the lack of difficulty.  So a week or 2 ago in some sort of kneejerk reaction they dumbed the game down to the point where pretty much anyone can do anything.  Reducing everything to a mindless grind and putting a massive skill gap between the end game raids and the general instances dungeons. (Same ones you probably already done a 100x or more).   If you like PvP then this is probably the worst MMO choice you could make.  If you like WoW, your probably already playing it.   Also, forgot to mention, it runs like a lame dog on high end machines.  particularly multi gpu.    All this has resulted in a game loosing subscribers hand over fist (at least on the pvp servers I play on) I actually cancelled my subscription today.  I had more than 50 people on my friends list 4 weeks after launch.  Now, only 1 or 2 are still playing.   Its cartoony and its simple, its very safe for kids being highly corny with some of the most corny cartoonish voice acting you will see this side of loony tunes. I would feel comfortable with my teenage kids playing it. is probably the only real positive I can offer on this after experiencing as much as I can get out of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=1621233">Expand</a></span>

Where WoW dumbs down class systems Rift went the opposite way of creating a very innovative way of allowing you to do what you want.  In terms of PVE and PVP content you will find it is very generic but it does it well.  The game is truley beautiful in terms of graphics but I believe this Realism graphics does not age well (oblivion, everquest 2)  The most excellent MMO dev team in the world have developed this game, with massive content (PVE content only though) in every patch makes this game a PVE&apos;ers heaven.
<br>
<br>The only downside to Rift is the PVP, they do not cater to their PVP community by adding real open world PVP, PVP rifts do not count as they are in no terms a good way to supplement Warfronts in terms of pvp progression.  They need a PVP world Zone with excellent rewards to pull in players.  Great game overall, maxed out 3 characters and enjoyed every minute.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=2055648">Expand</a></span>

They just added a whole new area to the world called Ember Island and have plans to to bring another area in called the Planetouched Wilds! This is big stuff and they are not even expansions this monthly updates. You don&apos;t get that with WOW. This game has it all check it out!</span>

I have played each class extensively, and they all work well, although PVP tends to be unbalanced (with different classes taking turns being way OP).  I especially enjoyed playing as a Chloromancer, as it allowed me to play a type of role that felt fresh and a little bit innovative.  The problem with Rift, unfortunately, is the end game.  It quickly becomes a boring grind, where you end up doing fairly tedious things over and over again.  PVP in the same battlegrounds.  Do the same daily quests.  Run the same instances.  You know the drill, and in Rift, the drill doesn&apos;t have the staying power that I was hoping for.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rift/user-reviews?user_review_id=2308395">Expand</a></span>
