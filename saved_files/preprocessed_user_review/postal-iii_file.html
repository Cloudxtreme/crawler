Postal 2 had a sense of humor to be shared with the worst South Park episodes.  Postal 2 had it&apos;s bugs and crashes were to be expected.  Postal 2 had a confusing map and annoying load zones.  Then again Postal 2 was made in 2003. That&apos;s a good 9 years ago that the game dropped and 9 years ago flaws like that were more acceptable. To have a  game come out in 2012 and have those problems is just plain embarrassing.  While the fans will be split along lines of &quot;is this game faithful or not&quot; and i have to say in some regards it is.  If you play the Postal series for buggy gameplay and horrendous crashing, on par with the AWP mod but that&apos;s a mod not a game sold for money, then you&apos;ll be happy.  If you came for the humor you&apos;ll be disappointing.  While much of the dialog is the one liners you would expect the feel of the new town is terrible.  Many portions of the game are not fun and most of the missions are more bland than an MMO. I stopped playing the game halfway through the meager campaign just so i could play Postal 2 and have fun, a major component missing in this sequel</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/postal-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2115794">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Postal series was a simple concept. Test your violence as you complete mundane errands. Of course, know that fate often turns against you. Well, this is just Postal. You have to play it to understand it.
<br>
<br>The game works on Valve Source Engine which may make a player think that he/she encounters a good game. The fact is, Source is very advanced engine, so the available options of graphics, sound etc. are extensive and one can adjust settings to balance performance. Oh god, what could I give to feel like that by going through this mess.
<br>
<br>Story like a story, in Postal it didn&apos;t have any major meaning and sense. Same thing is here, but developers decided to continue the story from Postal 2. After the Paradise town has been destroyed by nuclear warhead,of course with our help, Postal Dude moved to the town called Catharsis, to start a better life and find a job. Our goal is to get the job. Everything is covered in typical for Postal humour, controversy and limits of good taste. But one thing made me suspicious. The name of this town. Does the word Catharsis was a message sent by TM Studios? The answer is clear. Everyone who played this will need a relief to nightmares and trauma caused by the game&apos;s content.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is nothing compared to prequel. In Postal 2, player can (despite given errands) without limits kill innocent bystanders, explore a big town and the only true danger was the Police. In new Postal this aspect is gone. Forget about the open world and careful exploration. Catharsis is much smaller than Paradise. The game is linear, just like Apocalypse Weekend. All you have to do is only complete your tasks. Enemies spawn like crazy, so you won&apos;t have time for any calm walking.
<br>
<br>Postal 3 gave us something new to gameplay. The path choice. Yes. We can choose to keep evil side of Postal Dude, and support Uncle Dave, or (and I&apos;m not joking) become a kind policeman and defend the law. I thought that developers ate drain cleaner in bulk quantities before they made this game. And what we are going to do as a freshly hired police officer? We are going to stun everyone with tazer and cuff them. Prisoners escaped from cells? Stun and cuff them all. Attackers in a park? Stun and cuff them all. Pissed off feminists in action? Stun and cuff them all. Good path is longer than Evil one, but what sense the game has on doing the same thing?
<br>
<br>No bad word can be said about sick armory. We have a shovel, well known by fans, gasoline can with matches, badger saw, brand new machine gun, thrown bee hive and cats usable as silencers or dervish. In short, superior entertainment for murderers. Unfortunately despite enormous inventory, I found a big need for firearms. Apart from gas can we won&apos;t find anything. Also there&apos;s no flamethrower made of lighter and deodorant. But this is nothing compared to the shooting itself. Since the game is in third person, we are using firearms from the back. This is logical. Complete lack of recoil, yet inaccurate controls are oddity. The biggest problem is fist fight. It looks like the protagonist has hands made of cotton and he was after three strokes before attacking an enemy. Punching the air is very common.
<br>
<br>Graphics of Postal 3 is a joke. It seems to be picture of previous generation. Lots of saturation and improper shadows. Lighting is also messed up. And the biggest surprise  everything has been made in Source.
<br>
<br>Music of the game is great. It fits well to the game. Psychedelic variation of rock and metal is like cure for the  cancer caused by this game. I cannot say the same about FX. Weapon shots sound like hitting the table with a piece of meat. All voices apart from Postal Dude ones, are annoying.
<br>
<br>Artificial intelligence leaves a lot to wish about. The enemies are fighting us like morons. And difficulty of the game is not flat. Remember the police in Postal 2? Escape from it was a challenge. How situation looks here? If player annihilated certain amount of bystanders with machete for instance, one police officer is sent to the area that stands still and inflicts damage on player. But if we move few buildings away, our blue friends completely forget about everything. But lack of effort has been shown in escort missions, which made me put a fork into my eye sockets. NPCs often stop on walls and lose path. Player has to move backwards to see if escorted person is not stuck. They sometimes don&apos;t move at all.
<br>
<br>Performance of the game is poor. It&apos;s buggy and framerate often decreases.
<br>
<br>If most stuff in Postal 3 could be improved, the game would be be better than prequel. We will no longer experience the story of Postal Dude properly, thanks to this crap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/postal-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=3225354">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Storyline was nice and the and it had some funny bits which I initially played it for, the game had much game breaking glitches which gave a terrible gameplay experience for me.
<br>If the game had less glitches and graphical errors I would really recommend it for it&apos;s humor and story line, but the previous games which were made in-house were better, with less glitches and more varieties what to do, but I guess akella knew thew weren&apos;t making a triple A game, and the people at RWS were probably extremely disappointed, Postal III cost the series and RWS probably aren&apos;t going to make another postal game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/postal-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=4292646">Expand</a></span>

If it was not for that it would be a good game. I would say screw  Akella and release the patches myself if I where them. But there are so many freak-en bugs I doubt RWS will be able to fix them and probably just blame it on valve when it was poor dissensions made by them. Which lead to a completely unplayable game, and if you look in the positive reviews some of them are made by the developers themselves. While others I am guessing either have found a way to get the Russian patch working or never played the game itself, There is no avoiding glitches or bugs that will make you fustraighted with this game. Go with postal 10th anniversary instead if your going to buy a postal game. Its much more worth it than this cash-in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/postal-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2085626">Expand</a></span>

A little laggy, which should not be on a PC with an 8 core processor and 16 GB of ram. The graphics world provided no eye candy. The sound FX would cut out. Missions are BORING.

People must know how bad this is, just so they don&apos;t make the same mistake as I did. Are you a fan of modern shooters? Are you a fan of games with a stable engine? Are you a fan of Postal series? Then this game is definitely not for you. I&apos;ve never seen such a poor made use of the Source engine. Horrible hit detection, weapons that are rendered useless by the poor implemented controls, what else can I say? To be honest, I&apos;m more than halfway through the game and the only weapon I consistently use is the taser. Advantages? Ranged weapon, with unlimited ammunition. It&apos;s more than enough to get you through. Why then put at our disposal 20 plus weapons when we&apos;re able to get through the game with one? Talk about unbalanced. Then there&apos;s the humour, which remains Postal typical humour, and it&apos;s just about the only positive aspect of this game.

Never before have I seen a release so heavily botched. Even Valve seems to be unsure of it&apos;s release, as they&apos;ve been debating over how to handle the unlocking and the store page. You can get a steam code for the game in only one of two ways due to this: 1. By paying an RWS guy $40 and waiting for him to, eventually, email you a code or 2. Buying it from one of a few smaller online download sites and getting a Steam code from them. You can&apos;t get it from Steam, as they&apos;ve even decided to drop the store page.<br>Beyond the horrible release issues, there&apos;s the horrible gameplay issues. The game crashes constantly, it freezes, there&apos;s weird graphical bugs that range from just being annoying to being downright hilarious, there&apos;s a wide variety of gameplay bugs that prevent the player from even continuing the game...<br>Aside from the bugs, they&apos;ve also removed the freedom Postal 2 had. Now, instead, it&apos;s a level-based linear game reminiscent of the expansion pack to Postal 2, only a lot less funny. The humor... I swear to god it&apos;s less Postal 1 &amp; 2 and more Uwe Boll&apos;s Postal film. It&apos;s trying too damn hard to be edgy, and in the end it feels less like a fun, raunchy experience and more like a little kid that just learned some cuss words and ethnic slurs.<br>Go grab, say, Bulletstorm instead. Hell, even Duke Nukem Forever. Postal 3 honestly makes Duke Nukem Forever look like Duke Nukem 3D.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/postal-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2102847">Expand</a></span>

The missions are fun on paper, but being levels you&apos;re constricted to an area. This down plays the previous games &quot;Run around and smash **** up&quot; appeal as you find yourself more focused on the missions due to the constriction.<br><br>As I mentioned before the missions are fun on paper but carrying them out isn&apos;t that much fun most of the time. The game throws waves and waves of enemies at you and expects you to take cover, (which is the worse implementation I&apos;ve seen. You&apos;ll hide behind low cover only to be standing getting shot) which just doesn&apos;t come natural.<br><br>Furthermore some of the weapons feel weak and melee attacks feel like your s**tfaced flailing your arms.<br><br>The AI is also pretty bad, it mainly runs to its death (although it will take cover and cover fire ocassionally), but your allies are the worst they will litterally shoot you in the face, or either good or bad AI will just stand around doing nothing.<br><br>Unlike the second game there is a chance of  completing it without killing anyone because of the morality added to the game, I liked how it dictated what missions you would do(even if it is boolean good or bad), but still it leads me to the games main problem (at this time), the bugs.<br><br>How about a taser that randomly crashes the game, or not being able to complete a level because a door won&apos;t open, not to mention random crashes, lag, sound cutting out (I swear there was a soundtrack you&apos;re supposed to listen to in game)<br><br>Duke Nukem Forever has been bashed around a lot last year, but I had no problem with that game, I know the problems it had in development, but at the same time I realise I&apos;m probably wearing rose tinted glasses. But not with Postal III. I have to say that it tops Duke Nukem Forever for being bad.<br><br>Anyway in summary:<br><br>Good//<br>Good graphics<br>Funny story &amp; mostly interesting mission objectives<br>Nice implementing morality although it could be improved (and fixed logically)<br>Interesting assortment of weapons<br><br>Bad//<br>Level based<br>Bugs<br>Weapon damage<br>Sound<br>AI<br>Cover<br>Game Design<br><br>Buyer beware!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/postal-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2090279">Expand</a></span>

And I think all 10 score reviews are written by developers.</span>

The only redeeming quality is that it is funny in places and that&apos;s it, simply put it this game isn&apos;t worth the 5 year wait or your hard earned cash at all</span>

Obviously it is seriously flawed with bugs and graphical errors, but over all that, there is still some of that classic postal humor, and it looks pretty nice on the source engine. From me, this game only gets a 7. I would give it an 8 or 9 if they were to implicate free roam and make some bug fixes.</span>

After 9 years, we&apos;re &quot;treated&quot; to a game with, frankly, one of the most abysmal framerate issues I&apos;ve ever seen, tons of screen-tearing, more bugs than a one-star hotel during summer in Florida, innumerable crashes, large amounts of lines pulled straight from the previous game, INCREDIBLY boring gameplay that took away most of the freedom Postal 2 had, worse voice acting than the previous game, and broken mechanics everywhere you look. I tried long as hard (Oh, look! There&apos;s a good amount of the game&apos;s jokes right there!) to find something fun about this but, rather disappointingly, there were none.  If you wanna go postal, get the second game and have yourself a good time.<br><br>That is all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/postal-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2248688">Expand</a></span>

What sold me on the game were the features of acts of violence and crudeness allowed in this game which are fun! However, I dislike having to utilize steam because it&apos;s an additional step and login process which I find tedious and annoying and unnecessary for a pc game. I have been fortunate enough where I have never encountered any bugs during or immediately following gameplay, so I can&apos;t provide any real input on those sorts of stories. I will, however, say that the actual pace of the game is annoying to me because it&apos;s similar to a comic book story where the voiceover is cheesy, sudden, and abrupt. I may be in the middle of an intense action sequence and then all of the fun comes to a halt where I am supposed to learn about some new hotkeys and special attacks I have. I find that the game teaches me how to play it more than actually allows me the fun of playing it. It&apos;s like one giant tutorial on how to play the game, with little actual gameplay. Generally it&apos;s a fun game, but learning the special moves and whatnot slows it down and forces me to read and learn. I want to actually play continously, beating people up left and right, not sit around listening to the sleezy voiceover. It&apos;s still worthwhile for the overall immaturity involved.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/postal-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2715680">Expand</a></span>

So as for the controls, theres lots of glitches, game crashes, AI gets in my way, sometimes its hard to punch/pour gasoline, graphics are outdated(But I don&apos;t rate based on graphics, I love me some n64) But for the plus- its got good humor, good characters, lots of gore and dismemberment, decent weapon selection, and quite a few medium sized maps. Although the animations can be cheesy, the scenery of the map makes up for it in most cases. So should you buy it? Up to you, in my opinion if your a postal fan YES. If your new to postal, wait for the price to drop to 30 before you even consider buying. So in the end as for a fan - 7/10 (8 if the glitches were totally removed). And for any gamer 5.7/10. Its fun.<br>-Quick edit, if you are looking for a hardcore serious game, look elsewhere this is for people with a good sense of humor. I&apos;m only giving it 10 here just so i can get the rating up a little</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/postal-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2070096">Expand</a></span>

Postal 3 has some sense of humor but it`s too stupid and frankly. If you could spend your time with playing Postal (2003), now it sucks. Just save your 13$ and you`ll be glad.</span>

<br>
<br>For fans its a great game, It has a heap of game breaking bugs that badly need fixing. I was stuck halfway in the road at one stage. Another was the level just wouldn&apos;t end, I also couldn&apos;t get up the stares in 1 level. All these are game breakers. Had to stop and reload as there is no way to get past.
<br>
<br>Other than the huge amount of bugs it was a fun game. A bit repetitive in the speech but still I enjoyed most of it. I give it an 7/10 as its got so many bugs. I&apos;d give it a 10/10 if it looked better and had no bugs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/postal-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2246990">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Postal III is a fun game but it has lot of issues that keep you from enjoying the game, I would wait for this game to go down in price before you get it. Gameplay is not as good as Postal II but it&apos;s still fun and the story is entertaining but the bugs drag this game down. Wait for this to go on sale and then buy it or wait for this game to be patched.</span>

The frequent crashing is annoying, the aiming is off, the AI leaves a lot to be desired but at the same time the RWS team still delivers on the humor. I see a future for this game after a couple of more patches and some added content but unless that happens there really isn&apos;t much hope for it.</span>

The AI is Slightly better then the previous game, The story line is rail road with no free roam but you do get a chance to play through good, or evil which is fun. The graphics, and music are better then Postal 2. It plays much like Duke Nukem Forever, Goofy good time.</span>

<br>
<br>I will not call it the &quot;real&quot; Postal III as i can see that RWS will remake the game by themselves in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/postal-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2857416">Expand</a></span>
