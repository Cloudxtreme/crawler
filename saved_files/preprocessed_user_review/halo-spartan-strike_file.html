<br>
<br>However, there are more vehicles, weapons and grenades (both UNSC as Covenant), and more Armor Abilities that we saw in the previous game, Spartan Assault. We also have new enemies, some more challenging...
<br>
<br>The gameplay is a little confusing for those who came from Spartan Assault. The change of weapons and grenades are in different keys (1 and 2, from keyboard respectively). And now, we have an assistant (not Cortana, of course), who tells you the objectives of the mission, which makes the game a litte bit more interesting. And to get some achievements, we have to play with certain skulls selected, which makes the game very hard...
<br>
<br>The Soundtrack is similar to the predecessor game. And the Storyline is interesting. Halo: Spartan Strike is not a big deal, but it&apos;s cool and fun, really.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halo-spartan-strike/user-reviews?user_review_id=6235188">Expand</a></span>
