The people on the Kerberos forms are rabid fanboys who attack anybody for even gently criticizing the game, and the lead developer may just be more arrogant and opinionated than Derek Smart. The game as it is is extremely poor, and given the attitude of the devs, I sincerely doubt that anybody who buys the game and requests changes or added features will be given the time of day. It&apos;s just not worth it, folks. There might be a game here, but between the arrogance of the devs and the sloppiness of the game, it&apos;s not worth it - even for a budget title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars/user-reviews?user_review_id=390423">Expand</a></span>

As one of the critic reviews said, there are some really good features in this title that should probably be in a better game.</span>

The graphics are (or were) not bleeding edge when the game was released and the voice over is really bad. But the game... the game is really, really good. for example, the technology tree is not the same on each game, which forces the player to think about new strategies, and the different combinations of weapons and ship types makes it even more challenging.<br><br>The tutorial that comes with the game is RUBBISH, but if you want to learn how to play it and the different technologies the the site http://sots.rorschach.net/ is a great resource (it was build by the same guy who did the tutorial videos). I have to say that given that the game is quite complex, no tutorial might be enough to explain all the game (imagine a Flight Simulator tutorial in a super-real game).<br><br>Games also takes a while to finish (~3-4 hours for a short game with 60 stars). I&apos;ve never played a big game (350 stars, 8 players), but I reckon that it might take about a week and get boring when each player has already researched all the technologies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars/user-reviews?user_review_id=1940910">Expand</a></span>

The original released version was a Beta, wrong file uploaded to Steam, I understand mistakes happen, so another version was uploaded the following day.  Well nothing really changed and the publisher admitted on their forums that they knew the product was bad they were going to release and patch it.  Menus are grayed out so they cannot be selected, such as options, no scenarios maps but a tab, the encyclopedia which they tell you to use for information appears to be mostly empty.  The manual was a draft copy that the published put on the forums, how do you not have a manual completed for release? The graphics are beautiful but without just clicking around its next to impossible to figure out how anything works.  No tutorial, no intro missions,  no manual, no encyclopedia.  Horrible game, horrible release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars/user-reviews?user_review_id=1823342">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a shame that so many reviewers say &quot;the combat&apos;s broken&quot; when in fact all the issues they list in regards to the combat are issues that can be resolved by proper research. You&apos;re limited in how many ships you bring into a fight? Research in command and control ships so that you can increase the number of ships you start with in battles and control what reinforcements you bring in too. There ARE combat statistics available after fights. You have a full event log detailing every single turn taken. There&apos;s a management screen for all your planets . .I could go on and on. This is the type of game that looks very simple to pick up, but is increadibly well designed, and deep. And to be honest the interface with it&apos;s sleek looks helps to hide some of the deeper details available, but they are indeed there. I enjoy playing this game, I&apos;m very glad someone decided to go back to this genre. This type of quality software hasn&apos;t been around for a long while. Highly reccomended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars/user-reviews?user_review_id=391073">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> I think this game is extremely intresting, the humor in the voice acting is very amusing and the simplified controls make it easy. Also I like that you can assign temporary squads while in the battle, makes for easier ship control. I give it a 9 as it could be better. I&apos;m probably going to buy this one.</span>

Some use warpgates, some use jumplanes, some just fly along. The races you&apos;ve seen before. Research is lacking depth. In fact the whole game is lacking depth.

First of all, the game consisting of the demo is a horribly gutted shade of the full game; it represents something like 15% of the techs and gameplay of the full game. Even the AI was reduced to a sort of &quot;HULK SMASH!&quot; mentality and is much more clever and balanced aggression-wise than can be seen in the demo. Second, the strategic screen isn&apos;t &quot;too simple&quot;, it&apos;s straightforward and uncomplicated to avoid information overload. Things like lists of your colonies and fleets are just one step away by clicking on the pie chart representing empire finance. I will admit that the tutorial is rather lackluster, and a lack of a list of hotkeys is probably a bit of a handicap, and the voice acting can be sketchy sometimes, but you have to remember this is a small company making the best of limited resources. Furthermore, the devs themselves have said the tutorial is getting an overhaul. Also, in regards to tactical combat, you have to realize that 1. Selecting the Standoff or Close to Attack fleet stances are basically telling the AI to play for you, and for basic ships like Armors, it&apos;ll actually do a pretty good job, 1.a. Ships won&apos;t respond to new move orders under those stances until they&apos;ve dealt with nearby opposition, 2. If you want the most control, just stick with the Normal option and give all attack and move orders yourself, 2.a. Ships in that stance obey your orders /completely/ and so won&apos;t necessarily turn to bring all weapons to bear, and 3. Your ships have inertia; if you tell them to burn towards a distant target, they&apos;re going to counter-burn to turn around if they overshoot it. In closing, if you have a lot of questions about the game or you&apos;re just confused, come over to the forums. People are very helpful over there and can probably straighten you out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars/user-reviews?user_review_id=390347">Expand</a></span>

There are two playable races in the demo, Human and Tarka. There are two more in the full game Hiver and Liir. Humans get the unique node-drive system that greatly increases their ships speed and range. The Tarka ships are slightly more powerful in combat but travel slower and require refueling more often. Hiver ships are very slow but the have a unique gating system. Liir ships travel by their own unique system and are stealthier. The strategic interface is a 3D star map. At the start of the game you have your initial colonies, some starting funds optional starting techs. It&apos;s not quite as streamlined and efficient as Master of Orion II. It works better if memorize all the hotkeys. Like most 4x games,iInitally you will want to eXplore and eXpand. Later you will eXploit resources and eXterminate rivals. Exploring new stars reveals a single planet. Sometimes it can be a good location for a new colony or a cost prohibitive dust ball. Occasionally, you will run into an unknown menace when exploring and must immediately do battle. An unknown menace in the form of a meteor storm will likely threaten one your colonies later in the game. The Research tree is simple enough but some techs are randomized. That can lead to some frustration but there is a mod to make all of them available if you wish to use it. The technology tree consists mainly of ship upgrades but also includes technology that will increase production or make colonizing other worlds easier. There are more interesting technologies higher up the tree in the full game. The graphics are an improvement over other games of this genre somewhat dated compare to other new releases. The voices provide necessary information, when research is completed, if an enemy fleet is spotted, etc. The sound is adequate for a game of this genre. The tactical combat portion is probably the game&apos;s best feature. The ships are fully 3D models and their turrets move to target enemy ships. The only health indicator is flames and sparks coming from a damaged ship. Formations are the key to success. The tactical combat interface does take some getting used to. First time players will likely become frustrated until they get the hang of it. Overall, I&apos;d say it&apos;s a descent game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars/user-reviews?user_review_id=390970">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As the PC Zone UK reviewer said, a simple &quot;Total War&quot; concept makes the whole game fun, but there are a number of loose bolts in the interface as well as some game design considerations that upgrades the tactical interface ONLY if research particular technologies.
<br>
<br>This game is also mainly about blowing the other races to space dust, and with limited focus on other aspects of the game. It is honestly a &quot;War&quot; space 4X simulator, with lip service to diplomacy, basic colony management to get you into the business of researching a randomized tech tree, designing ships, building ships, organizing fleet into formations to maximize their impact and then hurling them at the enemy whether en masse or with finesse and committing mass genocide afterwards.
<br>
<br>The Tutorial doesn&apos;t tell you any of these though! I myself almost made the mistake of tossing the game demo aside at the first glance. But I stuck with it after a while, and was rewarded with how to unlock the tech tree that improves the style of the game dramatically.
<br>
<br>If you are looking for a game that has some sense of cultural aspects, galatic intrigue (there is NO episonage at all) and making peace with everybody and getting yourself elected to win, there is no such means for you to do so in the game, and I strongly advise you to look to other titles instead. A review from a person expecting such things will be horribly bad, as expected.
<br>
<br>Furthermore, the overall game core mechanics are fun for MP skirmishes with short turns, the ability to expand and ramp up technology fairly quickly as well makes it ideal for shorter MP games, compared to how long such 4x games can stretch (try a game of Civ 4 for example.)
<br>
<br>In all, not a bad first game from the developers, and hopefully, they will improve on the UI and the &quot;Total War&quot; concept in the upcoming patches.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars/user-reviews?user_review_id=59846">Expand</a></span>

However, even with all that, the game still ends up fun. I have been a 4x space strategy buff for 10 years or so now. I&apos;ve got to say that my personal favorite remains Space Empires II, but that was years ago. Recently, Galactic Civ 2 did a good job, but I wasn&apos;t a fan of the way they handled the star map. And it too suffered from poor interface (far worse, i believe, then this game). For now, I would rate this at a 7, but that may go up or down slightly after I play it more extensively. I&apos;d have to say that a lot of the people here have been unnecessarily rough on the game after playing a limited demo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars/user-reviews?user_review_id=391044">Expand</a></span>

What seems simple at first just keeps throwing new surprises at you. Don&apos;t judge this game by the limited demo, there is way more to this game.</span>

SotS changed that! Others may complain that they have a hard time understanding some things. That&apos;s because Kerberos has gotten rid of a lot of the noise and left as much of the signal as possible. You can&apos;t stop the signal. Each race is so different, it&apos;s almost as if I&apos;ve paid $40 for four different games. The settings upon game start are such that you can play a fast-and-furious game (few stars more players) a medium paced game or a truely epic game (max stars, max players). For those that like to play with the tech tree, you could also play a game with only one opponent and 500 stars. Might be a bit slow for most folks, though. The only things KP could do to make this game better are minor, minor tweaks not work downgrading even half a rating point all together.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars/user-reviews?user_review_id=391080">Expand</a></span>

The fact that you can shoot individual weapons or the engine or any other part of the enemy ships and bases can make things hectic. If you have 30 ships and you target them at the individual items that you want them to hit that takes a truly frenetic effort. The rest is very similar to MOO 1.</span>

Rather than being idiotic and redundant with continuous strings of &quot;improved&quot; and &quot;upgraded&quot; and &quot;ultra&quot; prefixed tech tree entries the people at K-P were actually inventive with the techs, and the randomized tree can sometimes throw you into situations for things like weapon configurations you wouldn&apos;t normally have considered with the entire tree always being the same. The UI does have some minor issues (many of which were brought to light in the suggestions forum and were considered and accepted despite what some may say) but the company is working diligently on it. Not perfect yet, but a mile above the rest of the market by my tastes. I&apos;d also like to add that reviewing a game solely on playing the demo (especially with comments on the limited tech tree and lack of variety) is particularly asinine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars/user-reviews?user_review_id=391827">Expand</a></span>

Managing the large maps is virtualy imposible, but then you can scale the map down considerably to much more managable levels. The Tech Tree, with variable tech each time you use it, is great, but some times its REALY anoying. For instance you put in ages worth of research into a tech you dont realy want, but you want what it leads to, and you dont get the later development. It would be nice if at the start of the game you could have the option to choose what tech can be researched, or leave it at random. Combat... ..leave it to the AI, its less entertaining, but the AI has far better controle of the ships than you do. If your going to win anyway then you can play, but if its a 50/50 split the AI&apos;s extra controle will win out. When your designing ships you dont get any information on the parts your putting in. You either have to remember, which once you know the techtree isnt too bad, what each upgrade and weapon dose. Or you have to look it up... ..not very intuative. Sound effects and Voice Acting... ..lets just gloss over them. The weapons are good, but the GUI noises are anoying rather than useful and the Voice acting is bad enough to be in an episode of dubed Pokemon. When in the strategic screen, turn the sound down. That said the rest of the game is great, reasonable graphics and good strategic gameplay make it entertaining. Its Tech tree is very broad and is not just focused on &quot;Bigger Guns GOOD!&quot; and that is a pleasent change in this type of game. Anougher good point is this is the only game of this type that can be picked up and played without reading the manual. But at the same time its got enough parts with finess to keep it entertaining. Also theres some mods for it, and it can be modified by anybody with a good archiver plus a basic text editor. Oh, and disable your daemon tools, its got a thing against it. It kept complaining that it was being run from a virtual drive when it was not... ..anoying but not the games fault, its the CD securities. Oh and I use it because there is a giant crack in my san an disc and I dont want to damage my drives by having it shatter in them. In all I recomend this game, just remember it has faults before ripping the CD from the drive and jumping on it screaming &quot;I KNOW THE *Random Expletive* RESEARCH IS COMPLETE!&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars/user-reviews?user_review_id=391933">Expand</a></span>

Apart from the great gameplay, I have some gripes. Large Galaxies are difficult and unwieldy due to the Interface design. Also, the promised &apos;Real Time Strategy&apos; doesn&apos;t exist. All combat is decided based on the techs you bring to the fight. The game gets somewhat streamlined in Multiplayer when everybody has to rush a couple of beginning tech just to level the playing field. One of the best features of SOTs as it&apos;s called is the random tech that&apos;s generated each created game. While the Tech cores are a given for each race, random tech branches each game, changes your tech strategy and eventually your &apos;fleet design&apos; strategy and formation.<br><br>A very decent offering by Kerebos.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sword-of-the-stars/user-reviews?user_review_id=1827256">Expand</a></span>
