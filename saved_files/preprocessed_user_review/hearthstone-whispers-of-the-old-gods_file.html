Basically, Blizz forces you to use new cards by making them so much stronger. Some of the older cards can as well be deleted from the game and very few will notice that they&apos;re gone (since nobody uses them anyway).</span>

<br>
<br>It is not a game that rewards its gamer&apos;s for their time and investment, so they get better and progress, instead every time they achieve it matches them against something x5 times better. This is because it makes melon head get an even fatter head. A head that literally should be knocked about like a pinata until balanced cards and fair play fall out. The cards aren&apos;t balanced and neither are its classes,, because freaking melon head only fancied himself  as that class its best. The game constantly disconnects it players, unlike any other game they play, because melon head greedily steals all the money instead of even doing basic server maintenance. Melon head server maintenance was programming in more melon headed bots to rig any outcomes.
<br>
<br>Everything in this game is rigged from the way the cards are drawn, the way any cards attack, the sequence the cards attack, and every opponent you are fixed against.
<br>
<br>Do us all a favor and put this crappy game just where it belongs. We might suggest the steam pro tourney version might be fairer. No it still had the same melon headed concepts to begin with, where you are literally just watching a computer choose and rigging your luck. Because any deck will win and every deck will lose, but it is up to the computer just what it decides. Stomp that freaking melon head in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-whispers-of-the-old-gods/user-reviews?user_review_id=6755993">Expand</a></span>

It utterly shocks me that Blizzard really thought they could get away with doing this. Whispers of The Old Gods is one of the most gigantic failures of a game update/DLC I have ever seen. There are three clear reasons for this;
<br>
<br>1.) Blizzard broke their promise.
<br>When Hearthstone first began, Blizzard promised that all cards they released would remain relevant. With the WoTOG expansion, however, they made the past two expansions null and void for the &quot;official&quot; game mode called &quot;standard&quot;.
<br>
<br>2.) Obvious money grab.
<br>A lot of the problems Hearthstone had was the over-powered classes and cards in the game, specifically the cards from the Naxxramas and GvG expansions along with some infamous decks such as Ramp Druid and Patron Warrior. As a result, whenever Blizzard released a new expansion, it made little to no money since everyone kept using the Naxx and GvG cards. This could have all been fixed with some patches and updates, but Blizzard chose not to do this. Why? Because THERE&apos;S NO MONEY IN DOING THAT.
<br>
<br>Instead they simply got rid of all those cards all together and forced people to buy the newest expansion in order to win games. It is the most blatant money-grab Blizzard has ever pulled that the fans weren&apos;t fooled for a second.
<br>
<br>3.) Goodbye Control, Hello Rush Decks!
<br>The heads of the Hearthstone department at Blizzard made it blatantly clear that with the new WoTOG expansion they wanted to make the game more control/late-game oriented instead of aggressive and rush-based. Well remember how I said earlier that Blizzard got rid of the Naxx and GvG cards? Well, THOSE WERE THE CARDS CONTROL DECKS USED TO STAND A CHANCE AGAINST RUSH DECKS.
<br>
<br>So instead of having a control-deck META, Blizzard accomplished the EXACT OPPOSITE in the WoTOG expansion. Now you can&apos;t play/win a single game without a Aggro Shaman, Face Hunter or some overpowered rush deck being involved.
<br>
<br>So this expansion was a massive failure because not only did Blizzard break their promise, they made this expansion an obvious cash-grab which accomplished the exact opposite it was supposed to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hearthstone-whispers-of-the-old-gods/user-reviews?user_review_id=6708326">Expand</a></span>

You can only play 1 card in pretty much every turn,so if RNG decides that your opponent draws better cards or cards that counter your cards, you just lose the game and vice versa. Also, the community is retarded (I mean, they still play the game, duh).</span>

You can only play 1 card in pretty much every turn,so if RNG decides that your opponent draws better cards or cards that counter your cards, you just lose the game and vice versa. Also, the community is retarded (I mean, they still play the game, duh).</span>
