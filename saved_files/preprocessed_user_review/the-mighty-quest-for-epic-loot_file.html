The plot belongs in a garbage can, doesnt even try and attempts to be funny by poking fun of itself but falls far short. The idea of a vast array of custom player made dungeons sounds great, but falls completely flat. Players do not design dungeons to be fun, but to be as frustratingly difficult to deter other players from attacking. This isnt because players are poor spirited, but because game design encourages you to. Player levels come slowly, making the game extremely grinding. Any attempt to make the game more playable requires a premium pay currency. If this game was balanced, retold and redesigned it would be a 9/10. But instead its a shabby money grabbing dungeon crawler that falls flat fast. Give it a whirl if your bored and dont have anything decent to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=4043611">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game has updates on a weekly basis that continually break existing features in an attempt to &quot;balance&quot; the broken mess that currently is MQFEL. If Steam had any form of quality control, this game would never have made it out of Early Access, as it is far from complete.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t even comment on the games features, as these get manipulated, broken, or changed on a weekly basis. In the latest patch, the devs released an untested no pathing system that breaks how players control their characters.
<br>
<br>So if you plan on trying this game out, I recommend not spending any money until you have witnessed at least one game patch. Chances are they broke your free character, and now can&apos;t even progress without buying a second one that will be broken the following week.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=5225712">Expand</a></span>

The design pushes you to either spend huge amounts of time grinding for crafting ingredients, or spend real money in the store. I could forgive this in a completely F2P game, but I paid $40 for the game back in closed beta, so I feel cheated now I&apos;ve seen what the game has become. Whether you Pay2Win or not, castle defense is still unviable, to the point that many of the players who play primary for the &quot;design a castle full of traps&quot; gameplay (myself included) no longer play. I wish I could say I have faith that the developers will improve things, but I don&apos;t. They have a history of making changes which even I (a casual player) can see would end badly, such as &quot;open creation&quot;. In that change, they removed the old limits on where you could place creatures in your castle. So, obviously, players started putting a whole castle&apos;s quota of monsters in the same room. Ubisoft should have realized players would make the obvious optimization after the patch, but they did not. Worse, in a hurried attempt to address hordes of mostly-empty castles, they introduced &quot;attack tickets&quot;, which both have silly effects (monsters run away from you instead of attacking you, even while you kill their comrades) and also remove a lot of the skill from castle defense (it is no longer possible to trick or trap the player into pulling a horde of monsters when they only intended to pull a small group). All in all, they spent a lot of developer effort to change the system several times, and ultimately ended up with a system which is less fun and less flexible than the original system. So, I can&apos;t suggest this game. If you want a castle-building game where you have to design traps, and want to have some hope of actually killing people, I suggest trying &quot;The Castle Doctrine&quot; instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=4567365">Expand</a></span>

Many silly bugs and mistakes such as not being able to easily equip potions, near constant unable to attack other castle bugs, UI bugs and latency issues are common place quickly make the game less and less fun and more frustrating.
<br>
<br>Another major issue is that this game is P2W regardless of what Ubisoft or the developers have promised, any micro-transactions quickly unbalance the game heavily in the favor of the purchaser, which obviously is a pay to win method making attacking other players castles a huge risk if you don&apos;t want to lose crowns.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=4588763">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>On the first, it stinks that one class has to make a dungeon impossible for the others, but then your class can make it through too easily, and vice-versa.  I do not like that mechanic.  Not to mention that if I make it too good, I may have to do the validation multiple times.
<br>
<br>On the second, the trick after level 16 is to simply make some jelly walls, surround them with a bunch of targeting fireball traps, add a few spring floors to keep knocking them back, then add a final one that throws them into a bunch of bombs stunned.  Instant nearly unbeatable trap, since the slime wall makes it nearly impossible to spring the floor trap without getting thrown because you are moving too slowly.  The result are playable (often too playable) castles and ultimately nearly unplayable ones.
<br>
<br>The result is frustration and, honestly, no incentive past a certain point to do more with your own dungeons since you can just farm your own wells without bothering to invade anyone else and make your castle absurd.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=4168211">Expand</a></span>

This may be exclusive to my experience, but about every hour or two, I encounter some game breaking bug that forces me to restart. (Though this has never happened mid-dungeon, or at any time that would have been frustrating). I am actually really liking the streamlined gear/leveling systems, it really lets you get into the experience, rather than spending a large chunk of your time A/Bing two slightly different helmets, or biting your tongue over which skills to invest in. The developers have tried to sell this game as being quite funny, but this is seeming to be a misstep on their part. Nothing has quite made me laugh yet. It is certainly goofy and charming, which is great, but don&apos;t expect any moments to be funny enough to tell your friends. I was expecting very little from the player-made dungeons, as it only incentivize cheap repetitive tactics, but for some reason I cannot quite figure out, they are actually... Pretty good. Just as good as the computer generated dungeons in most any dungeon crawler.  This is a game I would recommend that any fan of the genre at least try. it will be hit or miss whether you like it or not, but if it ends up being your thing, it will keep you coming back for more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=4000001">Expand</a></span>

Such a divide is unacceptable and in my opinion makes it a pay to win.

<br>Developers admitted that they aim for the 50% victory of attackers at all levels, this produces a lazy nerfing and buffing dance that goes on from patch to patch taking away a lot of the depth the game could have had.

<br>Overall it feels like the team is much more focused in getting money rather than producing a title worth playing and that&apos;s a shame.

I tried out the mage and the abilities were pretty much just poorly redone mage abilities from D3. Not to mention the UI and the way the loot drops/gold look. 2/10 glad I didn&apos;t spend money on this game.</span>

<br>First of all, I am playing this game since closed beta, and have around 150 hours poured into it.
<br>
<br>In closed beta game was kinda ok, they had some bad choices with spending real cash, but I never cared about it and haven&apos;t seen it as game-breaking. But, after 15th of February of this year, game got a complete overhaul, they wiped all progress (which they promised they wont, but screw customers right?) and made this game an insult to anyone who played it.
<br>
<br>Game is repetitive, has bad balance and terrible mechanics. Let me explain.
<br>
<br>Progression is painfully slow. Amount of cash you need to upgrade your castle is equivalent to raiding 50+ castles for 1 building ( talking about levels 15+).
<br>
<br>Their crown system is &quot;worked on&quot; for 2 years now (crowns are something like rating, elo, whatever). They have no clue how to fix it, and never will. For instance, if you have 700 crowns, which means you are not so bad and you&apos;ve done well with your attacks and defenses, and you attack SAME LEVEL castle with 300 crowns, you will gain 5 crowns for victory, and lose 30 crowns for a loss. This is plainly stupid. On the other hand, if someone lower than you  on a ladder (crowns) attacks you, he will lose lets say 10 crowns if he dies, BUT he can grind your castle over and over again, learning all your secrets, and if he win, he can walk out with NET crowns even if he died 15 times in there. Dying after the first time dos NOT remove extra crowns from the attacker.
<br>
<br>Monster balance is terrible. I bet you haven&apos;t used or seen at least 50% of monsters in game. Why? Because they are useless.
<br>
<br>Some visual themes are simply better than others, and they cost real money. Meaning that some traps are harder to see on some visual styles then on another.
<br>
<br>Game rewards brain-dead style of castle design. Placing all your monsters in 1 room, supported with tons of traps is most rewarding. ZERO strategy is needed to succeed.
<br>
<br>Oh yea. You know how you can win every castle after you learn how traps work and how to avoid them? Aggro all mobs and run back to starting position, they will slowly follow you 1 by 1. You may not get max stars and max crowns for castle, but hey, you will still walk out with gold/life force/crowns.
<br>
<br>That brings us to their free build mode, or whatever the hell they call it. Now you can set as many traps as you can in a small area (if they are supported by a generator) and place as many creatures in any room. This means that 99% of all castles in their level bracket are almost identical. There is some kind of soft/hard cap now, so even if you have 40 mobs in 1 room, only certain number of them will activate, while the rest will run away from you till you kill previous ones. This is simply BAD game design.
<br>
<br>Oh yea. there is nothing Epic about Epic loot in The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot. Painting a brick purple does not make it epic.
<br>
<br>Before Open Beta this game was kinda OK, after OB its down right insulting.
<br>
<br>WHOEVER gave this game a good score is part of the dev/promo team or have played it for several hours.
<br>
<br>I give it 2/10 because it is actually fun for the first couple of hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=4010590">Expand</a></span>

Instead, you are trying to raid player crafted dungeons to steal their resources.  I find myself spending hours trying to maximize the effectiveness of my dungeon.  The validation feature forces you to complete your own dungeon before you publish it, so that you can&apos;t make it impossible.  My best dungeon killed me 5 times before I made it through.  Anyone who reviews this game that complains the dungeon creation aspect doesn&apos;t allow for enough versatility or difficulty is obviously a trap-laying noob.
<br>
<br>There are bugs still, and numerous features could be tweaked or added, but that will presumably come with time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=3999993">Expand</a></span>

The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot, a new release from Ubisoft Montreal may offer a wide range of experience, but for me goodness is a bit of a stretch.
<br>
<br>The basic story is that a medieval, magical society called Opulencia has been able to find such wealth that they&#x2019;ve magically floated castles up into the sky. You&#x2019;ve been employed by an untrustworthy seeming high-powered businessman to engage in the looting of your neighbors. It&#x2019;s curious to take the heroism out of the process. It&#x2019;s meant to be funny, your &#x2018;boss&#x2019; is constantly making wisecracks, but it left me feeling a little like a malcontent. Not a feeling I&#x2019;m used to when I&#x2019;m on an adventure, but more like I&#x2019;m, in the words of my hero, &#x201C;taking candy from a really weak baby&#x201D;.
<br>
<br>Epic Loot is a hybrid of gaming formats, incorporating strong elements of adventure in the Torchlight, Diablo vein, and elements of tower defense, as you build up your castle and summon enemies to provide protection. The concept is intriguing, but the execution is sloppy. You begin on the attack, taking your choice of hero to raid nearby castles. This is almost identical to (some would argue a direct rip-off of) Torchlight. You run, you hack and slash and summon, you level up, and kill with satisfaction. But unlike torchlight the maps (the early ones I must admit) are pretty unidirectional. Ok, you are in the confines of a castle, but when the gameplay makes you think &#x2018;Torchlight&#x2019; or &#x2018;Diablo&#x2019; you automatically start comparing your experience to those benchmarks, and the shortcomings immediately show. &#x201C;Where should I go now?&#x201D; is not a question you&#x2019;ll find yourself asking.
<br>
<br>The game is stronger on the defense side, though still imitative. You start with a simple, two room castle. You build and upgrade &#x2018;stations&#x2019; (things like an architect&#x2019;s desk, a summoning portal, a blacksmith) and rooms, and populate the rooms with monsters and traps. Here the game offers a lot of variety and it was where I found the most enjoyment. Online players can &#x2018;challenge&#x2019; your castle and try to make off with your loot, as you can do to others.
<br>
<br>The online aspect is where some gamers might find satisfaction with Epic Loot. It is well integrated into the gameplay. But I foresee some suffering because of the &#x2018;pay to play&#x2019; piecemeal way Ubisoft intends to generate revenue from this game. You pay to unlock heroes, weapons, etc. This format has obviously had a lot of backlash in the gaming community recently, but that said it seems to be persisting. So from a business standpoint Ubisoft may not have missed the mark here. From a gaming standpoint, the mark was several yards to the right. You want to go further? Put in another quarter&#x2026;
<br>
<br>The use of humor in the game is where it might have been pulled together, but instead is driven further apart. It&#x2019;s a very delicate and thin line one must tread to apply contemporary colloquialisms in an anachronistic environment for the sake of humor. In this writer&#x2019;s opinion, it MUST be done sparingly. Epic Loot shovels it at you, like you and your hero are digging its grave, and the hero keeps heaving dirt in your face. Your medieval knight constantly complaining to you &#x201C;My arms are tired, I can&#x2019;t carry anymore&#x201D; &#x201C;I&#x2019;m strong, but not that strong&#x201D; doesn&#x2019;t make me laugh, and certainly doesn&#x2019;t encourage me to keep running him through the gauntlet. I think &#x201C;fine, I&#x2019;ll play torchlight and not listen to the whining&#x201D;.
<br>
<br>The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot is a game that is satisfying only through its borrowing aspects that have been tried and proven by more ambitious gaming endeavors. It&#x2019;s free to play before it starts charging, and so may be worth checking out, but if you don&#x2019;t I wouldn&#x2019;t say you&#x2019;re missing much.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=4079830">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>However, once you get to level 20 or so, here the game deserves a score of 2. It is simply frustrating, unbalanced and too easily exploitable. Abuses of the spring trap, jelly wall, OP archers all over the place.
<br>
<br>As others have pointed out, the idea as of May 25th 2014 is to simply make approach to your throne room as frustrating as possible, then clump most of your monsters in the throne room. It&apos;s impossible to beat the clusterf*ck within the throne room and impossible to kite them all out through the traps to the entrance. Once a hero dies in your castle, he can no longer loot your chests at the end.
<br>
<br>With this said, as of level 20, all the fun is gone. You need epic or rare loot to stay competitive, so the first 2 loot tiers become vendor trash. Within this epic loot you only want certain traits (confusion, stun), while not others (xp, gold or item quality bonus, reflect damage). It&apos;s painful to clean out inventory of trash so frequently, as there&apos;s no inventory sort or auto sell option.
<br>
<br>The in-game crafting system allows you to combine lower tier items into higher, however the costs of this quickly become extreme (4000k to make a lvl 19 epic, 4500 to reforge a lvl 19 epic). Considering how item creation seems to make items for all classes, it takes truly spectacular amounts of gold to get the gear that is actually useful.
<br>
<br>In the end game, everything suddenly become 10x more expensive - castle upgrades start to cost 25-50k gold, while a typical castle may have 3000 available to loot. The NPC castles have about 1700. This forces repetitive grind for truly meager returns. At least Clash of Clans (this game rips all of it game mechanics from there) allowed the user to buy gold and life crystals for real life dollars. So for a couple bucks I can avoid hours of grind. I have not seem such option in this game - it only seems to sell xp/gold boosters that do not really do much.
<br>
<br>As people on the forums have pointed out, the new crafting system has depleted the in-game economy of higher tier stashes of gold - people just spent them on upgrades to equipment, so there isn&apos;t anything truly spectacular left to loot at higher tiers.
<br>
<br>Overall, I&quot;m putting this game on the shelf until some of these exploits get fixed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=4207934">Expand</a></span>

<br>The first thing to realize is that this game is very much a beta. If you are looking for a finished product this is not the game for you. Give it a few months and come back to it if you don&apos;t want anything to do with waiting and providing feedback about the current state of the game.
<br>
<br>There are a few negative reviews based on current playability of the game, to be fair they have been fixing those errors fairly regularly. There have been patches every 3-4 days fixing and tweaking various things.
<br>
<br>The monthly content patch is what I think most people think of when they talk about a patch. MQEL has typically just stocked up their update and released it in something they call Pack&apos;s. Those that are new to the game aren&apos;t familiar with this, thus the constant outcry of the weekly patches having very little content.
<br>
<br>And on now to what the game is actually about:
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve played any tower defense type game&apos;s imagine putting that on a 3d map and instead of fighting off wave&apos;s of monsters your goal is instead to fend off other player&apos;s that want to steal your Gold.
<br>
<br>The game has a multitude of options to customize your Castle and your Hero&apos;s with a decent progression. There are some bottle necks you have to over come as upgrading can become very costly. But if you search around you can find some rich neighbors to fill your treasure chests.
<br>
<br>You can setup up traps like turrets that shoot fireball&apos;s, setup monster&apos;s such as a bone skeleton sniper and there are even some boss type bigger monster&apos;s you can set down to try to create some epic battle&apos;s.
<br>
<br>As you play the game further and further you start to notice a lot of players using the same tactics for defense. It&apos;s a good and bad thing as once you get more practiced it becomes easier to go and steal your neighbor&apos;s loot....
<br>
<br>At current there are 3 free Hero&apos;s you can choose and you can pay-in to get early access to the newer Hero, which gives you a few extra&apos;s as well.
<br>
<br>I think as the game progresses and hits a more solid state it will be one of my favorite game&apos;s of all time.
<br>
<br>Try it out, it&apos;s free. Give some feedback on the forums and hang out with the rest of the community and help propel the future of the game. =)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=4072514">Expand</a></span>

Equipment upgrades can be achieved by raiding castles wich is a nice aspect. They should integrate a co-op mode though. Playing this game with friends would make it much more fun and then mages can also use healing spells instead of damage spells. Definetly check this game out if you like this genre. And even if you don&apos;t like it, just try it, after all it is free. I don&apos;t like this genre, but this game sucked me in and i like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=4007769">Expand</a></span>

The game isn&apos;t pay2win, but there is a massive grindfest that just screams &quot;INVEST&quot; at you because you do have to invest a lot of time and most of that time is wasted by grind mechanics that force you to play endless hours just to get sufficient upgrades of the most basic level for your castle.
<br>
<br>If that wasn&apos;t bad enough, the game coddles you from the start. It makes decisions for you throughout a good portion of the starting game holding your hand constantly and making decisions for you, such as the decision to publish your ill-prepared castle which makes little sense to me if the game is forcing you to publish your castle.
<br>
<br>Validating your castle, which is a fancy way of saying publishing, involves you going through your own castle and testing your defenses for yourself. Sound good right? Here&apos;s the kicker... You have to do this EVERYTIME you want to update your castle. That&apos;s right, every single time you want to update your castle, you need to go through the process of going through your castle yourself. Of all my time spent playing games, this has to be the worse game design mechanic I&apos;ve ever seen in any game. It also immediately turned me away from it. The game forces you to do this everytime you need to make changes to your castle, it punishes you severely for it. What on earth processed them to go ahead with this instead of making it optional, god knows ...
<br>
<br>When it comes to the traps themselves, they are no better. They are obvious and rather limited in number and there doesn&apos;t seem to be a way to customise your own traps. Having obvious traps kinda ruins the whole point of the game really and ends up being a shallow experience. On the other hand, the minion types are numerous as well as the ability to customise them is the only reason, along with the humour, that this game gets a 4 rather than a 3.
<br>
<br>Unfortuntely the game is heavily flawed and I don&apos;t see it changing much once its out of beta. The concept is good, but the game design is bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=3996425">Expand</a></span>

The only items that can be purchased in-game are useless cosmetic items and 50% extra gold, xp or life force for 1 hour (which really is nothing). The only thing you may have to purchase is a class but you can pick one of any of the classes for free which is fair enough because they have to make money somehow. +1 to the developers for choosing this monetization path rather than the damn awful &quot;Pay2SaveTime&quot; model. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun and interesting game to play.&#xFEFF;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=4155063">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is certainly more fun when you play with some friends so you have someone to talk to as well as compete with castle wise.
<br>
<br>Give it a chance but remember it&apos;s a) still an open beta and b) a free to play.  You won&apos;t like everything.  You&apos;ll greatly dislike a couple things.  But all in all it&apos;s an enjoyable game where most games released lately have been irredeemable..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=4198958">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The gameplay is simple but not dumb. The game consists from several aspects that fits together really well. You raid enemy castles where monsters and traps await you. Your main goal is to overcome all monsters and traps to gain loot.
<br>
<br>By loot i mean items you can equip to your hero and various material you can use to craft traps and monsters that will defend your castle.
<br>
<br>Defending your castle is very important, to protect your valuables from other players. But do not fear the game do not allow others to raid you very often :-)
<br>
<br>There is a lot more to discover in game, but do not expect miracles. Game is simple, the aspects of game fits together, and of course its free to play.
<br>
<br>PROS
<br>- Simple gameplay
<br>- Everything fits together really well
<br>- Loot, Castles
<br>- Some castles designed by players can be very chalenging.
<br>- Free to play
<br>
<br>CONS
<br>- After some time it gets quite boring and repetitive (but it happends for all games soon or later)
<br>- Some pay to win aspects (but it do not take the fun from you)
<br>- I think there could be more effective ways to design your castles</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-mighty-quest-for-epic-loot/user-reviews?user_review_id=5389589">Expand</a></span>
