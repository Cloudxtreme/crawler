After playing Mass Effect, I went out and bought every BioWare game I could find, including Knights of the Old Republic and Jade Empire, simply because I couldn&apos;t afford to have missed these brilliant games at the prices they are being sold for now. Having a strong interest in Chinese history, Jade Empire appealed to me immediately. As with Mass Effect, Jack Wall has produced another hit-and-miss soundtrack, with slow, drab tracks followed by thunderous, spectacular masterpieces. The yu pipes and taiko drums prove to be the saving grace here, and the Ancient China-based theme of Jade Empire certainly benefits from their presence. The graphics, whilst not brilliant, are more than adequate. I did, however, play the &quot;Special Edition&quot; PC version, which has been obviously heavily modified as opposed to its Xbox counterpart, so my perspective may be somewhat skewed. I found the characters enjoyable, with vibrant colours and intricate clothing designs making them all the more appealing. I was surprised to read that my personal choice of character, Monk Zeng, was not even in the original release of the game! Good thing then that BioWare had the presence of mind to return him to the cast for the Special Edition release. Voice acting is above average, which is always a plus with a dialogue-heavy RPG, and there are familiar voices involved. I believe I even heard Nathan Fillion in there, whom I had no idea did voice acting for games. There were also no bugs, crashes or sudden errors of any kind here, which plagued my experience when playing through both of the KotOR titles. On the negative, I found Jade Empire&apos;s one and only major flaw to be the combat system, which was far too basic. The AI was not particularly brilliant and the combat move sets for each style were very limited. This alone strikes one point from my final score. Nevertheless, if you enjoy BioWare&apos;s other renowned high standard RPGs like KotOR, you should certainly not miss this game. For $10 (Australian), there&apos;s really no excuse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=423199">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphics, Sound, Interface:
<br>
<br>The characters models, backgrounds, and CG work aren&apos;t so bad as to be distracting, but they are dated (as this game is from 2005).  The style is an odd mix of western cartoon and stereotypical Chinese, and while this isn&apos;t bad or distracting, other games from this generation, like LOZ: The Wind Waker, were much stronger in the art department.  Overall the art direction definitely seems content to take a back seat to the rest of the game.
<br>
<br>The music, voice acting, and sound effects are all solid.  There isn&apos;t really much to comment on, other than the sound team did a good job.  Again, there wasn&apos;t much to laud, but there wasn&apos;t much to criticize, either.
<br>
<br>The interface, for the PC version, can be confusing at first.  I used a mouse and keyboard, and sometimes I was stuck using trial and error to find what I wanted.  This definitely is not an intuitive setup for the game.  I cannot comment on gamepad controls.  The menus are streamlined, but they are also a bit confusing.  Sometimes it would have been easier to look online than to navigate the menu for the purpose of a recently acquired item.
<br>
<br>Story:
<br>
<br>The story is really in two main parts.  The first part takes up most of the game, and does a good job pacing you through to its conclusion.  There is lots of intrigue to be had, and very little slowdown at the beginning.  Towards the end of the first part, however, you start to run into some pacing issues.  Despite this, there isn&apos;t much to hinder most players from wanting to get to the goal here.
<br>
<br>The second part of the story is a train-wreck.  I will not post any spoilers, but ending this game was neither enjoyable or rewarding.  Really, I just wanted to reclaim the space from my HDD and be done with it.  Luckily this last segment is only about three or so hours of game play.
<br>
<br>Battle System:
<br>
<br>The battle system fails, but shows a lot of promise.  You really want it to do better, and at the start of the game it seems like you will end up having a rewarding experience with the style switching and real-time movement.  It just doesn&apos;t pan out.
<br>
<br>Overall:  I&apos;m being a bit harsh here, but it&apos;s because the first five hours of the game made me hopeful and sparked my imagination.  The last bit of the game crushed that idealism.  I&apos;m giving this a seven because there was so much the team could have done to make a great game.  Indeed, it is painful that the last bit of the game is so bad, and I thus I am choosing to weigh the better parts a bit heavier.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3851361">Expand</a></span>

Excellent story, great universe inspired by Chinese mythology, interesting characters (though some of them are clearly KOTOR rip-offs, like Sky), good script and voice acting, believable antagonists with motivations beyond &quot;destroy the world&quot; clich&#xE9;, intriguing and sadly underdeveloped idea with Open Palm and Closed Fist philosophies, engaging and sometimes very original quests  and some real choices to make along the way. The combat isn&apos;t terribly deep, but won&apos;t annoy you and is pretty dynamic and fun. That is, if you are looking for an RPG with lots of numbers, hard tactical combat, inventory management, huge selection of weapons, items and skills, You&apos;ll be  disappointed- Jade Empire doesn&apos;t  offer any of that. What it DOES offer is an unique experience, you&apos;&apos;ll rarely see in a video game. A very solid action/rpg title. Just don&apos;t think about it as a simplified fantasy version of KOTOR( Dragon Age:Origins gets that honor).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2676747">Expand</a></span>

Amazing gameplay, excellent story that keeps you going, minimal complication of leveling up (unlike some games like Oblivion and maybe even NWN2), and great graphics. Finally a game that got me playing for hours on end, after so many not so good games... The problem is the kind of games that are TRYING to pass as RPG nowadays are focused on two things: graphics, and character customization. The amount of customization options on the characters looks and later level up option in Oblivion is pathetic. Why would I want to change the angle of the guys chin or the color depth of the guys nosehair?? Especially when I barely even see my character..? Graphics? the graphics in oblivion though meant to look real are very artificial and ugly looking... and the skin textures for the people are extremely ugly. and gameplay... what gameplay? the combat system is stupid for hand-to-hand combat. Jade Empire on the other hand doesnt focus on these things. It has some customizations but just enough, and good, vibrant graphics with nice effects, but just enough so that the world doesn&apos;t look like a hazy artificial place. And the gameplay is lovely. Hand-to-hand combat is done very naturally in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=396823">Expand</a></span>

The combat is simple but dynamic and rewarding. The world design and atmosphere are top notch, I wish there were more games like this, with distinct personality. I love the lore and the presentation. The voice acting is also great quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2327692">Expand</a></span>

Time and again Jade Empire permits you to chose how you act...sometimes leading to disastrous consequences. I&apos;ve walked the &quot;evil&quot; path and haven&apos;t regretted it. The story is hit and miss, having so much dialogue in the game is a double edged sword. The entertaining parts of the game are great but toward the end things get especially tedious. I had some great moments in Jade Empire, those priceless 10/10 moments where you just want to make love to your USB ports, however I can&apos;t say the entire experience was great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2884474">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes the plot is the standard bioware fare of &quot;Evil lurks on the horizon, it&apos;s your job to defeat it&quot; But it&apos;s something that the studio does very efficiently.  And jade empire reminds us why.

<br>Yes the plot is the standard bioware fare of &quot;Evil lurks on the horizon, it&apos;s your job to defeat it&quot; But it&apos;s something that the studio does very efficiently.  And jade empire reminds us why.
<br>
<br>What&apos;s good about it :
<br>-Unique rpg setting based on oriental culture.
<br>-A good martial art based combat mechanism that is neither like Dragon Age/Baldur&apos;s Gate nor like Mass effect. Refreshing is what i want to say.
<br>-Rich and detailed world with bioware&apos;s signature narrative.
<br>-Awesome Voice Acting
<br>
<br>What&apos;s not :
<br>-Uneven chapter lengths (the game is broken into chapters btw). 3rd chapter is bigger than the next three combined
<br>-You really have to talk to everyone to get the sidequests, as a result your playthrough could be as short as 9 hours or as long as 30 hours (i took 28 hours to beat it)
<br>-A cringeworthy twist in the story&apos;s plot. Not terrible, but still...
<br>
<br>In conclusion  You gotta play this if you are a wrpg fan. If DA2 left you disappointed play this to calm yourself</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3893973">Expand</a></span>

<br>In teams of presentation, Jade empire still looks good to the &#x201C;modern&#x201D; eye, the art work is appealing despite being a bit cartoonish, the animations are fluid and the menus are easy to navigate (atleast on the GOG version). Although, I experienced a few annoying graphic glitches between loading times, but nothing major.
<br>Sound: 6
<br>The sound effects are just average, like in previous bioware games.
<br>The soundtrack is surprisingly bland and occasionally hard on the ears.
<br>The voice acting is a mix bag, because Bioware decided it was a good idea to cast american voice actors instead of asian ones. Why is this bad? Because, when I&apos;m exploring a fantasy Asian world, i&apos;m not expecting the NPC&apos;s to speak perfect English, it kills the immersion for me. Other than that the voice acting it self, is sill above average.

<br>The Characters are also a mix bag, Wild Flower is the only character in the lot to be remotely original, the rest are just a compilation of badly written stereotypes with uninteresting back stories and inconsequential roles. The only other character worthy of mention is Sir. Roderick, because he&apos;s just one of the most hilarious characters I have ever seen in a video game, unfortunately you can&apos;t recruit him,  go figure!
<br>The Story it self is ok though. But don&apos;t expect nothing spectacular or memorable like in KOTOR or Mass Effect.
<br>Gameplay: 6
<br>As customary, in Bioware RPGs, you can recruit party members to aid in combat, but only one can accompany you, though it&apos;s possible to switch between the rest at any time. The problem is, other than giving you stat bonuses, your companions are utterly useless, mainly because their I.A is borderline inept.
<br>The I.A. in general, is also very easy to exploit. To win, you will only need to master 3 styles: Paralyzing palm fallowed by Leaping tiger and/or Dragon sword, which makes the rest of the fighting styles completely useless. Their are also &#x201C;Harmonious Combos&#x201D; you can use, by pressing the left and right mouse buttons at the same time, but I rarely used them myself because they take to much time to trigger.
<br>Their is also no customization options what so ever, you can only choose between a set of predefined characters. The only variables are the fighting styles you can master and the points you can attribute to Health, Chi and Focus.
<br>The combat system is fun to a certain degree, but it shows limitations when you ramp up the difficulty, mainly because of the iffy controls and wonky camera.
<br>Nonetheless, Jade Empire still has some cool ideas under the hood, for example: you can switch between styles during a fight to vary your strategy; you can use magic for long range attacks; you can use a combination of flips and rolls as well as slowing time to avoid enemy attacks and also turn yourself in to a freaking daemon or animal!
<br>Value: 8
<br>It took me 30 hours (flat) to beat this games without skipping any dialogs and completing ~95% of the side quests. And by the way, it is always fun to replay it a second time as an evil guy, lol!
<br>Other than that, there is no modding community to speak of, so after the second play through there is no point replaying it again.
<br>
<br>Final Thoughts: If you&apos;re looking for a hardcore rpg game, you&apos;ll better skip Jade Empire. But if you liked Knights of the old republic and Neverwinter Knights, you might want to give this one a try.
<br>
<br>Final Score: 7</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3711253">Expand</a></span>

I found most of the first half of the game to be significantly boring but this is probably because I&apos;m one of those people who has to read *every* dialogue option with *every* npc that can talk in case they have something unique to say. Unfortunately I learnt the hard way that this was not the case, and that everyone literally says pretty much the same list of things albeit slightly differently to fit their characters. About halfway through the game I started skipping a *lot* of dialogue options and this is when it became a lot more enjoyable for me. Thankfully your team members do each have their own storylines and their dialogue options were more fruitful, which was great. The combat mechanic of the game is tricky to review. It starts off difficult because it is unlike anything in any bioware game I&apos;ve played before, but then you gradually start to realise that it is very easy to exploit. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if somebody managed to finish the game without using the block function a single time. As a result most fights weren&apos;t very exciting, especially towards the end of the game. They probably would have been if I had mixed up my styles a bit, but I found no incentive to. The story of the game was good, and lasted a lot longer than I was expecting thanks to a few twists in the plot, but towards the end there were several loading screens telling me that my choices would has dire consequences that I should consider carefully, but I don&apos;t actually recall making any decisions at the end. Perhaps it was just my general play-through which influenced it, but it was underwhelming to say the least. The environments that the game is set in are okay, although there are very few to explore so you quickly get quite bored of being in a certain place, especially considering the detail of your surroundings are hampered by outdated graphics. All in all though it&apos;s an enjoyable game, especially if you can get it in a steam sale. I managed to get it for around &#xA3;3 which makes the pounds-per-hour ratio (around 25ish hours) much better than most games I&apos;ve bought recently. The characters and story are worth that money alone, and the rest of the game can be enjoyed equally as much so long as you don&apos;t expect too much from it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2550464">Expand</a></span>

In truth you can take your time and finish all the gloriously illustrated and story voice acted NPC interactions of any game yet to come.. This game even compells you to talk to simple peasants due to the chance you may stumble upon some simple quest that may make your character more powerful. The action is simply wonderful, fluid combat moves non turn based real time combat makes this game very challenging, I suggest playing on easy mode your first time through so you can master the martial arts moves on each successive play of this game I suggest raising the level of difficulty as the game itself will change due to your difficulty rating.. Every choice you make allows you to change your alignment towards good or evil.. or possibly neutral if your choices aren&apos;t genuinely good or evil.. but selfish. Overall this game gets 10 out of 10 due to the amount of work put into this game to enhance the realism and draw your further into the world that is The Jade Empire.. I can see this game becoming the next World of Warcraft.. or Everquest.. As long as they don&apos;t make the MMORPG suck like Matrix online sucked... or Star Wars galaxies.. etc.. (or even FF12&apos;s horrid grinding rate.) I&apos;ll be playing this game for a long time, hoping and wishing for a Jade Empire MMORPG...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=396245">Expand</a></span>

And thank God I didn&apos;t have to pay for this, because it is one of the worst, one of the most generic, one of the most laziest console TPP action games... ever. I&apos;ve played few hours, constantly being under the pressure of overhelming tediousness, blandness and the most boring and unimaginative gameplay designs I&apos;ve ever seen. The pure idea of a mediocre pre-nextgen console TPP brought out from the Platonic Idea to the petty world of shadows on the cave&apos;s wall. It&apos;s mind-boggling how badly mediocre and soulless this game is.
<br>So, let&apos;s take one of the simplest, bland settings you can build your setting on. Wuxia, boom, there&apos;s your whole game out of a sleeve! Why bother to write a plot? Throw in generic evilness and your typical out of a hat orphan that is actually the most important element of its universe, being trained by a mysterious, yet equally important master. One day, your idyllical environment is being crushed by absolutely random LOL evil&apos;s henchman raid and this your great journey begins. With kung fu!
<br>Now, the absolute trash story, characters and setting doesn&apos;t have to be that last nail to the game&apos;s coffin. That is, if the gameplay wasn&apos;t absolute TOSH either! It&apos;s the worst type of your PS2 button masher, but worse, because to the reduntand spam two buttons randomly to win it tried to implement stats and various fighting styles. Don&apos;t get fooled. They&apos;re all the same, with light fast attacks and slow heavy attacks to break through the block. Just mind your health bar and that&apos;s it. With absolute inexcusable input lag (on a PC?!) the game turns into boring mash the button parade until you encounter the next character to have... Wait, that&apos;s it! How about the dialogues? Maybe that&apos;s the real meat in this? Well, not, the writing in Jade Empire is really low bottom (how about options &quot;Don&apos;t call me like I&apos;m someone important, mate!&quot; vs &quot;Yeah, that&apos;s right. I was meant to great things, remember that&quot; - what the **** People boast that kind of bullcrap?) and &quot;ok, let&apos;s get that next line over with&quot; voice actors didn&apos;t help the case either.
<br>After 5 hours of this slog I&apos;m done. What an awful, awful game. Bioware games were never something special in the actual game quality (not production values) department, but this tosh is just mind breaking. I would take Dragon Age 2 (!!!) over this rag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6102086">Expand</a></span>

Poor game length, awful controls, awkward mini-games, muddy graphics and linear level design round out what is probably the worst game made by Bioware.

                                        <span>For me, the combat system in this game made it nearly unplayable.  I just didn&apos;t enjoy it at all, and actually didn&apos;t finish this game (a huge rarity for me, as I play to the end of just about every game that I buy).  The story also was uninteresting to me.  BioWare has made a lot of great RPGs, but I don&apos;t consider this to be one of them.</span>

Games like Bethesda&apos;s Oblivion seem to have implanted a new standard for RPGs in our minds that just isn&apos;t representative of other gamemaker&apos;s abilities. While Jade Empire is loved by hardcore fans, i would equate it with the butchering of Tribes 3 by Vivendi Universal. Fans of this game will come to dislike it and abandon it. the game has improved at the most basic roots: the storyline and graphics, a key part of RPGs is there, however, even more basic gameplay functions are lackluster and make me want to play Oblivion instead to suit my RPG needs. All in all, a 6.8 says its playable, but in my mind, a waste of time in a busy world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=396131">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay is a mix of real-time hack &amp; slash combat and exploration/dialogue similar to that seen in KOTOR. The story dips at its mid-point, and has little that stands out, but is worth riding out for the excellent final quarter. Can be difficult to invest in and properly role play with the cookie cutter character creation and static game world, which also harms replayability. Nonetheless, a solid game. Worth mentioning: versions purchased on Steam require a checklist of workarounds, particularly on newer machines/OS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3519198">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, the game is marred by frequent crashes and various glitches. The pixelated text doesn&apos;t help and it overall seems like a product that&apos;s very rough around the edges. Another thing that&apos;s not particularly appealing is the outdated visuals. It may&apos;ve looked good back in 2005, but with the special edition released in 2007, it just doesn&apos;t compare to games released in the same time.
<br>
<br>Combat is simplistic enough and works for the most part, but is hindered by an annoying camera angle. Often times, particularly towards the end of the game, boss/mini-boss fights had me resorting towards kiting which became very tedious. Styles are certainly unbalanced, where some are clearly more inferior or superior than others.
<br>
<br>To sum it up, a decent game. The game plays best in chapters 1, 2 and 3 where there&apos;s a great deal of intrigue, open environments and a plethora of side quests. The game kinda falls off from chapter 4 onwards, where it becomes completely linear and it feels as if the story is being dragged out. Took me 25 hours to complete after doing the main quest and most side quests.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3847660">Expand</a></span>

Jade Empire has the same feel as all of Bioware&#x2019;s other games, but its setting is relocated into a fictional Chinese kingdom.  Jade Empire&#x2019;s &#x201C;tri-stat&#x201D; system is simple, but also a very creative and effective RPG feature.  Each attribute offers individual combat advantages, but also work in conjunction for persuasion checks during dialog.  This delivers fantastic gameplay that won&#x2019;t confuse newcomers to the RPG genre.  After Jade Empire&#x2019;s initial release on the Xbox, many of the fans complained about its easy difficulty.  The special edition&#x2019;s new &#x201C;Jade Master&#x201D; difficulty feature smashed this complaint and offered an incredibly challenging experience for veteran RPG players.  In addition, the enhanced PC edition offers high resolutions and advanced AA settings for stronger GPU&#x2019;s.

But I do hope they could make a sequel for it to fix those problems, since this Asian style is so fresh in the current major video game industry.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1784491">Expand</a></span>

Do try to play through as an utter, complete villain and be amazed. The only downside is a bit simplistic combat, plus it&#xC2;&#xB4;s not the longest thing out there, either. But, for any RPG fan, this is a no-brainer. Must play, will enjoy.</span>

This one is probably the one that inspired Mass Effect, as you don&apos;t play as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;, but as &quot;help-everyone&quot; or &quot;learn how to help yourself&quot; kind of way. :) Since you have different endings, different styles and different ways to solve the situations (some you can&apos;t even access if you don&apos;t follow a certain phylosofical path...), it has a nice replayability factor (I played this game when it came out, and I&apos;ve already finished it at least 5 times). :) Wish Bioware kept doing them like this one...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2539888">Expand</a></span>

I feel as there is something lacking in Jade Empire which Dragon Age, Mass Effect and KOTOR have... it&apos;s just not there and I don&apos;t know what it is.
<br>
<br>There is some good moments that Jade Empire hold, like how the open hand and closed fist options aren&apos;t really dependent on Good or Bad choices...it&apos;s more of a Passive Aggressive/Aggressive Aggressive choice rather than good/evil wish is great. Also the story is original as well I just felt like the story is a bit rushed for the story to properly develop... It went from casually training to fulfilling your destiny in 2 hours... um that&apos;s a bit quick don&apos;t you think? Even KOTOR had it&apos;s plot introductions built up (with taris) same with Mass Effect (Eden Prime and Proving Saren&apos;s guilt.) and Dragon Age (with the prologue and the gray warden ceremony) And all of those intros took me at least 4 hours and even more to full explore everything. And listen.. I&apos;m all for short games but I&apos;m not all in for horrible paced games... Jade Empire seems to be incredibly rushed for a bioware game and that I&apos;m not happy about. Combat is JE is probably some of the best combat I&apos;ve seen for a bioware game but the limited options for fighting styles is limited but lots of fun to play and beat some baddies up.
<br>
<br>I got this game free on origin and I was really excited to play it... but I feel that I couldn&apos;t continue on... I simply wasn&apos;t enjoying the game. It&apos;s a shame because the combat is really good and the rpg/action in Jade Empire works really well but this game fails to impress me like KOTOR, ME and DA:O brought to me in the first place and all I wanted is a good story with proper character developments... and JE had all that... but it felt rushed and that&apos;s why I didn&apos;t like this game. I have only 7 hours completed and that&apos;s enough honestly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6566260">Expand</a></span>

Une avalanche de dialogues le plus souvent soporifiques et une fin qui tra&#xEE;ne terriblement en longueur. Quelques bons moments &#xE9;galement dont une qu&#xEA;te qui fait penser &#xE0; ce bon vieux KOTOR... Des personnages t&#xEA;tes &#xE0; claques dans l&apos;&#xE9;quipe et qui ne la ferment jamais... un syst&#xE8;me de combat en temps r&#xE9;el qui souffle le chaud et le froid m&#xEA;me si une pause est disponible... C&apos;est tout cela Jade Empire !
<br>
<br>Musique sympathique et tr&#xE8;s couleur locale, VF de tr&#xE8;s bonne facture. Graphismes fort r&#xE9;ussis et fluides (si on a pris soin de d&#xE9;sactiver le fpsclamp des 30 im/s dans l&apos;ini) : c&apos;est presque aussi beau que Dragon Age Origins (&#xE0; part les personnages). Le jeu marche bien en mode compatibilit&#xE9; sous windaube 7 (apr&#xE8;s avoir install&#xE9; DX9 ! -sic-) mais le disque dur n&apos;arr&#xEA;te pas de gratter au bout d&apos;un certain temps : pas mal avec 12 Go de ram !! il faut plut&#xF4;t y voir le mode de compatibilit&#xE9; de windaube 7 qui fait n&apos;importe quoi. On retourne alors sous windaube xp : et l&#xE0;, aucun souci !
<br>
<br>Curieux sentiment : ce Jade Empire est tr&#xE8;s caricatural au final, son monde est tr&#xE8;s caricatural, tr&#xE8;s caricatur&#xE9;, sans doute &#xE0; l&apos;insu de l&apos;ignorance de ses d&#xE9;veloppeurs, c&apos;est parfois presque aussi niais qu&apos;un jeu japoniais. Inqui&#xE9;tant. Pas le meilleur jeu de r&#xF4;le Bioware donc... mais pas le pire non plus.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7167430">Expand</a></span>

I originally played the game on Xbox but after playing the PC port, there really isn&apos;t any competition as to which is better. The PC version adds in two new styles as well as upgrades for two weapons, a new character and two more enemies, the Rhino demon and the Ghost Lord, both of which fit right in to the original cast of enemies. The Story is interesting if a bit simple by Bioware standards, but it benefits greatly from an interesting setting in Imperial China that is fairly uncommon to see. The writing is as always well done that added a real sense of immersion, there always felt like there was a whole world out there outside of the land your exploring with use of clever characters and dialogue. One such moment was when the water dragon mentioned how while the Jade Empire prospered many lands suffered because of it which helps add to the feeling of a world outside the Empire. The charatcers and followers are also well written but I always felt as if the team was much smaller and less diverse then it was in reality. This is most likely due to many of the characters having no real impact on the plot with only about half of your followers really needing to be there for plot progression after their initial introduction. In terms of graphics the game does a good job of holding up with a good mix of cartoonish colours and realistic models and faces, which helps the game stand up well over a decade after it&apos;s release (so long as you can handle somewhat low poly count and a few graphical glitches here and there).  The combat is where most people find fault with the game due to it&apos;s simplicity, and they are not wrong. The games combat is very easy to abuse with a combination of Paralyzing palm/Storm dragon and any attack the enemy isn&apos;t weak to but I think most people forget that this was Biowares first attempt at a real time combat system that didnt rely on pauses and dice rolls like Kotor or BG. For the most part the combat gets the job done. The game length was my biggest gripe though as my run of the game only clocked in at 22 hours, that includes completing all side quests. This is criminally short as most RPGs take roughly 50 - 60 hours to complete. This is most likely due to the game quickly coming to an end just as it starts to reach its high point. The first three chapters of the game take up more then half of the run time which is fairly disappointing as the game still has another 4 chapters to go that is completely linear with no side quests to be had. These last 4 chapters combined took about six hours to complete compared to chapters two and three taking about 8 - 9 hours. The game felt very rushed after the plot twist which may have made sense in a story telling perspective, but it made the later portion of the game feel as if there should be another 30 hours of content.
<br>
<br>Overall I feel as if Jade Empire is overlooked by many. I feel as if it&apos;s initial reaction of hate was due to it not being as polished as Bioware&apos;s previous game Kotor, and that it&apos;s niche setting and glaring flaws made many people overlook this fantastic game. If a sequel is to ever be conceived I hope that the flaws are addressed as the World of Jade Empire has a lot of potential to expand upon because as of right now, Jade Empire doesn&apos;t do enough justice to what is a really interesting setting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7092809">Expand</a></span>

<br>The feel of this game which is a result of the environment and the music was really well done and it does feel like you are in ancient China. The combat was very exciting and a lot of fun to experiment with a variety of different fighting techniques, and although the controls were a little clunky and difficult to actually control, I had a lot of fun with the combat.
<br>The story was also very intriguing. It had one of the better stories that I have come across in a RPG game.
<br>However, I had some issues in particular with your companions. Having a companion fight with you did not really add much to the game aside from that they distract some enemies. But more importantly, the characters were not really explored in depth and although they did get a backstory, it didn&apos;t feel particularly interesting. In later games, Bioware would have companion quests which I believe would have really improved the game. This is because near the end there is a moment where all your companions work together to save you as a result of you supposedly being an incredible leader. However, nothing you do in game really should inspire such loyalty. The companions were really bland for me in this game, which really detracts from the experience. The volume of which you pick up companions was also an issue. There was definitely too much companions in too small amount of time that you never really develop a connection or an interest in your companions.
<br>The final battle is also a little disappointing, although this is because I have been spoilt by some of Bioware&apos;s epic conclusions to some of their other games. I understand what they were trying to achieve so this isn&apos;t too significant of an issue. The game however was a little short and I believe it could have been made a little longer, and add some interesting subplots and complications. Also like I mentioned more quests involving companions would have been wonderful.
<br>Overall, I enjoyed this game even though the graphics were incredibly outdated when I played it and the companions were really disappointing. I do wish however that Bioware can somehow reboot this franchise. If  they are able to implement some of what they did with the Mass Effect and Dragon Age franchises, it could make for a very refreshing and intriguing franchise because of the unique environment and story</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/jade-empire-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7226930">Expand</a></span>
