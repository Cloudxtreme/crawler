<br>Unfortunately, under the pretty facade, both on its own, and in comparison with its predecessor, this adventure game is severely lacking in actual content. Yes, there are more areas to explore, more scenes to play out, and more videos to watch, but the jokes are fit for little children (which is out of place in a game with a mature setting), are devoid of wit, intelligence, or class (oh, this guy speaks in a funny way, let&apos;s laugh about it for the entire game, because it&apos;s obviously such a riot)  not to mention the completely needless and tasteless parts with cruelty to animals.
<br>Supplementing the vapid, hollow humor are unlikable, skin-deep characters that do not evoke the tiniest bit of emotional attachment.
<br>All except the protagonist, of course who is a loathsome  with no redeeming qualities, which I found repeatedly wanting to see fail. The fact that he is an oblivious, rude, shallow, mean-spirited, self-centered, charmless, immature idiot (and yes, this is how the game itself portrays him) might have been (almost) cute in the first game, but his behavior is simply insufferable this time around. In effect, he does not serve as a hero, anti-hero (Guybrush Threepwood has that part done correctly), or even as comic relief.
<br>
<br>In short, this is an average adventure game, that falls short of the classics it tries to imitate (there are a few homages too, not that they help much). Despite wanting to like it, I became more and more disappointed as the story progressed. Perhaps this trilogy (why?) can still be saved in its third installment, when that is available, but my advice is to think three times before handing over your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chaos-on-deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=3447100">Expand</a></span>

More hilarious moments in this one than the first (lollipop scene is priceless). Rufus seemed like a total ass in the first one but I&apos;m really starting to like him and root for him, even if he&apos;s still an ass. Again the only issue with this series is some mismatch between audio and subtitles but it barely takes away from the experience since it only happens once or twice, pretty good for a translated game. A real gem for adventure games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chaos-on-deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2779396">Expand</a></span>

<br>Chaos on Deponia is the second game in 3 part series. The first game was amazing too, but not nearly at this level
<br>Not spoiling too much,(just don&apos;t read if you haven&apos;t played the first Deponia) star of Deponia 2 is once again Rufus, egoistical jerk who always has some scatter brained plan for everything and of course people get hurt in the process. He lives in a planet called Deponia, this giant garbarge pile where humans, or human like creatures live. Rufus is trying to get to Elysium, this place high above in the sky. Another big character is Goal, the love interest, and unlike in first game, this time she&apos;s not asleep for the majority of the game, only in the beginning as you try to assemble her mind back together. Both are great characters and really funny in their own way. Rufus is always trying to hit on Goal but she doesn&apos;t seem to be responsive, and Goal&apos;s mind is split in 3 parts and all of the parts have great personalities and you get to know her better as a whole when you try to persuade all of the parts and get to Elysium to tell them that Deponia is inhabitent and not to blow it up.
<br>Story takes couple of nice turns and leaves in a nice cliffhanger while giving satisfying ending. At some point you learn something aboyt Elysium, which might make you question a bit is Rufus really trying to do the right thing when he&apos;s trying to stop the supposedly bad guy and stop Deponia from exploding, and what does Rufus himself really want?
<br>Gameplay is standard, if you&apos;ve played point &amp; click games you&apos;ll know and if you haven&apos;t, it&apos;s not that hard to catch on. You talk to lots of colorful characters to gain information, and collect and combine all sorts of weird stuff from your inventory to progress forward.
<br>Puzzles in this game are top notch, best I&apos;ve ever played. They&apos;re logical, they&apos;re challenging but not on impossible level but you still need to think and really listen to the characters. Sometimes there aren&apos;t even any hints to what you should do, not at least verbally because those puzzles are explained a little differently and they can get challenging.
<br>Humor is also one of the best in any game I&apos;ve ever played. There&apos;s constantly coming real laugh out loud moments (Mc Thulhu restaurant was the best part).
<br>I played the game with English voice acting which was superb. I&apos;ve heard that some previous Daedalic games haven&apos;t had that great English translation and many jokes have been lost from German version, but I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the case here, about every joke hits the mark and everything is completely understandable.
<br>Only bad thing I can say are the typo&apos;s, there aren&apos;t that much of them but they&apos;re noticeable. Now, I probably misspelled something in this review too as my native language isn&apos;t English, and neither is for the guys who made the game, Daedalic Entertainment, but those typo&apos;s still give away a bit unprofessional feeling and remind me that this is indeed an indie game. This doesn&apos;t make the game worse in any way and if you play it with English voice over and your first language is English, you most likely won&apos;t even read subtitles and the typo&apos;s are just a letter here and there, just pointing out.
<br>All and all, awesome game. This is definitely the best game in 2012 that I&apos;ve played and new king of point &amp; click games in my list. Can&apos;t wait for Deponia 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chaos-on-deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=2790552">Expand</a></span>

Some puzzles are not logical,but overall it&apos;s a great adventure game. Maybe a little bit to short. It maybe a good idea to wait until they finish 3rd episodeand sell all three episodes in one pack.</span>

It lets you explore a new part of Deponia (though it is rather small) and introduces a bunch of new colorful characters (O, Donna, your dim-witted giggles melt my heart!).
<br>Like previous game, Chaos on Deponia looks absolutely fantastic and is really funny. But also like previous game it contains a lot of bugs, most of which are the same as in the original Deponia. They are not game breaking (though some Steam achievements do not work), but it really saddens me to see that Daedalic still doesn&apos;t care to fix them.
<br>Overall it is fun game but besides game bugs it contains some other drawbacks. It is really short and ends abruptly only to tell you to wait for the third part to see the end of the story. Some people will find various jokes offensive because of animal cruelty and the main protagonist is still a douche-bag which makes it really hard to sympathize and root for him.
<br>But in the end, Chaos on Deponia is really funny quest with great characters, amazing graphics and interesting story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/chaos-on-deponia/user-reviews?user_review_id=4665276">Expand</a></span>

Thirdly, the game is longer  or so it seems to me.  Still loving the professional translation  humor if funny and enjoyable.

<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>- Pretty and colorful cartoon graphics.
<br>- Humour: edgy, sarcastic, sometimes dark.
<br>- Good voice acting.
<br>- Decent story: with love, deception, mystery and revolution.
<br>- Balanced difficulty.
<br>- Cool locations.
<br>- Interesting characters (Bozo, Toni, Goal, The Revolutionists).
<br>- Classic point-and-click feel.
<br>
<br>MEH:
<br>- You get to visit some locations quite often, which makes background music somewhat annoying.
<br>- Some animations are sort of lazy. But that&apos;s to be expected from an Indie game with limited budget.
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>- Some puzzles are not so intuitive, you may require walkthrough (I had to use it about 4 times).
<br>
<br>If you enjoy classic adventure games, &quot;Chaos on Deponia&quot; is just for you. It&apos;s not a masterpiece, but is good and you won&apos;t regret spending 10 hours to complete it.
