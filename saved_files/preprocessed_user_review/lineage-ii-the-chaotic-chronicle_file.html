I have never had a problem finding a party. The graphics are amazing. There is real danger in this game. You die, you lose stuff. Other players want to kill you. If someone is a jerk, find a group and go destroy them. </span>

Leveling is monotonous and mind numbing. The quests are boring, the world is empty and buggy, and the community is the worst I have ever playd with. The graphics are decent, but this is the best case of gameplay being nonexisitent. Repeat: Do not buy this game.</span>

The game has changed a lot after the Goddess of Destruction Chronicle. It can be very addictive game but it is also one of the worst grind games (maybe tops all others). PvP is the best aspect of the game but one need to be top level to be effective in that. getting to top levels, one has to spend a lot of time and money (to buy items that provide bigger experience point for the same time). The biggest problem currently is the extensive cheating. People use programs to automate gameplay (both on PvE and PvP) as well as buy in-game money with real (RMT) to acquire better gear. Another serious problem is that decision making for the game is made in Korea (it is a Korean game after all) and the Korean player base is always used as reference (sadly very different than Western population).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lineage-ii-the-chaotic-chronicle/user-reviews?user_review_id=3565658">Expand</a></span>

You hit your 2 maybe 3 big hitting skills first followed by your 1 spam skill and wait for your big hitters to cool down. If you have spent more real world money to buy a bigger stick or spend an infinate time playing the game you win. Win or lose you feel no sence of skill involved. As limited as your skills are at the start little change as you level up because they give the same amount of new skills and old skills become worthless.
<br>
<br>The large class system is really a few simualr class&apos;s with a little changes.
<br>
<br>The luring raid boss and castle seiges in the vidoes would make the game seem epic but skill less pvp ruins the seiges. The raids take a long time to gather a party of 10 to 100 payers depending on the raid who all must be around the same level and its pain to get 3 people to form a party to do regualr boring grind.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lineage-ii-the-chaotic-chronicle/user-reviews?user_review_id=1686625">Expand</a></span>

All the cool &quot;espoinage and pvp politics&quot; that people keep talking about don&apos;t really amount to much if you haven&apos;t been playing for 2+ years. There is a serious gap between the &quot;upper class&quot; and the &quot;noobies&quot;. Also the economy in the game is possibly the imbalanced of any MMO on the market. I love the idea of being able to create clans and alliances that reshape the land and effect the economy in an almost entirely player driven world, but in order for that to be successful the players must be outgoing and inviting. Instead you have maybe 200 people on every server that basically control everything.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lineage-ii-the-chaotic-chronicle/user-reviews?user_review_id=406284">Expand</a></span>

Furthermore, the game currently suffers from inbalances brought in from beta exploitation and inumerable player-bots. Despite this being against the rules, and obvious to pick out those that are doing this.. the administration seems too thin and swamped with issues to do anything about it. The Clan system puts a massive burden on the leader alone, which the clan cannot help with. Sacrifice goes with the position but the rates in Lineage are obviously aimed at keeping the hardcore players, who are levelling away 24x7, in check. Anyone who has a life simply will not be able to keep up, and will be left out of the more interesting facets of this game such as the upcoming Castle Seige add-on. I am currently playing and will continue my limited patronage to get my money&apos;s worth, but unless annoyances change (and unless the whole system is changed, then they probably won&apos;t) I feel that I will leave as soon as something more catered for partying and teamwork comes along. Guild Wars for instance looks promising. In all seriousness, don&apos;t play unless you have a lot of time to waste repetitively killing monsters, its a disappointment...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lineage-ii-the-chaotic-chronicle/user-reviews?user_review_id=375028">Expand</a></span>

What utter garbage this game is. The game is so full of bots that even the starting newbie zones are jam packed with them. I could not complete the very first few quests because they required me to kill X number of mobs. There were none to kill as all the bots were running around spawn killing them. Also the game crashes. I mean it crashes a LOT. I&apos;m not sure if the developers just gave up on stopping all the botting going on, but it&apos;s EVERYWHERE in the game. No joke or exaggeration, they really are in almost every spot in the game where mobs spawn. My recommendation: Don&apos;t Play This Game.

I suggest if you have time to grind grind grind and be a little bored or are used to being alone then you should play this game because soloing is boring and u cant always get a party.</span>

<br>
<br>For both PvP and PvE oriented players, out of the Chaotic Chronicle - C5 (Chronicle 5: Oath of Blood) was arguably the most balanced version, where there was no clearly overpowered class, therefore most classes were useful.
<br>However, it seems out of all the servers still running Chaotic Chronicle now in 2016 - there are only ones running C6: Interlude.
<br>
<br>Why play such an old game in 2016? I have tried/tested many: Rift, Black Gold, Aion, Blade &amp; Soul, ArcheAge, Black Desert, The Secret World, Bless...
<br>And I&apos;m a developer actually working on Neverwinter and Star Trek online, so I play those too, if only for work.
<br>
<br>And guess what? Graphics aside - games are not getting any better than they were in 2004. And even the graphics are reaching a point where improving them further hardly changes the overall impression.
<br>
<br>So comparing Lineage-2 to tens of MMOs released since about 2003 to this day, here are the pros and cons:
<br>Pros:
<br>+ Freedom. The game is NOT railroading you, nor holding your hand in any way. Wanna go kill lvl 40 monsters at lvl 24 - good luck, you are free to do so and it is possible and somewhat rewarding, although questionable for the profit/time.
<br>+ Free PvP outside of towns. Killing players who don&apos;t fight back increases your Player Killer counter, which gradually increases penalties upon death yet it is possible to thrive with high PK counters - you just gotta be good enough to avoid getting killed :-)
<br>+ A lot of _distinct_ classes. The Chaotic Chronicle/Throne has 33 different paths after level 40, each has an advanced version available at lvl 76 - which is really a better version of the same. Most other games give you less than 10.
<br>+ Big, open world. Esp. in C5 and C6. Yes you can find the invisible walls here and there but you have to put in some effort to reach them.
<br>+ Teamwork. It&apos;s really encouraged. Grinding is not as tedious and MUCH more effective in a group.
<br>+ A live, player-driven economy (except for the x10&apos;000 servers mentioned above). Some games created 12+ years later fail to even come close (I&apos;m looking at you, Black Desert!)
<br>+ Castle sieges, and hardcore raid bosses. They are massive, they are fun. They are somewhat unpredictable because other parties can and often do interfere.
<br>+ Mob AI is a bit diverse and has some freedom i.e. the monsters can chase you for miles. Most later MMOs have dumbed down monsters / put them on VERY short leashes.
<br>
<br>+ A lot of community-driven, yet popular (3000+ players per shard) servers, with different approaches to running the shard. Pick one that fits your taste. Some are true hardcore x1 with the bare-bones vanilla content, some are x10&apos;000 with NPCs selling S-grade (BIS items) for 5 coins in every starter NPC shop. And everything in between as well.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Dated graphics - I&apos;ll put it here just to get it out of the way, and - because it&apos;s wrong to deny.
<br>- Swimming - still not fixed and buggy. There&apos;s a way to exploit it though.
<br>
<br>Controversial:
<br>+- The grind. Now, this is HUGELY addressed by the plethora of shards with various rate settings - pick one that suits you best. But, assuming you want to experience the entire game without just skipping to the endgame, and play on x1...x10 rates - the grind is really your best option to level up.
<br>+- Your lvl determines your power more than anything else, including your gear. The game makes it pretty much impossible to deal any damage to someone more than 10-12 lvls above you. Once at lvl-73 I could grab some crappy grade-D gear and take out many players of levels 25-50 without much effort. This discourages anything other than grinding until you reach lvl 78-80.
<br>+- Only dwarves can craft gear, OR collect resources with about 5 times better yield than any other race. Took me a while to realize how funny and kinda dumb that is. Love it or hate it, but while the other 4 races can compete with each other in various forms of PvP, the dwarves are sitting on the side collecting resources and crafting and selling ALL the gear for ALL of the other races. Now, a good player with a well-equipped dwarf (and dwarves often get BIS for themselves before crafting and selling it to others) - can still kick some ass, but it&apos;s still gonna be more like a freighter ship with some guns mounted on it - vs. a purpose-built warship that was designed as such from the start.
<br>
<br>Overall - while The Chaotic Chronicle is by no means perfect, but - as sad as it may sound - the vast majority of games created since then have their own flaws and too often their flaws are much greater. Most common ones are: lack of player freedom and lack of endgame content.
<br>
<br>The fact that there are still a lot of  Chaotic Chronicle/Chaotic servers around and people are still playing it - only proves the point that it has long-term potential, while younger games with fancier graphics rise and fa</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lineage-ii-the-chaotic-chronicle/user-reviews?user_review_id=7100408">Expand</a></span>
