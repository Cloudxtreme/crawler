First off, I have no problem with any of the multiplayer features and I bought, downloaded and started playing this within 2 hours of release.  2nd, I do not agree that this is just a re-hash of the 1st one.  They have made a great deal of game play enhancements to this game that have made it more like the difference between Farcry 2 and 3.  The weapons have been expanded and the more advanced weapons are very cool.  The modifications that you can add to your weapons after collecting a blueprint are fascinating and a number of them enhance the stopping power of the weapon greatly especially after you have upgraded it to the 4th level.
<br>The comments about collecting from the same boxes/suitcases, etc... multiple times is irrelevant.  In order to collect enough money to get the later weapons and upgrades, naturally the costs skyrocket, so they have made it easier by resetting some of the collection areas randomly (so you never know what you will be getting), but the amount of money you collect from the average drops do go up and the number of drop sites goes down dramatically.
<br>
<br>I have been having a great time with this release, playing for nearly 12 hours nonstop.  It&apos;s a lot of fun!  Having some 350 games just on Steam and another 500 elsewhere not to mention the disks, I rarely play one game for such an extended period.  Not sure if I would be up for a replay once it&apos;s complete as it&apos;s a very long and complicated set of quests and side missions intertwined.
<br>
<br>I do have some negative comments, they are all not positive, few games will ever get that treatment.  The primary question I have is whether the map should be bigger and the map system better adapted to see more of the area you have already explored. The current map is very detailed and if the mission takes you across the map, you can&apos;t see where you need to go nor map a route to get there.  This adds to the frustration of playing, however you will eventually memorize the map and know the correct route eventually.   I just think that with a better mapping interface, they could have made a bigger map and we would not have to visit the same areas so many times (areas, not exact locations, locations are visited once, but if the guy there sells weapons, you may not have the cash to buy the weapon you want and have to return once, max.
<br>There are issues with the sound, I believe them to be related to their generation of the torrential rains that this kind of jungle would naturally get.  However, sometimes, the sound is more like static rather than pounding rain.  I am sure that this could be fixed soon.  I honestly do not have any bugs that are in anyway annoying other than the rain.   However and as with all other games there are issues, but not something worth bashing the game over.  This is a solid game and you will get many many hours of game play out of it, as much or more that the average game of this type. (can&apos;t say for sure as I haven&apos;t completed it).
<br>
<br>I appreciated the plot, the missions and the side quests and it&apos;s very satisfying to get all the XP for completing most.   Which gets to my last issue.  The side quests come at you about 8 at a time and all ask for a specific item and quantity.  These missions are all completed while doing the main quest, so when you eventually find yourself back at the main base turning in your quests, you can rack up 3 or so levels.  I think that we could go for less of that as it is redundant, but as I said, they are all completed in the process of doing the main quest, you just have to explore, something that a lot of people these days seem to want to do less and less of and more run and gun.  I, myself, have always been the kind of player that takes his time and looks in every nook before heading on and there is a distinct advantage here should you enjoy that play style.
<br>
<br>Finally, they have enhanced the skill tree for this game.  It is much more detailed and the 3 vines are intertwined quite well so as to prevent you from putting all your skill in one tree which gives you the opportunity to experience some of the abilities that you may not start spending SP&apos;s until late in the game.
<br>
<br>Finally, Driving is very well done, very smooth, it is very hectic once you get in a boat as the water is teeming with zombies floating who wake up when they hear your boat, but you can easily plow through them with accelerate and easily rack up XP if you spend the appropriate amount of time to learn how to steer and accelerate fluid.  Definitely not any sort of negative or reason for taking away a star(s) for sure.
<br>
<br>Also, it is very easy to pick up a single player mission and turn it into a coop mission when you get to the boss or mass zombie fights, no issues with that and I think it was done seamlessly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3123828">Expand</a></span>

Riptide on the other hand is rushed from the get go. It&apos;s shocking how little effort went into making of Riptide.
<br>
<br>Throughout the game you will be constantly reminded what an half-ass job they did. Just the sheer amount of reused assets and locations is enough to make you disoriented and question yourself about whether or not you&apos;ve already been somewhere.
<br>
<br>The inclusion of many loading zones and ladders artificially prolong the game. Also, the enemies re-spawn when you load a zone, so most of the time you have to kill the same mob twice, which takes time but serves no real purpose.
<br>
<br>There is an overabundance of stuff to be had and the game fails to prove a challenge at any point in time.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, it is my opinion that this games is not worth your money or time. If you are looking for a similar game that you can play with your friends cooperatively, get the original Dead island and you will have a much better time with it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3933803">Expand</a></span>

<br>- much lower difficulty. Riptide is too easy compared to the first part.
<br>- Riptide you can heal as much as you have healing kits, but in the first part, the kits are much harder to
<br>get by.
<br>- a better gun implementation. That&apos;s good for Puna players. Or others chars who want to experiment
<br>with guns
<br>- Guns are too powerful later in Riptide. One good auto rifle will own them all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3940983">Expand</a></span>

Although it is alot harder... which I would have liked if it wasn&apos;t so unfairly hard. It uses the whole waves of enemies while you defend a area (and in some instances infinite respawning enemies, these areas that you have to run passed which you might realize and fight till you die). The original game had maybe 1 instance of them both, here we get 3-4 in a shorter game.
<br>
<br>+Improvements to combat like new mods and weapons
<br>+Mini quests (fetch quests) are more interesting this time around rather than the blandness of what was before.
<br>+Everything the worked before is maintained like modding weapons and visceral combat...
<br>
<br>-One bad new gameplay mechanic, a one-hit kill move where you drop down on a zombie from up high, or at least weaken them down enough for a single extra hit to do the trick. But I&#x2019;d reserve how often I did this, because it would always leave me staring at my feet for a few seconds while getting attacked by the other zombies, helpless and paralyzed...
<br>-You end up getting pulled underwater when you explore with the boat, I mean seriously? Insta kills just because we want to explore. If you want to make the game linear like the previous dead island, don&apos;t block off areas with insta kills, Because we can&apos;t see it coming. Just block the areas off with debris, bouy&apos;s, nets, rocks...
<br>-Difficulty scales widely against you when you play on your own, dead island was criticized for throwing in characters into cutscenes when you play on your own... now theres another reason to hate coop designed game. Not playtesting solo games?
<br>-The game is roughly 15 hours rather than the 22 hours of the original.
<br>-glitching weapons and enemies through walls and ground, crashes and disappearing items, teleporting even into far away areas when your coop partner dies.. ect
<br>-Story is even more disjointed and slow than it was before..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3151697">Expand</a></span>

If you could stand the first one then you might be able to stand Riptide. I however have played both and prefer the first one by a long shot. The graphics in this game are pretty bad, and character models are horrible. There are countless technical issues in Riptide, such as screen tearing, but the island does look beautiful from afar and the water does look pretty good. One thing I am really glad they changed is the weapons damage system which has been greatly improved, and therefor weapons last longer. I wished they had added more zombies types in this game, and it would really be a better game if it had a story that I cared about. If the story was good and the graphics were polished this game could get closer to a 7 or an 8. Saying that, this game did do some good things, like the new defense missions where there are zombies flooding a village and you put up barricades and kill all the zombies, I thought that was pretty cool. And I also liked the upgrade system in this game, which I believe returned from the last game, it still works the same and I still liked it. Saying all that this game could have been SO much better, and if Riptide could have a better story and graphics I&apos;d say they could get something really good going.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3242638">Expand</a></span>

And don&apos;t expect a good ending for it either.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=4000558">Expand</a></span>

On paper, the game looks like it has plenty of improvements, and even a new character to play with, but they fall short with repetitive loss of sound, heavy spawn glitches, and a lack of original dialog from the voice actors that makes the game play out like a &quot;WWE ##&quot; game by THQ with **** acting and wrestlers just told to say some lines and leave so they could splice them into the game with a grapefruit spoon and rusty barbed wire. I did enjoy that they added siege functions and that the guns are now actually FUNCTIONAL, unlike the first one. This game is worth it for a few nights of fun if you are only paying $14 bucks or less.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=4291177">Expand</a></span>

<br>But their havent been a single patch to this game since release, it feel like they just copy pasted the original dead island into a new enviroment.. The co-op didnt work on release, after that you couldnt find anyone to play with.. So if you are hunting achievements, you wont get 100% completion here, since its bugged and no one playing..

<br>So by that note and Dead Island 2 coming up, i would disregard this company, They either dont have the ressources to make their game work probably, or they just dont care..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=4920226">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- You start at level 14, and already can enjoy firearms in the first hour of the game (after that you still have to wait a long time to get your hand on a simple revolver).
<br>
<br>- The survivors are way more active, and as a player, you can bond with them during the numerous sieges where they have to defeat an horde of zombies. It&apos;s way more easy to go on a mission alone to help the ones that you saw struggling at your side. You really feel like a hero and not an errant boy.
<br>
<br>- The maps are less open and more structured, with &quot;hubs&quot; connected by &quot;corridors&quot;, with the occasional &quot;maze&quot; sections. You don&apos;t have to exit the map / quest panels to see where you have to go, making navigation more fluid.
<br>
<br>- The &quot;Dead Zone&quot; barracks are a nice way to offer side-quests with greater risks for greater rewards. (There are so many references to movies in this game it feels like a tribute).
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, Dead Island Riptide is not devoid of not-so-good aspects :
<br>
<br>- Zombie stills respawns, sometimes in a very annoying way.
<br>
<br>- The boss in the lab (no spoil at this point), feels too hard to beat with no clear progression for the player to see.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=5921647">Expand</a></span>

And because this wasn&apos;t enough the same company have released re-hashed versions of the same game under different names ever since. The PC version is even more terrible as it seems like an extremely rushed console port. It&apos;s such a bad game even a 10 year old child would get bored of it.</span>

The mechanics of the game are exactly the same as the original game (a game I absolutely love) which is no problem for me, I don&apos;t mind at all the hack and slash nature of the game, but the total content for quests, area, and objects in riptide amounts to LESS than the beach map part (the first part) in the original game. For people who don&apos;t know what I&apos;m talking about, they are charging the same amount to buy riptide as the original game, but riptide only has 1/6 the story, area, and object content as the original game.
<br>
<br>This game should have been an expansion for 1/10th the price, that&apos;s the short story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3132384">Expand</a></span>

Loved the first one, Dead Island. this game however is frustrating and has some stupid moments that go beyond trying to be a challenge. When your walking along and get jumped from all directions suddenly by groups of half a dozen zombies that with your stamina and health, you have no chance to fight so you just sit there and wait to die so you can reload. that&apos;s not a game, that&apos;s a joke by the programmers who are trying to loose their client base :D. Another thing that drives me nuts is what seems to be a lack of physics for water on zombie movement, they run faster in the water than I do on dry land? Overall I am disappointed in the game and if given the chance I would have waited for the price to drop by half before buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3170234">Expand</a></span>

This is very much like Dead Island 1 with hardly any changes other than the obvious cross-hair change, zombie types and basically- Weapons. It practically plays the same as its predecessor. But If you love killing zombies with a variety of weapons  Then this is your game!</span>

However i also liked Dead Island. I enjoy the game and stuff and was happy when i heard that another part of DI is coming out, riptide. I had big expectations, for example new story new characters and stuff. Sadly i got dissapointed. Reasons for it  Same characters nothing new, same setting again miles of jungle walking, again same car models,  1000 of other things.  Okey they added a new character okey. But what i expect of zombie games is new fire arms, you cant modifiy them for example no supressed weapons would be handy, no sights. Same boring quests, find, put find, search help, bring kill. Apart from that the story is kinda boring. Its not a new game. Its a DLC but its okey nothing special i finished it and it got boring after a while but if you have nothing to play, buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3131598">Expand</a></span>

Even if you did love the original, Riptide&apos;s lack of vision somehow serves to make its predecessor seem better by comparison. Riptide is not changed enough in good ways and changed more than enough in bad ways to take what was a critically divisive but ultimately enjoyable title and turn it into a thoroughly unenjoyable one.</span>

<br>I don&apos;t even know what went wrong, the gameplay is a mess, hitting zombies is just about luck and not skills anymore.
<br>The controls and the combat mechanics are clunky as hell and very annoying when you are surrounded by zombies. Not only they made them tougher but also buggier and glitchier just like everything else in this game.
<br>
<br>Visually it doesn&apos;t look that good either, zombies spawning in from of you out of nowhere, graphical bugs and random crashes.
<br>
<br>Horrible music, terrible voice acting.
<br>Constantly bashing zombies just got way too repetitive and boring in this sequel.
<br>
<br>This is a complete messed up game, don&apos;t even bother unless its $5.
<br>Save your cash and get the first Dead Island instead. This is just pathetic beyond relief.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3133680">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I loved the original DI. It was an innovative approach to the zombie genre which played a bit like Far Cry. This is not that. To start, Dead Island Riptide is full of bugs. Some are so bad they&apos;ll cause the game to crash. Another gripe is this entry plays more like a DLC than an actual sequel. As a fan of the original, I still say AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS.</span>

If you enjoyed the first one, you should enjoy this one. Some bugs have been fixed, some have not, some probably can&apos;t be. As far as Co-Op play complaints, I haven&apos;t tried it yet. I like to beat games on my own, get a feel for them and ace the controls before I play multi-player. As I said before, I do hope my $40 purchase is funding an all NEW dead island hopefully for this time next year or sooner.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3133921">Expand</a></span>

To Deep Silver, changing a game is literally just re-hashing the already-fulfilled story, adding one character, adding a few more weapons, some drivable boats, and fixing NONE of the problems of the original.</span>

Having a new character to play, new infected to kill, they also changed up the story a bit and some of the stuff you can do.
<br>I&apos;ve had no issue playing with friends as I have seen people complain.
<br>It&apos;s a continuation to the first game, kind of like the F.E.A.R. series,  L4D  L4D2, Serious Sam, etc. So of course it&apos;s going to have a lot of the same game mechanics, that&apos;s just a petty excuse to not like a game.
<br>It is a lot like Dead Island, but it does have a lot more stuff to it. Like new character, new (some fun) weapons, more infected, and for example another means of travel is a boat. I have personally had no issues with the game except some minor glitches like the first game had. It&apos;s just a bit dull when you&apos;re not playing with other people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3305944">Expand</a></span>

It is worth saying that it is more of the same. If you enjoy slaughtering hordes of undead monsters in new and progressively more interesting ways then this is a great in terms of gameplay.  Gameplay is excellent.  Voice acting in this game works too. Even some of the stereotypes are just indicative and not quite as annoying as one might imagine because the emotion in the voice acting is extremely good. Story is fine, but personally I still find it a bit too linear but not too jarringly so.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, the bugs and technical limitations plague it.  You throw a grenade and your framerate slows to 5 fps for the duration of the time your in the same areas of the detonation.  I use tri sli and tried switching it off. Same issue.  This is something you can work around but its annoying.  More annoying yet, there is a fair bit of switching between zones into instanced type areas.  OMG the loading times of these are insane. I haven&apos;t seen zone loading times like these in the last 6 years.  Seriously, you can go to take a shower. perhaps get a massage and come back with minutes to spare.
<br>
<br>This is a console game through and through (though one of the best games from a console and one of the ways it feels like a console game is that the field of view is limited.  However, not so jarringly as other console crossovers. I am pretty sensitive to Xbox field of view trick which is one of the reasons why I never really brought games for the consoles but somehow DI rarely made me feel outright nauseous.
<br>
<br>The biggest issue though, is the usual console issue.  This is a game designed for the console demographic. Many games studios have defined this as the &quot;casual gamer&quot; and this apparently means a short attention span with expectations of buying it Friday and finishing it by Monday. That was certainly the case with this game. Far far too short for a AAA title.
<br>
<br>There have been many worse to be fair and it may be that my expectations are not aligned with this &quot;casual gamer&quot; demographic but I like a game to explore and get my teeth into.  DI is free roam to be fair but in the same way as many other games get called free roam these days to tick a box.  ie. YOu can go back to old zones etc but there is no purpose to it if you were thorough the first time.
<br>
<br>I was trying to be thorough but even so.  I didnt make it last more than a weekend.  I know a lot of people that would be pretty unhappy if they brought this for their kids etc for that reason.  Next weekend, they will want a another new game.  Makes one wonder what will happen with the next gen consoles reportedly taking steps to kill off the second hand games market in various ways such as limiting access to content on replay.   Sorry I digress.
<br>
<br>All in all. fun and good entertainment.  The usual serious issues of a console port but the game play balances this out so it is worth a punt if it goes on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3144531">Expand</a></span>

Fix your problems, maybe you might see happy customer base, not to mention you should do more to for them, since you screwed them over right off the bat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3123177">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The animations are still god awful like in the first game, i don&apos;t think quicksilver thought of us again when we said we can see the weird arm movements in the shadows
<br>
<br>The graphics are even more pretty and i have to run the game medium settings, so graphics dont take a toll on lower settings.
<br>
<br>The setting of riptide looks exactly like every part of the other island in the first game but these areas are actually complimented by the graphics in terms of forest density and city textures.
<br>
<br>The new character seems overpowered but that &apos;ll be fixed soon or later.

riptide is like buying a lacoste or nike shirt in china, you get a cheap copy of a wonderful original thing.

if it was a dlc, i wouldnt mind, the other dlcs were not that great either,...

<br>but selling this as full new game, without any information that its basically the same game, only with terrible changes and an additional character... thats just robbery in my opinion.

<br>
<br>The game looks, plays and sounds EXACTLY like the original Dead Island. Graphics looks dated and ugly up close. No AA or AF, graphic options are poor. FOV is narrow and can&apos;t be changed ingame. Soundmix is awful (I had to crank voices up to 90%, and lower the others to 20-30% to be able to hear voices properly.) I am amazed that they have carried over the screeching sound for USB 7.1 headsets (makes the game unbearable to play with i.e. a G35.)
<br>
<br>Gameplay has its ups and downs. Mouse acceleration is apparent, it makes the fights more intense; that you have to struggle with the aim. But it makes gunplay insanely frustrating. There are lots of exploration to be done. There are lootable containers EVERYWHERE. They introduce very little new, and has put very little effort into fixing and upgrading previous mechanics.
<br>
<br>I am very much enjoying this game. And as many others have pointed out; if you did not like Dead Island, you will not like this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3124959">Expand</a></span>

When i say that Dead Island: Riptide has the exact same game play as the first Dead Island, i mean the EXACT same. There have not been any graphical improvements to the game over the first one, all of the old characters remain as playable characters (with the exception of a new character with a ridiculously fun, but overpowered running kick move), and I have only run across one new type of zombie so far in a few hours of game play. I have to admit, there seems to be a great variety of weapons that were not in the first game (my favorite is the staff that you wield like a bad-ass, zombie slaying Darth Maul). Considering that most new games have a starting price between $50-$60 dollars, i&apos;d say that Dead Island: Riptide is a great buy at the reduced price of $39.99 on steam considering the lack of new material.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3129754">Expand</a></span>

I have just finished the campaign, i will not play any multiplayer at all since in the first game it felt like i was boosting other team mates all over. My favorite character is Xian Mei, i cannot like the game on any of the others, so i do understand why some of you had a hard time in this one and i do understand the low ratings some of you have given. Story is simple, it follows the normal facts that would happen in case of a zombie plague. You get to do normal stuff in such case, help people that otherwise cant, or wont help themselves. You can feel the fear from given situation and the shivers from the gruesome fighting. It is disgusting, but feels justified. Totally awesome game. I recommend it totally. Do not treat it as a shooter, do not try to run past the action, just live it. I will give it a straight 10 despite the multiplayer and coop not being taken into consideration. I am treating Dead Island as a genre of its own. You cannot compare it to Left4Dead or any other game. This is the best horror zombie story telling adventure ever. The graphics and the places you visit are simply astonishing.  It is like a virtual vacation to some of the most exotic places.  I must say, first impression made by first Dead Island wasn&apos;t much when i first tried it.. let the game rest for quite a while then went in to finish it. After level 20 or so i started to get the hang of it, the fights were no longer boring. I presume most people that gave low rating experienced the same as me, a unsuccesful first contact. Just give it some time, you need to get used to this game, as it is one of a kind. It is the Far Cry 3 of horror games, so to say. Enjoy it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3143006">Expand</a></span>

It was impossible to beat the game without the help of a friend in the original, and that is not so the case in Riptide. What made me rate this game a nine is that some of the missions in the game remind me of some in the original. For example, you have to get fill up a can of gas again. I&apos;m also not a big fan of the chrome engine, but I won&apos;t let that affect the score. A really cool feature I enjoy is the import character feature.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3126445">Expand</a></span>

The game has improved gameplay, improved zombie danger levels (i get killed SO many times if i&apos;m uncareful now, or if i&apos;m swarmed...), they have added so many more weapons and mods, etc...
<br>
<br>The only points of critic i have are the small time bugs i&apos;ve encountered, like zombies running through barrels or crates instead of pathing around it, but nothing has crashed or frozen. I haven&apos;t found big gamebreaking bugs yet or bugs so bad i started hated playing the game...
<br>
<br>Another point of critic is the somewhat half-assed  bad start of the story to the point where i just skipped it and wanted to hit some zombies in the face with my new BBQ knife. You wash up on the shore, some chick runs to you yelling some crap and i was there like: &quot;who the f* are you now?!&quot;
<br>
<br>Overal, great zombie slasher game, i&apos;m loving it so far i got 13 hours in about 2 days already  so if you have 40 euro&apos;s/dollars spare anyway, buy it until Metro Last Light or Company of Heroes 2 come out (because by that time you&apos;ll have finished Dead Island Riptide)

It has new zombie types (drowner, screamer, grenadier, mutated scientist, and wrestler generally), and if you count the variations (frenzied walkers, drugged infected, etc.) there are quite a few more, including &quot;boss&quot; types that are far tougher. There are several new weapons, with blades, blunt, and guns, including scoped rifles. A new class of stackable throwing knives has been added. It has a new vehicle type, the boat. There is an additional character to play with an entirely new skill tree. New explosives include several types of mines that can be placed on the ground to defend an area.
<br>
<br>New elements include base/hub defence, where you have to stay alive and defeat groups of zombies that are attacking. Also, the other main characters are present and you are able to interact with them, and they assist in the defense missions. You can use fences to close off approach routes, and in some case you can bring stationary heavy guns from other locations to defend the area. You are able to upgrade the members of your team, improving the weapons they possess or the items they are able to sell you. Your group of survivors moves from base to base, so they are not stuck in one place the entire game. Dead Zones, like mini-dungeons, exist, where buildings have been closed up and you can venture in if you want to... there are rare craftplans and craftparts that can be found in them that enable you to do the final upgrades for the team members, but you are not forced to enter into them. A new quest mechanic exists, where instead of the minimap leading you directly to the quest target, it takes you to an area, and you need to search around in that area to find what you are looking for. For co-op, there is a new rage mechanic where you can sacrifice your own rage and instead get a group benefit for 30-60 seconds.
<br>
<br>It is shorter, than dead island  I would say that if you actually do the quests and explore everything, it is about 65% as big. If you only do the main sequence questline, then it is maybe 50%. One of the complaints I have seen is that it is a lot like the original... it is a continuation of the storyline, of course it is a lot like the original. But it is not simply more of the same, and perhaps these people who are complaining after only playing a few hours just never got far enough to see the majority of it. If you did not like Dead Island, you are unlikely to enjoy Riptide. If you did like it, this is far more than a DLC. allso its moddable to customize to your own game preferance, and mods some very good mods made by modders all ready  available to download  just do a simple google search</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3272460">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t need this game to reinvent the wheel, I laugh at people who make these sorts of arguments considering very few games today are truly revolutionizing anything.

I just want to have some visceral combat and get cool weapons to continue the slaughter.

Most of the reviews that are critical I wonder if they played the game as it is so much better than many of the new big ticket games out. This game does have new Zombie types! It is a polished piece of work with the best zombie physics engine going. rich textures, great sound, amazing detail (water that gets cloudy the deeper you look). A skill system that shows results immediately. Variable skill zombies, a weapon modification system, repeating quests and re-spawning zombies in public zones to always keep you on your toes. This game can scare the life out of you if you let it.
<br>
<br>By far the best Zombie adventure I have played yet. There are not many games that can give you that trapped feeling when the zombies come. This game is a new use of an awesome engine that is a natural extension of the original Dead Island.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3165921">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve sunk 20 hours into this game in the first week and can&apos;t wait to play more.
<br>
<br>If you are looking for a deep story experience or the latest and greatest in game mechanics and design, this will not do much for you.  If you want a game that is a lot of fun, can be played w/ friends, and involves zombies, do not pass up on this game.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re really on the fence about this then just wait a few weeks as the price will drop.  The last game sold millions of copies and was not a best in class product, so, at least Deep Silver knows how to draw you in for the fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3132557">Expand</a></span>

Its kinda crappy to see all these low scores on such a brought out new game. This game is actually more playable than the first one! It has new features that make zombie slaying more easy, new weapons which balance out gameplay, a new leveling system which doesn&apos;t restrict a character to one weapon all the time. This game was bent on ideas that a lot of us probably suggested them to do! Sure the gameplay and story seem a bit slow, but the charm is still there and its more than enough to satisfy a zombie slayer in times like this. I say a 7 should sound fair. Mainly because at launch it was sent out what seems too early, but give them some slack. This game is good enough to be able to play once or twice fully and is somewhat worth the money. The gameplay isn&apos;t as shabby as other certain games... you all know what I am talking about... and it brings friends close together in another fight for survival and more zombies. However the zombie scale seems to have increased quite a bit, I think its more of a challenge this time. Instead of the first ones where all you did was walk up to a zombie and kick it in the face and stab it.
<br>
<br>Its a game that is willing to do a lot. Its impressive for a first release however could be tweaked on more before said release as there are some complications. No worries though, when you realize how much there is to do on this small island, it doesn&apos;t become a tedious task. Its just another zombie survival game worth its time</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3135386">Expand</a></span>

<br>What sets the Dead Island series ahead of</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">The Dead Island series is probably one of the most divisive game franchises of the last 5 years. Either you really like it, or you just don&apos;t. I played through the original a couple of times using different characters, not because the story was any good, because it isn&apos;t, and not because it looks very good, but honestly it looks pretty average.
<br>
<br>What sets the Dead Island series ahead of other zombie games is the great coop support and combat mechanics, specifically the analog based control you have when it comes to planning body part specific attacks against enemies. With a good group of 2-4 people, you can wade through large groups of infected pretty quickly, and it&apos;s super satisfying breaking the arms on a big thug and then whittling away at him while he&apos;s trying to head butt or bite at you.
<br>
<br>The story in Riptide is also a bit better than the original. This time they dive into the background of the infection more, which is cool. It&apos;s still not Uncharted or Bioshock levels of storytelling, but they give you just enough to maintain interest.
<br>
<br>In the end, if you played the original and enjoyed it, you&apos;ll probably have a lot of fun with this one. If you never played the original, I would recommend buying it first, you can pick it up for $5-$10 pretty regularly if you keep an eye out for Steam or Greenmangaming sales. Play it with other people to get the full experience out of it. It may take a little to reach a point where you feel like a badass, but the payoff is definitely worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3135820">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s slower paced combat, but it&apos;s also far more visceral, and the RPG elements let you customize your character to your play style. Also, the weapon mods are dope.</span>

Although, the graphics are not such good ones, and the story from the first one is far better. The amount of &quot;food medicines&quot; in the game which cannot be carried decreased, and the amount of medic kits found for free in the map increased, meaning the game became easier. A good game, but could be far better.</span>

It doesn&apos;t necessarily mean it&apos;s bad, although it can get like that sometimes, it just means they aimed at die hard fans as the key demographic. Its somewhat disturbingly harsh difficulty is a challenge for veteran players and as such, i guess, can be a turn off for some of the newcomers. The weapons and recipes are familiar and fresh at the same time. The new map is  very detailed, though the mini map feature is a little retarded. The game is flawed, that&apos;s a given, but it&apos;s also tons of fun, once you put some time into it. Or you can wait for a proper patch, so you don&apos;t have to suffer any indignity.

It have some things which could be better, too similar to original, but overall very fun to play! Need some new missions DLC soon!!!</span>

The game has some minor improvements, a new character, new enemies and new weapons. It is basically an expansion pack to the original game and should be evaluated as such. Nothing spectacular, but overall a good game.</span>

It&apos;s funny and its story is so much better than the first game. It still has its bugs and sometimes it&apos;s unplayable. But when it gets to multiplayer-mode it is awesome.</span>

That being said, this zombie game is good, but not great: the graphics are great and really add to the creepy atmosphere, some of the game-play mechanics and controls felt clunky, but not to the point of actually hurting the game.  the zombie AI plays exactly  how you might expect it to (an the downside it seems like the human AI does too at times).  The fact of the matter is, this game is really quite decent, however there was just one thing that killed it for me: the inclusion of a skill tree...pretty much everything else in the game makes sense for a zombie survival horror: weapons deteriorate and eventually break, you can hold very little ammo and guns are extremely hard to find), even the crafting (while somewhat over the top with slightly ridiculous weapons) still makes sense, but when you add in a skill tree and a leveling system, it  takes something away from the experience...but maybe that&apos;s just me, either way the game is good, but definitely not worth its current price-tag on steam ($40), if it is ever on sale and you enjoy zombie games you should try it out, odds are you will enjoy it (at least for a little while).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3237761">Expand</a></span>

As stated before by others, if you loved the original, you will enjoy this one too. In fact I think Deep Silver managed to mess (a bit) up more things than corrected, but it is still a good game. The graphics are basically the same; no wonder, we are still on a tropical island. I would say it is beautiful, although, for example, the waterfalls look like in ten year old games. I think the overall FPS dropped compared to the &quot;vanilla&quot; DI, but it still can produce 25-30 frames per sec on a 7 year old Pentium D with Radeon HD5770 on almost maximum settings (cheers for Deep Silver!). The gameplay is the same: you start with a basic weapon, you get quests, begin exploring, get rewards and loot. A big plus that you can import your DI characters and continue on the same level where you left them, although you will not get their equipment and known mods. I think the movement of the characters became more sluggish, but you will get used to it in no time. The voice actors for the main characters are the same as in DI, and the overall quality of acting is also the same: not bad, but no Oscar. The story so far contains absolutely no surprises, but I must tell, I don&apos;t care. I am on a zombie infested island, and I am not there for drama. I am there to kick ass. The game deliver this, so why complain?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3238785">Expand</a></span>

I love the gameplay, the characters, the missions, and grabbing loot a long the way. It&apos;s always fun to grab ten dollars off a zombie as they fly in the air from one of your machete slices. That&apos;s always epic. My brother and I played this co-op and completed it twice, and I played two times solo and completed with all four characters. It&apos;s so much fun. He likes the second one better, but I like the first better. This one is great, but it&apos;s too short, and there are too few missions. It&apos;s rather easy compared to the long and complicated first game. Which went on forever. But this game there is beautiful scenery, and an interesting story. my FAVORITE part is your ability to fight missions as a team, so with all the characters, plus others. Best aspect of this whole game. I hope they keep coming out with more dead islands, becuase I will keep buying them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=3831884">Expand</a></span>

<br>I decided to give the game another chance (as a result of my replay of first DI and deep willingness to have more time in DI universe) in 3 years after my first try, and... Guys, the game is pretty epic, I was wrong and idk what I wanted to see in it at the time of my fist gameplay =)
<br>On my second play-through I noticed how many cool and new features they had added, and how greatly graphics had been improved (I replayed it just after Dead Island). The story is not bad, but gameplay itself was improved noticeably. I really loved it.

<br>Don&apos;t trust the haters. If you loved Dead Island, you&apos;ll definitely love this one too. It should&apos;ve come out as a expansion, though.</span>

The change in atmosphere, the more cinematic cut-scenes, added waterboats, and new enemies are great additions and make &apos;Riptide&apos; worth experiencing even if you think you know what the game already has to offer.
<br>
<br>One of the best parts about this series is how long it takes to actually get some god damn firearms. I&apos;m sure that&apos;s a huge turn-off for some people, but I love clawing my way through horde after horde with just my bare hands and some pipes to get to the good stuff. &apos;Riptide&apos; has more of a focus on firearms than &apos;Dead Island&apos;, but the grinding to find them isn&apos;t lost at all. &apos;Riptide&apos; is also far less punishing when it comes to how quickly your weapons break apart. So there&apos;s always that.
<br>
<br>As for the story, it&apos;s pretty much what you&apos;d expect, cheesy dialogue from a group of misfit characters trying to escape the island to save their lives, and he music is better than the first and feels like it would be right at home in an 80&apos;s slasher flick. There&apos;s also plenty to do; mostly find this, find that, go here, go there, save him, save her, but despite the repetition in quests, it never felt like I was doing the same thing over and over again. &apos;Riptide&apos; is definitely worth picking up during the next sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-island-riptide/user-reviews?user_review_id=4920817">Expand</a></span>
