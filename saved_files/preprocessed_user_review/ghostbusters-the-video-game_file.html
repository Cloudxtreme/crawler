However... there is no multiplayer so no ghost busting co-op with friends and the story line is very linear. still worth a good play through everyone should enjoy this game.</span>

From the hilarious writing (the cut scene with the TV toward the end killed me), to the voices, to all the details and destruction you unleash upon it all...WOW. Definitely worth the wait. The bad points are so overshadowed by the good ones, they&apos;re almost not worth mentioning. But I will. ;) The ending felt rather hasty...or rough. Or rushed? Not sure. Something felt off, at the very least. Venkman&apos;s &quot;love interest&quot;, Ilyssa Selwyn was utterly superfluous and her voice actress (Alyssa Milano, I believe) was uninspiring and felt out place. At least some sections of the game (sewers of the Lost Island, and large swaths of the Central Park Graveyard) were verging on being mind-numbingly uneventful. Again, thankfully, these things are relatively minor in the face of all that went right in a product from an industry where these things almost universally go south. Oh, and one additional thing I feel the need to bring up... These people who are marking the game down for not including the multiplayer of the console? Get over it. They didn&apos;t have the funds to get multiplayer going on the PC (so I read in an interview). Given the circumstances, they should be PRAISED for doing the right thing and bringing the price down instead of shafting us.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ghostbusters-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=425437">Expand</a></span>

That, and the fact that the same music from the movie is rehashed on every level (it&apos;s fun the first three times or so, but then you get tired of it) are the only downsides. The voice acting is good, the humor is pretty solid, and it&apos;s definitely an all-around ghostbusters experience.</span>

<br>Decent but dated.
<br>It&#x2019;s so rare to find a licensed game actually worth playing through... and thankfully this is one of them.
<br>In Ghostbusters the video game you play as a nameless and voiceless recruit&#x2026;
<br>Perfect opportunity to have a customizable character... but no... You&#x2019;re just some generic dude that joins the ghostbusters squad.
<br>Your journey starts checking out a hotel and ends up in a chase to shut down this giant ghost portal by taking care of different points across Manhattan.
<br>This game is about 7 and a half hours long, and is varied and well-designed preventing repetitiveness to kick in&#x2026;
<br>You&#x2019;ll visit spooky libraries, different dimensions, and a graveyard just to name a few...
<br>But this game is from 2009 and it definitely shows with its grainy texture&#x2026;
<br>It&#x2019;s very hard on the eyes after being so used to the graphics and textures of modern day games 7 years later&#x2026;
<br>The actual gameplay here is engaging enough to force your eyes to just deal with it&#x2026;
<br>You have a proton pack and a scanner..
<br>As you progress through the story you&#x2019;ll gain new abilities and modes for the proton pack which tie into level progression itself, like being able to make a slime tether to pull items, and you of course have attacks and ways to capture the ghosts you run into&#x2026;
<br>To capture a ghost you have to weaken it, shoot out your capture stream and try to wiggle it into your ghost trap&#x2026;
<br>There are also possessed creatures that you can just straight up kill and not have to capture.. which I found to be way more fun to deal with&#x2026;
<br>The ghost capturing sections of the game for me were by far the worst&#x2026;
<br>they take way too long to complete and bring the game to a crawl&#x2026; they are spaced out more the deeper you get into the game, but are still an eye roll when they pop up&#x2026;
<br>And with the scanner you can scan a ghost or enemy to learn its weakness so you know which mode to use... but it also rewards you with cash, as do the collectibles in the game, giving true incentive to capture stats and seek items out to upgrade your proton pack modes&#x2026;
<br>And at the end of each spooky location is a pretty awesome boss battle.. all of which feel unique from each other, and the  game does a great job of hyping them up with their story as your progress through the levels
<br>there wasn&#x2019;t one I didn&#x2019;t have fun trying to defeat or capture&#x2026;
<br>most if not all being fan favorites as I&#x2019;ve never really seen a ghostbusters movie.
<br>There is a game save bug here though so be cautious&#x2026;
<br>I Turned my ps3 off right before the final 2 bosses and when I woke up in the morning the game wasn&#x2019;t reading my save.. Thankfully it did after I reinstalled... but be warry of this glitch going in&#x2026;
<br>And this games multiplayer is lost in time, it&#x2019;s no longer works.
<br>Other than dated grainy textures, this is a really solid game worth checking out if you&#x2019;re a ghostbusters fan.
<br>I give ghostbusters the video game
<br>a 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ghostbusters-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=6880591">Expand</a></span>

It is a cool game otherwise, funny plot, good graphics, and great voice acting from the kings of ghostbusting themselves. That is, if your computer can actually play the game. If you visit the official forums you will see horror stories of gamers that have never been able to get past the loading screen because it will crash their rig, among other things. Worst of all is that there is no support for the PC game as a patch hasn&apos;t been released yet, and this game is nearly a year and a half old. With these kinds of gameblocking bugs and no show of support from the publisher or devs, one can only say that this game is nothing but a bargain bin item.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ghostbusters-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=1427163">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> I am really enjoying playing Ghostbusters. The game starts slow IMO but the story is top notch and the graphics and physics make for some great action.The trapping ghosts and flinging objects around is awesome. lots of upgrades and gadgets, the &quot;hot and cold&quot; PKA meater works well to help the player through the levels. Probably the best movie game of all time, the one to break the mold.</span>

The graphics, for a first time run game, and only 1 or two bugs.... terrific game for all!!!</span>

Then it would run until I tried to exit the first room - when it crashed again. After reloading I got past that, then the first time I tried to use my gun - crashed again with gun sound looping. I&apos;m really disappointed, as I&apos;m old enough to have seen GB when it first came out, and I really liked the look of this game - but as it is, it&apos;s unplayable. Note that I don&apos;t have a top-of-the-line system, but it IS decent, 4 gig ram, XP SP3, dual core e6650, 250gb sata drive, ati hd3850. My setup handles every other game out there so I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s the game that&apos;s the problem. Very poor quality control, as MANY other users have complained about glitches too. Even a five is generous because until it&apos;s patched it&apos;s unplayable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ghostbusters-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=84427">Expand</a></span>

As soon as I finished it, I was ready to play it all over again. The pacing is beautiful -- plenty of action, but enough down time between battles to explore and appreciate the levels, which I feel are some of the most amazingly crafted and well polished in any game to date. Visual and audio effects are spot-on in every detail, and music, although somewhat repetitive, is very well implemented. Naturally, most of the music comes right out of the original soundtrack, but if you listen closely I believe there are a few new arrangements in there to keep things from getting too stale. Best of all, the writing is solid and very much consistent with the spirit of the movies such that this could easily have been Ghostbusters 3 -- something Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis were actually hoping to achieve in this game according to press releases. Granted, the story is designed in such a way that you get to &quot;relive&quot; a lot of the classic moments from the original films, so there may be some degree of creativity lacking, but on the other hand I think it&apos;s perfectly legitimate since that&apos;s what most fans of Ghostbusters have been craving since 1984. As for the comedic value of the writing, the style of humor may not be to everyone&apos;s taste (i.e., if you didn&apos;t find the original movies funny then don&apos;t expect to be blown away here either), but personally I found myself laughing out loud on more than one ocassion at some of the dialogue/one-liners, paricularly from Bill Murray. Kudos especially to all members of the cast for the exceptional voice acting -- I was very pleased to discover that time has not faded their ability to bring these beloved characters back to life. Even though in reality the actors are all much older, suprisingly, you can&apos;t really detect that too much in the sound of their voices. To my ears they all still sounded very much youthful. Combine that with rest of the presentation of this game, and it just adds to that illusion that absolutely no time has passed between the end of the last film and now. It&apos;s amazing actually how playing this game can make you feel like you&apos;ve gone into some kind of time warp -- the continuity between the movies and this game is damn near seamless. To sum up -- this is a fantastic game and a must buy for any die-hard Ghostbusters fan. If you&apos;re like me and all you&apos;ve ever wanted to do since you saw the first movie was strap on a Proton Pack and kick some serious ghost butt, then this game will surely not disappoint you (just make sure you&apos;ve got the system specs to handle it!).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ghostbusters-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=425428">Expand</a></span>

It seems as though multiplayer was an afterthought. The single player plays like a movie which is great. It takes you right back in time and is true to the world that was created. The upgrades and new technology are fun to get but almost too easily spoon fed to you. A little more freedom such as a spoke and hub type of system would have added much more interesting gameplay and challenge much like the NES version. I really wish that we could experience this world with 3 other friends cooperatively. The only multiplayer mode I found interesting was the survival mode. The other modes are just ok. Really the multiplayer is a pretty big disappointment to me. Overall, the single player makes this game worth the money. I guess we can hope for updates and downloadable content? Ok, perhaps we better pray.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ghostbusters-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=425465">Expand</a></span>

Improvements sure, but can not be perfect in the first launch now can we, or where could the game build to.  Great storyline, terrific REAL voices of all original Ghostbuster&apos;s!! This game is fun as heck and only one like it and very fun!</span>

Intensive care was given to make it feel like a funny - trilling - mystical experience and with an awesome replay value. I would also say that the game was made for 2012 computers (when the movie is supposed to be released), because It kind of gets slow in my 2008 - 24inch iMac.. And this was with low level detail settings.<br>When I purchase my next upgrade I will definitely play it again with high detail.<br><br>Also It took me a little bit to get hooked when I played it the first time, but Its worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ghostbusters-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=1427187">Expand</a></span>

Also, you can&apos;t custom set mouse buttons for &apos;Jump&apos;, etc... &gt;&gt;&gt;2nd: I think having it in 1st person view instead of 3rd person view would have fit this game better. When it&apos;s in 3rd person you have to see yourself and it blocks the view, it&apos;s an unnecessary obstruction, and 3rd person decreases performance since the PC has to render the character data along with everything else.... &gt;&gt;&gt;3rd: The game is a bit heavy on my hardware and it made my 9600 GT vCard too hot and caused a shutdown, so far just one time it happened. However, overall performance plays and appears OK (avg 42fps).. OVERALL it&apos;s a neat and fun game, but just not one of my favorites..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ghostbusters-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=1684532">Expand</a></span>

The voice-acting is obviously amazing as the whole cast (pretty much) shows up for the game, and if you&apos;re a fan of well done dialogue and story -driven gameplay; then you&apos;ll probably enjoy this game. The only hurdles for me were the controls were a little tough to master, but that was mostly remedied by the wireless xbox controller (which I found to be waaay easier than mouse/keyboard in this case). The ghost catching, while well done and authentic, does get a bit repetitive after a while. The graphics are a plus as well; art style is good, and the characters are immediately recognizable (a failing in another franchise title). I even found myself sitting around in the Ghostbusters firehouse listening to the phone calls that come in. I enjoyed this game quite a bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ghostbusters-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2115422">Expand</a></span>

I honestly think this is about as close as I have ever felt to being in a well loved film franchise. The dialogue initially started a little ropey but the cast soon settle in and you get to roam through some classic Ghostbusters scenarios which all build to a fantastic ending. One fault, the cherubs. I have no idea what the hell they were thinking. Purely on the immersion though. 10/10 for me.

Do I care about the above?  Not in the slightest.  In between fighting ghosts you are listening to the well written, well voiced acting of all the major characters involved in the movies.  The one-liners are fantastic.  Fighting said ghosts is an absolute blast, and the included damage meter really shows how destructive fighting ghosts can be.  There are escort missions, iconic boss fights, dimensional travel, etc, ie: all the stuff you would expect being a paranormal investigator.  The graphics are fantastic and the control scheme works for what it is.  This game is a far cry than its predecessor on the NES.  Must buy for any real Ghostbuster fan.  This is essentially Ghostbusters 3, and will bring a smile to your face.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ghostbusters-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=2279815">Expand</a></span>

My personal opinion is that even though the game is quite good, and is written and voiced by some of the original actors, it&apos;s not as good as the movies. But with it&apos;s own, original story it&apos;s not too bad either. If you&apos;re a fan - GO! If not you can just as well let this game slide.</span>

I picked it up on sale for &#xA3;2 to give it a go because I adore the films. Upon getting a few hours in I have found myself to be extremely surprised by just how good the game is.
<br>
<br>Graphically it looks lovely (for a 2009 game, at least), and runs smoothly without any issues. The sound, music and voice acting is spot on (all main cast members do the voice overs). It &quot;feels&quot; exactly like you are in a Ghostbusters film. The characters chat and joke with eachother and the humour from the films is here in abundance. The sound of zapping ghosts with your proton pack is pure joy.
<br>
<br>You take on the role of a &quot;rookie&quot; Ghostbuster, recruited to help the team. A lot of locations from the original film show up in the game, which are great fun to visit. The combat is refreshingly fun and different.
<br>
<br>Although the multiplayer is sadly missing from the PC version (I was very bummed out by this), I can safely say this game is good - great if you are a fan of the films. For the money I paid, it is WELL worth it. If you fancy a bit of Ghostbusters nostalgia - this is the game to play.

Alright, Ghostbusters: The Game! But before I say anything more, I must admit that &#x2018;Ghostbusters: The Movie&#x2019; is probably my favorite movie of all time. The first one, not the second one&#x2026;let&#x2019;s not get crazy here. I must have seen that movie over 100 times by now, and I&#x2019;ll gladly sit down to watch it sometime in the near future, possibly even after I finish this review. Back off man, I&#x2019;m a scientist. So needless to say, I&#x2019;m a really big fan. Anyway, this isn&apos;t the first Ghostbusters game to have been made, and if you&apos;ve played the ones for Nintendo, you&#x2019;ll know that they aren&apos;t very good. They&#x2019;re pretty terrible actually. So when I first picked this one up, I had pretty low expectations, especially since Atari released it.
<br>
<br>Now I have no idea who wrote the story for this game but it&#x2019;s extremely well done, and playing through it is like watching an entirely new version of the original Ghostbusters movie. It&#x2019;s all there, just re-arranged and updated to be shown through the eyes of you, a new hire for the Ghostbusters being put through the ringer his first day on the job. It&#x2019;s wonderful. The cast signed on to do the voices (brand new dialogue with lots of references to classic lines from the movie), t he unforgettable music is present throughout, and there are tons of recognizable landmarks and characters such as the library, old firehouse, Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, Slimer, Walter Peck, etc.
<br>
<br>As for the gameplay, it&#x2019;s pretty much what you&#x2019;d expect from a polished, third person AAA title. The controls are fluid and work well, catching ghosts is fun and sometimes difficult, and the camera is perfect. Characters can heal one another after they&apos;ve fallen, so you don&#x2019;t die too often, and regular cut-scenes and change in environments are plentiful so you won&#x2019;t get bored very easily. You really can&#x2019;t go wrong with the gameplay here if you even remotely like games in the third person perspective. So all-in-all if you&#x2019;re a big fan of the Ghostbusters movies, then I&#x2019;d easily recommend playing through this game for the story alone. It truly is worth it&#x2026;alright, who brought the dog?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ghostbusters-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=4920771">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game is considered to be the third Ghostbusters movie since it takes place after the 2nd movie and has a good plot, and the return of some favourite ghosts and some ghosts who were mentioned in the movie like the Sloar but never seen in the movie.
<br>
<br>You play as a nameless rookie, right of the bat this is awesome because it makes you feel like a Ghostbuster, the rest of the group all call you rookie which is a nice touch, this would have been a fantastic opportunity to create your own character like in Saints row or the Sims, however you can&apos;t do that, plus the game should have been in first person and you never saw your character, this would make it feel like YOU WERE the new Ghostbuster, not playing AS the new Ghostbuster, but overall I enjoy playing as &quot;Rookie&quot; but I would have loved either character customization or a first person view.
<br>
<br>All the cast is back, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson all return to their roles and haven&apos;t changed a bit, all 4 are funny and just as memorable as they were in the movies and all the chatter in-between them felt like I was really there listening to them.
<br>
<br>All the ghosts are creative, and all of them are fun to take down with your Proton pack, speaking of which your Proton pack has 4 firing modes, but I&apos;m not telling you what they are, why? Because you need to buy this game to find out yourself.
<br>
<br>The attention to detail in this game is amazing, the damage you leave on the walls with your Proton packs, crows flapping in the distance, all the small artifacts you can find in the levels and the best is exploring the Ghostbuster&apos;s HQ, trust me I love looking around in the HQ, it might be small but it&apos;s amazing. Plus the graphics are really good.
<br>
<br>This game is short and has no CO-OP or multiplayer, which I don&apos;t mind because this game already packs a lot of content with secrets, upgrades, the attention to detail, the ghosts, the cast and more!
<br>
<br>This game is a love letter to all Ghostbuster fans, if you enjoy the movies, there&apos;s no reason to say no to this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ghostbusters-the-video-game/user-reviews?user_review_id=5162377">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>It is a great homage to Ghostbusters Fans:
<br>a) All of the actors in the films lent their voices for the game.
<br>b) Lots of references
<br>Gameplay is fun, action oriented, has variety of stages and good story. I liked it, it&apos;s only issue is that this game was not completely polished but it is an enjoiable experience.
<br>Gamepad recommended (and I usually prefer mouse + keyboard)</span>
