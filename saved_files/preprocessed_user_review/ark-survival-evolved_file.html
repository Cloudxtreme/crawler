Has a lot of great promise but a rather steep learning curve if playing alone (similar to Don&apos;t Starve), but has a ton of potential for being the next great survival game. Lots of solo and community driven gameplay elements and a pretty immersive world to be in. Not the most &quot;realistic&quot; survival game in existence but it does take a more grounded approach to movement and fatigue (i.e. If you are swimming to long and you run out of stamina you may actually drown just like in real life).
<br>
<br>Biggest issues are that it does take a pretty meaty rig to take full advantage of the graphics (seems like a modified Crytek engine) on the highest settings. This game is JUST in early access so I expect to see some of the animations, bugs, and slight clipping issues get resolved over time. I only have about 8ish hours with this game so my review is based on initial impression and overall potential the game has.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ark-survival-evolved/user-reviews?user_review_id=5295069">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>From blatant refusal to resolve horrendously broken core game mechanics for two years straight, to releasing full price DLC midway through the most pathetic Early Access process I&apos;ve ever seen, to stretching themselves hair-thin across editions, expansions and console versions, constantly making useless content additions while the game&apos;s functionality went down the toilet, to not being able to wait until going out of Early Access before charging full price, to not even having a finished product on their hands when getting out of EA and finally making content modifications reinforcing ARK&apos;s focus on assaulting players through exhaustion and psychopathic degrees of grind, I not only believe ARK goes down as one of the most disappointing titles in history, but also, the team behind it are a bunch of sick, deranged individuals.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ark-survival-evolved/user-reviews?user_review_id=7703343">Expand</a></span>

I had a lot of fun with the game so far - BUT that&#xB4;s because I decided early to host and administer my own private server, playing with a bunch of people I know and trust. There are some technical problems with this game, such as disappearing items and dinos, resetting characters, missing skills and stuff. If I played on an official server, I had to live with that, but since I was my own boss with my own server I could always execute some console commands to let dinos and items reappear or level up some character again which was mysteriously lost in oblivion before. I fully understand all those negative reviewers here, according to the official servers and the developer&#xB4;s ignorance. If you want to play this game: Basically it&#xB4;s worth it, but don&#xB4;t even consider playing on official servers and start your own one, alternatively find some good unofficial server hosted by a good private community.
<br>
<br>Update November 2017:
<br>
<br>To quote the developers: &quot;There will never, ever be any monetization of this game whatsoever other than possible entirely new Expansion ARK&apos;s (whole new worlds as expansion pack). There will never be any pay items, not even cosmetics -- there WILL be tons of cosmetic &quot;item skins&quot; but they will all be earnable in-game rewards and time-limited free events to encourage gameplay, nothing ever to spend any $$$ on. [...] To be clear, we at Studio Wildcard are very much against any in-game monetization whatsoever. We&apos;ve seen it distort too many otherwise good games.&quot;
<br>
<br>Now they have added microtransactions to the game! No hint, no announcment, but perky excuses. Dear gamers: Do not buy this game, it&#xB4;s been developed by liars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ark-survival-evolved/user-reviews?user_review_id=7519686">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Firstly the game IS NOTHING LIKE ADVERTISED. NOTHING. Literally no one gives a f*** if you are a new player they will kill you and grief you on a PVP server because they can.
<br>
<br>Forget taming dinosuars, you will NEVER get the chance on a PVE server.  Older players have made it their life mission to royally screw you over as a new player.  You get to choose spawn locations from a tab, first logging in you will be surrounded by bases of other players.  Why? Because they are d***s.  The mechanics in the game don&apos;t allow you to build near anyone&apos;s base, so the low level area with hardly any carnivores? Ya they have them locked down to make it impossible for you to level, progress, and respawn when you die.  It&apos;s also intentional. They will build small nods inbetween their bases to prevent other players from building.  So you are forced to move into the higher level carnivore infested areas to do anything.
<br>
<br>All in all if this doesn&apos;t detour you from buying the game you&apos;ve been warned. It&apos;s nothing like it&apos;s presented on youtube, by people that have been in the game since day one, with huge tribes, and private servers.
<br>
<br>In all honesty No Man&apos;s Sky was better than this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ark-survival-evolved/user-reviews?user_review_id=7768825">Expand</a></span>

The game was beautiful, with a amazing concept and an ambitious dev behind it. For the first 6 months or so, this was the game to play. It was amazing. Very frequent updates, great communication from the developers, lots of community interaction.
<br>
<br>So what happened after that? Well, it&apos;s hard to say why, but at the start of 2016, the Developers attitude changed for the worst. Updates drew to a month or more a part, often days or even weeks late, and nearly always with the &quot;meat&quot; of that update missing. It was disappointing, but, issues only got worse. Communication stopped almost completely, community interactions stopped at best and at worst became negative.  A number of times, a lead member of the development staff posted on reddit calling people liars, and being a complete jerk off. As time went on, things got worse and worse, the customer support got worse, major problems with the game were outright ignored, and in fact intentionally made even worse, the developers began to lie to the community, and they even released DLC while still in EA.
<br>
<br>The devs still to this day refuse to even acknowledge that their game has problems which leaves very little hope for the people on Official Servers. If you say the game is too grindy, the devs will laugh at you and tell you you&apos;re wrong. If you want to re spec your stats more than once at max level, the devs will tell you to buy the game again and level an entirely new character on a entirely different copy of the game (and in fact, TheRightHand  (one of the lead developers) did say this and received quite a bit of backlash for it). They do nothing but deflect criticism and dodge the issues.
<br>
<br>So, why did i give this game a 3? Well, it&apos;s because of the developers. They keep compounding the problems the game has, and making already bad problems flat out worse. They treat the community like dirt, they lie, they could care less about anyone&apos;s actual experience playing the game. There is a good game here, but it&apos;s so bogged down with all the **** the devs keep piling on it that it&apos;s completely buried. Dig this gem out of the pile of **** it&apos;s buried in clean it up a little and it will shine, but the devs seem to have no interest in doing that.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, i will say that this game is incredibly grindy, repetitive, unbalanced, and unrefined, not worthy of it&apos;s $60 asking price, and the developers, Studio Wildcard, are not worthy of your trust. Because of what Studio Wildcard has done I can not and will not recommend this game or any game they produce in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ark-survival-evolved/user-reviews?user_review_id=7491852">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have finally decided to review this game after 8400+ hours of gameplay in early access mode.
<br>
<br>Positives:
<br>The game is a great idea. The way the game begins is tough&#x2026; I mean really tough. It is a challenge to get started and anyone without any patience is going to struggle but I do have patience and to me the hard difficulty of this game was a real refreshing eye opener&#x2026; but be warned it is not for the feint hearted. The best part of the game is the idea that you can breed your dinosaurs. This has been implemented in a really interesting way, where you can pool your breeding into achievable goals and breed out your favourite dinosaurs to have the stats that you have always wanted&#x2026; but all this comes after you have set up a kibble base, and tamed great level versions of your favourite dinosaurs. I personally play on PVE and as you can see, for over 8K hours I have had a great deal of fun and I have met some fantastic friends in the community&#x2026; This ought to be a great game, but there is another side to it that I have to address&#x2026;
<br>
<br>Negatives:
<br>I am so sad to say this, because I have put so much effort into playing this game legitimately and have done my best to help create a wonderful community and support network on a great PVE server&#x2026; however, the developers of the game have treated us long serving players with utter contempt. We have been completely mistreated, taken for granted, unrewarded, lied to, mis-sold to&#x2026; under a cloak of awful communication and absolutely brutal and dire decisions that have kicked the games player base in the teeth. The scenario now is that the devs were going to cull the lowest 10% of ghost servers&#x2026; and instead have decided to wipe over 33% of servers with medium traffic to consolidate their server lists and re-use these to plonk new servers on that do not have the same issues that the old servers had, and then to cap it all, any support for the old servers and the long serving players who play on those servers is to be canned so that we are on our own if we lose a character or experience any technical issues&#x2026; This is a huge let down of the Ark gaming community, and sadly it is pretty irrelevant, because any support I have needed in my 8K+ hours has been utterly non-existent anyway. I reported a serious harassment case and followed every single instruction to the letter, and no action was taken against the wrong-doers. This was a shameful let down and completely spoiled my enjoyment of the game&#x2026; The devs carried on doing little tiny favours for a select few gamers whilst most tickets were left completely unattended. I have colleagues who lost their level 100 character in transit and not a single effort to answer the ticket was made, that was over 2 months ago now. The sad truth is, that this team of developers and community managers, is sadly the most useless and incompetent and uncaring team that I have ever experienced in a game&#x2026; so if you have any issues playing this game&#x2026; do not even bother to report it&#x2026; nothing will be done&#x2026; this Dev team do not care. They care that they receive your money&#x2026; they will go on to look after the new servers and make things look as though they are prepared to provide support there&#x2026; but it is as many things are in ark&#x2026; it is lies and false promises.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>This game had SO much going for it&#x2026; it was a fantastic idea but the execution of the game and the choices made by the developers has left a bruised gaming community feeling ripped off and mistreated, un-respected and un-supported&#x2026; and sadly their actions and incompetence in how they run their business has led to this review being a vote of no confidence. The way the legacy servers are setup now means that over-time the old servers will lose players and get wiped, so either old players stick around on current servers and wait for the server to die, or we start afresh on a new server and wait to be lied to and sit having no confidence that one day these new servers wont be wiped themselves&#x2026; and that is the finding of this review&#x2026; that ultimately, there is no point in playing this game, because it provides 10% fun, 80% grief and trolling and a final 10% of crying into your coffee as you hope your dino baby survives over the next ridiculously badly timed update that takes away something else that used to be a good idea.
<br>
<br>Do not buy this game&#x2026; do not play this game&#x2026; go and play something similar where the developers actually deserve your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ark-survival-evolved/user-reviews?user_review_id=7502135">Expand</a></span>

I WANT MY FLYING FORTRESS! They could have at the very least removed them from ONLY official servers instead of ALL OF THEM! GAH. Why does it have to take several long hours to tame a dino? Just give us some hard objective to do to tame them, don&apos;t waste 5 literal hours of our time to tame some piddly little dino. So much potential wasted by amateurish devs that would rather release 3/4 paid DLCs rather than getting the fricken game to run.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ark-survival-evolved/user-reviews?user_review_id=7630605">Expand</a></span>

There is a ton to do, from the survival notes hidden throughout the islands giving a glimpse at a much larger story to a ton of interesting and neat dinosaur specific features. Wall climbers, gliders, and gryphon&apos;s oh my!
<br>
<br>The bad: That said, those that know the grind, and it is exactly that, a grind, get a massive advantage over others. With the full release, a slew of unfinished or unoptimized performance issues still remain from it&apos;s open development such as horrid hitbox detection, under the map exploits, and many of the dinosaurs do not serve a long term purpose in the game. It&apos;s a race to 4-5 dinosaurs for the pvp end with there being significant overlap into the pve side.
<br>
<br>The Ugly: Studio Wildcard has left in numerous unfinished or outright broken features. There are still clipping issues with structures that were not addressed in the beta, the incorporation of cluster servers means that every server will either be a fiefdom of a mega-tribe or will be merrily wiped for amusements sake whenever boredom strikes, the grind and timesink factor is still Korean MMO level of bad, and opening the servers for free access to the Asian marketplace is going to go over as it always does, poorly, as the cultural differences between what is acceptable gaming behavior between west and east is not compatible.
<br>
<br>It has potential, but Ark survival evolved shoots itself in the foot over and over again in favor of grind over engaging gameplay and puts a heavy prioritization on shoot first, ask questions never on their official servers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ark-survival-evolved/user-reviews?user_review_id=7485422">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>A lot of the bugs people have mentioned have been fixed since well before EA, I&apos;m not sure what they&apos;re going on about.  Yeah the game&apos;s support is genuinely terrible, but I only had to use it twice, once when I got a dinosaur stuck underneath the terrain (back in early access - and this only happened once) and second when I messed up with tranferring tribe ownership.   Couldn&apos;t get any help with the first one because I couldn&apos;t remember the dino&apos;s name and it had been a few days (it was dead, jim), but the second one got resolved speedily.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ark-survival-evolved/user-reviews?user_review_id=7635020">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You have Official Servers and Unofficial servers.  Official servers seem to have a lot of toxic players on them.   But those exist on unofficial also.
<br>There are thousands of mods available for your local play or to have on an unofficial server.   The game has been in the top 10 most played games on Steam for TWO YEARS.  Typically has 60,000+ people playing in the US prime time and on weekends.
<br>
<br>The PVP... claims are that PVP isn&apos;t balanced.    I don&apos;t play PVP, but most of the complaints are about other PLAYERS.    The people who make the game can&apos;t fix players being mean.  Yet the developers are the ones that get blamed.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve got over 2500 in the game, still enjoy it.
<br>
<br>The game does require a good machine, but the way it plays on machines varies greatly.
<br>The game is LARGE, with all the DLC maps downloaded it can go over 100 GIGS of space.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ark-survival-evolved/user-reviews?user_review_id=7551896">Expand</a></span>

<br>Theres something here, but its half baked
<br>ARK Survival Evolved is out of BETA, but unfortunately it doesn&#x2019;t quite feel like it..
<br>Fair Warning im awful at survival games and they don&#x2019;t keep my attention for long&#x2026;so if youre looking for an in depth review on all the survival stuff, youre not going to get it here,
<br>As a casual survival game fan, Ark survival is probably the most half baked one ive played..
<br>The hardest part of this game is actually getting into a server&#x2026;
<br>the server numbers don&#x2019;t make sense as there are some with numbers way over the limit and others that say they are under the limit until you try to join it..
<br>but once you do find a server, this server is basically your home unless you want a fresh start..
<br>There are 2 modes you can play in&#x2026; one having modern technology and one focusing on just primitive technology, but you choose an area to spawn in at ..all with different difficulties with your fresh character and you get to surviving&#x2026;
<br>|Knowing how to survive is one thing..
<br>knowing how the game works is another because this post beta game has no proper tutorial to teach you the game. I had to go to youtube to learn how to pick up stones, im not even joking&#x2026;
<br>I found myself doing this a lot when I ran into questions like how to tame a dinosaur..
<br>oh did I forget to mention dinosaurs..
<br>theres dinosaurs&#x2026;
<br>This game is full of them but theyre not as cool as I thought they would be..
<br>Theyre essentially jerks that try to kill you while you collect sticks rocks and berries&#x2026; .
<br>the game is a pretty steady evolution of equipment which is cool..
<br>youll level up as you craft, collect, and hunt.. and you can dump skill points into stats but you can also learn how to craft new items like fires to cook raw meat.. btw another youtube trip.. how do you start a fire&#x2026;
<br>the higher level you are the better items you can craft and the better dinosaurs you can tame, ill save you the trip.;. you beat them until theyre unconscious and throw a saddle on them,...
<br>But as a survival game you have to manage your health, hydration, hunger, and body temperature&#x2026;
<br>This is done by collecting berries, building shelter, hunting animals with the weapons you craft, or going for a swim..
<br>this was the coolest part is how easy not dying of thirst is here&#x2026;
<br>finaly a survival game gets it.. let me just drown myself until im not thirsty anymore..
<br>it works in this game as it should&#x2026;
<br>but there are pvp and pve servers.. there are other people running around, theyl lbuild huts and fires too, these items cant be destroyed as youre able to lock them, but you can squad up and join tribes.. or be a lone wolf like me cause youre awesome at surviving and you don&#x2019;t need a tribe&#x2026;
<br>theres no real task here&#x2026; its just dumb fun of running around a map and try to build the coolest stuff you can, sort of like minecraft with none of the fun stuff but with dinosaurs&#x2026;
<br>which again are here to kill you&#x2026;
<br>when you die you have all of your blueprints and levels&#x2026; and youre able to rush to your dead body fr your gear if you can remember where you died at.. but other players can pick your gear too so good luck&#x2026;
<br>I see the good in this game, I can understand why people love it and how they can have fun within its world&#x2026;
<br>of creating your own survival goals and setting out to accomplish them..
<br>but it&#x2019;s a half baked game that still feels as though its in beta&#x2026;
<br>I cant argue that this game isn&#x2019;t fun.. but I can argue that there are plenty of better more polished survival games out there on console
<br>I give ARK Survival Evolved

When you first join, you really have to learn for yourself, which is sometimes good, but most of the time can be annoying. The community is better than a lot of survival games, but still isn&apos;t perfect. But of course no community can be perfect. ARK has a wide variety of things to craft, and so many things to discover. There&apos;s so much fun to be had with all the unique types of dinosaurs scattered across the large world. One big flaw I have with this game is what the devs have done to it. So many changes have been made, and causes it to be unbalanced at times. If the devs could go back to the older style of the game, I think this game would be a much bigger success than it is right now. Again, this game isn&apos;t perfect, but is definitely worth a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ark-survival-evolved/user-reviews?user_review_id=7713869">Expand</a></span>
