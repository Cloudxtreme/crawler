<br>You will not have even close to the same control and ability to micromanagement either your units or base. Not that a more casual RTS is necessarily a bad thing, alot of people might be put of by games such as starcraft because it is more indepth and has a steeper learning curve.
<br>My main issues with Halo Wars 2 is not that it is more casual, it&apos;s because it puts so much frustration and idiotic obstacles in your way that sometimes it even requires more clicks to do simple stuff than in more indepth games.
<br>The UI is attrocious for pc and it has alot of controller diseases despite choosing m&amp;k in the options menu. Speaking of optionsmenu... omg... it is an utter mess... I kid you not there are 15 tabs for keybinds with most of them not even making sense. Other options menues lags when you cycle through tabs and some tabs are even empty!
<br>Some hotkeys are worthless ingame, for instance you have to see your base to build stuff, and the hotkeys for building depends on where your buildings are placed. Wich makes them utterly useless because it is quicker to just click on the buildings.
<br>If you want to demolish a building a huge ass warning asking &quot;are you sure&quot; pops up on screen blocking your view. Console radial menues also plague this game, and they are huge blocking everything as they are selected.
<br>There is no attackmove either, your units do engage everything within range and give a short chase automatically and are generally smart enough in their targeting but half the time you try to micromanage they don&apos;t do what you want. Also their pathfinding is trash around 25% of the time.
<br>Also descriptions of various sort are missing so half the time you don&apos;t know what a level up does etc.
<br>You also have to bear in mind that there are microtransactions in the game, and not the good kind either.
<br>If you can stomach the horrendous UI and microtransactions there are alot of content in this package though. There are several online modes and a cardgametype mode (wich is where the microtransactions ruins this mode). And of course there is a campaign that so far offers pretty varied missions, it&apos;s not a starcraft lvl campaign but pretty good.
<br>Do note though that there is no crossplay between xbox one and pc and given this is a windows store exclusive (not the most popular store on pc) and there are alot of modes, so I&apos;m worried multiplayer might turn out to be useless for pc gamers because it will be hard to find players after a while.
<br>Performancewise it runs okay on my i7 4770K, 16GB Ram and Titan Black (save for the lagging menues) but I did note that for a game that visually isn&apos;t anything amazing it hogs alot more resources than it should.
<br>To me the game is held back ALOT by the retarded console UI. If this is patched in the future for proper pc m&amp;k control I would consider a higher score but as it is now, no, to many obstacles for such a simple casual RTS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halo-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6978480">Expand</a></span>

The story asks a few questions, but answers none. The plot is simple and somewhat unengaging, and the antagonists have about a minute of screentime and development. The Banished and their leader were described to us as being cunning and ruthless, yet none of that is ever shown in the game.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is fun though, and I&apos;m enjoying the variety that multiplayer has to offer. On that side of things, Halo Wars 2 really builds on what made the first game so great, and offers a solid experience. That being said, the PC port is very poor. The UI is clearly not optimized for a mouse and keyboard, and the controls don&apos;t work very well. Unlike many modern RTS games, Halo Wars 2 is clunky and not always obvious to play.
<br>
<br>If anything, this is the final nail in the coffin for me, and I think I&apos;m done with the Halo franchise. While Creative Assembly are technically the developers here, 343 Industries was clearly calling the shots here with everything else. Once again, 343 Industries shows to us that they do not know how to handle Bungie&apos;s legacy, and are more interested in making a quick buck than to give fans a quality game. It&apos;s sad, Halo went from being my absolute favourite franchise to some low quality generic series that fails to stand out. Halo Wars 2 is just the latest victim of 343 Industries&apos;s incompetence.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halo-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6982131">Expand</a></span>

<br>Campaign: Bad- About a 6 hour campaign, terrible unit introduction, controls are brutal, next to no micromanaging ( I&apos;m use to starcraft 2) and the key bindings are confusing, bonus objectives aren&apos;t obvious, I had to constantly keep opening the objective menu ( which I had to look up control to figure out how to even bring up).
<br>
<br>Game UI- This game is a mess, to talk to someone who isn&apos;t in my game I had to launch the xbox app and talk through that, some settings bring you to a browser, others to the store.. all in all to run this game you have 4 apps running ( xbox app, web browser, store app and the game) seems a bit much.

<br>Balance changes made this game one of the most poorly-balanced RTS games I&apos;ve ever played.
<br>- An entire army of anti-vehicle infantry cannot take down an army of tanks or wraiths
<br>- Bases have very little health, making the &apos;rush&apos; tactic highly viable compared to other RTS games
<br>- A full army of level 3 (max level) infantry can be wiped out in seconds by a leader power such as glassing beam
<br>- The maps are bland. It makes very little difference which map you choose because they are all so similar. The first Halo Wars had a special uniqueness to each map... these maps become very boring very quickly.
<br>- A defensive strategy with base turrets and a fair-sized army will almost always lose to a rush. Turrets are nearly worthless until they may be leveled.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s so much more I could say but these are a few examples. I&apos;ve played this for over 80 hours because I really wanted to like this game as much as I did the first one, but I just can&apos;t. It feels like they tried too hard to cash in on the success of StarCraft by making a Halo clone of it. But this game isn&apos;t StarCraft, it feels like a very poorly done clone.
<br>
<br>Many of the bugs and glitches are fixed now and the game seems to be running much smoother and I haven&apos;t had a crash since the latest patch. Also, having multiple leaders to choose from keeps the game fresh for a while. This could be a really fun game if the maps felt as unique as the first game and if they made a few balance changes to support certain unit roles and offer alternative strategies other than favoring the &apos;rush&apos; strategy the most.
<br>
<br>The game was fun during the pre-release, then they patched it and now its broken.
<br>
<br>Day 1 Patch:
<br>Horrible framerates
<br>long load screens
<br>black screen crashes
<br>units won&apos;t listen when you tell them to do something
<br>units will continue to chase enemies for long distances rather than staying put
<br>
<br>Patch update 3/7/17:
<br>Fixed a lot of framerate issues and crashes but introduced new problems...
<br>Units still won&apos;t listen at times
<br>Units will still chase enemies halfway across the stage even when you don&apos;t ask them to
<br>Units will randomly disappear off the map but still show up in your &apos;all units&apos; selection. I lost 57 units off the map during a fight against legendary AI. Couldn&apos;t summon them, couldn&apos;t teleport them... the showed up as selectable units but were nowhere on the map... making my cap army size pathetic, insuring my loss.
<br>
<br>So far, every game I&apos;ve ever preordered in the last 2 years has been a huge let-down with broken gameplay. I was hoping this would be different... but it is worse than most.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/halo-wars-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=7080395">Expand</a></span>
