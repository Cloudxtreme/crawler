With gameplay mechanics that found the magic balance between player skill and character attributes, intricate-yet-accessible character customization (skills, augmentations, weapon customization, limited inventory forcing you to choose equipment suited to your play style), and a strong multi-linear (generally linear plot with multiple routes from start to 3 similar-but-narratively-distinct endings) story that invokes some of the most popular global conspiracy theories of the post-cold-war West, Deus Ex adapted the RPG genre to the FPS interactivity model in a way fans of both genres can appreciate (particularly impressive with respect to RPG fans). The graphics and audio (short loops for ambient sound, rudimentary environmental audio, short soundtrack) are dated, though well-implemented, and the AI scripting is more-or-less the 3-D version of Space Invaders AI (all guns blazing and weave as you CHARGE!), but even today the game is fun and engaging. In fact, despite having played through the story a dozen times or so, I&apos;d gladly shell out another $50 for the same plot and mechanics on a contemporary rendering engine with slightly tweaked AI scripting; I&apos;ve always wondered why the sequel(s? I haven&apos;t checked-up on DX3 recently) decided to mess with a winning formula when they could have kept all of the mechanics and simply made new stories on next-gen engines. Anyway, I can&apos;t recommend this highly enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=747462">Expand</a></span>

Then cross-compare them with the positive reviews. Then add a dash of common sense and ability to analyse and read between the lines. Now, onto the actual review. Deus ex - has been my favorite game for the past 12 years. And I play a lot of games. Why? It&apos;s sure visually aged poorly, it&apos;s kind of clunky. So surely that means I deduct a few  points right there? No. Deus ex is the true definition of a masterpiece, it gives you true options - options that the lesser masterpiece human revolution can&apos;t even match. It still stands alone as something incredible - the only problem is that now people have to look past the age (if they are coming in fresh). Each hub (or sectioned level) offers hundreds possible &apos;ways&apos; to achieve a simple goal. Let me explain - It&apos;s like this;  there is a simple thing you need to do. You need to infiltrate a building and get past all the guards in the building so you can download an important document (this is hypothetical). Now, there are about 10-15 different &apos;ways&apos; you can get into the building and each &apos;way&apos; has branching &apos;options&apos;. So options, lead to options, lead to options. You take choice 5 out of 15 and go through the sewers instead of the top, no strike that - you decide going above ground is best, so you get a crane and lower the shaft so you can sneak across onto the roof - no strike that, you decide to go full force and shoot everyone in your path - no strike that, you decide to go to the building manager and get a keypass, now when you open the caravan that the manager is in, it has cameras inside it, so you hack those cameras to work for you. You then threaten the manager with information you have on him, that you picked up off a nearby computer - then you walk past the guards and enter the keypass into the door slot. You walk strait in, and decide to open a vent that leads you to the roof, in which you plant explosives that might distract the guards. You walk up to the heavily guarded entrance to your objective - and you remotely detonate the explosive, all the guards run towards the threat and you walk into the room. Problem solved. Now, that thing you did was one of a few hundred things you could have done to achive that same 8 minute objective. Now you have 30 hours of incredible globe trotting, storytelling, twists turns, cities, exploration - all with that very level of freedom options. It&apos;s mindblowing. That&apos;s what you need to understand when you boot up deus ex and see some janky graphics and blocky models. No, this is not just &apos;some first person shooter&apos; dig deeper. And find one of the true miracles of gaming. This game needs a 999/10 score made specifically for it. Masterpiece is a painful understatement. This is a revolution in gaming that never took off. So far ahead of it&apos;s time that nothing else can quite match it. I truly hope the developers of human revolution make another deus ex game - because I think they had the right idea. They did not &apos;quite&apos; pull off &apos;deus ex&apos;. But I have a feeling they are heading towards something great. And that&apos;s promising.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=2159496">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m assuming you&apos;re aware that this game is nearly 9 years old and the chance of it running on a modern PC without serious glitches and faults is highly unlikely, yes? You might want to take that into account. Deus Ex is quite simply one of the greatest shooters of all time. The branching storyline, interesting characters, multitude of gameplay options and choices and the dystopian cyber-punk atmosphere are spectacular. Graphically dated, and probably not likely to run on a modern Vista setup without significant tweaking, but well worth the effort.

When you got a game then, it was all about the single player. If it were short and easy, like most current games are, then it wouldn&apos;t have much substance and wouldn&apos;t be much fun. The controls take literally a minute to change to modern FPS controls, so you can&apos;t really complain about them. Unlike many current games, it actually has a decent story and good atmosphere. The game has aged surprisingly well over eleven years. To get an idea of what I mean, go back and play the original Half-Life. Amazing game, but looks so bad it&apos;s almost impossible to play. The RPG elements are implemented really well, and any level-ups make an immediate difference in the game. While the inventory system is kind of a pain, it&apos;s realistic and works well. There&apos;s a reason this game is often hailed as the best PC game of all time: it&apos;s excellent. If you don&apos;t like it, you don&apos;t know a good game when you play it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=1538399">Expand</a></span>

It had incredible gameplay, incredible characters, and an unbeatable storyline. No game had ever done what Deus Ex did. It balances action, humor, suspense, and plot like no other to date.</span>

There are so many things to do, to discover, to read, they thought about everything. It&apos;s a must play, if you can handle low graphics (which were amazing for the time) you should enjoy a lot!</span>

Well o.k. it is showing it&apos;s age some but what an epic story! The graphics are of the era when just moving your jaw when you talked was cutting edge. Still, it has more content than any three modern games put together. The music was terrific and always matched the locales. The environments were varied and they offered multiple solutions to it&apos;s sand-box style missions. My only complaint after twelve full play-troughs is that the inventory and crate-breaking got a bit tedious. The weapons were fun to use and the world seemed richly populated with characters that had their own stories. May we see more games like this again once the brown-shooter-dark-age is over.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=2806774">Expand</a></span>

The story is very well done, and the gameplay is a very original FPS/RPG hybrid. At times the game seems just slightly repetitive, and that&apos;s the only thing holding it back from a 10.</span>

It has never been equalled, let alone surpassed, in this regard.
<br>
<br>To understand Deus Ex requires an understanding of its pedigree. In the nineties, game design was beginning to fall into two different camps: the linear, tightly-controlled setup that could be seen in games like Doom and Quake, and in a more sophisticated fashion Half Life, and a more non-linear, experience-led approach. This latter approach was found in comparatively few games, as it was far costlier to make and typically resulted in far fewer sales. For these games, which were later dubbed the &quot;immersive simulators&quot; by Warren Spector, emergent gameplay was king. That meant that the game designer would not explicitly design the experience, but rather would let the player do things their way. Games like Ultima Underwolrd, Thief and System Shock would be the opening salvos of this style of gaming, all of which were popular and profitable, albeit not mega-successes. Deus Ex took things one stage further. As well as allowing most objectives to be completed in numerous different ways, map design was completely non-linear, and bizarre solutions to complex problems could be devised. Under attack in a penthouse apartment? Leap out of the window, break both your legs, and crawl away. Need to get past a laser defence grid, but can&apos;t? Try smoking onto it, that&apos;ll disrupt the beams. Need to stun two men to get past, but have no weapons? Use a fire extinguisher to blind them in the face. Need to infiltrate a guarded building? Reconnoitre it out, and look for a way in via the roof, or the sewers. Or try and bribe your way in. Need to get past a wall, but don&apos;t want to fight the guards? Why not try stacking up physics objects like crates and rubbish bags to make an impromptu staircase? This was the philosophy that underpinned Deus Ex, and no other game since has even tried to be as open to different user play-styles and ingenious solutions. Wrap all that up in a grittily believable world, with just dripped atmosphere and had an incredible soundtrack, and which moreover was filled with deep questions such as &quot;who is really in control of society?&quot;, and you have an incredible, incredible game. People who want a high-octane first person shooter in the vein of Half-Life should keep away. This game is far more cold, and calculated, than it is high-octane. Those looking for a Mass Effect-style game, which is brutally linear in the gameplay but allows for some trivial choices in conversations, should also look away here. Deus Ex does things the other way around: conversations are functional and barebones, but the way that the user &quot;chooses&quot; paths comes from what he or she does in the gameplay. As an interactive medium, I believe this is as it should be. This is a game for which I have a lot of love, as you can no doubt see. I think it understood exactly what a game is and what it should do better than any others I have played. It&apos;s not for everyone, as I have outlined, nor should it be regarded as perfect (although it is very close). Technology of 2000 was pretty limiting, especially graphically and in terms of AI programming. On the other hand, if you like games at all, and want to experience something a tad more cerebral and involving than the Mass Effects and Call of Duties of the gaming world, then you can do no better than Deus Ex.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=1795583">Expand</a></span>

<br>The narrative flows seamlessly, the characters (even the minor ones) are beautifully fleshed out and the game play is rewarding and fits with the story.  Oh, and everything makes sense. Don&apos;t you just hate those games that make you go WTF?? Well, that never happens with this game.
<br>
<br>Deus Ex discourages shooting stuff and instead encourages alternative, preferably non-confrontational ways of completing missions. You have a multitude of ways to avoid fights, and a multitude of ways to dispatch enemies without having to shoot them. Characters even scold you for shooting stuff up. You&apos;re not compelled in any way to go in guns blazing, unless you specifically want to. So why this game is being judged as an FPS is completely beyond me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=2772070">Expand</a></span>

<br>Deus Ex is just a pleasure to play, never once do you get frustrated at the game, every mistake is your fault. Is it faultless? No, but that doesn&apos;t make it any less of a masterpiece. Deus Ex has such a riveting story with so many intriguing characters most notably Morgan Everett and Walton Simons that will keep you engrossed for your entire playthrough. The gameplay is also superb allowing for many different experiences each playthrough as there are so many ways to complete an objective. You can kill, knock out or simply avoid your enemies, the choice is yours. There&apos;s also many ways to get to your objective.
<br>
<br>The graphics are obviously outdated (but it kinda has it&apos;s own charm) but with the OpenGL renderer the game still plays like a dream and I was using fairly meh integrated graphics on my Linux PC, I would go against using the DirectX renderer, even on Windows, runs like total balls. The soundtrack is also wonderful and adds even more immersion to the levels, my personal favourite being Enemy Within. The voice acting is awful, but has a charm and I actually like the way it is as opposed to Human Revolution.
<br>
<br>Just get this game. It&apos;s one of, if not the greatest PC games of all time. If you don&apos;t like it.... &quot;What a shame&quot;
<br>
<br>P.S. I encountered a game breaking glitch where everyone in my save was aggro at me, this could simply be due to using Ubuntu to play this game using Wine, but my advice, save a lot. The glitch set me back 45 mins.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=5708070">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are great for the time, especially with a game this long. If you are playing on realistic (highest difficulty in the game) it can take you 15 hours, and even more. The first level alone takes an hour. I still remember when this game came out, and my parents buying it for me, still have my original copy; Anyway, this game has huge replay value, you can take the game a whole different route!

I&apos;m playing games for the last 25 years, I played hundreds, if not thousands of titles and I came across many masterpieces and fantastic games, but for the last 14 years my opinion is clear about one thing, the strongest experience i got from a video game, was here with Deus Ex and if there ever was a game that should be considered &quot;the best of them all&quot;, it&apos;s Deus Ex. The Story, the atmosphere, gameplay, level design it&apos;s all out of this world, it&apos;s like this game is something more than just a game, it&apos;s something that cannot be expressed in words, you must play this. Your life is not fulfilled if you haven&apos;t played Deus Ex. It&apos;s that simple.

Nifty but simple skill system. Modifyable weapons. A choice of different endings. It also got #1 &apos;best game&apos; award 3 years in a row from Australia&apos;s PC Powerplay magazine.</span>

Alongside GTA and the old X-Com series of games, this is undeniably in a league of its own. Many newer gamers view Half Life 2 as the modern equivalent of an iconic game, but this in no way compares to the brilliance of Deus Ex; try this once and you will understand exactly how Deus Ex forces you to move the goalposts when rating every other subsequent game. It acts as a forceful comparator to remind you of just how close to perfection a game needs to be to compete. The graphics are looking rather dated in modern times, but it is the intricate and interactive plot and intense characterisation that makes Deus Ex tower far above its peers. Six years on and there has still never been a better game within this genre, or even one that comes close for that matter.

It incorporating a great story, RPG-style inventory with experience points used to increase skills, fun combat with countless weapons and items, good music, memorable events and dialogue, incredible replay value, and an extremely dynamic and lengthy campaign, which is different every time you play, due to the incredible amount of freedom. After playing through the game 5 times, I still found many new things and places that I had never found before, and triggered events and plot twists that I hadn&apos;t come across in 4 play-throughs. Each playthrough was with a drastically different approach, as the game incorporates many different play-styles, including playing with &quot;realistic&quot; combat damage for those who wish to. Not enough can be said about this game. It&apos;s like &quot;The Godfather&quot; of video games, in more ways than one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=9572">Expand</a></span>

In fact, I enjoyed this game even more than the 3rd one. I&apos;m usually not a fan of FPS games, I&apos;ve tried many but their has only been a couple that I liked enough to sink into for more than an hour or two. But this is a FPS with a well written and thought out story, and the way the FPS and RPG elements are intertwined is done perfectly. There&apos;s enough side missions to get you exploring all the nooks and crannies of the well designed world, and the story forks off in several directions depending on your decisions, allowing for you to play a few areas several times to see what happens in each story line. There is a lot of awesome gaming in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=1968186">Expand</a></span>

Full of little flaws and far from perfect, and yet still in the top 5 games of all time... which should give you an indication of just how good it is. Of all the &apos;classic old&apos; games it&apos;s probably aged the best, the atmosphere is just unrivalled, outlasting the graphics. Even the creators haven&apos;t come close to replicating it&apos;s genius.</span>

<br>Yeah, at first it was weird jump into those old graphics and so on... But after about six hours game-play I must say I was living JC Denton&apos;s role in the game, I mean... Every choice, every dialogue, even the choice of your own gameplay. Yes, there wasn&apos;t those dramatic cutscenes, but DX made me more excited than most of the new games i have played
<br>Also atmosphere, soundtrack just perfectly fits to the environment. So what I was playing only new games with those fancy graphics, I still can see how beautiful this game is. Some people just don&apos;t understand this game&apos;. So after all those gaming years I found my best game that changed whole gaming experience for me... It&apos;s sad to see how people can be ignorant by saying this game &quot;sucks&quot;just because they don&apos;t understand it and it&apos;s not nostalgic or something, like I said, I found it in 2011. Also new generation of gamers are just graphic whores, at least you could your subjective ignorant opinion without any real argument keep for yourself. Oh well, I&apos;m glad I found this game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=2229410">Expand</a></span>

Anyway, this is overall a solid game that I wish I&apos;d played 12 years ago when it came out. It took me about 30 hours to play from start to finish. My only real complaint is it&apos;s always dark throughout the game, but everything else about it is absolutely solid. I completed my first playthrough a couple of days ago, and will probably play it again.

<br>
<br>The best thing about this game is that it doesn&apos;t feel like a game. The levels are so huge, the characters so interactive, and the puzzles solved in so many different ways that this feels like a limitless world. Every element comes together perfectly: an incredible storyline that has you tied up in knots, gameplay that allows you to play the way you want to play, and an augmentation system that lets you mould your character in weird and wonderful ways.
<br>
<br>Do you want to be a stealthy assassin? Then develop your hacking, sniping and running silently skills, stick a silence modification on your sniper rifle and away you go. Want to run round shooting anything that moves? Then level up your ballistic shielding, stick a couple of recoil modifications on your machine gun, and let&apos;s get to work. As long as you have a consistent plan, any gameplay style is catered for.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m still waiting to play a game since Deus Ex that even comes close.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=2544087">Expand</a></span>

<br>Deus Ex - every time you mention it, someone reinstalls it. One of those games that never really gets old. The story, the gameplay, the dialog, and best of all - the music. Everything was perfect.

<br>Tho graphics are somewhat dated now, this is indeed a Great game. Go for it, and have fun.</span>

You are JC Denton, international United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) peace force agent fighting NFS terrorist organization in dystopian 2052 New York. New, unknown virus (&quot;the grey death&quot;), widespread zyme drug addiction, police curfew are the reality. You aren&apos;t just a regular person, you are nano-augmented. This means you have bionic upgrades giving you almost superhuman capabilities in some fields.
<br>
<br>The game has some first person shooter qualities. There are multiple types of firearms including pistols, shotguns, sniper and assault rifles, experimental plasma guns, tranquilizer darts and various melee weapons including swords, batons, crowbars and knives. You can also use various grenades and explosives. But here come the RPG qualities: you are initially inexperienced with all of these weapons and as the game progresses you need to choose skills to upgrade. How about some stealth? You don&apos;t have to upgrade your fighting skills. You can upgrade swimming, lockpicking and hacking. Deus Ex is not-so-linear and usually you have more than one way to finish a level. Fighting is one option, but usually you can also crawl into ventilation ducts, climb some ladders, jump some containers and find yourself on the other side without having killed a single person (or bot).
<br>
<br>Along with upgrading your skills, you choose and upgrade your bionic augmentations. Your game tactics will depend on implants you choose. There are 18 types of implants, but you only have 9 slots. You get to decide whether you prefer to install Speed Enhancement or Run Silent implant. Will you need Ballistic Protection (reduced bullet damage) or EMP Shield (protection from electrocution which is used by some bots)? To use your augmentations you need to use bioelectrical energy and you need to plan carefully, because it has limits.
<br>
<br>JC Denton will discover conspiracy, traitors, surprising allies in many locations, all of them with neo-noir feel. New York City, Hong Kong (think Blade Runner), Paris, Area 51, ships, hotels, underwater labs. The plot is really long, has many surprise twists and gives you multiple choices, including three quite different endings. Music is quite cool and fits the atmosphere of the locations. Graphics... well, the game was released in 2000, so it&apos;s a little disappointing as of 2014, but if you can get over average graphics, Deus Ex is amazingly immersing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=4679767">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve replayed this game from start to end more times than I can count and it seems that every time I play, I discover new ground.  What I truly love about this game are the choices that you might not even realize you have after a single play through.  Characters you thought were doomed to die for the sake of the plot can be saved and objectives that you were not aware of on a first time play through present themselves with a little more exploring.
<br>
<br>Because the game is pushing 15 years, the graphics and mechanics are nowhere near up to par with modern games, but the player driven story is better than any game I&apos;ve played its release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=4883413">Expand</a></span>

Even the hero&apos;s very monotonous voice is strangely compelling. Fantastic entertainment on many levels. The only thing that I can criticise it for is the pathetic attempts at foreign accents of which the Australian variety was particularly atrocious. But still, this is a must play for any gamer, any gamer at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=1803699">Expand</a></span>

Let me clear this: I enjoyed it, I loved it to the end, but It has some huge problems that makes this game very&quot;old:I hated how the game is based on &quot;Trial &amp; Error&quot;, which will make you destroy the autosave button in order to finish a mission. Yes the AI is buggy, but sometimes they are just too strong: they were able to see me, from the other side of the map, hiding in pure darkness and down below a street...WOW, buggy AI right? It might be buggy, but sometimes they could see me (and HEAR even while sneaking) too well. And this might be nitpicking, but I would have loved a map of the area: they are HUGE and it&apos;s very hard to see where you have to go without a map, making you  lose the way. Ok, the rant is over: I give it a 8 mainly because it IS good, but to me it&apos;s just aged: stealth games have evolved for the better and this game, even though created a standard for stealth shooters, has basically lost it&apos;s innovation: give it a try though if you can surpass the flaws and, in general, if you don&apos;t agree with me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=2267745">Expand</a></span>

And what an astounding one it is too.  Very good combat, a nice variety of enemies and a great selection of weapon choices making real changes to the feel of gameplay  sum up the fighting, both ranged and melee.  The stealth is a challenge which requires genuine care and thought but provides great satisfaction when successful.  The rpg elements and skills/augmentations allow you to tailor your character in a way that is very rewarding and allows for several playthroughs that give a different feel.<br><br>Finally, these elements are bound tightly together by an amazing story that includes many memorable moments and wonderfully created characters, locations and situations.  Easily one of the greatest games of all time and my personal favourite.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724336">Expand</a></span>

You are given the chance to mould and guide your hero from humble bureacratic beginnings to a place in the annals of human history. Give Manderley a punch from me on your way up.<br><br>The game is a seamless melding of FPS and RPG. A clever twist lets you augment your character with bionic abilities, which can be found in canisters while exploring the game. Most upgrades grant one physiological ability and lock out another permanently, but the detailed inventory and character information pages let you browse the upgrades and plan ahead.<br><br>The experience based skills system lets you can choose how well you can use items and weapons, if at all. For example, if you haven&apos;t put points into rocket launchers, there are subtler methods of bypassing security systems: lockpicking, electronics and computer hacking. Packrats rejoice, this leads to a diverse array of item pickups: credit chits containing digitised money, personal organisers with codes and passwords, biological modification canisters, modification packs for weapons (capacities, fire rates, silencers, etc), lockpicks, multimeters, food or medkits for healing and even chapters from an in-game book. Usually, at least once per level, you&apos;ll get a chance to buy items from a black market trader or use your information to rummage through hidden or locked stockpiles.<br><br>Though the graphical models may look dated, all of these features create a rich gameplay experience that, in my opinion, hasn&apos;t yet been surpassed in this genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=2279822">Expand</a></span>

As stated by many other reviewers, I will admit that the game has a very frustrating and slow aiming system, but that doesn&apos;t bring down the game by very much at all. The story is conveyed in a genius way, most of the plot twists I did not see coming and the story is so interchangeable, you could play the game over and over, and not play it exactly the same as you did the time before. The inventory system isn&apos;t as annoying as many other people think, but the game should have automatically moved the items out of the way if you had enough room anyhow. The graphics look outdated quite a bit but the game makes up for it in the way the story is conveyed and how the plot unfolds. Overall great game, while it has it&apos;s faults, the game makes up for them in different areas of the game. I&apos;d recommend it for everyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=1849291">Expand</a></span>

Although I don&apos;t fully understand all the reasons that led to it, my review of this game is still going to be positive. / The fact is, the game&apos;s graphics were outdated even at the time of its creation. But surprisingly enough, this fact didn&apos;t bother me much during singleplayer experience (also, I am not exactly into top-notch graphics at all times, I still like retro games if there are other aspects that I like about those titles). The multiplayer, on the other hand, oh yeah, that is a slightly different story... I remember that it was hard to keep a straight face in situations like when your own teammates got poisoned by gas grenades... / One of the main strengths of the game are the possibilities that lie in front of you. Stealth vs. action is divided into a lot of smaller options you can choose from. You can kill everything in sight, stun your opponents or put them to sleep, avoid them altogether by choosing alternative paths, use not only weapons and tools, but also augmentations to your advantage... These elements really made the game fun to play. Nothing forced you into choosing one particular solution (e.g. stealth is better than action - make love, not war - DX: HR, anyone?), so you could enjoy the game the way you wanted to, without any penalties (at least I don&apos;t remember any). / The augmentation system is generally a nice idea and I like the fact that you have to choose between several upgrades to determine which one you want to install on that particular body part. Some augmentations however I found kind of obsolete and I think I didn&apos;t use them once during the whole game. You can also invest points into various skills to help you further during the gameplay (weapon use, hacking, lockpicking and... swimming - OMG, that was kind of obsolete too). And yeah, the hacking and lockpicking are very primitive, on the other hand, if I have to choose between tiresome minigames and beeping multitools, I pick the second option, thankyouverymuch. / The game is definitely... long. I dropped out twice (once in the ship area and once in France), but returned after several months and I am glad I did. There are other titles that deserved to be dropped instantly and I didn&apos;t do it (*facepalm*). I liked the fact there were numerous locations and environments to be visited and explored, although some of them were more boring than the others. But, the longer the gameplay is, the better, sure - phenomenon of a 3 hour-long games that cost 40 bucks is NOT COOL. / Deus Ex is generally praised because of its storyline, which is captivating and original at first. After some time, it gets a little confusing and I had the feeling as if someone wanted to incorporate all the existing &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; he could find into the game&apos;s story. Maybe less would be more in this case. But not a huge issue for me. / Also, the music definitely deserves mentioning, there are a LOT of tracks, each location has a music of its own, so a huge amount of work went into this. I think it was worth it and the soundtrack is a nice bonus to the overall experience. Voice-acting is not so good, but for me, it provided an amusing aspect, so thanks for that. / I must add that sometimes I felt like I was playing some Star Wars game because of that nanosword, which was strangely addictive. At first, it was good against greasels, then I was overpowered by the dark side and I used it against almost everything, eh.... / The ending (one of the few that are available) wasn&apos;t disappointing and the game offers great re-playability not only to experience other endings, but to try different things and approaches. / I&apos;m not giving this game a full score like most of the people I see on the last page - it&apos;s not the best game I ever played and it has its flaws. But I admit it&apos;s one of the better ones (not in the term of graphics, of course) and it can be seen that a lot of effort was put into making some elements as good as possible, which is something that deserves recognition. Unfortunately, nowadays I don&apos;t see many modern titles with a &quot;heart&quot;, and Deus Ex definitely is a game that has a &quot;nanoheart&quot;, sometimes beating slowly, sometimes rapidly, always being cold, but yes, it&apos;s a heart nonetheless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=1894311">Expand</a></span>

HR certainly has prettier graphics, among other improvements. But it&apos;s not the same. Deus Ex was an RPG shooter. The sequel is a shooter with RPG elements that follows the cookie-cutter plan of every cover based shooter game on the market. Cover based shooting, magically regenerating health, XP based upgrade system, not to mention the fact that based on the controls, it&apos;s a console game first and a PC game second. Original game may not stand up in terms of prettiness, but it has a better story, more entertaining gameplay, good music, endings that don&apos;t consist entirely of stock footage with a vague monologue laid over...
<br>
<br>Honestly, if this game were to be redone today, it would probably be the best thing ever. It&apos;s got plenty of fun to it, plenty of runtime (Story takes forever to push through, but it&apos;s not a drag) detailed, fleshed out world, interesting characters, and a matrixey feeling that you&apos;re not just playing a game, you&apos;re playing art.
<br>
<br>I guess that&apos;s the biggest part. Human Revolutions is a game. The original Deus Ex is a game too, but it&apos;s also art, it&apos;s also a story, it&apos;s also a whole world to explore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=3960440">Expand</a></span>

Lousy accents for foreign characters, terrible graphics, conspiracy plot that borders on the ridiculous and of course not being able to hit a headshot on a guy even if you&apos;re pointing the gun a few centimetres behind him.  But no matter what, you can&apos;t help getting pulled into the game by its wonderful ability to show how much your decisions matter.  Small decisions can go  a long way in the game&apos;s plot and its very interesting to see it unfold at a later point of the story.  And then, there&apos;s the atmosphere and setting which is probably the best part of the game, you can really feel the bleak cyberpunk future where people are struggling to survive.  Not only that, the levels in Hong Kong and Paris are perhaps the best parts of the game even though it should be obvious to some that it looks nothing like the real thing.  Characterization is also interesting, even though the hero JC Denton is blunt and monotoned most of the time.  Still, the dialogue is rather humorous if not corny.  It really baffles me why no game has come close to achieving the feel Deus Ex created (even the highly praised Mass Effect series).  The only beef I have with this game is that its hard to get it working right on my laptop.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=2279118">Expand</a></span>

Once you get past the voice acting and realise to play it the obvious way (get pistols and melee with technical skills, play on easy, stealth) its quite enjoyable.</span>

I&#xB4;m into video games since 1990 and Deus Ex is one of only a handful of games I&#xB4;d give ten points. And it would be the only one I&#xB4;d give 11, if possible.
<br>Every other FP RPG/Story-Shooter/Adventure is judged by me to the standart set by DeusEx, and none came near to it yet. And I fear, nothing will ever come...
<br>The Plot is not a blockbuster, but the way it is arranged and experienced, combined with the artfully accomplished atmosphere, makes me wish I&#xB4;ve never played this game before. Just to experience the immersive feeling again I had when playing the first time back in 2000.
<br>The gameplay isn&#xB4;t easy at the beginning and since you don&#xB4;t know the evolution of your char (playing the first time), the motivation curve rises low through the first levels (or maps). But as another Reviewer said: this game will make you think about calling in sick right in the middle of your day not at home, just to get back to your screen.
<br>What really, really is astonishing are the ways you can choose to build up your char. And the way that&#xB4;s chosen will affect the gameplay massively. Indestructible heavy weapon bomber? No problem. Sneaky, roof climbing Hacker? No Problem. It&#xB4;s like playing two different games wich happen to have the same storyline. More or less, Story developement depends on the choices made at critical moments.
<br>Okay, so far we&#xB4;re at a level of quality also arrived by Fallout 3, too. More or less, let&#xB4;s not be nitpickers.
<br>The topping on this tasty cake of video games are the side quests, side tracks and the sheer endless amount of info available that&#xB4;s not related to the main story. Newspapers, books, Notepads (sort of), that make the in-game world so lively and realistic... just like a very, very good book you can&#xB4;t put aside, even if it&#xB4;s 3am and you have to get up early.
<br>Also, I love the interface. It&#xB4;s more than versatile. You can make notes by yourself and you can type in keys and passwords with your keyboard. And you need to, if you don&#xB4;t have the abilities to hack`em! Because even if you already &quot;know&quot; a key to a door, you&#xB4;ll have to look it up in your notepad and type it in by yourself.
<br>And it never gets boring. No repetitive situations like in newer games (DE3 or even Skyrim), no linear path through the levels, no stereotypes.
<br>
<br>To everyone calling himself a &quot;gamer&quot; who didn&#xB4;t play it yet (especially the youngsters): ignore the old graphics and experience this work of art!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=4009273">Expand</a></span>

<br>PRESENTATION - 8
<br>Graphics aren&apos;t great technically (it looks like the first Unreal Tournament from 1999), and almost no objects have physics.  But aesthetically, everything fits the cyberpunk themes really well, music is great, and all lines are voice-acted (a big deal back then).  The story is superb, the greatest blend of conspiracy theories ever in a single product, and with a better understanding of the philosophy of technology than anything in the 15 years since.  What&apos;s great about all the optional flavor-text is half of it is actually gameplay-relevant, giving you codes and passwords, which encouraged you to talk to everyone and read everything.
<br>
<br>CONTROLS - 8
<br>FPS controls are smooth, and you can interact with everything in the world with just a right mouse button click.  The game is hard: sights take way too long to become accurate unless you pour upgrade points into that weapon system, the &quot;tranquilizer&quot; causes enemies to run around for 10 seconds shooting back at you before they keel over, and the only other nonlethal knockout option besides tranq darts requires (very) limited ammo.  Both violent and nonviolent options are difficult: you have limited inventory options, and the every &quot;Augmentation&quot; option excludes a different Aug, so you are constantly making meaningful choices. But since the game allows quicksaving/quickloading, and you never feel lost in terms of what to do next, it all works brilliantly despite the complexity.
<br>
<br>DESIGN - 10
<br>What makes the game is that every encounter or puzzle has multiple solutions.  When most (including Deus Ex&apos;s sequels) games say &quot;multiple ways to play,&quot; they really mean 3 ways to play: 1)stealth around enemies&apos; lines of sight  2)snipe enemies from hiding with a sniper rifle or silenced pistol or 3)kill everything  like you&apos;re playing a shooter.  You can do that in Deus Ex 1, but you can also talk your way out of situations, lay traps, stack crates (they can obscure cameras), jump around obstacles or hack camera/turret systems; all of those are also solutions to boss battles.  Every room has at least 3 means of entry/exit, so while in most games &quot;exploration&quot; would mean &quot;not knowing where to go,&quot; in Deus Ex it&apos;s almost impossible to get lost because there are so many different ways to get to the objective you stumble across it automatically.  You choose your preferred gameplay style by picking which superpowers and skills (i.e., super-jumping will assist the platforming route) you upgrade. If you miss the document with the secret code to the locked door, it doesn&apos;t matter, because you can lockpick it open, blast it open, or get inside the warehouse through a different route.  The game is also brilliantly adaptive; normally when a game is &quot;realistic&quot; it means the Shenmue-open-world system of having a bunch of irrelevant interactive minigames that delay your progress; here, realism means letting you choose your path and actions and having characters react to it realistically.  You can kill allies, but they&apos;ll shoot back.
<br>My favorite part was at a ramp (leading to an optional arms merchant with good stuff for sale) protected by a laser tripwire that would release a robot drone when triggered.  I kept reloading that section, testing out different ways to get past it, just for fun: 1)trigger the &apos;bot and shoot it out  2) lay an EMP or explosive mine on the wall, trigger the bot and it would roll right into the trap and kill itself  3) if you talked to the right person earlier in the level, he would give you a code to the nearby panel to disable the tripwire 4) you could use multitools to hack the panel, fewer multitools if you invested in the computers skill  5) using the speed augmentation, you could run past, triggering the bot but escape before it shot you 6)using either a stealth camo item pickup or the stealth augmentation, you could walk through the tripwire without triggering it 7) by stacking crates (easier if you got the muscle augmentation to lift the heavier crates) you could build a little staircase to walk over the tripwire without triggering it  8) with the superjump augmentation you could leap the tripwire without triggering it  9) If you placed a crate in the path of the tripwire, it would trigger, but you could hide, and after the bot returned to its original waiting position, the tripwire would only extend until the position of the crate, which interrupted it; then you could walk between the crate and the wall without triggering the tripwire  10) there was a nearby vent that let you bypass the ramp entirely.
<br>
<br>LEGACY - What I would have liked for the sequel would be better graphics, physics, and improved enemy AI.  We got that, but in the grand tradition of sequels having fewer gameplay mechanics, the newer Deus Ex games are merely shooters with a stealth option and more dialogue choices than in most games.  Deus Ex 1 stands alone, and it is a must-play for any videogame fan.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/deus-ex/user-reviews?user_review_id=5375306">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics don&apos;t look as impressive now as they were in 1999, but the gameplay still rocks. The story is clever and very interesting. Just make sure you click on all NPCs a few times to let they say all their phrases. I must admit I haven&apos;t seen comparable games in all these years..</span>
