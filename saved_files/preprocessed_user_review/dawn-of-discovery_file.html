The combat sucks, yes, but that&apos;s because it&apos;s not what the game is about. If you want to kill stuff go play CoD: Black Ops with your &apos;bros&apos; or something and let the rest of us have our peaceful city builders.<br><br>Also, the expansion(Venice) adds multiplayer.</span>

You have to min-max your cities in a certain pre-determined way,</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Boring and deceptive game. I really wanted to like this. It has amazing graphics, good music, and it is charming. I wanted so bad to like this because i liked games like Settlers in the past. But this game is bad.
<br>
<br>The main issue with this game, is that there is really no freedom or creativity in strategy/city building. You have to min-max your cities in a certain pre-determined way, especially at higher difficulties. The game may seem complex at first, but it is not, this is not a strategy game, this is a puzzle game. Once you figure out how to layout your cities and in what order to build your production chains, the game gets very repetitive and unfun.
<br>
<br>And this leads to the next problem, this game is complex but is not deep. If you need to make some army units and need weapons, you will need to make whole production chains in order to make those weapons, but this is just busy work. The difference between just making a &quot;base&quot; in Age of Empires to make units, and making a whole production chain to make the same units in Anno, is just that it takes more time and takes memorization of the chains, nothing more.
<br>
<br>In the end, this game is a colossal waste of time. Fun to look at, but very shallow experience. Avoid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dawn-of-discovery/user-reviews?user_review_id=6689928">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are beautiful (you&apos;ll need good hardware to run on high settings), the music is very good and atmospheric and the voice acting is done really well. What really makes this game great is the strategy involved in building your empire and the rock solid trade system that is rich in options and gives you full control of what and how much you want to trade. It&apos;s one of the deepest, most addicting games I&apos;ve ever played. Oh yeah, and a really cool &quot;post card&quot; view that lets you do a close up fly by to see the game really come alive. Cons: The manual. It&apos;s terrible. If you are new to the ANNO series (like me), you will have to learn the game by playing it and the occasional google search. There&apos;s no list of buildings or tips on how/where to place them, although there&apos;s decent in-game descriptions. Nothing about acension rights. Nothing about how to get prestige points which are required for diplomatic status to the Sultan&apos;s advisor so you can build Orient style structures on the desert islands. I could go on and on. I can&apos;t believe that put out such a poor manual that is missing very important info. Also, I realize the military aspect is not the focus, but this could have done better (specifically the land combat).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dawn-of-discovery/user-reviews?user_review_id=82971">Expand</a></span>

The strongest focus of this game is on building your city and establishing a strong economy by acquiring raw resources and using them to produce goods that your citizens need in order to advance. The game is fun enough with just building a massive city builder, but the added ability to engage in military combat is icing on the cake. The combat doesn&apos;t involve much strategy, large numbers usually win. The biggest downside to this game is the gigantic learning curve. The manual is of almost no help. You MUST be patient if you want to enjoy this game to the fullest. You must take the time to play around and learn how everything works by experimenting. You can also go to forums on sites such as www.annofans.com and get help there from other players. Bear in mind, if you just want a simple resource-gathering RTS game that focuses almost entirely on building military units and fighting (such as Age of Empires) then this is not your type of game. Play the demo, and remember: Be patient with this game! It&apos;s fun once you give it a chance and learn how to play!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dawn-of-discovery/user-reviews?user_review_id=83313">Expand</a></span>

The biggest problem with the game is the constant feeling that you&apos;re lacking control. Even with intense micromanagement you will struggle to keep things running smoothly and you have to fiddle all the time with redundant boring tasks. And that&apos;s only if you can figure out the cause of your problem. Frequently things are happening automatically that you simply cannot diagnose. Why am I losing money when my income is supposedly green? Why do I keep losing linen-shirts when I have 3 weaver plants running and I&apos;m not selling them? Why does this mine keep getting overstocked with ore when I have a trade cart right next to it? With some improved control schemes and diagnostics there is a robust, even fun strategy game under all this. Without it, you just get a frustrating mess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dawn-of-discovery/user-reviews?user_review_id=85127">Expand</a></span>

I tried the demo on a whim and I find the game to be excellent. I have always enjoyed city builder games and imo this one takes the genre further in its game play and execution. This is very well done game (despite the sorry manual). Despite the fact that it is also a simulation game, as well as a city builder, there is something to do and keep you busy and occupied. The voice overs are good and the graphics are extremely good. The game is gorgeous imo. I recommend this game to any city builder fans out there. As I said I think the game takes that genre to the next level. How PCGame UK could give this a 61 is beyond me. However if you read the review you will see that it is very poorly done, is less than a page full of very shallow observations and hints at the thought they the reviewer only spent a few hours with it. Very poor and unprofessional imo. If you can speak/read German I very much recommend that you read most of the other reviews as they are much more comprehensive and descriptive. All in all I am very pleased with the gameplay and the purchase</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dawn-of-discovery/user-reviews?user_review_id=82785">Expand</a></span>

Oh, and the music is so good, and the sound design creates such alive environments. Everything is good about this game. I have zero complaints. Related Designs has totally outdone themselves here. This truly is sleeper hit.
