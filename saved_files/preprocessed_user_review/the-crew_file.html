The Crew is a game that promised so much as a concept but fails in the most basic sense of a racing game.
<br>
<br>The game takes place on a grand scale but the map and its locations look really bland and unsurprising even maxed out. The driving physics are absolutely horrendous with dodgy handling that makes even Watch Dogs seem acceptable. The story is cheesy and extremely dull plus you&apos;ll be driving around participating in pointless races and events that just become a chore. Even against fellow players in this MMO-oriented game; you just get the sense of dissatisfaction from everyone when competing. Everything feels really bland and tedious. Always online, uPLay and unreliable servers just add to the dissatisfaction as the game never feels truly stable and I&apos;ve already seen my progress lost after being kicked out of races for no reason also.
<br>
<br>Overall; The Crew is another dismal delivery from Ubisoft who 16 months ago seemed untouchable. The game fails on a number of levels, uPlay also causes breaking issues and for &#xA3;50 plus a &apos;pay to win&apos; structure; it&apos;ll cost you a fair whack even to remotely compete even if you can get over the severe technical and conceptual problems. I&apos;d avoid and wait for Project Cars. This is merely a ported console game riddled with flaws and lackluster design.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4793340">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Probably the developers wanted to do something fun and unique. But in came the suits, and before you know it, all we get is more icon chasing, a scripted, linear narrative and almost no focus on the cars, racing or driving. Ubisoft has to make the same game over and over again, regardless of genre, and this time, its to their detriment.
<br>
<br>Perhaps one day Ubi will release a game with real innovation. The Crew is not that game. 3/10 for wanting to be something special. Deducting seven points for linear story where it makes no sense, always online requirement for what is basically a need for speed game, bugged launch, poor handling and small &quot;open&quot; world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4785562">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First of all: F*ck Uplay
<br>The game had an interesting concept, huge open world and lots of places do drive to but even in 2013 it seemed weird..Ubisoft put on so many trailers, teasers and ads showing parts being put together, every spring, every header, but what we get is just an ordinary, boring tuning experience..it&apos;s cool to see those animations where the car gets stripped but nothing more, that is why i HATE ubisoft, they always promise a miracle and you get an average, usually boring result
<br>
<br>Alright, i really need to say that the focus of any racing game, simulator or arcade, need to be THE F*CK!NG RACE, no use in having mind blowing tuning or open world if the races are boring, the car handles like sh!t and there is no thrill in the races, i have played a LOT of racing games since i was 6 and the ones wich i liked the most didn&apos;t even have decent tuning or a lot of places to explore, it was just fun and thrilling, the races gave you joy and it was fun, wich is why we play games for f*ck&apos;s sake..we play games to have fun, not to look at a big map or just see car animations..those two are the most fun thing to do on the crew since the car handling is garbage..
<br>
<br>Now, anyone who says that the graphic is good is LYING to you, DO NOT BELIEVE IT, it&apos;s like older need for speeds, the graphics are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY far from next gen, want graphics ? play need for speed hot pursuit 2010, it has better reflections, better details, better world physics than the crew and it&apos;s CHEAPER..how can you make a 2014 game wich was promising innovation WORSE than a 2010 game even in graphics and engine..?
<br>
<br>I feel sad for this, i really do, I wanted the crew to be good even without faith in it, i just wanted a fun racing game wich i can enjoy for a couple of days but well..
<br>
<br>One thing that made me want to throw up was the physics..HOW CAN YOU F*CK UP PHYSICS IN 2014 ? HOW UBISOFT ?! HOOOOW ?! SO MUCH TECHNOLOGY AND EXAMPLES NOT TO SCREW UP BUT SOMEHOW, PEOPLE STILL MAKE HORRIBLE PHYSICS LIKE THIS (some rage there lol)
<br>
<br>Summing up, The Crew is overhyped, not fun, not thrilling, the graphics are not that good, Uplay is horrible, the physics is TERRIBLE (meh meh meh it&apos;s and arcade game, meh meh meh, good job sherlock but you need at least cars that do not sway around the track like the driver was drunk, play daytona on the arcade first to get a feel for a real arcade game) the tuning is plain boring, nothing new, the online interactions are ok, in fact, it is the ONLY reason why this game is not a zero, the plot is predictable and boring and the characters are terrible..do NOT buy this game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4785452">Expand</a></span>

<br>The WORLD: impressive with scale, but in game it used not more for 2%.
<br>PICTURE: there are some good things, like white skyscraper in Miami, starry night in mountain desert and LA view, but generally this is an image of past millenium type. Colour gamma cruelly dirty, offend eyes and cause depression, especially in nord-east including mid-west (game beginning). Trees bristle themselves, taunt eye - just like in TDU2, somewhat metal brush. Unnatural feeling of all. The main - asphalt: it covered with whitish spew with stains. Simply impossible, force you to sick.
<br>DRIVING: eatable, but not moreover. Oversteer and overforce - Watch Dogs model. Became worse then in beta.
<br>STORY and character: stupid, banal, brute. We must see again stamped FBI agents, and deal with geeks, see their disgusting mugs and hear their disgusting voices. A propose, all voices made very poor, stupidly, unnatural, in Russian version as in English. Story, from the one side, too primitive, for minor schoollboys, but, from the other hand, too brute for them. Fail.
<br>GAMEPLAY. As mentioned, world used very bad. No long races or test drives (taxi, delivery). Annoying stunt challenges. Cheatting AI (as usual), strange feature of you won race with great advantage and recieved bronze medal. Again idiotic feature of &quot;dynamic&quot; difficulty: if you made good advantage, traffic and all the world begin war against you. The same with restarts: very difficult to improve once obtained result. So, I shall not fight for records with somebody.
<br>The most idiotic feature: NO MULTIPLAYER IN THIS GAME. No enough usual words for it. You forced to play with &quot;friends&quot; in career regime.But no friends you can find at this immense space. Not friends needed for multiplayer, but RIVALS, which we can meet in somewhat  stated area, ideally - in lobby. Without lobby its practically impossible to organize game. as we just saw in NFS MW and especially NFS Rivals. I absolutly cannot realize,  what about developers thought and for what fight, for what they killed their game in the same way, although result of such experiment was just well known: online project without multiplayer is somewhat simply ridiculous.
<br>So, generally, we see total fail of ambitions. Total disappointment. And it was predetermined by fact that these, looks like, TDU2 creators are people not only untalented, but also blind and deaf: they havent even try to correct manifest deformities and ) incongruities players mentioned during beta test.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4785512">Expand</a></span>

The core element of the game, around which all other elements, whether they be racing, customizing, roaming, etc, is the physics and handling of the cars. And it is horrendous. You may as well have drank a whole bottle of J&amp;B Scotch (&quot;The antidote to roadrage!&quot;), because you will be swerving like a madman. There is no road feel. It is not even close to simulator quality handling. If you so much as lose a hair&apos;s breadth of control, your force feedback will give up, you will spin-out, and you will get frustrated. Pretty fast.
<br>
<br>That Ubisoft shackles the player to a terribly cliche, uninspired revenge plot just adds insult to injury. I want to skip all the bland voice acting (we all love Troy Baker, I&apos;m sure he&apos;s a good guy, but I&apos;ve had enough!). I wouldn&apos;t mind us being able to have different gender/race driver avatars. And don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m no &quot;social justice warrior&quot; looking for a soap box-- I just think that in this day and age, dammit if every single person playing the game is going to be a white 35 year old male with a Mumford and Sons beard. Variety is the spice of life.
<br>
<br>The graphics are lackluster at best. Your car looks about the same as a car from NFS Hot Pursuit. That&apos;s a 2008 game. This game should have better looking cars than what comes out of a 2008 game! Not marginally better -- a LOT better. Curvature of chassis is simplified down to single polygon lines.
<br>
<br>The interface is so cumbersome and intrusive that it is almost impossible to play the game without having to pause, press a button twice, just to get the game to stop congratulating me on driving two miles.
<br>
<br>Somewhere between the concept and execution, something went wrong with this game. It&apos;s just very...underwhelming. There is no sense of speed the way you get in a game like Assetto Corsa. Yes, it&apos;s a simulator being compared to an arcade game, and I suppose that&apos;s the main source of my disappointment. I was hoping for high fidelity racing and instead got a NFS game that drives with the subtlety of one of those hot wheels remote control cars.
<br>
<br>I give it a 1 because I was looking forward to an open world racing sim with some NFS styling. Instead, I got NFS and drunk physics. I don&apos;t recommend anyone buy this game unless he or she absolutely LOVED the NFS series, because that&apos;s all it is. For some that&apos;s a bad thing (myself included), and for others, it&apos;s exciting news. But at the end of the day, NFS + MMO = The Crew
<br>
<br>It wasn&apos;t worth my money or my time, and I regret purchasing it. In my opinion, 2 star.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4784929">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ 60 FPS
<br>+ Its a multiplatform Carpg
<br>+ Miniscale version of the U.S to drive around

<br>+ Handling choices such as sport, all assist, and hardcore
<br>+ Cars upgrades as you use your skills to earn the parts
<br>+ You can buy the cars if you don&apos;t feel like farming and winning for it you lazy bum and well, earn it faster that way but doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re better those who worked harder will progress.
<br>+ Drive all over the place, I surf the dunes of vegas
<br>+ Most importantly, with friends or even a crew of people to race around with this game is FUN
<br>
<br>- Its a miniscale U.S many towns and city missing still as they add in more
<br>- Need more cars!
<br>- No rear view mirrors working .... YET
<br>- Need a better system in knowing who is racing in certain pvp lobbies across the u.s cities since its pretty massive.
<br>- No rain effects seen yet or tornados and dust storms etc. I would love to drive against a tornado please.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4785218">Expand</a></span>

The game ends up being decent single player driving game. Game is quite fun for a few 10 of hours, but don&#x2019;t expect to have fun with late game multiplayer! Not worth 60 eur!
<br>A few cons and pros:</p>
<br>
<br><p>+ driving: sits nicely between simulation and arcade feel. Similar to older NFS titles, similar to CMR DIRT and a like improved TDU2.
<br>NOTE! Rocks are **** Very poorly coded! Imagine them as springs&#x2026; yes you just fly ridiculously&#x2026;
<br>NOTE! Nitro is stupid. It just spins your wheels. Does not matter in which gear you are. Very hard to control! </p>
<br>
<br><p>+ hardcore mode: you have to be constantly careful how you accelerate, so you don&#x2019;t lose grip. Every bump in the road counts, which makes it feel nicely realistic. </p>
<br>
<br><p>+ roads: have a nice realistic feel to them. You can&apos;t really drive in a straight line all of the time. Different surface has different road quality, which gives you a bit of randomness when driving on them. </p>
<br>
<br><p>+ map: really big. From city corners, to curvy mountain snowy roads, to flat straight highways, jumps, etc&#x2026; awesome! </p>
<br>
<br><p>+ FPS stability: on 60 with my gtx 970 and 3570K, all maxed out expect aliasing FXAA, other types are causing me frame drops. </p>
<br>
<br><p>+ graphics: overall nice. They have too much quality downscale when cars are far away and when you travel fast. &#x201C;Pop-in&#x201D; &#x2013; you can see it all over, cars spawning in like 700m in front of you. Sometimes you see a lot of nothing &#x201C;behind the scene&#x201D; (over a building). </p>
<br>
<br><p>+ engine sounds</p>
<br>
<br><p>+ cinematics</p>
<br>
<br><p>- story: decent at most, nothing really special</p>
<br>
<br><p>- driving conditions: Day/Night cycle, no weather!! </p>
<br>
<br><p>- vehicles: to few cars, probably reserved for DLCs&#x2026;</p>
<br>
<br><p>- Ubisoft&#x2019;s &#x201C;&#x201D;&#x201D;cinematic look&#x201D;&#x201D;&#x201D;: You have to options: lock to 30 or 60 fps. You can not unlock it&#x2026;</p>
<br>
<br><p>- DLCs: no problem gamers, Ubisoft has you covered. As much DLCs as your wallet can handle! So you they can continue &#x201C;develop&#x201D; bank account their game.
<br>
<br></p><p>- multiplayer: unbalanced matchmaking, queue&#x2019;s approx. 5min, you can&#x2019;t really play then until you max your car. You can not queue for specific type of vehicle. You can race in P, C, S road vehicles or D, R offroad. Type is chosen by PvP lobby leader, which is chosen on random. Random driving conditions. Cars in multiplayer are ridiculously close with performance. </p>
<br>
<br><p>- &#x201C;skill&#x201D; challenges: on its own they are fun, but when you add traffic it becomes a mess. Very luck based! You need &#x201C;Platinum&#x201D; level parts to level up your car, so you can compete in multiplayer. Luckily once unlocked, you can buy them straight from the shop for your new car.
<br>There are also leaderboards for this challenges, which combined with traffic is a bit ****
<br>When you retry a skill challenge, it spawns you too close to challenge start, which sometimes require you to go back for more speed.
<br>Ghosts for specific reward are sometimes broken. </p>
<br>
<br><p>- racer car AI: AI is ridiculously horrible! They are crashing all the time. You can be glad if they don&#x2019;t hit you and make you crash. Horrible! And how did developers compensate on this matter? They implemented &#x201C;catch-up&#x201D; system. So AI in short: Crash, catch up, crash, catch up, make you crash, AI wins. </p>
<br>
<br><p>- cop car AI: OP as **** You can not outrun them. You are supposed to do as much turns as you can. </p>
<br>
<br><p>- game UI: game shows you all of ten players on the map on your screen. You can also see those stupid names in the center of the screen&#x2026;.</p>
<br>
<br><p>- traffic: minor compromise. Spawning in and out. Make a U turn and the car which just passed you is nowhere to be seen </p></span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4908513">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First of all, the physics are complete garbage, making it feel like you are driving a hovercraft that goes over land, water, or road, through trees, fences and street lamps without any difference or damage whatsoever. Second, the cars do the same horrible shuffle from all the Grid games where they oversteer uncontrollably as soon as you hit the brakes. Finally, as you are trying to cope with this, the AI cars drive into your lane without rhyme or reason while you are trying to do the missions. Get hit once and all the AI cars zoom ahead of you, leaving you to restart the mission.
<br>
<br>The graphics on a GTX 980 with all settings on max are decent enough, but the sound is utter garbage. I had to turn up my speakers far too loud to hear the engine so I could judge my RPM for gear changes, and the exterior car engines, tire squeals, and the radio (thankfully you can turn the music off in settings) still drowned it out.
<br>
<br>I played on both a Logitech Momo wheel and an Xbox 360 controller, the wheel made no difference in helping to control the car whatsoever. Baffling.
<br>
<br>I would not recommend this game for anyone. I was really looking forward to trying a social racing game that would let me put my skills up against other &quot;real&quot; drivers, but this is just far too annoying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=5057442">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Crew can be really annoying. The game has bugs which will make you really mad. In these &apos;&apos;end game races&apos;&apos; you will have to win races which last like 1.5h-2.5h. These races give really good cash and exp rewards, but the AI of random traffic and the racing cars is so trashy that you will end up crying. I have done many of those races and i keep getting messed up by the AI and bugs. The cars on highways might turn randomly even tho there&apos;s no exits around. This will basically wreck your car and make you lose a lot of time in the race. The other racers may fail a lot during the race but they will get this bs boost where they can drive a lot faster than the car should actually be able to without slowing down on turns because i think there&apos;s a set time where they have to finish the race. Usually the enemy cars might pull you into the crash but because they have the set time they will be a lot faster than you when they respawn and basically outrun you even tho they failed. The biggest annoyance yet i&apos;ve come to find out is the back on track feature bug. Sometimes during those big races if you have to use the back on track feature to continue the race it might just mess you up completely. Just the other day i was in 1.5 hour race i was just a few checkpoints away from victory at 1st place, but then i had to use the back on track and it basically teleported me 10 miles away from the last car in the race. So basically i played for more than an hour to lose it all thanks to a bug. The story in the game isn&apos;t anything new or original it seems to me like it&apos;s the exact same story stolen from Nfs - Undercover. I let the story part slide because i don&apos;t usually pay attention to the stories in games. Pvp or Co-op in the game is bad (to me atleast) since every guy seems to have a laggy computer or the servers are trash because when you join a crew then race with the guys the chances are the host has the only good connection to the game and the other racers are just teleporting around for the guys in the crew.

<br>I really like the map in the game it&apos;s quite large and there&apos;s alot of variety and the graphics are good so the scenery is really beautiful. The car customization in the game is quite decent. The specs in the game make you have to buy multiple cars because the better cars can only use like 2 of the 5 specs. The visual customization in The Crew is lacking. You can only choose 1 sticker on the car. So you can&apos;t place multiple stickers and move them around the car to make it really personalized. There are like 41 cars in the game and there&apos;s a lot of variety in the cars. Yet i think they should add Bugatti Veyron in the game. The driving physics in the game are quite good if you turn the driving help off and turn on hardcore settings so it&apos;s more realistic. The snow areas on the map are really annoying to drive on without driving help tho because the roads are like ice there&apos;s no grip whatsoever on the car and that&apos;s not realistic at all.
<br>
<br>The Crew is a beautiful and large game but these bugs annoy me too much to give it a better score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4871964">Expand</a></span>

What I was hoping for was a marvelous co-op open world car game where you would have fun just by racing around the world, earning money and customizing your car. The reality hit me hard when I finally started playing this game. It was pretty much nothing like I would have wanted it to be. Let&apos;s make a simple cons and pros list since those are clear and simple:
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- AI is atrociously bad. Opponents will catch up with you no matter how big is the car level difference between you and the bots. They IGNORE laws of &quot;physics&quot; that apply to your car. They can smash everything and not lose any speed at all. They can drive well on any terrain with any car spec. Police cars will be terminators with their own physics. You can&apos;t push them at all and they will catch up with your uber speeder car no matter how fast you are.
<br>- Physics. The cars feels utterly wrong not to mention the &quot;physics&quot; of the objects. You sometimes drive straight into a metal fence just to bounce off from it. Drive almost straight to a car or a tree? No worries the game just bumps your car to the left or right and avoid the whole crash. And the non-destroyable fence? They are a real pain in the ass. Physics just simply suck.
<br>- Car performance customization is a lie and a joke. There simply is no customization. You do missions and get a part as a reward. You choose to install it to your car and you have it on. You can&apos;t buy the parts, you just have to keep repeating the same boring &quot;side-missions&quot; to get better quality parts. Not to mention that Platinum parts are a gamble. They vary from level 40 to 50 and what you get as a reward is completely RNG. Have fun trying to &quot;achieve&quot; the level 50 parts from all categories.
<br>- Car visual customization is lacking. There are &quot;decent&quot; customization for the starter cars for Street, Dirt and Perf specs, but Raid and Circuit don&apos;t really have anything apart from the rims. Not to mention that NONE of the other cars have all the specs available than the starter cars. Most of the cars can be build around few specs like for example Street and Perf.
<br>- Car list is nothing as promised. Only a handful of cars are in the game and there isn&apos;t really much variety. Have fun paying for more cars in the upcoming DLC packs. So much for &quot;lots of cars&quot; to choose from. I don&apos;t want to pay a 10&#x20AC; just to get one car from the pack and leave the rest unused.
<br>- The story is simply disappointing and bland. Characters are shallow and boring. The NPC yelling at you in races is darn annoying and I wish there was an option to mute it. All women look like whores and the men all sound way off from their appearances.
<br>- The Crew server are crap. &quot;The crew servers are currently unavailable&quot;. You will get that message a lot. After a month of playing this game you would think that this would be fixed already, but it&apos;s not. You will get multiple disconnects per few hours of playing. And the best part of it? It will NOT save your progress when you get DC&apos;d. So have fun replaying your crappy missions over and over again just to get the game save your progress. I shouldn&apos;t even mention how frustrating this is when you are doing a &quot;perfect&quot; run. A nice salt to the wound is that it will only DC you AFTER you have done your mission. So you will not get instantly thrown away, you can still continue to do your ******* long 3-part mission without even knowing of the DC. Then when you are supposed to get the &quot;reward/statistics screen&quot; you will be kicked out and progress flushed out of the toilet.
<br>- Graphics don&apos;t reflect the &quot;next-gen&quot; at all. There is not even a decent anti-aliasing option to go with it. The change of weather/time is really awkward and doesn&apos;t blend seamlessly.
<br>- The co-op aspect of the game is more hindrance than fun. The co-op works really well when you are free roaming, but when you get into missions the other guy will be just &quot;ruining&quot; your race. He will steal your points for being the 1st or taking the checkpoints or he can just accidentally ram you and take the &quot;adaptive&quot; AI with him so that you will be left to the bottom. The how scores gets distributed is just ridiculous. This game feels more like competitive racing than actual &quot;co-op&quot;. Have fun retrying the mission over and over again just to get you both the gold medals etc.
<br>- The radio channels in the game are crap. Nothing even half decent to listen and there is NO option for &quot;independence FM&quot; to listen to your own music. Only way is to simply turn off the music and keep WMP or winamp etc. running in the back.
<br>
<br>Pros.
<br>+ Co-op is fun when it works and free-roaming can be enjoyable.
<br>+ Scenery is not so bad and the map is pretty big
<br>
<br>So all in all a really crappy experience with this game. I&apos;m glad me and my friend didn&apos;t have to pay for this crap since we got it for free with our new GPUs. We are really disappointed with the product we got. I&apos;m running low on writing space.

Maybe I expected too much of a single player aspect from this game, but many other arcade racer similar to The Crew usually let you progress by allowing you to buy a new car every time you advance in the story, but in this game you can do the whole in the starting car and are pretty much stuck doing so if you want the nicer cars that are offered at the end game. And again, like mobile games, instead of grinding, you can just pay for it with real money instead. The entire game feels like it is centered around that ideology of &quot;grind or pay&quot; and it feels incredibly scummy for a game that you have to pay for in the first place.
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise, majority of the racing is solo checkpoint to checkpoint racing, and it gets boring real quick because there&apos;s no competition. When there is competition, the AI is so atrocious that you will often see them crashing and swerving wildly across your screen. There&apos;s only a handful of actual races. Near the endgame they force you to play some stupid &quot;destroy the boxes&quot; mini game race which just feels stupid because it&apos;s not even racing. The default controls are pretty bad because I assume they were going for the half-baked semi realism thing, but the game is much funner if you put all the sensitivity, linearity, etc to max at which point the game becomes fun and arcadey which suits this game a lot more than whatever they were going for.
<br>
<br>The graphics are honestly quite mediocre even with all the setting at max. The story and script are clearly targeted towards edgy ten year olds because it&apos;s ridden with stereotypes and cliche one liners that one can&apos;t really take it seriously. But then again, I never really expected a good story from a racing game so kind of a moot point.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game leaves a sour taste in my mouth, and can&apos;t really recommend buying this unless it is on sale/ bundle for a REALLY low price and your looking to waste a couple of hours with mindless arcade racing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=6477866">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Things took a turn for the worst a few &quot;tasks&quot; into the story when they introduced an &quot;American&quot; law enforcement officer by the name of &quot;Clara WASHINGTON&quot; (!!), who opens her mouth and belches out  a thick British accent... I knew at this point this story is going to be cheesy AF to compliment the difficult AF and tedious AF, so I quit and uninstalled the game.

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>The entire U.S. in one open map.
<br>Some of the cars (Discussing this later on).
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Awful car physics and controls.
<br>Constant online connection needed.
<br>Graphics with some ugly textures.
<br>Weak story.
<br>Slim variety of cars.
<br>Difficult to have online matches, races, and missions.
<br>Very limited single-player content after finishing the story.
<br>
<br>I was one of the many players that was excited for this game because of the open world being the entire US and it&apos;s pretty awesome to drive across the country and see the scenery change from forests to deserts. However, despite the fact the map is huge, the city sizes are not consistent with each other. Many major cities such as Denver or Atlanta are missing and instead included 3-4 city blocks to represent smaller, lesser-known cities which I found very questionable. Compression in some areas of the map also look weird such as mountains seen from Chicago which in real life is non existent because of the 800+ miles of Iowa and Nebraska that is nowhere to be found in this game.
<br>
<br>In conjunctions with the graphics, some areas of the map look amazing, especially the deserts at sunset, but many areas of the map are littered with ugly, repeated textures, trees looking lifeless and look like they are made of metal, and many recycled objects in the cities including parked cars with no shadows or reflections that look bad. It literally looks like your driving around on a map created in Sim City 4 - all copy and paste with lack of variety in many ideas which I was afraid of finding in a game with an open world like this. There are racing games that are over 5 years old that have better looking graphics than this.
<br>
<br>The story is weak, it is pulled straight out of a Need for Speed title with hardly any thrills. Many of the CGI cut scenes look great and others are just dull. Missions are dull and many times do not work well with the situation in the story. Many of them are not even races.
<br>
<br>The AI in this game is garbage! There is no consistency at all! Cars constantly pull ahead of you regardless of car class. I had a race where a Ford Raptor was constantly pulling far ahead of me and I was driving a Ferrari. You don&apos;t need to be a car expert to know that a pick-up truck can&apos;t beat a Ferrari no matter how much customization there is. Cops are annoying in this game as well. I love police chases in any racing game, but this one has no thrills but full of frustration. They will block your car like a tank. You can push them out of the way, you can hardly outrun them, and if they block you - your instantly busted. When you try to take down a fleeing car in certain missions, they constantly stay in front of you and nearly give-up when there is 30 seconds left on the clock. Worst AI system I have ever seen.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t care much for car customization in games, but compared to other racing games, there&apos;s nothing that stands out in this game from others.
<br>
<br>The soundtrack in this game is dull. The only good songs I briefly listened to where songs found in other past racing titles. The dramatic music score during missions is bland and feels no emotions. Car sounds are ok, not &quot;mind-blowing&quot;, but they work.
<br>
<br>Now this biggest problem with The Crew:
<br>
<br>WORST DRIVING PHYSICS EVER!
<br>
<br>The cars drive like boats. You can never keep them in a straight line and always lean to the left or right. This gets even more frustrating with the high-end circuit cars. Even worse is that many vehicles do not feel different from each other regardless of what pointless upgrades you applied. Some drive faster than others and that&apos;s it. There is no element to the sense of speed either like many other games. Blur effects are weak and the camera doesn&apos;t shake, just HUD (which looks fake). The cars feel bulky at times. You can also swipe cars and trees and your car will simply slide around them with no collisions or damage. When you do crash, the damage on your car is not consistent to the crash. Cars also take off on a dime with no screeching tires or spinning unless you bounce off the guardrails. I could go on forever about the driving.
<br>
<br>Online on this game blows. There is hardly anyone online to compete in events which is a big problem because when you complete the story, there is very few single-player races to compete in leading to an open world that is virtually empty. I don&apos;t care for the online set-ups and I never will. Did I also mention you need constant online connection to play The Crew? Guess Ubisoft didn&apos;t learn from EA&apos;s big failure of Sim City, did they?
<br>
<br>Overall: The Crew has some cool cars and a big map with some cool areas to explore, but the outdated graphics, bad design choices, forced online, weak story, and horrible physics - there is just too many problems that make this game worth playing after exploring the map.
<br>
<br>This is a $60 incomplete beta.
<br>
<br>Back to the old NFS titles that look and run better.

<br>Unfortunately, the number of cars in the game is too less (like 40 something). Of course, the &quot;kind&quot; and almighty &quot;U-not-soft&quot; knows this problem and decided to &quot;help&quot; by publishing EXCLUSIVE 14 cars with the very &quot;low&quot; price of $24.99. Sounds cheap, isn&apos;t it?
<br>Not only that, the AI is very annoying at times. In races, AI can suddenly activate &quot;hyper speed boost&quot; option and pass you when you&apos;re in last 500m or so. The traffic is so awkward that sometimes you just slide the traffic cars when you hit it head to head, and sometimes they just go &quot;f___ you!&quot; and let your car crash. When you&apos;re doing skills, there are chances that AI are blocking you way to weave through the slalom or get through the gate, and you just get raged and restart it again.
<br>The main failure of this game is the concept of multiplaying. You can hardly invite your lobby players (if you can connect to one) to join your co-op missions, unless they want to do the exact same thing. Also, the PvP lobbies are extremely broken that you can hardly enter any faction wars. If you are lucky enough, you may be able to play &quot;free for all&quot; and have races with others, but you need to be ready for stupid rubber banding. These makes the game quite boring after you finished the whole story.
<br>When I was playing story missions, I find the game extremely fun. And now it&apos;s covered in dust in my computer and I rarely play it now, unless Ubisoft fixes the PvP problems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4884520">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Should you buy it? On sale, yes, I think it&apos;s definitely worth it.
<br>
<br>Why the low score?
<br>It&apos;s simple...Uplay.
<br>It&apos;s unstable, unreliable and will often just lose connectivity for no reason while at the same time Origin and Steam will still be running perfectly. It&apos;s also always online, which wouldn&apos;t be a problem if it weren&apos;t for Uplay.
<br>If this game used only Steam I&apos;d have given it 8/10, because Steam actually works.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=5441641">Expand</a></span>

The game itself is bland, the graphics, the characters, the story line, etc. which left me feeling like they just did not try. Races are near impossible to win, if you&apos;re doing good, the computer is doing better, if you pay attention it&apos;s very clear that they have one really &apos;good&apos; racer and then the rest absolutely suck. The way every race goes its that the person in first is 1 - 2 miles ahead of you and everyone else is 1 -2 miles behind you. If you come in second, you lose so really in all honesty you&apos;re screwed with every race.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t even get me started on the take down missions, the cars are so hard to handle while the computer seems to have the perfect car. it seems like they could take 90 degree turns on a dime and go from 60-120 in 2 second just to get away from you. It&apos;s ridiculous, the ONLY way to beat them is to play the same mission 20 times just to find out their pattern and then you can take them down. I don&apos;t know about you but that&apos;s not fun at all for me.
<br>
<br>I must say, the main reason I bought this game was because I bought the logitech g27 and i honestly did not have that much racing games that i could play with it. I took the leap and bought this heap...of stinking, rotting, and fermenting garbage and i regret my purchase 100%
<br>
<br>On the the pros of which there are very little. A lot of the cars look nice, the fact that they have a somewhat nice looking interior is what really brought my in and the customization is enormous. That is until you find out that getting money and these parts are nearly impossible and you&apos;ll end up spending all the blue credit things you get right in the beginning on a new car and now you&apos;re left to either spend 20 bucks or waste 20 hours of your life saving up money.
<br>
<br>Just as a side note, this game isn&apos;t really for the huge car guys as they make it out to be, you don&apos;t really need to know what the parts do, just equip anything that brings up your car rating, how disappointing.  equally disappointing is the amount of cars there are that aren&apos;t even out. if you wanted to drive your dream car you&apos;re probably out of luck, there are a lot of concept cars in this game and any good car will require you grinding for hours to get enough capital. And this may be nitpicky but the voice of the ominous girl that talks to you throughout the game criticizing you will really get on your nerves.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=5199327">Expand</a></span>

<br>In its basics its pretty good. Huge world. Some decent cars. Many customization options. And thats it!
<br>
<br>The ingame physics are god awful. Cars are alway trying to face ground with their bottom. Obsticles you hit fly through the air at an amazing speed then suddenly stabilize themself with some magic and suddenly come down like a leaf in the wind.
<br>
<br>The NPC cars. Omg the NPC cars. They are just there. They only react to you by honking. Sometimes hilarious, sometimes pretty annoying, they glitch everywhere. And they are often placed to distract you if you are first or whatever. I could count on.
<br>
<br>To get the needed money so you can get the nice looking shoping cart you want, you either do PVP, which is very repetitive at time. Or you make the long races either alone or with friends. These are so frustrating. The longest races there are last like 4 hours sometimes. What happens? One f*king Checkpoint before the goal Server crash. Or you are 2 hours first, do one mistake and all your progress is gone. The best thing is, that the NPC Cars in these long races have several advatages, like when they are afar from you render distance there are no traffic cars for them. Its funny when you actually look at the distances. You get ahead of them and at some point behind you they somehow make a ruberband flash and are suddenly behind your butt again.
<br>
<br>So much about the World. But what about the crews? When my friends aren`t on I sometimes try to drive with some people in the Openworld. Like the Trailer always said, you can drive with them and feel like an actual crew and find new friends! Especially when you just drive them, and they just want you to get away. Or they sue you. Or they dont stop ramming into you and vanish. But to be honest. I had also my good times with some random people on the street.
<br>
<br>As I said this game has its flaws. But I just cannot stop playing it. even more with friends. But seriously Ubisoft should shutdown Uplay or rework it completly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=6088921">Expand</a></span>

On the plus side, the cars are cool, the graphics are alright, and it&apos;s a big world. I&apos;m almost surprised that they haven&apos;t worked the bugs out in the 2 years that this has been out, but after all, this is ubisoft.</span>

<br>I&apos;ve played about 10 hours of the game and thank Carl Sagan I got it on the Nvidia deal this holiday season or I&apos;d be asking for my money back.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve broken my review into a few sections:
<br>
<br>- Technical (Covering graphics, performance, and interface)
<br>- Social (How the online integration works, feels, and how interactions with other players work)
<br>- Feel (How the cars drive, what upgrades feel like, etc)
<br>
<br>Technical:
<br>The game is commonly full of lag and with an MMO-Racing game this is simply unacceptable. &apos;co-op&apos; drivers rubberband all over the place, I commonly lose connection to the game servers and get stuck on random objects and invisible walls in the environment.
<br>From a graphic performance standpoint, there is no reason why this game should be capped at either 30 or 60fps when my GTX 670 with AA off can EASILY lock 60fps with no trouble. What about people with 120hz monitors? It doesn&apos;t look anywhere near as good as NFS: Rivals even maxed out which is almost 2 years old if I&apos;m not mistaken.
<br>In terms of interface, the game is nothing to write home about. All pertinent information is displayed where it needs to be, and the wiki feature is welcome. The map is...difficult to navigate smoothly, and the fast travel feature once unlocked kind of defeats the purpose of free-drive, as earning points that you don&apos;t buy with your credit card comes VERY slowly. The lone chat box that is your connection to other people appears in the bottom middle of the screen, obscured by pretty much every other interface element....and nobody talks. Nobody.
<br>
<br>Social
<br>Unless you have a lot of friends who play the game, prepare to feel absolutely alone. You NEED friends to play this with, because making them online is very unlikely.
<br>Dropping into &apos;co-op&apos; races puts you against other people - and doing this in story missions is next to useless, because most of the time as a new player, you can&apos;t come in first (since you&apos;re fighting the broken, rubberbanding players and AI when racing online), and because you can&apos;t come in first, the story doesn&apos;t advance.
<br>In PvP modes, the player with the highest level car wins. No matter what. Unless of course they crash due to rubberbanding, or just randomly disconnect.
<br>The &apos;social&apos; environment of this game is hugely disappointing, mainly because there IS no social environment to the game. It&apos;s just bland, empty and relies on you to have a &apos;crew&apos; to run with before the game is purchased.
<br>
<br>- Feel
<br>This is where the biggest disappointment for me came through.
<br>Every car no matter what you drive feels like a floaty 30-ton dump truck being driven on the moon. If you make a slight course correction, you WILL fishtail in a matter of seconds, spin out and immediately lose control no matter your skill. It&apos;s not simulation grade driving. It&apos;s not arcade driving. It&apos;s just plain bad.
<br>The different &apos;specs&apos; of cars you can get are seemingly random and have no different feel to them at all. I noticed zero difference when driving street spec to dirt spec to raid spec. They all felt the same - wobbly, uncontrollable, floaty and just...yuck.
<br>
<br>Conclusion
<br>In conclusion, I&apos;ll say that one day, The Crew MIGHT become a decent game. There&apos;s a hint of awesomeness behind all the bad design choices and being billed as an MMO, maybe Ubishaft will push out some content patches to tighten things up, and make the cars handle like they&apos;re being driven on earth instead of the Moon.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving The Crew a 4/10. There is simply too much that feels unfinished, unpolished, buggy and a mess.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4810533">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>- Handling. Oh, boy... If you enjoy driving soap on ice, this game is definitely for you. Choosing &quot;hardcore&quot; handling type doesn&apos;t help much, driving is still not enjoyable;
<br>
<br>- Terrible AI (Rival cars going off the road or crashing into a train and then respawning right in front of your vehicle);
<br>
<br>- Incredibly ridiculous story missions (Escape from police Crown Victoria&apos;s and Ford F150&apos;s with weight of 50 tons and ability of reaching a top speed of more than 180 mp/h in less than 10 seconds; take down vehicle that is faster than yours, but you only have 3 minutes, otherwise the world is going to end; crash into dozens of crates, but you only have 3 minutes, just because; take your performance spec ride to a race on an icy road, because AI is not affected by the environment, but you&apos;re and that&apos;s how the things work in virtual USA, etc.);
<br>
<br>- Mediocre open-wold racing game using basically the same M.O.O.R multiplayer component (Does it work properly? Na-ah. Don&apos;t even hope for it to function as intended) introduced in Test Drive Unlimited (2006) and re-advertised as a revolutionary MMO that&apos;s all about social gameplay (Channels with 8 players each, no way of a proper interaction between players (Text chat is surprisingly uncomfortable to use);
<br>
<br>- Waiting time of getting into a PvP-lobby may go up to 50 minutes. There&apos;re only 2 options in PvP-lobby for you to choose from: you can turn off traffic and you can turn off collisions (Which is useless, because rival cars don&apos;t become even a little transparent, so if you&apos;re playing with a cockpit view you can&apos;t see &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; because of another car model moving into yours). You can&apos;t turn off nitro for all players and you can&apos;t restrict handling type to &quot;hardcore&quot; or camera view to a certain one (Because why would somebody need that, right? Nobody cares, anyway). There&apos;s no balance between players (You may be connected to a lobby with max lvl players who have maxed out cars, so be ready for your &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; to get kicked). No penalty for cutting corners or collisions with other players;
<br>
<br>- You&apos;re forced to do story missions until you reach certain level and get a Dirt-spec car before you&apos;re allowed into PvP (1-2 hours of gameplay);
<br>
<br>- You can make a Performance-spec Hummer or any other SUV with a top speed of over 180 mp/h, but you can&apos;t make a Raid-spec Nissan Skyline GT-R (R34) or a Circuit-spec Mustang 2015, which totally makes sense;
<br>
<br>- You can&apos;t just purchase new performance parts from tuning shops, you&apos;re forced to do skill challenges to get better ones (However, if you win parts for your first certain-spec car, you&apos;ll be able to purchase them for another);
<br>
<br>- All the cars featured in The Crew are RWD (Even ones that should be AWD);
<br>
<br>- No reflections in rear-view and side mirrors when in cockpit view, but not when using 3rd person vew. There&apos;s also some weird bug that changes level of detail of your car&apos;s interior after cutscenes or fast travelling (Getting out of the cockpit view and back in returns level of detail back to normal);
<br>
<br>- NPC cars don&apos;t use blinkers when changing lanes;
<br>
<br>- Inviting session players to complete story mission with you is Ivory Tower&apos;s revolutionary social experience;
<br>
<br>- Horrendous radio soundtrack. My ears are still bleeding. By the way, you won&apos;t find any mention about the keys answering for changing radio stations in the control settings, it&apos;s just not there;
<br>
<br>- No dynamic weather;
<br>
<br>- No support of 4:3 display aspect ratio;
<br>
<br>- 60 FPS cap.
<br>
<br>&quot;The sCREWd: Always Drive Alone&quot; is a bright example of false advertising. If you&apos;re thinking of purchasing the game, wait until it goes on sale. It&apos;s not worth 60 dollars or even half the price, in my opinion. Still unfinished, without a good optimization product even after SIX years of development. Also no significant improvements have been made since beta.

My desire to own a fast car stemmed from playing games such as the original racing arcade games and the first Gran Turismo.  I must have played Gran Turismo for hundreds upon hundreds of hours.  I had no idea what torque was, I just knew oh HP = Good.  The crew actually takes my child level intelligence and dumbs that down to the point where your car just has levels.  Its beautiful really, that you can condense every variable of a car into one simple number.  It really allows for a high level of customization.  I also really love driving on ice, so the crew is perfect for me, no game has ever quite satisfied my desire to attach ice skates to a car until now.  The crew had ought to be renamed to ice skating cars, and then the car level could refer to your cars overall scores for figure skating.  There was also a plot and cut scenes added for you to skip every time you skate out of the rink into a dead end.  Its also really cool how when you go into first person mode so you can drive your car like you would normally, ALL OF THE MIRRORS ARE JUST BLACK, as we all know black is the color of carbon fiber, so that carbon fiber glass is probably adding about 40WHP in total.  Luckily in the crew you will spend about half of your time facing backwards anyhow so you can still see everything.  The game, although being mechanically perfect in every way, has a FEW bugs.  Just a few, I swear.  The crew however stays true to its superior racing game roots and carries on the tradition of physics not actually existing and trees being the ultimate life form.  We also all know that what an object looks like has no real relation to the amount of space an object takes up.  I hate it when I&apos;m driving to work and I think I&apos;m clear to go around the side of a building but to my surprise its actually 6 feet farther out than visible.  Good thing, just like in the crew, my car regrows my intercooler and engine on my way to work.  Its also awesome that I got this game for free buying my new graphics cards to do 4k, and it looks just as good as Gran Turismo 2.  The crew also has such a good selection of cars, American Muscle cars are really the only ones that matter, lets face it.  No one likes that ricer crap.    I would have paid $450 +$75 per DLC like ubisoft wanted, but unfortunately I had already gotten the game for free.  I would recommend this game to anyone who has ever wanted a game that allows them use their car to ice skate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=5156646">Expand</a></span>

It features one of the largest free-roam maps in any racing game with a drive straight through the middle taking a good hour to complete - not to mention a run around the perimeter! The map is scattered with mini-challenges called &apos;Skills&apos; which you can enter seamlessly. These keep you busy, and are worth doing considering they offer fairly decent upgrades to your cars. Skills can be found just about anywhere, which is impressive considering how huge the map is. What&apos;s more impressive is that, despite the maps massive scale, the level of detail is consistently high right through. Not to mention just how pretty much of it is, which brings me to the visuals. I found The Crew ran very well on my system, Ultra detail at 1440p and 60fps with only a few drops - this is impressive, because The Crew is absolutely gorgeous. I likely spent more time with my jaw on the ground taking screenshots than I did actually playing the game. The games driving physics are fun, a fairly realistic driving model but still very accessible to casual players. There&apos;s also plenty of content to keep you busy, expect to be playing this for a while! Unfortunately, now we come to the low points. Firstly, the games story. The story itself isn&apos;t terrible, I found it somewhat reminiscent of NFS: Most Wanted. However, it made a few crucial mistakes. It&apos;s biggest issue is that it rushes through the opening scenes which set up the ENTIRE GAME in a matter of a few minutes. The story is, a dude named Shiv kills your brother who you knew for all of two minutes (In which he called you an **** and then frames you for it. You&apos;re going to spend the whole game getting revenge for that. Because the game fails to set itself up, it falls flat on it&apos;s face right off the start line and drags itself along for 10 hours or so trying to convince you to care. But you don&apos;t. And you won&apos;t. The plot serves it&apos;s purpose in keeping the game moving forward however, and it certainly does a great job of showing you the world in the timely manner, having you dart from place to place every few missions. As far as the plot goes however? Total failure. Another flaw is the games list of cars. A large amount of vehicles are locked away as paid DLC, and those that aren&apos;t are quite few. Without having counted them, I daresay there&apos;s around 30 - 40 cars included in the price of the game. Make no mistake however, the roster is a strong one, quality over quantity you could say, but even so, it&apos;s not a great amount to choose from. Above everything already stated, The Crew has one more flaw - the biggest flaw of all. That&apos;s that it lacks an Offline mode. Being able to play The Crew relies on having an internet connection. It also relies on The Crew&apos;s servers being online, which occasionally, they aren&apos;t. It also relies on uPlay&apos;s servers being online, which, to my surprise, are frequently down. In short, the planets need to align for you to be able to enjoy The Crew and when they do, it may not be for long. In addition to availability frustrations, the game lacks any kind of &apos;Private&apos; mode. In short, if you&apos;re playing the game, everybody else can see you. Everybody else can ram you off the road. Everybody else can spam you with race and crew invites. And god forbid you have friends with the game, because they&apos;ll be hassling you to play with them regardless of whether you want to play with them or not. So really, there&apos;s no being antisocial with this game. Despite being able to complete the game without any interaction with other players whatsoever, the game will offer you no way out of having to put up with them anyway. This wouldn&apos;t be so much of a problem if the online features were good, but they&apos;re really not. They&apos;re very cookie cutter, &apos;seen-it-before&apos; stuff. It more or less lifts Test Drive Unlimited&apos;s multiplayer features and does nothing to modernize or improve upon them. So in summary, the multiplayer isn&apos;t really all that new or fun, but you have no choice but to put up with it anyway. So, back to the first sentence of this review. The Crew is a hard one to rate because it largely depends on what you&apos;re wanting to get out of it as to how you&apos;re going to enjoy it. If you enjoy open world racing games with pretty and detailed scenery and lots of open road to cruise, you&apos;ll probably love The Crew. But if you&apos;re looking for a highly complex single or multiplayer driven racing game, or a highly realistic one for that matter, you&apos;re going to be disappointed. Put simply, The Crew is open world porn. The kind of game where you can drive for hours in with no real goal in sight. Beyond the open world appeal however, it can be somewhat lacking although not morbidly so. The Crew isn&apos;t a bad game, just some parts of it are mediocre. Some of the other parts however are simply exquisite, so don&apos;t discount The Crew because of it&apos;s luke-warm reviews!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=5135671">Expand</a></span>

<br>Die KI ist ein Witz, man kann 10 min einfach stehen bleiben und gewinnt immer noch, im Gegenzug wenn man gut f&#xE4;hrt kleben sie an einem. Wenn man als Crew Fraktionsrennen f&#xE4;hrt wirkt sich das katastrophal auf den Spielspa&#xDF; aus. Da es immer nur einer schafft sich an der Spitze zu halten und die anderen werden st&#xE4;ndig von der KI von der Stecke &#x201E;geschossen&#x201C;.  KI beschleunigt mit Performance Ausstattung auf Schotter, Gras usw.  zerst&#xF6;rbare Umgebung beeintr&#xE4;chtigt sie &#xFC;berhaupt nicht. Wenn man mal Mist baut wartet die KI sogar in manchen F&#xE4;llen oder f&#xE4;hrt in einer  Kurve gerad aus.
<br>Polizeiautos halten sich noch nicht einmal an physikalische Gesetze.
<br>Die Liste ist unendlich&#x2026;.
<br>
<br>NPC Verkehr ist viel zu sp&#xE4;t sichtbar. Autos entstehen direkt vor einem.
<br>
<br>Bei den Tuningteilen ist es schon auff&#xE4;llig das man zu etwa 90% entweder Grip- oder Bremsbonus bekommt (mit weiteren Spielern abgeglichen), soll wohl die Spielzeit verl&#xE4;ngern.
<br>
<br>Mehr negatives m&#xF6;chte ich nicht mehr aufz&#xE4;hlen.
<br>
<br>PvP Events
<br>Allgemein ist zu sagen, wenn sich einmal eine Lobby &#xF6;ffnet, die Rennen relativ stabil laufen. Wenn man von einigen Rucklern und hin und her springenden gegnerischen Spielern absieht.
<br>Bei Fraktion gegen Fraktion hat es bei mir bis jetzt immer &#xFC;ber eine Stunde gedauert bis sich eine Lobby &#xF6;ffnete. Im Frei f&#xFC;r alle Modus sieht es etwas besser aus da wartete ich &#x201E;nur&#x201C; 10 bis 20 Minuten.
<br>
<br>Positiv ist das es sehr viel Spa&#xDF; macht mit Freunden durch die Gegend zu cruisen.
<br>
<br>The Crew ist meiner Meinung nach zu fr&#xFC;h auf den Markt geworfen worden und hat bestenfalls zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt den Status einer Beta.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4810617">Expand</a></span>

<br>The world is big

There are several types of cars to choose from.

Cons:
Mediocre and somehow blurry graphics. Wild Run fixes it but then it is a paid DLC
Cities does not look iconic at all, and most environments look generic.
Landmarks are unremarkable for most of the time.

<br>The world is big

<br>There are several types of cars to choose from.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Mediocre and somehow blurry graphics. Wild Run fixes it but then it is a paid DLC
<br>Cities does not look iconic at all, and most environments look generic.
<br>Landmarks are unremarkable for most of the time.
<br>Slow progression.
<br>Awful story, which does not really revolve around having a close crew, or cars themselves. It is a stupid revenge story with terrible dialogue.
<br>Sloppy gameplay and handling.The drifting in particular, is difficult.
<br>Frustrating AI
<br>Ridiculous physics
<br>Everything is connected by Uplay
<br>Online functions are shallow. It does not feel important at all.
<br>One you make a mistake in a race, there is no fixing. You are going to play the same race again and again and again till eternity
<br>Cutscenes that you can&apos;t skip at the beginning of some races
<br>Cars do not feel that different
<br>Glitchy wildlife and pedestrians
<br>Pointless radio towers. This works in AC and FC but not in a racing game.
<br>Loading times can be long sometimes
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>I don&apos;t know how Reflections manage to mess this up, since they have decades of experience making games, but most core aspects of the game: graphics, gameplay, story, handling, online functions are below average. You will have fun, if you like doing road trip in a video game, because driving around is still fun, and  very relaxing, but if you want to complete missions, or simply wanted to race, this is definitely not your choice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=6703646">Expand</a></span>

The vehicles handle like Watch_Dogs, the damage engine isn&apos;t that great, and the graphics don&apos;t look next gen. Story and voice actors are a bit cliche if not douchey.</span>

Are these bugs game breaking in any way? no, they most definitely aren&apos;t!
<br>I spent about 15 hours in game approx and I have had to crash my game once because of a mission load bug while I was in a crew.
<br>The missions are a LOT of fun and the events (or skills, or whatever they&apos;re called) in the open world are very well implemented, for example one could mention the fact that they actually took the time to make each event work on both ways to make sure that you get the best experience possible. (of course not the jump ones as those ones are quite specific).
<br>The story is a bit cliched but I wasn&apos;t expecting anything great.
<br>Honestly the single player for this game is nearly flawless. It really is.
<br>
<br>The problems start with the multiplayer aspect of the game with huge problems in terms of connection stability. I have been able to make friends and hook up with crews online though, the problems are mostly linked to the open world 7 player system. This system is fundamentally stupid and broken.
<br>First of all I think 10 would have been a much more appropriate number (or maybe even 15?) as actually meeting someone else on the road is rare and only lasts half a second until you take the next turn.
<br>You can invite people from your session into events but its rare for that system to actually work, it wont work if the person is already doing a mission (which makes sense) but it also wont work with people on the map for some obscure reason I cant really explain.
<br>I didn&apos;t try any faction missions yet because they seem to be very long. I&apos;m about level 25. So I already have my Dirt and Perf specs. Ill be honest, outside of real urban racing where I might prefer the P, the street spec is definitely way better than the two others. It may not go as fast, but it&apos;s the only one that&apos;s actually controllable. Dirt is so slippery it&apos;s scary and Perf just goes so fast, you cant make any 90 degree turn without slowing down to about 60km/h first. Whereas with my street spec I stay at &gt;110 at all times even in tight turns.
<br>
<br>So yeah, I don&apos;t think the game is perfect but it DEFINITELY deserves some praise for trying to do something a bit special. The world is quite beautiful and the game is well optimised, I have not had any FPS drops on ultra with my 870m (so desktop standards approx 660) and like I said in 15 hours, the game crashed once and it wasn&apos;t even on single player.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s good fun but it still needs a few patches made to multiplayer elements.
<br>I played this game with a mouse and keyboard, so I didn&apos;t really get the controller or wheel feel about it. Also, Im not a big fan of racing games so apart from the dirt cars being too slippery, I don&apos;t really know what to say about actual physics. The street racing spec feels right and it does give a sense of badassery to whiz past the cars on the high way by slaloming through them and then go for some drifts and pack up combos. Then again, there are some bugs on overtake counting, I am under the impression that only one car out of two that I overtake is counted. The game also stops overtaking when I am in the opposite lane.
<br>
<br>Anyway, all in all, this game is addictive and fun. its maybe not made for pure racing players but more the casual gamer who wants to have a bit of fun without it being too competitive and serious :)
<br>
<br>I gave it an 8 on metacritic but I think it deserves around 7.5, I could&apos;ve rounded down to 7 but I think that the reviews here are a bit too harsh so I decided to round to 8 instead.
<br>
<br>Proof of purchase -&gt; my name on Uplay is AllexioRigins (because Allexio was already taken), my games should be public.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4799150">Expand</a></span>

Season Pass is nothing more than just a prepaid of cars that will be added in the future update, etc etc etc. The game&apos;s only unique feature - is &quot;whole&quot; USA :) LoL, not that whole as you could see. I bet that in a year the game will be given out for free, damn - it&apos;s already is, but now it&apos;s masked as &quot;apologize offer&quot; :)
<br>
<br>This games is nothing, I repeat NOTHING but a replica of NFS The World, but also a very bad replica I must admit. In NFSTW you can control your car, in The Crew - you are driving bricks sliding on oil.
<br>The graphics suck deeply, the game can and should be better, but nope - it looks like a game from 2007, the year when the dev company was created.
<br>Patches, patches, patches - funk yeah! Welcome to the Ubi world, the worst publisher ever, I think this year they&apos;ve beaten the record, earlier only EA was such a looser.
<br>Servers are down - sure, all the time, why not? Can&apos;t log in? Sure. Eternal loading? Sure. Tell me why the hell there were so many betas and they ARE NOT prepared? :) LoL, nice eye-washing technique, Ubi, way-to-not-go!
<br>
<br>I am happy I was smart enough not to buy the game, as I knew it would suck, the betas never showed a thing that would attract me, and, unfortunately, thx to my friend who bought this **** and now tearing his hair off his head :) Due to his purchase I was able to have the review of the &quot;final&quot; release of The Crew :)
<br>
<br>It sucks = 1. Farewell.
<br>
<br>PS. IT has never participated in the development of TDU2, that&apos;s why the game is much more better, a way much more better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4791008">Expand</a></span>

Forget NFS Most Wanted, forget Test Drive Unlimited. This is much worse. It has absolutely no consistency with all the cars and all the specs and you can try with any setting: the car just bounce all around with that stretchy steering I can&apos;t suffer, ruining all the game experience. That&apos;s the worst part in terms of gameplay to me. The rest is just tons of more-of-the-same missions like all the games of this genre we&apos;ve already seen in years with the usual end-game based on farming even more of the same.
<br>
<br>The storyline has a nice concept bur a ridiculous development: no details, no continuity, no characterization: definitely deep as a 8 year old baby made plot. It&apos;s just an excuse to keep you driving as long as you can sustain.
<br>
<br>Pros: huge map, but with poor traffic, and the aesthetic tuning part. That&apos;s all. Considering all the hype and the &quot;next-gen&quot; promises in a 2/10 for me. 50&#x20AC; thrown in the toilet would have been more satisfying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4787607">Expand</a></span>

<br>A vehicle game with unbelievably silly unrealistic physics is not a vehicle game at all and has no value.</span>

How are you going to communicate and invite other people into playing races with you? It&apos;s all random.And there is a limit of 8 people you can see in the world.And they call this an MMO.Right.It&apos;s co-op at best.

<br>
<br>Today it came out - I bought it.
<br>
<br>The last month I&apos;ve played Testdrive Unlimited 2 again, to warm up for The Crew.
<br>
<br>All I can say is. I&apos;ve been more happy with TDU2 , better gameplay, graphics .. well everything seems better than The Crew.
<br>
<br>Another overhyped Ubisoft game title.</span>

<br>The world is massive but 90% of the world is just farm lands / crops.
<br>
<br>And of course the story line is total rubbish from some C grade movie.</span>

<br>
<br>Leaving the main road I coast around discarded drums and the piles of rubble picking my way through the abandoned redbrick site.  The lights of the car moodily casting shadows into the interior where boards are missing or walls collapsed.
<br>
<br>Just then I round the corner into a graveyard and I come to a stop.  I didn&apos;t expect this.  I&apos;m feeling things.
<br>
<br>I look back through the graveyard, through the broken buildings, and far away I can see the remaining towers of the Brewster housing projects standing completely abandoned, a place where people like Diana Ross grew up, the kind of project that serves as the go-to archetype for any ghetto cliche.  I wonder at how, in the 1950&apos;s, the creators of these monoliths imagined them, how they were as they stood in their lifetime, how brief that lifetime was compared to all these years standing as ghosts, eerie.  As one person put it; &quot;places I had known my whole life, but that had never known me&quot;.  Most people alive here now never knew these buildings as they were intended.  Soon they will be gone completely.
<br>
<br>I slip my shifter to first and let the clutch up with a satisfying mix of ingame and out-of-game sounds.  Over the low purr of the engine I hear the ambient, sorrowful music of the 24 hour ambient radio station &quot;sine waves&quot;.
<br>I feel like Stalker, peering out across the Pripyat skyline, wearing the dashboard and interior of the car like a claustrophobic gas-mask.
<br>
<br>Earlier I&apos;d watched the people of this ersatz town going about their daily grinds as I sped up and down the 8 mile.  These bizarre insects struggling over each other, that too had been oddly moving in a way.  I&apos;d placed myself like a barricade in their path - but they just pushed me aside, swore and went around.  How separate I feel to them as I head towards the intersection and back towards Central Detroit.  That discord, that feeling pretty much evokes the real world to me, or at least the worst of the cities I&apos;ve lived in.
<br>
<br>But as I approach the intersection, towards the big floating mission marker I am jolted into Ubisoft&apos;s reality.  I can no longer move the camera, a mandatory accept or decline screen appears.  I release the controls to find the enter key, or to click with the mouse..  Then, once accepted: &quot;Surprise!&quot; birthday balloon animals floating in the air.  Instructions and numbers fill the screen.  Time limits, medals, ghost cars and incremental improvements and &apos;EXP&apos;.
<br>Now the game designer has me drive through targets, crashing through the world I was enjoying so carefully observing moments before.  An abstracted world that uses the game-world as wallpaper and apparently likes to throw food at parties.
<br>
<br>I finish this fairground attraction, there is another mandatory accept/decline screen, but the gameworld is still live and unpaused in the background.  Reaching for the mouse to accept confusing options about incremental upgrades of different colours I rear-end a car at the lights.  The car sits a little oddly now, but continues waiting for the lights to change.  There is no consequence, no one gets out  or calls the cops, and my car is perfectly fine, not even visual damage.  I sit too now, cursing the game for making me behave so out of my own character.  Then, with something *anything* clicked and the menu finally gone the screen fades and inexplicably comes back up.  My car is in a similar but not quite the same location to as it was before.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s over.  And it feels like I&apos;ve just been mugged, or taken advantage of.  Like a nighttime stroll that went bad.  I feel like I want a shower to wash away the stain of the balloon animal nonsense.  I look at the world and try to see it how I did a moment before, the industrial wasteground, the locational storytelling.  But instead I see an npc, an office everyman, walking into a wall like a fly trying to escape a glass window.  I just sit thinking about what&apos;s next.  How am I going to meet this game halfway and make a fist of it?
<br>
<br>Perhaps my character is insane?
<br>
<br>This is a game where I have more control over the cars look than my own.  I know I am &quot;wearing&quot; a Challenger SRT in black.  So perhaps I am the car, perhaps I am a dormant sorrowful Transformer robot trapped in car form.  I&apos;m certainly not the occupant, Alex is it?, the person in the Fast and Furious cutscenes that I have to watch sometimes whenever I approach the terrible glowing orbs that tell me a fade out is about to happen and I&apos;m about to see things that never happen in the gameworld ever, which will, nevertheless, occur in a cutscene that is passed off as being part of the world.
<br>
<br>So what is this game?  What is left?
<br>It&apos;s as tender as a first kiss outside a club in the rain - shortly before a car tries to run you over for standing in the wrong spot.  Where cutscenes presume who you are and how you behave, in a world that allows you freedom yet doesn&apos;t count it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4793490">Expand</a></span>

I would&apos;ve rated their game higher if the missions would be more enjoyable and the gameplay would be more smooth. Also if you were trying to race beware because if you a pedestrian car it will most likely Wreck you and you and you will spin out and automatically lose the race.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4883656">Expand</a></span>

<br>Since I&apos;m old fart i remember the golden era of arcade machines. One of best game for me from that time was game outrun. And than i launched this and bam, its new outrun for me :). Story is meh, handling is ARCADE style, so if you expected simulation look elsewhere. But if you loved outrun for example, you&apos;ll love this too. Graphic is not top notch, but is very beautiful, and it really goes easy on graphic card so much kudos here. Sound, yeah, it could be better, but its not gamebreakingly bad. Best asset is hugeness of the map, never saw a game with this much content. You can just cruise around looking at scenery for hours and not get bored. Diversity of cars is not great, but is good since many cars can be fixed to several specs, and they look pretty different with different specs. Progression is also kinda arcade style, most of your car power comes from upgrades, not the cars itself, and you collect those by racing (i look at that like item drops in wow). All in all, hours of fun for me
<br>So, i get it that this game is not for everyone. If you&apos;re old enough to remember outrun you will love this. If you love NFS, chances are that you will love this too. If you love simulation, well, this is not for you sorry. I would give this game 8-8.5 but since it really don&apos;t deserve this low mark, I will give it 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4960489">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unfortunately there&apos;s a few negative aspects about the game.
<br>-There&apos;s various technical issues (I currently have an issue with textures not loading properly, which makes some Faction missions impossible for me to do and I also had some issues with my gamepad, but I managed to fix it);
<br>-The story missions are quite boring and repetitive;
<br>-The UI it&apos;s can be difficult to get used to;
<br>-Microtransactions;
<br>-Uplay.
<br>(Some people say that are having connection problems but, thankfully, I never had one.)
<br>
<br>But overall, it&apos;s a good game, if you&apos;re into racing games, and it&apos;s getting even better since the developers are still supporting the game and releasing new content. Definitely worth a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=6635548">Expand</a></span>

<br>I have completed the story
<br>I have played extensively in the PvP
<br>I am max level
<br>My cars are all max level or close to it.
<br>In short, I have played the game a lot.
<br>
<br>First of all I am rating the game, not the game servers or game bugs.  Disconnects because of server issues and crashes because of bug have been the most ridiculous that I have ever experienced.  I do not rate games based on this, because these things will be fixed as time goes on.  Saying that, let&apos;s get down to &quot;brass tax&quot;. Shall we?
<br>
<br>Graphics (10): Typically, MMO&apos;s must sacrifice a lot on the graphical side of things so, that players can have smooth gameplay.  Although, the graphics quality is not the best I&apos;ve seen, it is still better than any MMO I have ever played.
<br>
<br>Driving/Gameplay (7):  The developers tried there best to simulate a real life feel.  Overall, they did a good job.  You can feel the differences in each car and each spec of a car.  For instance, when driving a &quot;Raid&quot; spec vehicle (a jacked up off-road heavy vehicle), you can feel the sway of the suspension as you turn and the grip of the mud tires as you punch the accelerator.   In a &quot;Circuit&quot; spec car, you feel like you are gliding at 1 billion MPH 1 inch off the road.  One downfall to the gameplay, is how some objects or pieces of the environment effect your car when you collide with them.  For example, if you hit an NPC car or tree anywhere but dead center, you are going to slide to the side without slowing down hardly at all.  Rocks.....OMG......rocks.  Do not hit a rock in this game.  Driving over a rock in this game is the equivalent of driving over a landmine in real life.  Wooden fences and such slow your car down WAY too much when you hit them.  For those of you that have rated the handling bad, you should look at your controller/wheel settings.  this game is not compatible with every controller type &amp; controller setup.  Example: My roommate tried to play with a PS3 controller, and the driving was so bad that the game was unplayable.  He was ready to call Ubisoft and ask for a refund when I insisted that he try the game with my Xbox 360 controller.  That day he bought a 360 controller and fell in love with the game.
<br>
<br>Game Modes/Races/Missions (10)  There is plenty of a variety of things to do in this game.  Story Missions can be done solo and coop.  PvP can be faction vs faction or free for all.  There are about 10 different skill challenges such as jumps, speed challenges, hill climbs, etc...  There are dozens of each of those skill challenges scattered all over the map.  There are faction races that last upwards to 1 Hour.  There are also a handful of 2.5H races that I have yet to had the gonads to try.
<br>
<br>Longevity &amp; Replay Value (5):  Unfortunately, you will complete the story quickly and around the same time hit lv 50 (max level).  It will still take you a while to buy and max out all of the cars you want, but that gets aggravating some times because you have to play challenges over and over to get the gear you want.
<br>
<br>PvP (6) Although the PvP races are fun, that is all they are....races.  There is no other game type.  I was hoping for a &quot;tag&quot;, &quot;hide and seek&quot;, &quot;smear the qu**r&quot;, or something like that, but all we get is races.  There are leaderboards for everything, that are accessible at the end of every race or from the menu.  You can watch the &quot;ghost&quot; of any other player on the leaderboard complete an event, so you can try to do what they did, but better.
<br>
<br>Conclusion - The graphics are better than any other MMO.  The story is intriguing and exciting.  There are plenty of game modes, but you wont be getting 1000s of hours out of this MMO.  You will, however, get a solid 100 hours before you start feeling the grind.  Overall, I have enjoyed the game.  If you can deal with a few bugs and many disconnects, I recommend you buy the game now and have some fun.  However, If you are one of those people that gave Skyrim a bad rating because of bugs and game freezes, then wait till the devs have solved some of the issues before buying this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4802398">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played Midnight Club before and THAT gets annoying but this game... It just pisses me off.
<br>
<br>Although the map is huge in this game it is so BORING! There is absolutely nothing to look at besides VERY flat hills and the obviously copied and pasted trees/foliage along the way. The maps need to look more natural and have a lot more trees and bushes.
<br>
<br>The mechanics and physics in this game are pretty bad. Hitting cars or trees often times just bounces you off of them like a bumper car. Objects you collide with don&apos;t leave appropriate dents, marks, scratches, etc. I really regret purchasing this game and UNFORTUNATELY once it&apos;s registered you can&apos;t return it as far as I know.
<br>
<br>AI is also bad. Vehicles don&apos;t turn smoothly, they jerk around corners. This is the 21st century. Ubisoft acts as if this is their first line of games released. I&apos;m glad to know that they are doing everything right now to fix these games BUT they REALLY needed to push these projects back further.
<br>
<br>In my opinion, I would wait to purchase this game until it is patched a little.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4816588">Expand</a></span>

As of December 2014 don&apos;t bother buying it, The Crew is broken in so many ways, You can never imagine. Or maybe You could if You were playing some other Ubisoft games recently, but that&apos;s not the point.
<br>
<br>The scenery is really great, even though the graphics are not as good as they should be, especially considering the performance of the game, and if You like just cruising through the big, open map, You won&apos;t be disappointed.
<br>
<br>The problem is: the previous sentence is the only thing good in this game as for now. Even though it&apos;s an arcade style game, the handling is at best &quot;controversial&quot;. And even that I could live with , but what I absolutely cannot bare is the rubber banding. You&apos;ll see this term a lot when reading about The Crew, and it only shows how big of a problem it is. Don&apos;t get me wrong: I do like challenge, and I do think it&apos;s bad if a game let&apos;s you &quot;one shot&quot; everything. As long as the challenge is fair. And here we go: The Crew doesn&apos;t even try to pretend that it is fair. It&apos;s difficulty is not based on the real skill of the AI drivers obeying the same rules as the player, which would&apos;ve been fine, instead it&apos;s a scripted mess of unreal catching up, cars that defy every law of physics that&apos;s available, indestructible police, and unreal pacing that forces You to always be on the edge of loosing, no matter how good or bad You are as a driver.
<br>
<br>Yeah, some might say: &quot;but You can beat the game, just try harder&quot;, and they&apos;d be absolutely right: You can. But what&apos;s the point in beating the unreal script? Really there&apos;s no joy, or pride in winning in The Crew by figuring out where are the holes in the script and exploiting them.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s the main complaint about the game: it doesn&apos;t even try looking real.
<br>
<br>Verdict for me: absolutely DO NOT BUY NOW. Wait. At least wait until the major bugs are fixed, and then maybe think again. You won&apos;t miss much, at best You could call it a late beta version, with still much to fix. And when it gets fixed probably it&apos;s gonna be discounted on the steam sale. Just not now, You won&apos;t enjoy it anyway.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4802794">Expand</a></span>

I like the gameplay and the customization that you can have in the game. The story is decent but not boring. Ofcourse there is Uplay but i still enjoyed the game and if you&apos;re looking for a racing game that gives you a new sort of gameplay, try The Crew. It&apos;s worth the money.</span>

                                        <span>This game is one the best AAA games I have played this year so far. It&apos;s a huge improvement of originals TDU and Eden made a big work for this to be done. I played more than 30 hours in 2 days. Driving in the whole USA is like a dream. A very pleasant dream. And, to put an over to a false fact : The Crew is not slowish. At level 50/1200+ cap in a circuit car, you will be fast. Very fast !</span>

The Graphics aren&apos;t overly new and anything fantastic but the huge map is full of beautiful scenery. It combines the MMO style with the racing genre better than some others. The challenges put around the maps adds that extra challenge to the long journeys between places. Overall a very enjoyable game.</span>

Even the story is kind of decent for a racing game! Highly recommend it! Watch the game on Twitch, people there love it as well. I highly doubt most people here bashing the game did even play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4796390">Expand</a></span>

Yes, the cutscenes were cheesy. Yes, the race schools were difficultly annoying. And, yes, a lot of the missions were ridiculous. But... driving around the open world and taking in the sights kept me coming back again and again. I only stopped playing TDU2 when The Crew launched.
<br>
<br>The Crew is very much the spiratual successor to the short-lived TDU series. The cheesy cutscenes are back (albeit with less cheese and more cliche). The annoying racing challenges to progress the story are back. And exploration of a large, beautiful open world is back.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re going to get this game, get it primarily for the open world exploration. As you&apos;ve heard, the map is HUGE. There is so much to see and the game is structured so that you&apos;ll need to see it all if you plan on getting all the collectibles. Along the way, from Point A to Point B, you&apos;ll encounter racing challenges, car parts and vistas that give their own rewards. However, in my mind, the real reward is simply driving the open world, taking in the sights and getting an appreciation for the work that Ivory Tower has put into this game.
<br>
<br>The racing is mediocre. The range of cars is limited (expect several DLC packs with additional cars). And the car handling takes some getting used to (I spent a lot of time mucking about with my wheel settings). It&apos;s cool seeing other drivers around you and there are lots of opportunities to team up. Just don&apos;t expect a high-end racing game with realistic physics and damage simulation.
<br>
<br>I should add that The Crew has online DRM. Unlike TDU2, if the servers go down, there&apos;s no offline mode to play. That was an issue on launch day and I cringe at the thought of it happening again.
<br>
<br>Overall, The Crew is a thoroughly enjoyable exploration game. Get it because you love to drive, not because you love cars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4791103">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>BAD: number of car models, random bugs (hit a tree still stupid), no mirrors
<br>
<br>i test this game whit Logitech Drivng Force GT and it&apos;s simply amazing.
<br>
<br>With some modifications, like a free tuning mode (for paintjobs), this game will be almost perfect</span>

The physics are nor good nor bad. It&apos;s not like a racing sim, but it shouldn&apos;t also be that way. If you and your friends are looking for a racing game just to have some fun, buy it. You also don&apos;t need a really good graphic card, a plus for some people!</span>

<br>
<br>For the Interested, here is the Pros/Mids/Cons of the game.
<br>
<br>PROS+
<br>+ Racing coop (up to 4 player max per mission or pvp game)
<br>+ Very detailed environment (Working NPC&apos;s, a lot of Wilflife and alot of map details)
<br>+ Better graphics than Test Drive Unlimited 2
<br>+ Detailed leaderboards and statistics for everything
<br>+ Good car handling and controls (with a few exceptions since its a NFS styled game)
<br>+ Polices Forces that can chases you almost evrywhere. (give challenge somtimes)
<br>+ Open world where you can drive wherever you want (Even discover some easter eggs in the world)
<br>+ Good transition between game cin&#xE9;matics and gamplay (So you fell like you gived control of it after mission movies.)
<br>+ Posibility to send your friend do faction missions for you. (so you can save time instead of doing a 2h mission for a bit more of easy game money)
<br>+ 50 Cars for first release batch (Witch is not bad for a game that features quite detailed car interiors)
<br>+ Offers car customisation such as pre-fab vynils/stickers, Rims, Spoilers and some chasis mods. ( Alot more visual customisation to offer compared to TDU2)
<br>+ Day and Night Cycle System
<br>
<br>MIDS~
<br>~ Servers are down for maintenance sometimes. (yes it can happen, its an online game)
<br>~ Uplay Launcher (at least i can be used / merged whit steam tho)
<br>~ Storymode is a bit short. (but is still entertaining to watch)
<br>~ Missing Mirrors Animations for Cockpit view in some Cars. (they already working on it already for next patch )
<br>~ Weather conditions changes only when you go the mountains where there is snow (they might could use a bit rain but its not that bad)
<br>~ Can have unblanced AI (depending if you and your crew have to high level gap)
<br>
<br>CONS-
<br>- No offline mode (you need a internet connection to play this game)
<br>- No possibility to add your own Music (but you can customise your playlist atleast)
<br>- Microtransactions
<br>
<br>So as so far for the rest for the game and the gamplay itself, the pleasure of free roaming those cars with friends is pretty Neat, if your one of thos players who dislike this game, just go back to driveclub or what so ever other racing sim game you were playing, otherwise if your looking for car tunning, driving everywhere from road to montains, and like fast paced races for the fun of playing it, this game i what you are looking for !
<br>
<br>All together i would say, &quot;The Crew&quot; is a cool game to play for cruising around with Friends or even to play alone i would say, sure the game have some bugs and have a litle lack on MMO since its more concentrated on the NFS genre gamplay but is worth the price when we know they will comme up whit more !
<br>
<br>(10 thumbs up)
<br>
<br>Continue the good work Ubi we know that you can do it and update this until perfection as other titles did before !!
<br>(Afterall They made Driver San Fransico witch was a great &amp; fun game so why not the crew !)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4808316">Expand</a></span>

The first types of cars are a bit slow, but when reaching level 20, you can have pretty fast cars or just &quot;update&quot; your first car and the fun is here. The map is really big and diversified, big cities, little towns, farmlands, swamps, deserts, mountains ... summary all the biomes of the United States, the only bad point is the police ...The cops are really OP until you can flee on offroad or until you have faster cars and getting rid of them is hard without luck.

Ubisoft really took a chance trying to bridge the gap between the tuner (Forza and Gran Turismo) crowd and the more arcade (Need for Speed and Burnout) crowd and give them the best of both worlds. For the most part the succeeded. I loved the seemingly endless customization options for each car, and figuring out the best way to get that new upgrade I so desperately needed had me coming back for more despite the issues mentioned above. If they can keep turning out content in a timely fashion that isn&#x2019;t just money grabbing DLC, they could have a huge hit on their hands. This is the best open world driving experience currently available. Period. They have some tweaking and fine tuning to do to certain mechanics, but they&#x2019;re off to a great start.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4794027">Expand</a></span>

As my last racing game was NFS Most Wanted from 2005 I&apos;m realy impressed about todays games and technics. I love the huge open world and the living environment. Always on isn&apos;t the prob for me because the world feels more alive with other players around you. So don&apos;t believe the pro haters to much and give it a chance.</span>

<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve enjoyed Test Drive, the sceneries, the driving, the cars, the freedom, welcome to The Crew!
<br>
<br>Beware of Evolutions! First, forget the bling-bling and collection of gleaming cars, the aim and your weapon of competition of the game is the tuning and upgrading of your precious, or your few preciouses all along the progression of this Fast and Furious-like racing MORPG!
<br>
<br>And BEWARE!!! Streets, towns, countrysides, mountains, deserts are ALIVE and swarming with animation! Cars, pedestrians, an extremely varied wildlife will brighten up and add spice to your driving experience!
<br>
<br>And this is NOT advertising but the feedback of a passionate of the game and big supporter of the crew behind The Crew, Ivory Tower.
<br>
<br>Well of course, the game is at it&apos;s beginning and there is still a lot to do and deploy to polish  it&apos;s promised splendour. As it is an on-line only game, there are some issues that need to be corrected nevertheless the launch was for now a success compared to the launch of other Ubisoft or other racing games lately.
<br>
<br>AND we have a dev team dedicated to their baby (with not to forget no less than 7 hard years of work  developing it hidden in their Ivory Tower) and open minded, listening to the community (they proved it, taking into account the critics and suggestions of the beta testers community) and working day and night to make their dream came truth  running day after day.
<br>
<br>Stephane Beley, Director of the Game promised us AT LEAST one year of daily, weekly and monthly adds on, challenges, DLC&apos;s (paying and for free), and more if the community asks and follow the game!
<br>
<br>By the way, you&apos;ll need to come up to level 20 to begin to handle the true potential of the game and Level 50 (the top level) is only the beginning of the freedom throughout the amazing reproduction of the huge USA territory of The Crew!
<br>
<br>An open world massively multi-player racing game that I hotly recommend !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4810673">Expand</a></span>

<br>Good selection of vehicles and a wide range of terrain and scenery give this game quite a bit of life.

Huge, detailed, drivable map of North America. A really solid story with great cutscenes. Great cars, detailed customisation options, multiple racing disciplines, cockpit view, great sounding engines, tough cop chases. What more could you ask for? The Crew takes racing fans back to their roots and satisfies pretty much everything we&apos;ve been missing. The online experience is amazing. You can hook up with online players and take on missions together in co-op mode. The single player and online multiplayer experience is seamless. Play it your way. Single player all the way, as a crew or a bit of both.
<br>
<br>I picked up one major glitch during one of the races where all the cars hit an invisible wall and all our front wheels starting lifting off the ground. That was about it. After 24 hours of gameplay, only a few glitches and AI issues picked up, but acceptable. I am loving it and strongly recommend that you buy it. It is worth every cent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4992408">Expand</a></span>

You can drive around the U.S. in a highly extensive, although I cannot give weather or not it&apos;s an accurate presentation since I&apos;m not American. The story mode has a great storyline, but nothing we haven&apos;t seen before, but it still leaves you wondering what&apos;s coming next. A shortfall is repetition, where the person who gives the mission tells you to simply do one of these 3 things:
<br>1. Race
<br>2. &quot;Collect&quot; Crates (which you actually run into with your car)
<br>3. Ram into another car to take it down
<br>Another con is that, you start with a car, which you upgrade throughout the game, but most good cars are either outrageously expensive, or require to spend real money. If you get a weak car, you must keep levelling it up and upgrading it to different specs like dirt and street which cost MORE money. Till then, they cannot be used in missions since most of them require an upgraded spec., making it a bit more tedious. Also, once story mode is finished, all you can do is replay missions, do faction PVPs, drive around the U.S. and buy more cars, or quit since there isn&apos;t much else to do.

<br>It&apos;s an 8 or 8.5, but because of all the negative troll ratings I give it a 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=6709343">Expand</a></span>

Bisogna dire che io ci ho giocato solo nel 2017 ed ha subito tanti aggiornamenti e alcuni (Wild Run) lo hanno completamente stravolto, quindi il gioco di adesso non &#xE9; sicuramente nello stato in cui era al rilascio. La prima cosa che mi ha lasciato a bocca aperta &#xE9; la mappa. Si hanno a disposizione tutti gli USA (ovviamente in scala), ma il livello di cura &#xE9; veramente altissimo. Visitare nuove citt&#xE1; come New York, Las Vegas, Detroit, &#xE9; semplicemente fantastico. Il senso di libert&#xE1; che ti da questo gioco &#xE9; veramente altissimo. Giocare con un amico &#xE9; relativamente facile, anche se a volte l&apos;auto del nostro compagno pu&#xF3; scomparire nel nulla per poi ritornare per magia a caso. A livello di gestione dell&apos;online infatti direi che ha i suoi pi&#xFA; grossi difetti, che comunque a me personalmente non mi hanno mai impedito di giocare con un mio amico e divertirmi. Il parco macchine &#xE9; molto buono, ci sono tanti veicoli disponibili e molto diversi tra loro (ci sono anche le moto, i SUV, le supercar, hypercar, auto comuni, ...) e le gare si dividono in varie categorie (categoria off road, tuner, pista, raid, ...) . Comprando 1 volta una macchina (ad esempio una Skyline) si possono comprare poi i vari kit e scambiarli ogni volta a seconda della gara che ci aspetta. L&apos;economia di gioco nelle prime ore di gioco &#xE9; molto severa e probabilmente spinge all&apos;acquisto in-game di contenuti aggiuntivi, cosa che mi ha scocciato abbastanza in quanto non siamo di fronte ad un freetoplay. Le possibilit&#xE1; di modificare le proprie auto sono tantissime e si possono cambiare anche gli interni, le minigonne, i fanali , come su need for speed! Ogni tanto girando a caso per la mappa (assolutamente gigantesca) si incontrano delle mini-sfide che permettono di fare punti e sbloccare nuove parti per la nostra auto, rendendo i viaggi mai noiosi. Anche tutto il resto della componente online &#xE9; studiato veramente bene, ci sono un sacco di modalit&#xE1; per il PvP e il sistema a fazioni (ogni fazione corrisponde ad un animale) fa si che grosse quantit&#xE1; di giocatori collaborino assieme per concludere delle missioni (missioni di fazione) e fare punti per poter superare le altre fazioni. Nel complesso un gioco ricchissimi di contenuti, originale, con un&apos;ottimo comparto tecnico (musiche e grafica) ma afflitto da qualche problemino con l&apos;online e una politica di acquisti in-game poco appropriata. In ogni caso assolutamente consigliato a tutti gli amanti dei giochi di guida</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=7421050">Expand</a></span>

<br>And now let&apos;s talk about the game. The real thing to understand here is that you have to play online with &apos;friends&apos; (uplay contacts) to feel the beast. You have to play faction missions online to get the thrill. This game is made to be played online.
<br>
<br>The standalone part is better than a lot of driving games I played during the last 15 years. The scenario is predictable but also good and the cutscenes are just gorgeous.
<br>
<br>This game is definitely more simulation than arcade style playing but it is still a mix between the two. You don&apos;t have to be a pro driver to handle the cars but, in towns, you have to avoid the sidewalks if you don&apos;t want to see your rides crash in the buildings. The physics are okay, you have to pay attention to the center of inertia if you wish not to play with barriers at every bend. You even have to handle the &quot;exterior, interior, exterior&quot; handling at every single bend. Zigzags also have to be handled with care or you will lose the perfect trajectory and, with that, precious seconds ...
<br>
<br>The map is huge and there are races which can last 4 complete hours? Yes 4 HOURS ! Of course, there are also a lot of very short races, so you can play casual if you need your daily 10 minutes fix :)
<br>
<br>The &apos;challenges missions&apos; are well thought, not very diversified.but always challenging. And there are &apos;ghosts&apos; that you can download to try to beat the bests players and see how they did to perform so well.
<br>
<br>Interior camera is also a very enjoyable feature if you wish to immerse yourself a bit more in the game. But the graphics in this section are not very good and the rear-view mirrors are just not functional (they do not reflect anything at all !)
<br>
<br>IMO, this is a very, very good start for this new franchise !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-crew/user-reviews?user_review_id=4817257">Expand</a></span>
