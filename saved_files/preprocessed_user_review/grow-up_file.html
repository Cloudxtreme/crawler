<br>
<br>I am incredibly happy to say that not only did it exceed my expectations, but it also overtook my enormous love for the first.
<br>
<br>This is quite possibly one of the best sandbox game/physic simulator I have ever played.
<br>
<br>The music, the atmosphere, the collecting, the exploring, the creative thinking used to get to the next platform, the smart implementation of physics, and that absolutely fantastic abilities all come together to make one of the best games I&apos;ve ever played.
<br>
<br>Highly recommended to anyone who wants to relax but still have fun, or just wants to mess around with some incredible physics.
