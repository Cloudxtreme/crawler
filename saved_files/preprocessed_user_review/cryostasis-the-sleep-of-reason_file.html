This sort of vacuum gave me a larger berth to overlook the glaring faults in this game and enjoy the absolutely stellar other parts.
<br>
<br>First and foremost, the environments in this game are dull and boring, and you WILL get tired of them quickly.
<br>
<br>Do not let that stop you from playing this amazing game.
<br>
<br>At full spec, the game looks good enough to make the boring environments justifiable, and they do make sense in the space of the story.
<br>
<br>And that&apos;s where this game shines- story. Compelling, addicting. You, from the first moments of the game, become desperate to figure out what has happened, and what is going on. It also has pretty amazing voice acting considering this is a foreign title.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is a little rough, but that&apos;s the realism of the old-school fisticuffs and bolt-action rifle work. It&apos;s slow and clunky, but you&apos;re going to be slow and clunky in -30 degrees F weather using a 50-year-old Mosin Nagant rifle, so I liked that bit.
<br>
<br>The flashback mechanic really makes the game shine. The trial-and-error element coupled with a break from the repetitive environs and horrifying enemies is a nice departure, and the game wouldn&apos;t work without it.
<br>
<br>That brings me to another point- although there aren&apos;t many kinds of them, the enemies are TERRIFYING. Never in a game have I dreaded so much fighting &quot;the enemy&quot; as I have this game. They creep me out to my core.
<br>
<br>Overall, the game has its rough points, but they&apos;re all justifiable. The artistic elements, terrifying enemies, solid voice work, compelling story, and temperature mechanics make this game shine like no other.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=3272057">Expand</a></span>

Unique weapons from a world war time period to new inventions and the story makes you think unlike other games were the story is fed to you with a silver spoon. You will fight an array of different ice zombies and boss fights, each with different tactics to defeat them, requiring you to think on your toes. Using heat as a source of health and energy is also unique, keeping you stressed about staying warm in a arctic environment. The graphics are actually quiet remarkable for a 2009 game, but at the same time they require good hardware for top settings. Only reason i am not giving this game an 10 is because the games bugs are evident and the lack of re-playability let this game down. Besides that.. A great game from a unexpected source.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=1832346">Expand</a></span>

The best scares in this game came from trying to navigate the frozen ship and hearing a door slam behind you, the howling of the wind through a broken window, or fear of dying from lack of heat. Instead the majority of the game is cluttered with clumsy, coverless firefights resulting in lots of cheap deaths. Poorly optimized graphics mean sudden single digit dips in frame rate happen often before, during, and after battles. A flashback system fleshes out a great narrative about a captain losing control of his ship with another overarching story told by a narrator with sketches that runs parrallel to the plot. Along with time travel elements and numerous trippy encounters, there was the framework for a great story and game here. With some more focus on puzzle solving and non-combat survival this could have been a great game. As it is, this is an average survival horror at best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=2822708">Expand</a></span>

The atmosphere is pretty good and the mechanics and features of the gameplay are pretty interesting. No FOV slider in menu, but enabling the console and entering r.fov X into it solves this issue. My biggest gripe is that it&apos;s the same damn thing all the time. You go into a room, kill some dudes, flashback this dude, go into another room and the cycle repeats. Add in some cutscenes and you have a game that is pretty mediocre, but not bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=2814847">Expand</a></span>

I would like to thank the team of Cryostasis for a job well done and well deserving. I bought a GTX 285 to play this game. What a perfect match! The game with the latest patch is virtually bug free. Just a minor hiccup here and there. I did have to turn off advanced physx for the final boss scene. I did leave the regular physx on though. I used 1280x720 with 2x antiliasing and it looks great on my 24&quot; monitor. The mood is perfect. I love to see sparks flying when fighting some tough little bosses. I look forward to more games from the Russians.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=733035">Expand</a></span>

Based on the critic reviews I feel that overall this game has been largely misunderstood. The biggest flaw in this game is - without argument - combat mechanics, particularly the melee combat. However, these failings in design were not enough to turn me off to the game. This game&apos;s story and the folktale that is being told concurrently tie together nicely - the game&apos;s story leads us through a modern mystery which gives us &quot;facts and details&quot; about the events that lead up to the demise of the ship&apos;s crew, while the folktale gave us a more esoteric insight into the base human emotions and fears that often - and in this case have - lead to highly irrational actions. The criticisms of the &quot;heat&quot; based health system also seems to be larger misunderstood. A standard practice in FPS games these days is to indicate you are being shot by the enemy with a red &quot;arc&quot; or &quot;blur&quot; in your line of sight; the red being meant to correlate with blood. Here, the indicators are not red blurs, but ice &quot;marks&quot; indicating that hits from the enemy are freezing you rather than physically piercing you. However this is only an indication of the overall misunderstanding. Why is it that your character is even assumed to be physically alive or moving through a frozen ship in what we would term reality? I went through this game thinking the body of my character was lying dead somewhere, either in the ship or back in the ice when the sled fell in the crevasse. It makes the bizarre enemies, traveling back in time, etc. much more plausible within the context of the story. I felt as if I was supposed to be &quot;between&quot; time, giving me this this one opportunity to change the course of events that have already occurred. And why the complaints about homogeneous environments? The entire game is played in a single location, an old rusting ship. What kind of variety do these critics expect? Comments like these justify my assertion that many game journalists lack the credentials to adequately evaluate and comment on games. Being a past employee of a videogame retailer should not be sufficient qualification for gaining employment as a critic. But I digress... Despite Cryostasis&apos;s graphical glitches and poor combat design, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and the story it presented. I hope the developer can bring other similarly creative and interesting concepts to markets beyond its Eastern European home. My score reflects the technical imperfections of the game and their impact on my impression of the game as a whole.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=733799">Expand</a></span>

Cryostasis: The Sleep of Reason is a mystery game.  Everything about the game, from graphics to lighting to monsters to cutscenes, is part of the environment that tries to tell a story.  These pieces of information scattered about are all for piecing together of the absolute most amazing tale in video game history.  Symbolism is heavy and atmosphere is so thick you can cut it with a knife.  It&apos;s not just a game, but a spiritual experience.  It shows more than any other release that games are art and a valuable storytelling medium.  Buy it, at least if you make sure your computer can run it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=1382533">Expand</a></span>

It has the basic FPS elements but intertwines a gripping and chilling (pun intended) story into a fun and scary thriller.  It boasts some great visuals, interesting characters with some great voice acting.  The weapons are simple, as they should be, since this takes place on an icebreaker in the late 60&apos;s.  The idea of using heat for health is unique and genius.  There are certain parts where the baddies scared the crap out of me.  The flaws though are few though.  The game engine is a bit clunky and slow.  The movements are unrealistic at times and can be annoying.  Switching and loading weapons is also slow and infuriating when in a pinch.  In a few instances, the mutants get stuck in corners or objects.  Lastly, the interactivity is limited as some items can&apos;t be used, picked up or moved.  Overall, it works well and is a very exciting and smart adventure.  75/100.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=1996159">Expand</a></span>

The characters are complicated and have their faults that leads to the situation they are in. They are written as imperfect human beings that can be liked despite the bad choices they may make. There is no good or evil, just people in a unfortunate situation. The past segments really had me caring for the crew and feeling sorry for the predicament they were in. It lead to me to being compelled to do a good job to save everyone. Also, it does a good job in showing how the crew was handling things and what they experienced that you could care for them despite being nameless. I wish could learn more about the generic crew members and how they felt. The story is complicated and confusing at first that can take a second play-through to piece everything together. It will make sense in the end with no loose holes in the story and a satisfying ending. To me the story is some of the best I have seen in gaming. Just for the story alone is the game worth owning.<br><br>Game play:<br>	The game is in first person where at first 1/3 of the game you will be using melee weapons until you get a firearm. I should talk about the meters on the bottom left corner of the screen. The small red meter is your health which can be recharged by being warmed up by heat. The big red meter is the heat meter which will recharge your health to high high your temperature is. The yellow bar on your meter is your stamina bar which affects how many attacks you can do in a session and how long you can run. There are not too many times where you need to run though, you can save your stamina for melee weapons or a quick doge when needed. The heavier the melee weapon, the more stamina will be used and the longer the attack animation will be. You can do combos and attack differently depending on what direction you move while attacking. Guns don&apos;t use stamina but are old, have no cross hairs, and reload slowly. You can look down the iron sites to aim accurately though. The bolt action rifles and the semi-auto rifle fire slowly, and the SMG uses a lot of ammo to kill someone. It can feel a bit sluggish when using guns though you don&apos;t have to use them often. There is a water gun you get halfway through the game if you install the patch that is quite a game breaker as it stuns the enemy while you hurt them and you can get plenty of ammo in the form of icicles.<br><br>	The game is linear with 18 chapters to complete. During the game you will come across bodies which you can jump in to change their past before they died. These segments are generally easy though you can&apos;t save in the middle of them. Some of them are difficult where you need to really pay attention in order to get through.  The monsters you face are strange and unusual with some being creepy . The atmosphere in the levels is gripping and pulls you into the creepiness of what has become of the ship and the crew. Many of the levels are long and difficult with the last 3 levels being very short. The game took me about 16 hours to complete. It never felt tedious to me and always compelled me to continue on. Graphics:<br>	The graphics in Cryostasis are amazing. On the highest setting, they are amazing with realistic water effects and ice freezing. The water flows in a realistic way when thawing that it can look real. The way the ice crumbles to pieces is neat as you see the little pieces fall part on to the ground and stay there and can be adjusted too in the ini settings. The animations for enemies look very natural and feel real and smooth that even your own fighting animations can be timed in rhythm. If you play the game with PhysX on, the graphical effects are even more amazing. PhysX didn&apos;t seem to support anything below shader 4.0 with no window mode. This game has a reputation of having some of the best graphics, comparable with Crysis on the PC. However, it has no multi-core support so it can be rough on all but the high end computers in the 3.0 ghz range<br><br>Sound:<br>	There is no music in the game and it&apos;s all atmospheric effects. This can create an uneasiness to the atmosphere when exploring the environment an helps keep you in the mood no matter what you are doing. So even combat does not ruin the horror but adds to the tension. The sound effects are great from the blowing of the wind, to the power turning on, to the swoosh of a weapon swing. The gun sounds are authentic and sound powerful like you are using a real gun. The voice acting for the game is surprisingly good even if it is in English. The Russian accents are not silly where they will ruin the atmosphere but sound possibly like what a real Russian person speaking English would sound.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>	You can get this game on steam, DRM free on GOG for $10, DRM free on GamersGate for $13 or you can find it DRM free as a physical copy somewhere. Overall, I would recommend this game to experience great atmosphere and story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=2442643">Expand</a></span>

It is an enjoyable and unusual game and I give it credit for that and for the scary atmospheric feel. It is similar in concept to Amnesia: The Dark Descent but Cryostasis lacks on execution and the story. The graphics are good but spoiled by ugly lighting and shadows - and I was running it at max settings. Also, the game has crashed on me too much at the end spoiling the immersion - perhaps it does not like 64-bit environment. It has innovative game mechanics, scary atmosphere and that feel of hopelesness with no clear direction despite being totally linear. But somehow I fail to connect with the game even though I speak Russian and designers did a great job recreating likely setting of that era. I also think the final boss scene is very disappointing - it almost feels that the designers built a game that kept going and going and then they had a brainstorming session to wrap it all up to meet release deadline. In my opinion it fits neither with the main story nor the secondary.
<br>
<br>To sum up this game has more goods than bads overall and at current prices (as of July&apos;11) it is an absolutely great deal to try something novel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=1712316">Expand</a></span>

Those reviews couldn&apos;t be any more wrong. For what I paid for this game, I received an incredible experience. At the time of writing this game is a few years old but this is hardly noticeable as the game looks gorgeous even by todays standards. This is a bit of a horror game so it would it wouldn&apos;t be very good if it had bad atmosphere but I can safely report this game has one of the best atmospheres in any game I&apos;ve played in a long time. It&apos;s extremely immersive and you just get sucked right in to the experience. It&apos;s paced extremely well which befits the cold an dark environment in which you play in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=1718123">Expand</a></span>

I bought it on clearance for $15 and in my mind was still overpriced. This steaming pony loaf is a monument to superficial minds at the heart of technique and style over substance. Any reviewer who tries to say the story is solid or even comprehensible is as ignorant, vapid and/or juvenile as those that slapped it together. If you merely read the synopsis of the box and read the &quot;survival guide&quot; you will see they don&apos;t even agree with each other on the narrative premise. It is not clear what the folk tale that is told throughout has to do with the main plot. Unless you are a typical inarticulate adolescent with little or no education in literature and even less common sense, the thoughtlessness with which themes are slapped together will just be insulting. It is not satisfying as an action game either. It is slow and confining. One might say it is appropriate to the scene but I get the distinct impression combat is heavily hamstrung to prevent performance issues stemming from the fatuous emphasis on empty bullet points of features. Ultimately the loser in the trade-off is game-play. In the worship of shadowing effects some downright asinine design choices have been made. The folk-story telling should really be treated as a cut-scene that you can skip or the auto-saves should happen after every section is read. The &quot;last weapon&quot; hot-key should be implemented like every other first person shooter: Last _equipped_ weapon. In Cryostasis you have to have fired a weapon for it to be the last weapon. It should probably be a clue that this game is one of the biggest half-assed efforts ever seen in that the sub-title &quot;The Sleep of Reason&quot; appears nowhere on the packaging; at least nowhere on the copies that were on the shelf where I purchased it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=736668">Expand</a></span>

Note - it&apos;s not &quot;How do I do this and that?&quot;, it&apos;s &quot;What the love am I supposed to do here?!&quot;. Example - one puzzle features a crewman dead in a chair in front of a broken window. His chest is full of glass shards. You possess him and... five seconds later you hear a siren blaring, twenty seconds later you hear (or even see) the glass break, then you see a failure screen. You can exit the room, you can enter another one, but it won&apos;t matter. Have fun guessing what the problem is. This game doesn&apos;t have: a point where it becomes interesting, a point where it actually starts making sense, a point where the story told by the sketches becomes somehow relevant to the ship&apos;s story. Also there&apos;s the heat-as-health mechanic, which is as innovative as it is idiotic. Because, somehow, warming your hands at a lightbulb helps you survive a few more hits from a fireman&apos;s axe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=2846629">Expand</a></span>

Great flashback stories, but that deos get a little old after the tenth time. The controls work great, by the way...no bad porting here. So, I really like this game. I&apos;m playing it for the second time now. I highly reccomend it to anyone who is bored with the usual cookie-cutter, FPS stuff.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=733148">Expand</a></span>

However, the atmosphere, puzzles, sound design, and even the story are all top notch. First of all, I haven&apos;t seen a game make you feel so isolated, even games such as Dead Space or System Shock 2 you&apos;ll have people talking to you, in Cryostasis the only dialogue comes through flashbacks of the crew and how everything got messed up and it really manages to keep you on the edge of your seat constantly. The flashbacks are the puzzles of the game, you&apos;ll come across dead crew members and you&apos;ll be able to relive their last moments to try and set things right, things such as having to walk by about a dozen angry snarling hungry dogs is really nerve wracking and one of the many moments of brilliance shown by Action Forms in this game, although there are two or three that end up being rather vague and frustrating, with the amount in the game I think that&apos;s a fair amount. The sound design is probably some of the best I&apos;ve ever heard in a game right up there with Dead Space, hearing the Warden limp around with his chains rattling is incredibly cool, but even that can&apos;t compare to the big enemy weilding two tommy guns. When he spots you you&apos;ll hear an air siren go off and you know you&apos;re in for the fight of your life, hearing the air siren again once you&apos;ve killed him makes you breathe a huge sigh of relief. All of the guns sound really nice and the reloading animations especially are really well done making combat less of a chore which is nice. The story was a bit vague and mysterious which is always cool, there was never really an explanation for things leaving the interpretation of what happened up to you, the flashbacks following the captain are especially well written and acted. This game is brilliant, it has its fair share of problems so it can&apos;t truly be a perfect 10 but I&apos;m really looking forward to the next game from Action Forms.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=735789">Expand</a></span>

Conversely, the combat is clunky, which helps to make your encounters more frightening. It&apos;s heavy heavy on philosophy, told through a complex to assemble and albeit slow-to-tell story that&apos;s very satisfying to unravel, but some parts are very difficult to figure out in relation to each other, even to Portal 1 veterans. The characters are excellently portrayed, and the player&apos;s interaction with them through the &quot;mental echo&quot; ability is highly emotionally compelling, but sorting out who&apos;s who is difficult, partially due to the English dubbing. Animations are unnatural, but the graphics more than make up for it. And above all: the atmosphere. Like so many other games made in eastern Europe, it&apos;s all about immersion. And the arctic atmosphere really intensifies the unique health mechanic of keeping warm instead of popping pain pills or ducking into cover to regenerate punctured flesh. All that said, there are some bugs about, which makes it strangely reminiscent of STALKER. But don&apos;t even dream of an open world, as this one is a strictly linear story. In the end, I recommend getting this game on STEAM, and saving it for a nice autumn day where the wind from your opened window makes your fingers burn on your keyboard, because that&apos;ll suck you right into this fun, satisfying, and poignant story. Final note: the end &quot;boss&quot; has a highly difficult learning curve, and there are three ways to choose how to get to the same ending. All three are equally excellent!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=2678283">Expand</a></span>

But the ship you were meant to board is stuck in the ice and it looks like it&apos;s been that way for quite some time. The ice breaks under you and you&apos;re forced to investigate the fate of the ship.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not sure how to classify this game. It&apos;s pretty bad, but at the same time I finished it which means it&apos;s not completely bad.
<br>
<br>The visuals do look quite outdated and bland. Texture quality is terrible, the models are of poor quality and there is little variety. For as bad looking game the whole engine is very unoptimised requiring definitely too much of processing power. The audio is fine for the most part, nothing spectacular but nothing to complain about. The voice acting is at least decent.
<br>
<br>The game play itself is a slow exploration of the ship. Health is represented by heat and you replenish it by holding your hands to the heat source. The combat is dreadful, not all entertaining and quite painful to be honest.
<br>
<br>At least there are no audio logs - all the history is presented either through flashbacks or through quite the interesting mechanic of going into peoples memory in order to re-write the history. Those short episodes are mostly fun, though frustrating at times as you need to perform exact actions in order to change something that will let you progress in normal time line.
<br>
<br>The game starts slowly and I was thinking of giving it a pass within the first hour. It does get better later on mostly due to the story that slowly starts getting interesting over the course of the game. The ship itself is an interesting thing and exploring it is satisfying.
<br>
<br>The whole game was a bumpy ride. Started really poorly, didn&apos;t get better for a while. then it started getting better mostly due to story evolving. Then a bit of combat sections brought it down again. Then started to entertain nearing the end until the final boss which was unnecessary and made no sense - the ending was a real let down.
<br>
<br>Overall I did finish the game. I did enjoy it at times. I would not however recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/user-reviews?user_review_id=7452194">Expand</a></span>
