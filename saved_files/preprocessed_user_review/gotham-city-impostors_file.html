This f2p was.. quite a slap to the face, to be honest. Gotham City Impostors? How does this game have anything to do with Batman if Batman&apos;s full 3d rendered character isn&apos;t even shown once, or for that matter, playable, as like a special character? At least that would add some flair to the game. It is very mediocre beyond belief, and CONFUSING. Weapons, matchmaking, etc. To one, he/she may think right off the bat that this game is a fighting style sort of game, with actual third person fist-fighting similar to LA Noire. But no, it&apos;s another free typical fps shooter. Cmon steam. First off, matchmaking, horrendous. Takes at least a 10 minute wait on good internet speed, and this game does not have a beginners server, no. They immediately throw you in with higher ranking players and you have no damn clue how to play properly. Sprinting in this game? JOKE. It&apos;s exactly like walking almost! Even I could run faster in other shooters. And weapons, unbelievable. Starter rifle, is a con. Very weak, but somehow other players manage to make it overpowered. Everything is WEAK in this game, and deaths are more likely. Overall, you gotta pay the price in money to get the good weapons you want to wreck havoc. In my honest opinion, lame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2631367">Expand</a></span>

If the game gets fixed then I will edit my score to 9, because this is really big problem for me. Matchmaking is now good without boring waiting and new stuffs are cool.  Very good game for this price.</span>

<br>Downsides, slighty console oriented (but works brilliantly with mouse and keyboard), gametypes you&apos;re probably already familar with and could do with some more maps.. but i have high hopes for this now it is free to play. seriously most fun I&apos;ve had in a long time.. what have you got to lose?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2617971">Expand</a></span>

You have to wait in matchmaking system for at least 30 minutes before you can play and when you get into the map the team are unbalanced. It&apos;s almost impossible to hit the opponent due to the awful hit reg. The player with least skill gets on top.  Do yourself a favor,  do not buy this game!</span>

The latest *free* DLC pack seems to solve all the slow matchmaking issues that other reviewers seem to have had. I never have to wait more than 60 seconds for a game to start. The semi-class based gameplay works well. You can occasionally be surprised by what someone is carrying but the weapons are distinct enough in appearance and function that you can ascertain what to expect from opponent is capable of very quickly especially compared to a similar system in Brink. The gadgets used to modify your movement play brilliantly, giving you a lot of different options on how you want to approach combat. Weapons and gadgets unlock at a fair pace for this type of game during regular gameplay. Cosmetic items unlock more slowly. This doesn&apos;t really bother me too much as it gives you something to work toward. If you are the impatient type, you can pay $10 to unlock them all. People seem to be complaining about this, yet I regularly see people paying upward of $7.50 for a single hat in TF2. All in all, this is a well designed game that is more than deserving of you time. With continued support from the developers, this game just might replace TF2 as my multiplayer shooter of choice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2220497">Expand</a></span>

I was playing it the other day, and say someone running around with a purple katana on roller skates. Tell me that&apos;s not hilarious. With SO much stuff to unlock, it will keep you going. The weapons are mostly all homemade and just reek of originality, plus, although it is a $15 dollar purchase, the only money that they would want you to spend would be purely cosmetic stuff (i.e. costumes). And even those you can get buy just playing it a lot. I love this game, with its hilarity, and just utter foolishness and calamity. 8 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2576268">Expand</a></span>

Youtube &quot;Gotham City Impostors Beta - Gameplay 1 - Fumigation on Crime Alley&quot; for a more accurate feel for the gameplay, the promotional vids make it look more crazy than it is. I really wanted to like it and even playing the challenges I can see huge potential, but in multiplayer it just feels like call of duty with a few movement mods. I think the main problem is the machine guns &amp; gunsights, they just dont seem to -fit- with the fun goofy atmosphere and make the game feel serious. ****Some Minor issues relating to it being a console port. Matchmaking &amp; game menus are not good enough for a PC game, but once you have set your keys and get into a game, it&apos;s fine. Team balance is a little odd too (one team can outnumber the other 3 to 1 and you can&apos;t swap teams to balance it).

I set up a metacritic account just to share my impressions about this game on Steam,  because I read all kinds of reviews, but none of them mentions the flaws that I ran into. So here we go. I don&apos;t think at this point I would recommend someone getting this game on Steam.  I am going to start off with the negative, because I wish someone would have told me the negative, and then the positive. First of all the PC matchmaking is BAD! It takes about 10 to 15 minutes to find a match. I found one match within 2 minutes, but then it was back to waiting 10 to 15 minutes between matches. Also it is a Window live Game. So if you don&apos;t have a Windows Live Account you will have to sign up... Like I did... Which took some time. My biggest complaint of the game is that there is NO gamepad support. This is a huge let down for me as I don&apos;t enjoy keyboard mouse, as much as gamepad. I have also read that they don&apos;t plan to support gamepad controls? Thats right... I don&apos;t know why, but get used to keyboard... On a positive note, the game itself is good. I enjoyed the matches that I was able to join. I can&apos;t say that I was any good...because I am not good with a keyboard mouse combo, but it was still fun. The controls felt very smooth, and the leveling system seems to be very compelling. It was very easy to pick up and play, and enjoy. In short... If they fixed the matchmaking, and added gamepad support, i would give this game a 8.5 compared to a 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2136036">Expand</a></span>

I love the humour that runs throughout this entire production, from the quirky gadgets to the outfits and funny lines spoken by the characters. The match making/joining process has been upgraded and now works flawlessly. There are plenty of matches that can be joined quickly and easily. The online community is large, and will only get larger. Gotham Impostors is a refreshingly original new intellectual property (IP). This is a AAA online multiplayer FPS that runs very smoothly, is fun to play, and makes you laugh. It is a very addictive game, and at just $15 USD, it&apos;s a real bargain.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2133062">Expand</a></span>

I really did; the zany concept, the colourful characters, it felt like the old days of FPS&apos;s where a sense of humour was more important than how space your powered marine armour was. It looked as though it was going to be as much fun as Left 4 Dead, with frantic mayhem being the rule of the day.<br>The game is presented well enough, with cute animations for introducing the various elements, and transitions between the screens that makes the game feel like there was some care put into it. However, it&apos;s when you actually try to play the game that things start to become unhinged.<br><br>Firstly, there&apos;s only a few maps to play on. Yes, this is a budget title, but they&apos;re the same kind of maps you could play in any shooter, they&apos;re not nearly as colourful as the promos and opening intro lead you to believe. They&apos;re boring old buildings that don&apos;t even feel like they&apos;re part of Gotham... I was expecting traps or environmental effects to take advantage of. Secondly, matches take FOREVER to start. During average hours I&apos;d EXPECT to be able to play with other people, it still takes 5-20 minutes to find enough people to play with, and even then, the teams are almost never even. Not even AI bots to at least PARTIALLY assist in a match when you&apos;re shorthanded. Thirdly, the game isn&apos;t even very well optimized. I have to launch the game directly from its .exe, or I&apos;ll get 10-20 fps despite having an i5-2500K CPU and a reasonably powerful mid-range graphic card with ram to spare. The in-game micro-economy is nothing to write home about.... it is what it is, and if I enjoyed playing the game more... I wouldn&apos;t have minded the hours I would have needed to invest just so I could have my character tricked out to appear and sound exactly how I wanted it.<br><br>The game sorely needs drop-in game joining to resolve uneven team sizes, a faster, better matchmaking protocol, and better hardware/software optimization... when it comes to frantic, fast-paced VS mayhem, you&apos;ll get more enjoyment out of TF2 or L4D than you will this game. It was squeezed out before it was finished baking, and frankly, if the game isn&apos;t good at launch, then patches aren&apos;t going to make it any better. Even at $15, this game feels more like I was only begrudgingly playing it because I bought it than because I felt it was genuinely fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2304329">Expand</a></span>

It is a shameless attempt to cash in on the recent success of Batman games, and the $200+ worth of day one DLC is proof of the fact that the developers were more concerned with making a quick buck than they were with actually making a good game. The Graphics are extremely poor for todays standards, and the gameplay leaves much to be desired. The fact that the matchmaking is somewhat broken only adds to how terrible and genuinely boring the game is to play. I would avoid this unless you enjoy bad games. There isn&apos;t any single player content, so once the online community dies out, you won&apos;t even be able to play the thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2131434">Expand</a></span>

You bunch of crying babies. Lets give everything away free, &quot;right?&quot; and not let anyone make money! fools, anyone that had anything bad to say about the game &quot;I am glad you not playing&quot; your missing out on the fun!!

The matchmaking is a major downside, because it&apos;s so freaking slow, but when you get into the actual game it&apos;s just fun. A sleeper, really.<br><br>This game gets a six or seven due to the current matchmaking bug, but I&apos;d give it a nine if that were fixed.</span>

Unique.<br><br>If you like multiplayer FPS, you should love this.  Yes there are matchmaking issues that effect some (and all).  For me, while having to wait sometimes (thus the all), it really isn&apos;t hard to get into a game, and I&apos;m level 30 right now.    Is it CoD quick? No.  But there aren&apos;t 10 million copies sold.   They are going to tweak the matchmaking soon, some say early March, others say much sooner than that and should make things better and remove the main complaint by impatient (and/or) unlucky users.  Either way I&apos;ll be having fun even with the current matchmaking.  I&apos;ve seen far worse. Lag? Very little.  Probably one, maybe two matches out of the dozens of games I&apos;ve played (level 30).  Which seems to be pretty normal amount with any multiplayer game.<br><br>They will be updating the game.  We&apos;ll get a free map in March.  The &apos;pay&apos; stuff (costumes) can be unlocked by playing.  Now that the bad stuff is out of the way, let me tell you why should buy this game!<br><br>Do you like the customization of CoD?<br>Do you like the unique flair and ambiance, not to mention craziness of Team Fortress 2?<br>But just want something unique as well?<br><br>Well this is your game.  Just about as many weapons and customization options as CoD.  Iron sights.  Silencers.  Extended Mags.  Through walls.  And more.<br><br>Crazy Gadgets...bear traps. exploding jack in the box&apos;s.  inflatable shoes.  pipe bombs.  ghetto superhero cape to fly around and pounce on people. (remember people these are &apos;impostors&apos; so they all look certifiably ghetto)  And more.   My favorite so far is the default grappling hook.  You can fly (well grapple) around the map fast and can grapple on pretty much everything, including the ground.  There&apos;s actually two different sets of gadgets.  So you can have the grappling hook and the jack in the box at the same time.  You can choose your size.  Big = slower = more hp&apos;s = bigger targer.  Tiny = faster = less hp&apos;s = smaller target.  There&apos;s 5 sizes.  Default is the middle one.<br><br>You even have a psych profile that at level 30 you can choose to give you a +/- benefit.  Like say....gives bonus when doing team situations and penalizes solo actions....or a different one that is vice versa.  There&apos;s many MANY different psych profiles.  Gotta be at about 20, maybe more.<br><br>So yes, when it comes to customization, there are tons.  There are 1000 levels, and I just wouldn&apos;t be surprised if they added more stuff later, since it appears I&apos;m getting access to lots of stuff and I&apos;m only at level 30.  So what do you unlock once you are at say level ~100 and on? I have no clue.  But there&apos;s probably going to be something.<br><br>Now for actual gameplay.  You have team deathmatch.  You have fumigation (like control points).  You have propaganda (think one netural bomb which is a battery that juices your propaganda machine).  There&apos;s another mode too, but forget and haven&apos;t tried it.<br><br>People fly around, grapple around, rollerskate around, normal run around.   Some people use the &apos;see through walls&apos; thing to show enemies through walls for the team.  Throw bear traps down around a control point.  There&apos;s lots of crazy stuff.  Fast paced.  (especially when you know what you are doing and the opposing team does as well)<br><br>It&apos;s fast and furious.  It&apos;s unique.  It&apos;s similar.  It&apos;s fun.  Seeing a fat tub-o flying around and trying to pounce on you is pretty funny and even comes with the cartoon &apos;something is falling&apos; wailing type sound as he pounces on you.<br><br>It plays great.  Mouse might be a little sensitive, and right now there is no controller support.  Hopefully they change this, as it should be mouse + keyboard, mouse + 360 controller, 360 controller alone capable.  But for now it&apos;s just mouse + keyboard.  (and since it&apos;s on the ps3 and 360, there really isn&apos;t an excuse)<br><br>The maps are pretty good, definitely has the Aura of a gotham city batman and joker type locale. Now if they could only add a payload type mode, this game would be insane.  As it is now it&apos;s great.  I&apos;m very tough on scores, so this gets an 8.  Which is a great game, and a blast to play.  (lesser critics might give a 10).  I can understand that, but this is really an 8 game.   I can understand lower due to matchmaking (maybe a 6), but that should be fixed, and if everyone is complaining and I&apos;m experiencing the same thing...then it&apos;s just impatience.  But some are probably having more problems than me.  Again.  I haven&apos;t had to wait very much, with the occasional couple of minutes...oh no.  As it stands now I&apos;m going to overlook it in the score since I feel it&apos;s being hammered much ado about very little, and they are working on it.<br><br>But for overall fun (which isn&apos;t the score you give when rating) it&apos;s a 10.  Buy this game.  It&apos;s fun and unique with some familiar aspects that we&apos;ve come to enjoy on other shooters.<br><br>Good luck.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2135105">Expand</a></span>

To say that it should be rated against games like BF3 or COD is a complete farce and I&apos;m not even sure it would be fair to rate it against something like TF2. What I would call it though is a decent way to waste a couple of hours releasing your inner vigilante rage. While the graphics are nothing to scream about, having known the game was running on Directx 9.0, it&apos;s to be expected. The characters have some fun customization potential and leveling up isn&apos;t too daunting making the pace of unlocks generally good. While weapons selection and load-out slots are rather limited, the pre-determined &quot;classes&quot; give you a good base-line to figure out what works for you when building custom characters and playing styles. As for game modes, this game was more or less meant for Multiplayer (like TF2) so if you were hoping for an engaging single player, you&apos;ll be disappointed. The game modes are generally straight forward with versions of capture the flag, point control and team death match. Maps, (only 5...I think) are a bit like nascar, so if you need diversity you won&apos;t find that but if you&apos;re just looking for a straight forward FPS the game play can be quite enjoyable.<br><br>The one major downside I&apos;ve found is the Xbox360esk method of finding playable games. The reason I play PC games is for dedicated servers (...and graphics) and not having to wait to find more players which at times can be frustrating, as well as the inability to mute annoying players on their mics in the player lobbies.<br><br><br>Overall though Gotham City Impostors is generally a pretty easy game to pick up, after about a half hour I&apos;d say its fair you can get a good sense of the controls and how play works. If you&apos;re smart enough not to get wrangled by all the &quot;buy-now&quot; DLC then for $15 it&apos;s certainly not the worst purchase I&apos;ve made.<br><br>Beyond that, I&apos;d say if you can hold off the impulse to purchase (unlike myself), I&apos;d say wait until the price drops to $4.99 on steam and then pick it up, at that point I&apos;d say it&apos;ll probably be priced appropriately (for more critical players) and there might be more FREE content...maybe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2138376">Expand</a></span>

I expected this game to feel cheap and to be crappy, I was totally wrong. So far i&apos;ve already wasted 40 hours and i&apos;m still enjoying every minute.

Honestly, I do not know where the harsh reviews are coming from. It just goes to show that a huge game like COD can get better reviews from critics then games that are actually good. It&apos;s quite absurd: can you say payed reviewers? First, this is the most fun I have ever had in a FPS. I own all the CODS, Halos, etc, and none of them are as fun as this! My friends and I have played this hours on end without boredom. The matchmaking wasn&apos;t the best at first, but it got much better over time, and it is pretty much flawless now. The gameplay is very fast paced and exciting. Far less sitting in corners like in COD. Overall, this game sets itself apart with it&apos;s gadgets, as they completely change the feel of the game. Dive bombing on people or flying around on roller skates offers a new, and far more interesting, play style to the game than COD or other popular FPS. I would highly recommend this game, as it is extremely entertaining and very inexpensive. Who would have thought I would have more fun on a $15 game more than all others....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2279882">Expand</a></span>

The only thing that bothered me is Games for Windows Live, and we all know that Games for Windows Live is a pain in the arse. Honestly, it is well worth the price so pick it up today on Steam or any other DDP (Digital Distribution Platform).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2294311">Expand</a></span>

First thing i heard was that the matchmaking is broken and that was one of the most important reasons for me to not buy this game.<br>Anyways the matchmaking has been fixed so i decided to take a look. And I must say that Gotham City Impostors got me. The Style and the weapons are pretty much unique and due to the gadgets which for most parts boost your mobility, this game is one of the most wicked and most funny shooter experience i had in years. Even though it is often compared to Call of Duty i would really prefer Gotham City Impostors because of the simple fact that it does not take this whole shooter-thing too serious. CoD always has this attitude, that it is resembling modern days military fps, on the contrary GCI is all about having some wicked fun. I do recommend this game if you are in search of an arcade-style action-fps. And with many many many unlocks, which are quite balanced. That means u can play versus players who have a level advantage of 100 but you will still be able to kill them.<br>So far GCI really made a good impression on my side and is recommended to all fans of fun-based action-fps.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2312178">Expand</a></span>

If you feel like being a rocket flailing tank, you can. Very few games seem to understand that people want to have fun, and Gotham City Impostors is a fine example of that. The graphics are nothing special, but they fit the gameplay well. The maps seem perfectly sized for the type of action, and they all have areas where every weapon is practical.
<br>
<br>The only problem I found was the poor matchmaking. On the PC version, the only gamemode that you can (almost) ever find a match in is Team Deathmatch, and quite often, there&apos;s only about one match running. Some of the weapons seem slightly unbalanced, but anything has potential with a bit of practice. Essentially, it is a $15 game, and it delivers to that standard and beyond.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2506248">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The graphics on max with forced 8xMSAA run very well on my 560ti and hold a constant 60fps. It isn&apos;t Crysis but it is a decetn looking game and oh so much better looking than the blurry and jaggy console versions. Just turn the in game FSAA off. This game has a lot of creativity for an FPS. Think Timesplitters and Team Fortress and some old fashioned COD type dm from older days mixed in with some wild gadgets and weaponry. There is actually a gun that fires a parrot and there are many gadgets like rollerskates and gliders to use. Too many different styles of play to list. You run into some wild variations. I prefer using my own PS3 pad and using the Huntsman rifle with its semi-auto tap fire. The LMG might be a little OP and I have noticed that on the PC end, even though I game with my PS3 pad and xpadder/motioninjoy, the snipers are MUCH better LOL.
<br>
<br>Anyway, I cannot recommend this game enough. I got for what is basically 5 dollars and I cannot put it down despite all kinds of great single player games to play. Something very addicting to it. If you have some change lying around pick it up. Leveling is easy just find a good combo and go with it. A decent amount of maps though I do wish there were more.
<br>
<br>6v6 is about the right amount for a game like this. Buy it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2521706">Expand</a></span>

Quite literally, given the intentionally shoddy quality of the costumes the characters wear. Its got fun items like a grappling hook and double jump boots, and is far more vertical then CoD, requiring you to battle for control of rooftops and the skies. However, it has a crippling player count (Six versus six, AT MAXIMUM) and very few people seem to have bought it anyway. It also has some glaring balance issues, endemic to the CoD generation of shooters, such as the clear superiority of certain items and perks over others, one-hit-kill sniper rifles (headshots optional), rocket launchers with ridiculously generous ammo counts and so on. Add to this mix only three multiplayer gametypes, the cursed consolization that is Matchmaking and a tiny number of maps, and you have a game that is barely worth the already low price. You&apos;re better off playing Space Marine.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=6508001">Expand</a></span>

Another flaw is the connection to a lobby - My friend and I notice that most people within a game have terrible ping, but a few do not and it lags to the point of frustration, because you keep getting killed and you&apos;re completely oblivious to anything happening due to the lag. These two flaws are terrible, but it has been rumored matchmaking will be fixed, sometime in March. The connectivity issue is something I have not heard fixing about, but who knows, they may fix it sometime in the near future. All-in-all the game has some major issues that will be hopefully fixed sometime soon, but other than that the game is fun and I enjoy it for the cartoony graphics and great gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2156197">Expand</a></span>

BUT! as I very clearly outlined in my TF2 review I more or less compared it to the closest form of multiplayer perfection we could possibly ever see and this was not the mere remarking of a Luddite! I launched the game to eagerly give the villains of Gotham the sweet taste of lead filled JUSTICE! And I waited patiently for that virtue. I waited. And waited. And waited. About 15 minutes later and smashing my head against the keyboard to kill time I was thrown into the game to give the villains of Gotham the taste of my sweet lead-fuelled JUSTICE! The experience I got was wholly different to that of the magical goofyness of TF2, and the variety in weapons and experience and modding and general fun that TF2 threw out there. There was a laborious levelling system within the slowest unlocking system imaginable to create my pink covered avenger of the night and an askew team balance to say the least. But I didn&apos;t rate it at 0 or lower (...?) because its functional and smooth operating like the smooth operator. The controls and moving plays out very well and fluid-y. The gadgets used to modify your movement play brilliantly, giving you a lot of different options on how you want to approach combat very nicely, and to its credit the weapons and gadgets do unlock at a fair pace, I will say however that there is a REASON TF2 uses a random drop system, it doesn&apos;t alienate new players who find they&apos;re grossly outmatched by their betters - it adds an element of balance to the game as a whole. And I did have fun with the game but I will add there&apos;s a massive big * by that whole sentence, just because I didn&apos;t have as much fun as I did with TF2 - its a decent game but not world-breaking, and certainly not worth &#xC2;&#xA3;15 ($24) off steam. Save your money and get TF2 (which I will add is free! :3 )</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=2279351">Expand</a></span>

All the type of online types for playing, all of them are just super normal, normal rpg game, nothing new, Just one of many bad rpg games... Horrible, hated it, nothing good in the game, not one single thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=3205461">Expand</a></span>

Graphic style is great, funny weapons and gadgets work perfectly. Awesome audio effects and voiceovers.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s only problem are not servers - it is hosted by players, and if they do not set up connection speed properly, game will be lagged. About performance issues: any PC not older than 2-3 years old will be fine. It is F2P now, but DLC&apos;s are not required at all. It is not Pay 2 win. Also leveling system is not like Call of Duty or Battlefield - right from the start you can use powerful loadouts (not like you are getting better gun later, because you cannot operate it or what? Great way of keeping people with game).
<br>
<br>Biggest problem, though, are new players (!). Accusations of hacking are normal on PC, as gap between new and experienced players can really be huge. Unbalanced teams happen only in first match, then it works pretty well.
<br>Next thing: matchmaking: right now it never takes more than 30 seconds to join a match (unless you live in Antarctica).
<br>
<br>Many reviews here are pretty old, so try this game, especially when you are somewhat experienced in online competitive shooters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/gotham-city-impostors/user-reviews?user_review_id=4556704">Expand</a></span>
