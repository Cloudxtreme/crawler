<br>
<br>There are a few things I didn&apos;t like though. First of all I pretty much have to empty a clip into the face of an enemy to kill him. That ruins a lot for me. Secondly the re-spawning of enemies some places made the game close to unplayable. Thirdly I hated the fact that my weapons became useless very fast, because I wore them out, so to say, and there was no way for me to repair them. So I ended up carrying around the coolest guns, using all sorts of crap I came along, because I didn&apos;t want my coolest gun to break...
<br>
<br>The game started out good, but towards the end it was just a fast FPS, and I don&apos;t like that. I kept playing to find out how it ended (and I found three different endings), but it really was not very fun at the end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=3777570">Expand</a></span>

<br>The STALKER games have a reputation for being tough, and it&#x2019;s well-deserved -- this is probably the most challenging single-player game I&#x2019;ve played. Both the open world and the AI are very unforgiving. There are constant dangers not just from the wide variety of enemies but also from high levels of radiation and strange spatial anomalies. The Zone is a large place and during the course of the game you get to visit a diverse range of environments and encounter many weird malevolent forces. The combat is always demanding and requires a good deal of strategic thinking given that you have to deal with other health-depleting factors at the same time. The story, although it does suffer from the usual lack of focus as a result of non-linear gameplay and some uninspiring side quests, is still reasonably strong and engaging. Graphically it&#x2019;s quite impressive, although I should point out that I installed the STALKER Complete 2009 mod from the get-go, which (as I understand it) improves on the vanilla game in this area. It&#x2019;s true that there are some annoying bugs, but they didn&#x2019;t dampen my enjoyment of the game too much. And even though the weapons and armour deteriorate (a feature I&#x2019;m not overly fond of) the speed with which this occurs is more realistic than in many RPGs so it didn&#x2019;t bug me too much. Overall the game scores very highly for its outstanding atmosphere, which is one of the most engrossing, and idiosyncratic, that I&#x2019;ve encountered. Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=5142913">Expand</a></span>

Yes, there is a lot wrong with the game, but there is so much right I am mezmorized. I&apos;ve played many games that were polished more, but very few that I&apos;ve enjoyed more.</span>

Gameplay is not as non-linear as some reviews make it out to be -- like most games you pretty much have to follow the missions to get anywhere. Great dark, cynical story line and plenty of weapons. No vehicles though.</span>

You pick up quests, loot, trade and upgrade you gear much like a RPG. You move freely around the lands and you can explore on your own loading only at level borders. Some quests will take you to underground bunkers or houses and here the game looks more like a classic FPS. The AI&apos;s are fairly good, they take cover behind corners and aim well. The atmosphere of the game is good and scary. I would picture it as a Mad Max scenario in a radio active Ukraine with unknown mutant horrors lurking. However, it&apos;s not a realistic shooter as some others suggested. For realism I would play OFP, ArmA or the more linear Red Orchestra. What bothers me with the shooting is that it almost takes a full clip of 30 rounds to kill one enemy using a fair AK. The one handed guns are useless for anything but critters, you need to get very close and put a few rounds in between the eyes for any effect. I would rather use a real life slingshoot or a stick and expect better results than that. Perhaps weapons and ammo will get better later on. The grenades are good and at this point it&apos;s my only efficient weapon to down anything quick. The game engine have some major flaws. I experience crashes, even blue screens while playing. Initially I couldn&apos;t exit to desktop without a blue screen and system reboot. I removed all sound hardware acceleration, EAX and now it&apos;s better but I still have issues with random blue screens crashes in nVidia DLL&apos;s. If you want to play this game you better search the community FAQ&apos;s on how to minimize crashes and don&apos;t forget to quicksave often. The game is mercyless, death or a system crash comes fast. Despite the major flaws I really enjoy S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=407660">Expand</a></span>

Still, it will probably go down as one of the top PC games of 2007 (even though it should really have been 2004 or 2005). In time it will probably come to be regarded as a classic.</span>

It is moderately hard, so be conservative in just going for the first missions right away. Honestly, this game is the most unnerving game in its realism, you actually almost FEEL you are breathing this sickly radioactive air walking around this devastated and infected area dizzied by blows from enemies. I have to say this is the first game that I am actually affected by this intensely. It&apos;ll probably take JERICHO, but this is one scary experience. There is so much sensory play and creepiness that it takes a special person to appreciate it. Like I said, only a few hours and I&apos;m scared to play it. I love it. The storyline&apos;s a bit vague, but hey.. that&apos;s what WE have imaginations for. I don&apos;t have to know yet. I believe there&apos;s probably one way that gives you the best ending. Either way, the realism is beautifully implemented in the organic engine this game uses. You&apos;ll notice on repeat missions (which you&apos;ll have a few), that the weather&apos;s changed or monsters, etc are there. Not as much obvious scripting, it&apos;s really mindblowing. I don&apos;t mind the press ESC save function. I think the graphics are great even for today. The smoothness helps everything seem living and breathing. All is fairly detailed, it&apos;s just the landscape is not &apos;pretty. I keep getting paranoid to leave camp after dark for what lies out there. I haven&apos;t even touched multiplayer yet. More fun. This game rules, BUY IT.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=396810">Expand</a></span>

This game requires a bit more patience (especially with the random crashes...) but it rewards your patience with a very enjoyable gaming experience. thumbs up!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=396864">Expand</a></span>

It has been said in most reviews that the story is badly told; as a system shock fan, I can tell you it&apos;s just told &quot;differently&quot; - through fragments of knowledge and awkward conversations. It fits the setting well. I&apos;ve also read that the graphics are dated, but from what I&apos;ve seen so far, the lighting and texturing detail are top notch. There&apos;s nothing spookier than seeing the room illuminated a lighting storm through the cracks in the wooden ceiling and brick walls. Combine that with normal and parallax mapped surfaces, amazing weather and foliage systems and great particle effects, and I can&apos;t see why people think the graphics are &apos;dated&apos;. The only disappointment is that the world is not seamless like Oblivion or Morrowind, there are artificial &apos;loading zones&apos; joining a series of levels surrounded by invisible walls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=396958">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The decay-and-rust-alike graphics along with the sound design makes the weapons look really great and with a good variety of types and modifications. The reliability and accuracy of the early weapons are affected by this and you find yourself forced to plan your approach and devise a strategy accordingly. Even the enemy AI shows remarkable intelligence as they try to surround you and flank your position. You need to think fast and be adaptable in order to overcome the challenges in this game but once you learn how to survive the reward is fantastic. Unfortunately this also makes the game a bit too easy near the end but you&apos;re still looking at many hours of solid entertainment. I admit this game may not please everyone and at this point it is probably very outdated, but if you&apos;re a post-nuclear apocalyptic FPS fan you owe yourself to try out this game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=2291513">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I won&apos;t mention the almost permanent &quot;dying&quot; due to gunshots, radiations, and various anomalies - that&apos;s part of the experience : wandering inside the Zone, a perimeter around the nuclear plant of Tchernobyl, full of mutants, factions and hazards. So S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a &quot;quicksave/quickload&quot; game in old-school fashion (even in easy mode).
<br>
<br>I liked the design of the wasted lands, and the warring factions, but not loved it. Trying to find your way to Strelok isn&apos;t picnic.
<br>
<br>So far, I&apos;ve understood that the main strategy is to :
<br>- find a serie of guns (pistols, machineguns, rifles, shotguns...) for which you can gather enough ammo ; and upgrade the most efficient ones
<br>- always keep a nice amount of bandages (bleeding), syringes (radioactivity), medikit (heal) and food (eat) otherwise
<br>- gather artefacts to keep the best ones in your belt and resell the other ones. The best I&apos;ve found (for me) were the ones reducing radioactivity &amp; bleeding ; and boosting endurance.
<br>- never pack more than 50 kg of stuff otherwise you&apos;ll lose stamina too quickly (because you&apos;ll have to go back and forth alot of time in this game - no teleport).
<br>
<br>The game lacks some clear information about what is important to play properly, you&apos;re basically left alone. But since it takes about 30 min / 1h to die stupidly, it takes time to figure out the whole thing.
<br>
<br>Another dissapointing aspect of the game is the dialog window and the inventory window, two modes not that exciting. Plus, the game still run while you use your inventory, so sometimes you die without knowing why.
<br>
<br>Despite these negatives elements (and the fact I wasn&apos;t able to go farther than a &quot;locked&quot; checkpoint), the first instalment of the serie was quite engaging and pleasing in its punishing ways ;)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=5574457">Expand</a></span>

Very few games now-a-days have the pure, innovative gameplay, that S.T.A.L.K.E.R: Shadow of Chernobyl provides. STALKER is a lot of things, it&apos;s atmospheric, it&apos;s frightening, it&apos;s unique, and it&apos;s quite hard. However, STALKER is not Call of Duty, nor is it Fallout, and especially not Oblivion, it isn&apos;t even an entirely perfect game. To the players that man up, and fight there way through the zone, this will be a game that is played over, and over again.<br><br>With 7 different endings, and a amazingly long single player mode, this game will deliver surprises both good and bad for years to come, especially with the huge modding community.<br><br>STALKER tries to be annoyingly realistic. You will die of blood loss, if you don&apos;t bandage up wounds. You will not take a shotgun wound standing. You will not walk away from radiation, without some medication.<br><br>Graphically, STALKER has some of the best dynamic lighting engines ever, and it&apos;s a game that holds off the bloom, so it has a distinctive &quot;dirty&quot; look. Perfect for the harsh wastelands surrounding Chernobyl.<br><br>Most bugs have been patched, and I highly recommend that everyone plays this spectacular game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=1551252">Expand</a></span>

Being a true hunter,  I can honestly declare S.T.A.L.K.E.R as the most realistic account of actually lugging a weapon in an open field.  In fact, it is easy to forget yourself and imagine a proper hunting trip through scrub and forest with industrial detritus thrown in as a bonus.   Although the foliage is consistent throughout the game, the environments are extensive and the scenery varies - from contaminated creeks and swamps, to hills and elevated terrain.  There is a literal plethora of abandoned buildings and hidden areas to explore and almost all of them contain some kind of reward. The loose goals and utter in-game freedom encourage exploration and provide great incentive for the player to realise all of the inherent possibilities.  Adding further to this, eery music, strange biological sound effects and unusually gloomy areas all culminate to form a unique sense of mystery. Overall, this game genuinely appeals to the hunter gatherer instinct, which judging by some of these reviews, seems to be on the decline.  When it comes to personal items, you start off with the bare minimum (pretty much junk) and have to work your way up to achieve a high tactical prowess.  Although this is a common theme in many FPS&apos;s, it is starkly emphasised in this particular title.  Items known as artifacts can be found scattered around the environs and offer a vast improvement in terms of Strelok&apos;s abilities.  Some artifacts provide resistance to radiation and chemical burns, whilst others increase stamina and healing.  Since they occur in dangerous areas, artifacts commend great value on the market and the rarer ones can be sold or swapped amongst stalkers for virtually anything that is on offer.  Ammunition is relatively scarce, and must be conserved in order to ensure success.  Players will find themselves searching dead bodies and unloading dropped weapons in order to accumulate their ammo.  Similarly, health supplies like medkits can be difficult to find, but if a player is careful, they do eventually accumulate.  Bandages, anti-rad medicines and foodstuffs are very common throughout the game, but can be quickly depleted if a player fails to be conservative.    The weapons in this game are nothing short of brilliant.  High end weapons are customisable and behave in a very realistic manner - there is a whole lot of recoil from auto weapons and this makes aiming virtually impossible when shooting in full automatic.  During large bursts, a weapon will sway both traversely and longitudinally making it very difficult to shoot distant targets.  This can be counteracted by switching the weapon mode to single/semi or by firing in sporadic bursts.  Even with a brand new rifle, accuracy is never 100% and when overused, a weapon&apos;s condition will deteriorate further, hence decreasing its effectiveness.  Jamming is common in poorly guns, and they  must be reloaded to permit firing again.  This is especially fun during battles, as it gets the adrenaline pumping.  To further increase immersion, some of the most rugged and tactically appropriate weapons are provided, like the AK-47, AKS-74, VSS Vintorez, FN F-2000, MP-5 and LR-300.  This choice of weapons is extremely consistent with the survival theme.  By offering RIS rails,  tactical weapons can be customised with grenade launchers, silencers and improved optics.  There are also one off weapons hidden throughout the zone, which offer vast improvements over the base weapons and often commend a high resale price.<br><br>To suggest that gameplay can be difficult is a dramatic understatement.  Although Strelok will do everything he is commanded to do with a sturdy, surefooted confidence (unlike the wooden and clumsy JC Denton in Deus EX), the enemies are very competent at engaging and will take cover before unleashing a torrent of bullets.  A few well placed shots are enough to kill Strelok, and a serious injury will lead to profuse bleeding.  If left untreated, profuse bleeding can kill Strelok very quickly, so it must be stopped by applying bandages or by using a medkit.  Whilst spawning does occur in this game, it is by no means obvious.  So long as you remain in the area which you have cleared, it generally stays clear.  Factions of bandits will usually reclaim the area once you leave for another region, but engaging them on the way back is strictly optional.  Overall, the S.T.A.L.K.E.R franchise offers a great gaming experience which has not been replicated since.  I have found that the closest title of similar offerings is FEAR, but it is much more streamlined.  The zone is such a diverse world that replay value is a virtual guarantee.  If you still have hunter-gatherer instincts and enjoy a challenging and complex survival based shooter with realistic physics and a very effective horror element you won&apos;t find a better game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=1701257">Expand</a></span>

Yes it&apos;s buggy, and horrendously difficult in some places as you die by tripping over a rock... and the enemies need nothing short of a tactical nuke to kill. But lovably so. Some great hair raising moments, and a good sense of &quot;pphhew&quot; at the end. Great game</span>

There is a bit of a learning curve at first, but this game has the perfect blend of realistic combat and survival horror. This is one of the first open-ended FPS games that I know of, so you can explore an open world and take on multiple tasks, preceding award-winning games like Fallout 3. It also features real-world locations, including the city of Pripyat, which was abandoned during the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, and the Chernobyl NPP (Nuclear Power Plant) itself. One can expect Counter-Strike style combat when fighting enemy factions, though there are mutants and even zombies to keep things interesting as well. You&apos;ll quickly learn that dashing into a crowd guns blazing is a death wish, even with the best armor. You can buy and sell weapons and equipment. There are Artifacts that you can collect that will enhance your abilities, such as running speed and how bulletproof you are. I won&apos;t give away any more spoilers - first time players will have to find out for themselves. Another cult classic in the gaming industry. If you haven&apos;t already played it, play it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=2286249">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay makes STALKER shine; with challenging, unforgiving, yet supremely satisfying gunplay, the RPG elements littered about include weapon scavenging, quests and random encounters.  Ammunition is scarce, so rationing is of utmost importance, and utilizing the day/night cycle to maximize damage with sneak attacks is a common strategy.<br>While quests are enjoyable, they ultimately felt pointless since vendors rarely have ammunition you need, so the earned income was largely worthless.  Engine issues would cause corrupted saved games on occasion, and some heavy tweaks were needed to get acceptable graphical settings.  Lastly, the weight-based inventory system was beyond restrictive in an un-modded game.<br>STALKER is an amazing game recommended to FPS fans who crave some non-linearity and some serious challenge in their game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=2416120">Expand</a></span>

Technically the game is sound it has a solid frame rate and not many glitches. The physics are superb, bullets drop while in flight and npc&apos;s react realistically when killed by explosives. The sound is really a mixed bag, some weapons sound realistic while others sound like hitting an oil drum, suppressed weapons sound especially good. The mutants are new ideas and they&apos;re actually pretty scary. This games atmosphere is second to none, I am genuinely scared about what lurks behind a door in an underground lab i&apos;m in. The plot i found was easy to follow but not to simple. Voice acting is pretty mediocre and most npc&apos;s don&apos;t even speak but instead have written dialogue. Though you don&apos;t have skill points or anything like that artifacts and armored suits improve your resistance to bullets,chemical&apos;s etc. Overall I&apos;d say this game is one of my favorites, I&apos;d even go as far as saying this game is the unsung hero of open world FPS&apos;s. It is definitely worth your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=2550408">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s a good mix of freedom, side missions, and storyline missions that you have to complete to progress. You can always go backwards, hunt for things, sell your treasures, buy weapons and ammo, until the endgame. The endgame itself is long, and took me totally by surprise at how epic it turned out to be. I was completely satisfied with it, seeing how such a modest game could unmask itself as being so brilliant. I wish I&apos;d played it sooner, and had higher expectations with it, or I might never have tried it out. If you enjoy this and want a multiplayer version, I think DayZ mod is quite similar.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=2565982">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a game that doesn&apos;t pander to casual types. Totally fierce experience with gunfights killing you in 2-3 hits, nights being crazy dark forcing you to rely on your weak flashlight and no, you don&apos;t get nightvision until MUCH later in the game. Monsters are ferocious, sneak on you and human enemies are dangerous and fun to fight. Hell, you can talk and trade with 97% of everybody you meet! The zone is a truly inhospitable place that forces you to think, explore, be careful and fight hard to survive.

On higher difficulties, ammo, health, and other nessecities are hard to come by. You and your enemies die in one or two shots and when you&apos;re hit you&apos;ll bleed out and die unless you bandage yourself up.  Weapons have realistic recoil (at least more realistic then some modern FPS&apos;s) and hitting enemies with older more worn guns can be a challenge. youll constantly be stashing supplies in hiding spots in the world and taking ammo and bandages from dead enemies. You actually feel like your trying to survive, and that&apos;s something a lot of games fail to do. The story isn&apos;t that exceptional but is interesting and being very interested in what happened at Chernobyl, this game&apos;s setting is amazing and original. I heard that this game was the Crysis of its day and it shows as the world is very detailed and graphics intensive for its time. The game does everything right and still holds up to this day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=3388382">Expand</a></span>

What i&apos;m trying to say is that this game is hard....like really hard. Even on the easy setting it can still kick your ass if you&apos;re not careful. But that just adds to the appeal for me.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>This is one of the rare games that i have no cons with. I didn&apos;t find anything gamebreaking and there was nothing unholy wrong with the gameplay so yeah.....this game is awesome in my opinion. Go check it out and see for yourself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=5981619">Expand</a></span>

The underground mission in Agroprom alone is worth while playing this game.
<br>
<br>Having said, not all can share my enthusiasm: the game has a large fan base, but there are also lots of people who don&apos;t like it. In the beginning it took me hours before I got into it.

<br>With Bioshock this is one of the best games of the past 10 year.

It&apos;s a FPS mixed in with a few RPG elements. It&apos;s like Fallout and battlefield got together and had a baby. (because of the gunplay and the &quot;Post Apocalypse&quot; setting)
<br>
<br>The story, not gonna spoil anything. The story is comparable to &quot;Bourne Identity&quot; but it has it&apos;s own twists and makes it memorable. The story in short words is that you have to track down a guy named &quot;Strelok&quot; and you have to kill him, and because your character was involved in a truck crash... Your character has to get that memory back and understand what&apos;s going on. The story makes it prefect because you are in the same position like the character you are playing (refered to as &quot;Marked One&quot;) You have no clue what&apos;s going on... Which makes this part of the game great.
<br>
<br>The pacing of the game goes really well from the beginning to Pripyat and the pacing varies for each playstyle. You can play slow and take your time and enjoy the environment and explore or you can rush and breeze through the side missions and the main story. But until you reach Pripyat.. the pacing goes fast and I&apos;m a slow player so I was like &quot;Wtf this is really pacing up now&quot; it kinda forces you to keep going but pacing was back to normal until I hit the Chernobyl NNP so that&apos;s the only problem I have with the game personally.
<br>
<br>Overall.. yes the game is extremely buggy and I found myself frustrated that the game would crash when spending at a certain area too long. (Dark valley) but what I&apos;ve learned that GSC wasn&apos;t a huge game company so I forgive them for this, and plus there are many mods (like that 2009 complete mod or whatever) which fixes the game. So people shouldn&apos;t really be complaining about the bugs because there are fixes for it. But I loved this game, the atmosphere as mentioned before is great. You feel very immersed into the game and I would recommend this to anyone who likes these types of games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=6405121">Expand</a></span>

An incredibly immersive FPS in a post-Chernobyl setting, STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl has a gripping plot with twists as well as many different dangers to encounter and learn about, without any nannying. STALKER is a game which allows you to play however you wish, whether a heavily-armored juggernaut carrying a grenade launcher, or a sneaky assassin with a sniper rifle, but enemies include more than just humans. The STALKER Complete mod is strongly recommended even for the first play-through, covering bug-fixes, updating graphics and lighting, in order to deliver a more polished version of the vanilla game. 11/10 recommend this game if you enjoy story-based FPS, you will play this game again and again and again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=6227723">Expand</a></span>

Its sort of like Deus ex and BioShock , so if your a fan of the Dues ex or BioShock i highly recommend this game.

This is absolutely nothing like, say, Fallout 3. Because the choices are very limited.<br><br>When you play the game for the first half hour, you get the impression that you can make your own choices entirely, which is simply not true, keep in mind this is a First Person Shooter, Not a Roleplaying Game. The game gets extremely linear towards half of the game.<br><br>&gt;The first thing that was really negative about it was those small bottle-neck loading-time routes that you have to go through, to get into a new area. Not only that, when you sometimes  finished loading from one of these points, a fresh wave of respawned NPC&apos;s is there to immediately try to kill you, this is off-putting because you just can&apos;t prepare for anything, so not a lot of thought was put into that.<br><br>The game discourages you to do any backtracking to other locations, to trade and stuff, because you&apos;ll have to pass about 4 extremely long loading zones.<br><br>They could&apos; ve been way more creative with the Chernobyl Power-Plant area itself. It&apos;s basically just one big shoot-out towards the end of the game, which really takes away the experience. The quests are not really note-worthy, and pretty straight forward, with the exception of some parts of the main quest.<br><br>There are some horror-elements in some parts of the game, but only few were actually really scary. Most of the time you&apos;re just shooting bad guys with your gun.<br><br>The only thing I found absolutely brilliant was the AI, and the lighting effects of day &amp; night.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=1833552">Expand</a></span>

But this game STILL has, even with the latest patch and after so much time after its release, an annoying number of bugs and glitches. A number of side missions appear to be glitched or broken. The game stutters, crashes and causes the computer to freeze randomly, EVEN when you tone down the graphics settings to something your computer can easily handle. It also has excessively high system requirements. Weapon ballistics are mostly very realistic, though at times weird things seem to happen, like when you shoot your enemy at point blank range with a shotgun and somehow still miss. Your combat knife is a complete joke, most of the times it doesn&apos;t even seem to hit your enemy. Features that should have been included in the game are sorely missing, like there is no way to repair your weapons or armor, and your only option of travel is on foot, no vehicles, no optional fast travel (the game takes place in a pretty large map). The game features a large quantity of weirdly translated in-game dialogues; as if the translations to English were done by someone who didn&apos;t properly understand the English language. To me this is a serious flaw because it detracts from the mood of the game. And overall, the game feels like a number of exciting and innovative gaming features that have just been thrown together instead of having made sure everything works well together. This last flaw is important because Stalker isn&apos;t simply a FPS where you go about gunning down your foes, it&apos;s also about doing missions, scavenging, exploring, and surviving in an unforgiving landscape. In the end, Stalker promises to be an original and really exciting game; but it&apos;s simply dragged down by its bugs, glitches and unpolished gaming features.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=71964">Expand</a></span>

AI behaves in very intelligent way - think CoD2 where soldiers after battle sit around the fire, playing guitar, telling jokes and drinking vodka. You can talk to every stalker, ask him about rumors, try to trade or ask for a quest. Gameplay is about doing quests, roaming around the Chernobyl zone, avoiding deadly &quot;anomalies&quot; and radiactive area and battling with bandits, military, mutants and aggressive wildlife. Zone represent area around Chernobyl with forests, plains, city of Pripyat, nuclear plant itself, small willages, roads and soviet Ukraine cars and trains wrecks. The game is mostly FPS but RPG elements are very strong. You have an inventory and doll for different types of gear. Every weapon have it&apos;s stats and durability. Every character have a name, inventory and an opinion about you. There is a player reputation system. If you help a dying stalker with a medikit he will become your friend. If you come close to neutral stalkers with weapon drawn they will warn you and if you don&apos;t listen, they will open fire and become hostile. You can use zone artifacts to improve your stats. Inventory is limited to weight you can carry. There are many quests in game - main quest line and side quests, many of them are time-limited. Models and textures are a bit outdated but light and shadows are very impressive. System requirements are somewhat high but it&apos;s not a big problem. I&apos;d say they are close to F.E.A.R. requirements - slightly higher though. You can also use lower graphics settings on old video cards. After two days of gameplay I experienced a few minor AI and graphics glitches and only one CTD. Game is pretty stable and it lets you use Alt+Tab with no problems. Summary - if you want to imagine what is S.T.A.L.K.E.R. looks like... it&apos;s like F.E.A.R. meets Oblivion in living world of very realistic Chernobyl area. P.S. There IS eating and anti-radiation vodka drinkin in game. If character don&apos;t eat very long it will starve to death.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=396179">Expand</a></span>

I saw the flaws and bugs: Not pausing the game while you loot bodies... Being over burdened while under fire... save / loading bugs. But being one who hates wasting his money, I gave it a solid shot... and this game grew on me. It&apos;s not a conventional shooter by any means. It&apos;s an adventure shooter with light rpg elements... food, weapons, ammo, armor... etc. The A.I. is very strong... Enemies will fall back when out gunned, regroup, flank, and attack. Dead bodies are persistent until a predator/scavenger devours the bodies. Enemies dont spawn in front of you, they actually walk across the environment and repopulate previously cleared areas. There are weather changes, day / night cycles, and the behavior of all adapt and take advantage of it. There are many types of environmental hazards and strange/creepy creatures. The environments themselves are massive... and extremely detailed. The more you explore and play this game, you begin to realize that the environments themselves are alive! You also realize just how much work went into it... and it shows. I still don&apos;t think it was finished when it went out the door, but it&apos;s still solid. And for a first title on a new game engine... it&apos;s amazing. This game blatantly dares to be different and has successfully enhanced the FPS genre and raised the bar dramatically. One of the most impressive FPS titles to come out in a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=397870">Expand</a></span>

If some of the characters speeches we still in russian there would be no bugs. The one phrase they left in russian is to me important. when the guy says but down ur gun its in Russian!!!! good thing I already knew waht it mean.</span>

Its a typical Russian story of &quot;ghosts and radiation&quot; like they all seem to be: Nuclear disaster with a paranormal element. The living breathing world is cool... and I really like how fragile you are as a character and how many things you have to be mindful of from food to sleep. It makes one feel like they actually are in Ukraine fighting mutants and bandits. The graphics are not very good although there are mods to alleviate this, and there is next to no voice acting and long text blobs that have to be read to understand the story. I wouldn&apos;t so much mind this, but in a game like stalker, it REALLY breaks the immersion and reminds you its a game. All in all, STALKER feels unfinished and sloppily put together. But I&apos;ve certainly played worse.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=2965468">Expand</a></span>

It is quite realistic in terms of shooter, meaning you will get easily if under-equipped, basic guns are quite inaccurate, you bleed a lot, get poisoned, radiated and so on. Introduction of anomalies and artifacts system is amazing, loved just running around, collecting everything. The story might be little chaotic, plus the different endings need more than one playing to fully enjoy the game, but it isnt game for ordinary &quot;lets go shoot something&quot; player. The further parts of the game are quite scary, you find yourself overwhelmed by mutated creatures and determined enemies, that wouldnt hesitate to chop your head off and make a campfire decoration out of it.
<br>The only letdowns are the necessity to run miles and miles at the beginning of the game completing the side missions and collecting goods for selling. The weapons are usually adaptable, but there isnt large range of attachments, only basic ones like SUSAT scope or silencer.
<br>Graphics are quite low, but you can always mod the game (for example with Complete 2009 mode, changing textures and so on). There are some strange physics sometimes, people get burned in their own campfires, boxes explode when you smash them and so on, but its not so drastic.
<br>Sometimes the game could get quite frustrating, like running to a massive radiation spot and get killed even with high protection, or get killed by anomaly you didnt see in the dark. But hey, rule #1, dont run when around anomalies, right ) All and all, the game is definitely one of my favs, even through some minor flaws. Plus there is the guy saying &quot;get out of here, stalker&quot; which is probably the best game quote ever, what more do you want.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=4544882">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> This game is amazing. I have played FPS since Wolfenstein 3d(probably about 100 fps games total) and this is the most immersive environment I have ever seen. The game is so spooky, and is so addicting. I have clocked over 100 hours on the Single Player alone. My only problems with the game are it&apos;s technical jitters, but the game should not be missed. Stop reading this, and go buy it.</span>

I have a fairly decent rig, but the game runs like garbage in single player, I have to play in windowed mode with the settings at low-medium and I get a terrible frame rate much of the time. Despite that fact though, I push onward because for every time I want to stop playing and wait for the inevitable patches, there is an instant in which the game completely and utterly surprises me. If you were (or maybe, like me, still are) a fan of Fallout 2 and really wish they would hurry the hell up with making Fallout 3 the sequel we all hoped for, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. should certainly make the wait easier. Hell, they could have released it a year from now after all the issues were fixed and called it Fallout 3 and I would not have complained.

Close up firing a sub-machine gun at a zombie just near your feet sent half of the shots to the limbo (same happened when playing F.E.A.R. online with a 60 ping). No prone, only lean left/right, sprint, jump and ladder climbing. GTA:SA styled gameplay which allow the player to goes around and pick-up jobs. Not easy to learn as how to, as the objective menu interface are confusing so are the anomalies around or collected, it sure takes a lot of time to learn. No quad bikes or bicycle here and there (simply no vehicles in the junkyard), so it takes a long run from one place to another on foot. Due to the weights/loads you carries, it takes too much stopping for breathes to finish a trip. The FPS gets a big stuttering by every 3 or 5 running steps, it&apos;s like hiccups, but it doesn&apos;t happen in the first few areas/zones of the game. Try the other games like Crysis if your brain is tired after playing other PC games, because this game is the library and the nuns would love it best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=1453219">Expand</a></span>

The atmosphere is fantastic and unlike any other game out there. it was in development for years and even though they didn&apos;t manage to include everything they wanted, what they did is still incredible. this is no Console shooter or port, if you want a simple run and gun don&apos;t buy it and play for 20 minutes and complain when unlike Crysis you can&apos;t kill everything in 10 seconds with your hi tech gun and invincible **** suit.<br><br>First of all, don&apos;t play it without downloading the Complete mod for free first. This updates the textures, sounds, AI, fixes a load of bugs and errors and makes the game what it wanted to be. It doesn&apos;t change anything, just cleans it all up.<br><br>This game isn&apos;t like other FPS because it is actually hard. You don&apos;t start off with an amazing gun and squad and intel, you have a coat and a pistol and aside from that you are on your own. The Zone is an easy place to die even without having a host of powerful mutants and heavily armed humans roaming around. This game doesn&apos;t hold your hand like Western shooters do, or load you up with amazing gear under the guise of being some Spec Ops soldier. The atmosphere is incredible, part&apos;s of it are creepy as hell and scary and not like the Doom3 teen equivalent of having a monster jump out when you press the door button or a loud bang etc. It is hard to get into because it is so unforgiving, and the first few maps and missions you are constantly trying to find a decent weapon that doesnt force you to retreat when outnumbered etc. If you want a linear shooter like HL2 or CoD with no freeplay, dialogue or exploration and lots of cutscenes then look elsewhere. There are plenty of games liek that around. if you want a slow hard atmospheric adventure then give it a try, turn out all the lights and play it till the sun comes up; call in sick and keep on playing.<br><br>Very few games are ever made like this because of the time spent and expertise of a dedicated small team that a large company could never replicate. There is such a talented modding community there are literally thousands of mods you can install; including some Total Conversions that change the story completely - and are good enough to be stolen by the developers for Call of Pripyat.<br><br>10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=1693168">Expand</a></span>

Nope. The bugs/glitches are terrible and the game design is flawed to begin with. I tried to like this game but it is a nightmare and not worth your time. The game starts off relatively interesting but then I quickly became bored with the running through zone after zone to reach certain locations. The enemies re spawn over and over in the same spots turning traveling into a chore. Bugs and glitches galore even after 6 patches! It seems like the developers just gave up. There&apos;s only so many bugs I can put up with.
<br>
<br>Simply can&apos;t believe how many positive reviews this game has gotten. Anyone giving this game a score above mediocre has some incredible patience to put up with this tedious, chore of a game!

I remember the first time I played it, I hated it for the dated graphics (even though I never look at the graphics in games), for the bad so called tutorial and the (what I felt then) extremely hard gunfights. As I was going to uninstall it I got the feeling that I should give it a chance. I don&apos;t regret that choice today. While you play along you get to learn the art of killing in this game and get a very rewarding feeling when you do it. Combat is complex in this game but that is a positive thing since I&apos;m tired of today&apos;s FPS games where you are like a tank and your weapons are so easily used that even your grandma could pull a shot at somebodies head. Other than that I can guarantee that you will fall in love with the Zone as it is truly alive with its mutants, environments and anomalies. This game combines big parts of the FPS genre with its own twists and elements of the RPG genre with its free roaming, scavenging etc. I recommend this game to everyone cause it is a remarkable and special game in it own right. Give it a shot and you won&apos;t get disappointed.

The setting and possible story elements are great, but the actual story that is presented is bland, confusing, and uninteresting. It&apos;s often hard to understand what the ingame characters are saying and with the absence of subtitles, the story becomes useless. The atmosphere outside of Lad X18 is not engrossing or &quot;atmospheric&quot; at all. The levels are hardly open as you will often see fences and other obstructions which force to to take a pre-defined path. The gun play is okay, if a bit stale. There are an insane amount of bugs and glitches present, including broken animations, application crashing, etc. If you want an engrossing Post-apocalyptic game done by an Eastern European studio, get Metro 2033 instead. It is far, far better than this title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=2575434">Expand</a></span>

The new patch is out that fixes many of the bugs that have been complained about so don&apos;t worry about that, it&apos;s just kind of hard to find a place to get it from but it worked out. The AI is amazing, constantly changing tactics and adapting to enviroment, but they do act like they have an IQ les than that of a jar of mayonaise, but not often.My only grip about this is that if you wan&apos;t to run this on high settings, you&apos;ve got to have a beastly computer. All in all, great title that mixes different game elements to create a unique and gripping expeiriance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=401533">Expand</a></span>

It is great just to sit around a campfire listening to the guitar in a post apocalyptic environment.. You never want to come back. Great job GSC</span>

Fun for explorers. + Non-scripted activity abounds! The world feels alive. Seriously. - Real resource hog with type lighting effects. Running on 7800GTX SLI OC&apos;d, X2 4800+, 2gig and can maintain over 30fps in 1600x1024 with HDR *most* of the time. High object density areas can dip it into the high-teens. - Story is weak. If English is the writer&apos;s first language, he/she has the literary skills of an 8th grader. - Overall lacks &quot;polish&quot;; mouse wheel works poorly with map, fonts often look like place holders, need to push-and-hold to maintain &quot;iron-sight&quot; view. etc. etc. - Economic system seems imbalanced. Seems a bit too easy to get cash and not too much to buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=396623">Expand</a></span>

The game has a lot more in common with Deus Ex than it does with Oblivion. You do have a certain level of freedom to explore but the world is quite small overall. Its broken up into somewhat linear maps and the side quests are a lot like those found in Freelancer, standard &quot;shoot him&quot; or &quot;collect that&quot; fare. Still, the single player campaign is quite good. The human enemies are extremely smart and always surprise me with their capacity to flank, hide, and cover one another. The game&apos;s most promoted feature, the so called &quot;A-Life&quot;, seems to be there in full effect but almost never has enough room to run around. Packs of wild dogs (among other things) move around eating things, running when outnumbered or scared, and working as a team, but only three or four of the games areas feature these elements and most can be run across in a couple of minutes. I was also disappointed to see the more innovated enemies like the bloodsuckers and psychics almost completely constricted to the main quest. You&apos;ll rarely run into any interesting enemies until you reach the last few areas. The Zone&apos;s anomalies are also hit and miss. They range from nothing more than boring, glorified minefields in the open areas to well integrated traps and visual effects in some of the interiors. Radiation has some cool implementations like radiated, burned out vehicle hulks on some maps but it is often simply used to mark the edge of someplace you can&apos;t go yet. The artifacts are interesting, though they&apos;re really nothing more than stats boosters randomly strewn across the landscape. The factional elements are also woefully underdeveloped and don&apos;t come close to what you&apos;ll find in other free-form games. In the end, you&apos;re investing in a standard FPS with a great sense of style, gripping atmosphere, and solid gameplay. Sadly, for any of us who frequented the game&apos;s original website (replaced a few months ago), this isn&apos;t quite the game we expected. No vehicles, no massive world to sink into, and practically nothing interesting to do off the beaten path of the main quest. Everything unique or outstanding gets showcased in the plot missions which can sadly be breezed through in under 20 hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=396830">Expand</a></span>

That being said, the game designers said that&apos;s what they wanted. I think this game is fantastic, I think the graphics are quite spectacular, even though they rely on very high rig specs. This game might have the best gun fights I&apos;ve ever seen in a game. The Ai is impressive, they take cover very well and will escape if they feel out-gunned, they will even hid so they can ambush you later. I enjoy the inventory system they use in this game, you can find detachable under barrel grenade launchers and scopes for your weapons, armor and relics of the wastes. The environmental qualities of the game are above that of HL2 if not as varied. Most everywhere you go will be very.....Russian. The grass isn&apos;t going to be bright green and there won&apos;t be palm tress but there are still sunny days and it feels like summer sometimes. The designers took trips to Russia to get it right. I think they did, if you like abandoned buildings, research labs, makeshift military camps, sewers etc in quarantine zones you&apos;ll like the setting. There are dynamic day/night cycles, which means if you speed up time you see the sun raising and setting and the shadows growing longer, very cool. There is also a dynamic weather system, there is nothing cooler than having a gunfight with an enemy faction through the streets of an abandoned city with flashes of lightning lighting up everything around you and casting realistic shadows of all the trees and buildings. It&apos;s needless to say at this point that the real-time shadows are re-donk-ulous. One of the cons of this game is that every-time you move through an area and it needs to reload it, the enemies come back. Which is a huge jolt of unrealism, because the bodies stay for like a week game time. So after clearing out one of the much larger camps of 50 or so enemies and you go back, you have mounds of corpses. I built a wall via &quot;300&quot; of corpses, must have been 80 or so, that&apos;s the most un-realilistic thing ever. Another con is that to enjoy the awesome graphics you need to have a computer that can run Oblivion without dropping below 30 fps at any time. It seems to me that the longer I play the more I take a hit on fps because the game has more to remember in high traffic areas. You need a moderately powerful computer to run this game well. Personally I haven&apos;t had any crash error problems, but I hear that&apos;s a common launch problem. If you install the first patch your save games from V1.00 don&apos;t work anymore. It has issues, but I feel I got more than my moneys worth in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=399610">Expand</a></span>

Today, having just gotten to the Garbage, I was prepared to uninstall this game and write about how crap it is. I was JUST ABOUT TO go through with that... when I noticed that the game has a modding community. Surely, I thought, some astute modder has by now (the game is 3 years old) overhauled this game and made it not suck. YES! In summary, downloading and installing the STALKER Complete 2009 (currently 1.4.4) mod is a REQUIREMENT to enjoy this game. If you don&apos;t, you WILL NOT like it unless you&apos;re retarded. If you do install the mod, you might still not like it, but at least it will have put its best foot forward. The game is literally incomplete without this mod installed, and experienced gamers will identify the fact that the game, even fully patched, is in a development state that could be called &quot;late beta&quot;. This is what the STALKER Complete 2009 mod rectifies. It alters so many aspects of the game, and the filesize is so large (700mb) that it might as well be called the official version of the game. What came out before that was just a buggy release candidate. For graphics cards that can handle it, the mod also makes the game pretty, departing from the game&apos;s original &quot;real is brown&quot; philosophy, aka the &quot;we&apos;re too cheap to give you decent HDR&quot; philosophy. I&apos;m giving the game only a 6 because it was released in such bad shape, and the developers didn&apos;t have a hand in this mod, so why should they get positive recognition for it?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=1404441">Expand</a></span>

Making enemies incredibly difficult to kill while make you easy to kill doesn&apos;t make the game terrifying, just frustrating.  I can understand making a game difficult, I would be even more bored with a game I could just walk through, but a game you can&apos;t even get through when you try every strategy you can?  The graphics are pretty bad for 2007 and the plot is flimsy at best (wet toilet paper holds up better).  I only give it a 5 because of a few things.  First, if you play this game like the survival type that it should have been (screw the missions and storyline), the game holds the attention for a while.  Second, The realism from having to decide what to hold and what to leave behind is a good system (too many games seem to think that ammo weighs nothing).  And third, oh wait...there is no third, that&apos;s why I&apos;m rating it a 3...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=2288394">Expand</a></span>

The thunderstorms are awesome, the anomalies are bizarre and the bloodsuckers will have you jump out of your seat. Venturing through The Zone after sunset will make you very uneasy and keep you on your toes. This is a unique game with a lot of potential. Add the STALKER complete mod and prepare yourself for a scary and paranormal experience in The Zone.

You never expect anything to happen more than twice when playing the game. Very scary at times as well, to make it scarier try to play the game with the brightness toned down as if night time. The only minor problem for me was the lack of some realism, such as shooting point blank at a target in the head with the obokan it misses. Also it takes a unfair number of shots to kill a certain monster or person. Don&apos;t get me wrong I really loved this game, and I can&apos;t wait to buy Clear Sky! This is a true MYST BUY game! For 20 bucks? This is more bang for the buck without sacrificing the game play at all!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stalker-shadow-of-chernobyl/user-reviews?user_review_id=71959">Expand</a></span>

My only gripes are that the ending is lame and there should be more expansive levels. Better bonuses to the exo-suits would be a good idea too. I really hope they make a sequel for this.</span>
