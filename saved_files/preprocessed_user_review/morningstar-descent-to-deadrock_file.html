We didn&apos;t have gazillions of polygons and shaders, those listtle DOS games have had to make it by providing a good overall atmosphere, and a nice story. The heaven for adventure games. (Fast forwarding) Remember the unexpected rebirth of the genre in browser based Flash games? Especially the &quot;locked room&quot; types where you were alone in a creepy place and had to find clues and tools to escape?
<br>
<br>Okay. Mix these two together and you have Morningstar. This is not a game in shiny armor (so it doesn&apos;t have much movemment and action during the game), but it sure has a feeling that will pull you back until you have finished with the whole quest. The main story is a bit of a cliche - stranded in an alien planet, okay. But in the other hand the atmosphere is really cool, the graphics are nice and the ingame ambient soundscapes are giving you the chills. You find items, combine them and use them in the right places, solve puzzles (not too easy and not extremely hard either) to advance.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s see the highs and lows:
<br>
<br>+ Great overall atmosphere
<br>+ Nice bunch of tasks and puzzles
<br>+ Excellent intro and outro movies with a superb orchestral soundtrack
<br>+ Chilling ingame ambient music
<br>
<br>- Voice acting is flat sometimes
<br>- Overall game is too short (even without the clues you can make it in maximum 2-3 hours)
<br>
<br>My rating is 90%. I wanted to give less at first, because it&apos;s a nostalgia game with many static screens and a bit too short. But playing it through I have found that it has a great atmosphere that overwrites all my scepticism. And looking at the credits you will find that it is made by a very small group of people (1 writer, 1 general artist-programmer, 1 music artist and 2 voice actors), so I guess it&apos;s more than superb work from a really small group of adventure fanatics. Recommended game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/morningstar-descent-to-deadrock/user-reviews?user_review_id=5004511">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story flies off the rails towards the end as it creates a couple big questions and then leaves them hanging and I lower score from a 7 to a 6 for this and stretching credibility.  The motion action at the start and end of the game are excellent and have weight - good for setting the mood initially, and concluding the game with a bang.
<br>
<br>A good, better than average imho, point and click game; just wished story was tighter at the end.
