Well Galactic Civilizations II comes prett darn close to filling the void. A nice technology tree, awesome AI, customizable ships, and a great 3D strategy engine helps you relive the glory. One thing missing is tactical control of starship battles as they are played out only in cinematic view. The technology tree is also a little bland as Laser I-IV are as creative as they can get. On the plus side it is a constant design challenge to use equip your ships with the proper defense and weapons. Ship design is also a great feature where your options as far as cosmetic are limitless. Your ships on the starmap actually look like the one you designed too. The 3D starmap is a direction these games need to go where you set at what level you see the model of your ship or a color coded icon from a GOD&apos;s eye perspective. Diplomacy is also more fullfilling as the AI is truly the best I have seen in these type of games, MOO included. As far bugs, I have encountered very few bugs, and none that detract from the game. There practically weekly updates so the you know the publisher is on top of their game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-dread-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=389260">Expand</a></span>

The technologies are bland and lamely-named (most of them are just SomeTech I, SomeTech II, SomeTech III, etc.). Worst of all, the writing is *horrible*. I don&apos;t expect strategy games to have writing on the same level as a good CRPG, but this is some seriously derivative, borderline-nonsensical stuff. I don&apos;t think they even bothered to run the &quot;story&quot; through a grammar/style checker -- and heaven knows whoever wrote for this thing could use the help. All in all, this game is very much like a slicked-up re-hashing of the sorts of games that we used to play on Apple IIs and Commodores -- minus the charm and excitement of those old games. Pick it up when it hits the $4.99 bin, maybe, but otherwise, avoid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-dread-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=392244">Expand</a></span>

Stardock had spent 4 years tweaking and polishing the first game - and adding so much new content that I struggled to think of what more they could add. The planet logistics is great - specialised planets - Population and growth centres could be close to home -where a good factory centre with a starpost just on the edge of enemy territory a &quot;net loss&quot; in terms of budget - but strategically - a lovely little Cuba circa 1962. In fact so many strategies can be used- but BEWARE - on the highest levels the CPU will outguess you - do the same - do better - adapt - win - and leave you wanting another go. I feel for people with bugs - I&apos;m luckiy in having no show stoppers so far - but that doesn&apos;t mean the game is flawless. I Got sick of X3 ( a real-time competitor to this in many ways) where one half of the community couldn&apos;t get the game to run - while the other half told them to shut up and stop whinging&quot; All in all a top game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-dread-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=385931">Expand</a></span>

My guess with Neil B. is that he didn&apos;t bother to read the readme and make sure his drivers etc. were up to date. The company is among the best in terms of product support and not only updates its products but puts out extra material for free. (okay, got a bit long winded there). The game features customizable races, ships etc. and is the spiritual successor to Master of Orion II in my opinion. The many ways to win (cultural, military, trade, diplomatic) are all excellent and balanced and have overtones of Civ. IV. I haven&apos;t been this happy with a purchase and its replayability in a long time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-dread-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=385728">Expand</a></span>

But after getting in to it I find it hard to stop. I like how I can buy my ships if I need them in a pinch. Designing my own ships is great! I&apos;ve had no crashes and found no bugs. The company supports it fully and it is easy to update. I&apos;m very pleased with the game.</span>

Either someone has picked up this game and expected Real Time action or is addicted to FPS. Stardock is really the dream company we all want behind our games with free content and lots of love shown to their cutomers. This game is not easy. You better bring your brain and have a strategy coming right out of the gate or you will be working to come from behind by turn 30. The animation is nice and menus streamlined. This game is what you make it, it can be a military fight or a diplomatic chess game...just make sure you build some kind of military or you will be eliminated. The game smells your weakness and guilts you about your bloodthirsty strengths. I give it an 8 but that&apos;s just because I think a 10 truly means Hall of Fame game to me. An 8 to me is a game that I will never get rid of but not play exclusively like BF2, XCom, or Morrowind...I&apos;d say this is a solid customizable game with solid gameplay where brains over mouse clicks will decide if you win. The only thing I wish in a game like this is a little more &quot;fun&quot; factor that entertains you while you play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-dread-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=385814">Expand</a></span>

However, GalCiv 2 could still use more high-end gloss to really finish it off.  The graphics and interface are certainly workable, but not gorgeous, and the sound is rather weak.  Defenders of this type of game will tell you that this is the way all space-exploitation games should look, but I think there&apos;s room for more chrome and anodized metal in this game.  I&apos;d like to see the genre come up with a game that played out like Civ 4, but had the graphics of X3.
<br>
<br>That being said, GalCiv isn&apos;t nearly as polished-looking or -sounding as Star Wars: Empire At War.  It doesn&apos;t have as many cohesive features as Civ 4.  But the game play is very good at the get-go, there&apos;s tons of room for customization by every level of user from beginner to expert, the forum support is not bad, and the game developers, Stardock, are extremely willing to listen and react to their user base.  
<br>I&apos;d still reccommend Civ 4 as the best conquest game out right now, but if you want to know what happens to your civilization after you complete the space quest, the absolute best way to do that is to play Gal Civ 2!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-dread-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=57922">Expand</a></span>

Turn based games for the PC are few and far between and this game just makes it so much sweeter, what with planet management trading fleet management this game keeps things simple and fun. also another plus is how you can create your own ship designs. ive managed to create so far the battlestar galactica, enterprise, cylon raider klingon bird of prey, basicly you can design almost anything that takes your fancy. another thing about this game is that they decided not to add the starforce protection system and you have to comend stardoc for doing this. and the last plus is that after its installed you dont need the disk in the drive to play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-ii-dread-lords/user-reviews?user_review_id=386161">Expand</a></span>
