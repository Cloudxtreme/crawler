This is bad both as a game, and as a Game of Thrones adaption.
<br>
<br>The good things first. Graphics are mostly OK, voice acting is very good.
<br>
<br>The bad things. This ordeal misses the whole point of &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; games, and also makes a complete mess of a glorious opportunity with GoT. The world of Game of Thrones would be a perfect setting for plotting, intrigue, schemes both grand and small; a place where your choices could really count and result in either small victories or horrible calamities. What do we get instead? 6 episodes where you do not get to make a SINGLE decision that would affect the outcome ot things even in the slightest.
<br>
<br>And not only that, the plot lacks all dynamics. There are no highs and lows, there are no funny moments, there is not even sex that is so abundant in both the books and the TV show, balancing the gore and horrors in both. At several points there is no logic behind what happens. There are only bad things happening to you in a steady flow, with no other options available than to sit and watch, apart from annoying quick-time events that you have to react to in order to keep the &quot;fun&quot; going. And, incredibly, at the end there is not even a resolution to the events of the season.
<br>
<br>All in all, this series amounts to a stunningly bad gaming experience. I feel cheated and would like my money and 10 hours back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5844824">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story starts strong, but devolves into a poorly written mess, chock-full of plot holes and inconsistencies. It would feel more in place in The Walking Dead than in Game of Thrones: the core cast is small, there&apos;s no character growth, and main characters are randomly killed off for pure shock value. There&apos;s hardly any scheming, all you do is try to survive the immediate threats. This series also lacks the dark humor that GoT is known for: everyone is always deadly serious, and many characters only have a single facial expression: worried frown.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s no replay value, because your choices matter far less than in most Telltale games. The events play out exactly the same even if you choose to stay silent, and illusion of choice is more obvious than ever. Except for one big choice in chapter one and a few more in the last two chapters, most of your choices change no more than a couple of immediate lines of dialogue.
<br>
<br>And this isn&apos;t even a complete game. Telltale signed a deal for three seasons of this. There&apos;s no ending beyond &apos;buy the next season to find out what happens to the few characters that we didn&apos;t kill off already&apos;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5982334">Expand</a></span>

<br>They pick a bit from every story and just repeat it.

<br>Amazing. I do hope TellTale goes broke. I think that&apos;ll be sooner than they&apos;ll learn to make an actual game, rather than a poor mix between a game and a movie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5886139">Expand</a></span>

I would also like to point out this is the first time I&apos;ve been able to put down a Telltale game for long periods, I finished episode 6 two weeks after episode 5 when I usually knock out an episode a day back to back due to being engrossed. Take from that what you will.
<br>
<br>Telltale have changed their usual format with Game of Thrones, you don&apos;t play the role of one person, you play many and I feel this hurt the immersion, I didn&apos;t feel truly connected to any of the characters as you are swapped between them so regularly, although some were definitely more likeable than others. I guess it makes sense, and follows the format of the TV show but still, I don&apos;t think it translated very well into the game.
<br>
<br>Another big complaint I have was the bizarre choice of graphical filters and effects used throughout the game, all edges appear blurred and jagged regardless of settings and there&apos;s no way to correct this as it&apos;s an artistic choice made by the devs (supposedly to make it look like an oil painting), one that completely butchers the visual fidelity. At first I thought something was simply wrong with my game, but after researching further I discovered this is 100% intended and I couldn&apos;t disagree more with the overall aesthetic of the game. Telltale aren&apos;t known for their technical prowess, but at least their games usually look clean, and that&apos;s just not the case with Game of Thrones, the overall look reminds me of playing a game at a non native resolution. The technical issues didn&apos;t stop there either, the game crashed to desktop many times when first starting the game, sometimes taking 3 - 4 attempts before it would open correctly, thankfully this never happened during gameplay. I would just like to point out this has never been an issue with any other Telltale game and I&apos;m certainly not alone, many people have reported the exact same issue with no solution. On top of these extra problems the usual Telltale engine issues are of course present, so don&apos;t expect any improvements on that front.
<br>
<br>While this review may seem negative I would still recommend it, it&apos;s definitely the weakest, recent Telltale offering but it&apos;s still a solid game, especially at 66% off and if you enjoyed their recent work you will most likely enjoy it as well, but I&apos;d be surprised if you don&apos;t feel the lack of Telltale magic because it&apos;s just not there, or at least it&apos;s spread too thin.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=6126713">Expand</a></span>

This is the worst Telltale Game I&apos;ve ever seen. No matter what your choices are everyone still dies. I replayed this game 3 times and still got the same ending. For example, let&apos;s look at Gared. When they send him to the wall you can make him promise to Jon that he won&apos;t be killing his family&apos;s murderer. So I didn&apos;t want to kill him, but guess what? The story continued anyway. They want to execute me now. That shows how much this game is broken. Plus on PC version the game&apos;s optimization is so bad that it can&apos;t even run 60fps, years after release and it&apos;s still broken</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=7417555">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Really good art style.  REALLY.  GOOD.

<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Your dialogue choices DO NOT MATTER a great deal.  Compared to choices in games like Witcher, this one doesn&apos;t come close.
<br>- Script has been DUMBED DOWN for a younger audience (despite still being 18+).  It is not as eloquent or complex as the tv series.
<br>- Music feels AWKWARD, it is not the licenced GoT music, and is NOT GREAT.
<br>- The graphics were RUSHED in places.
<br>- Some elements of the game - even the startup menu - are &apos;JUDDERY&apos; when they load - for example the music CUTTING out and changing volume on load.  These elements feel UNPOLISHED.
<br>- Some characters react to your choices in NON-SENSICAL manner - especially if the dialogue or plot continues on the SAME PATH REGARDLESS of any choices you make.  Sometimes the dialogue options essentially mean the SAME THING, and yield the EXACT SAME RESPONSE from a character.
<br>
<br>Some dialogue is INSANELY BAD, for example (NO SPOILERS DON&apos;T WORRY):
<br>*in conversation with Margerie*
<br>- Margerie asks your character to do as Cercei says and to agree with everything Cersei says, in order for you and Margerie to feign loyalty to the King.
<br>- During said conversation, you side with Cercei and agree with everything she says, JUST LIKE MARGERIE ASKED you to.
<br>- After said conversation, Margerie HAS A GO AT YOU for siding with Cersei and says how disloyal you are to her.
<br>
<br>ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME
<br>AND THIS HAPPENS LOTS
<br>
<br>The game is relentlessly PUNISHING the player for making devious and intruiging dialogue choices, and yet this is what GoT SHOULD BE REWARDING.
<br>
<br>- Bugs.  Running a HIGH END SYSTEM and NEVER have problems with games, but the bugs are there and support is hard to come by on the developer&apos;s website.  Had to REINSTALL the game once for a COMMON PROBLEM where the START MENU DOES NOT APPEAR.
<br>
<br>To clarify - this reviewer is a fan of the Walking Dead Telltale series and a huge fan of Game of Thrones.  With this installment of games Telltale has hit a wall, LARGER THAN &apos;THE WALL&apos; ITSELF.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5287153">Expand</a></span>

Obviously not. Telltale thinks &quot;shock&quot; writing = good writing, which is definitely not the case. Having the bad guys ALWAYS win, regardless of your own personal choices, is bad writing plain and simple. Having a majority of your characters butchered regardless of your ingame choices is also bad writing.
<br>It got to a point with choices where I was like &quot;f*ck it, who cares what I pick, my characters probably going to die anyway&quot;.
<br>The final episode was so open ended and weak I found myself having literally no investment in the outcomes of the game.
<br>
<br>Overall just extremely disappointing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5817633">Expand</a></span>

This is the game where your choices matter the least, where the plot moves in directions for no logical reason other than to &quot;shock&quot; the player. I will say that the feel of the world and characters very much makes me believe it is set in the ASOIF/GoT world which is fantastic. However the game suffers from typical telltale issues such as terrible animations, poor texture quality, missing sound effects, and a heavy overused of quick time events. However, my biggest problem with this game is that it makes the same cardinal sin that the GoT TV show has been making the past few seasons. It makes the &quot;bad guys&quot; win because that&apos;s what they think is supposed to happen. There is no hope for the player, I can only think of one good thing that happens throughout the entire 6 episode seasons and that good thing is immediately wiped out the very next episode. There is nothing to cheer for and no matter what you do you will still lose everything. This is not what the book series is like at all. There is always hope, always something good that is happening or is going to happen that you can look forward to. This game has nothing but failure. The ending doesn&apos;t wrap up any of the loose ends and it doesn&apos;t hint on anything good to happen in the heavily implied second season. Nobody wants to play a game where they constantly lose and are shown how they&apos;ve messed up but they can&apos;t do anything about it. It&apos;s not fun. It&apos;s not a good game. nothing feels natural about the story and the bad guys just get advantages because they are the bad guys and that&apos;s how it&apos;s supposed to be for this game and the TV show. If you&apos;re a huge fan of the show and haven&apos;t read the books then maybe you&apos;ll enjoy it. If you&apos;re a fan of the books and aren&apos;t happy with the direction the show has been taking then i highly doubt you&apos;ll like this. Telltale games have grown stale and this is yet another example of the dying formula.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5795445">Expand</a></span>

<br>Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series, does not offer any</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This game is not fun to play, and it&apos;s main selling point, the story, is not that interesting. It is clearly just a way to cash in on the large fanbase of the Game of thrones series.

<br>
<br>Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series, does not offer any additional value to the show. It is the same intrigues from the show all over, which shouldn&apos;t be a problem since it is a Telltale game where your dialogue options are supposed to alter the story. My main issue with this is that the dialogue options are all the same! You often get three dialogue options to pick from, but they all point towards the same end, and so in the end it doesn&apos;t matter what you choose.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+Real, well animated characters from the television series.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Bland color palette
<br>-Boring story
<br>-Bugged controls
<br>-Blocky graphics. Previous telltale titles look much better for some reason. Guess they didn&apos;t have the budget for this one... oh wait!
<br>
<br>Stay away from this one, unless you are a really diehard fan of the Game of thrones series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=4816734">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Cons: Episodes 5-6 are horrible.
<br>
<br>Episode 5 has one of the biggest plot holes you will ever see in a story.
<br>
<br>Episode 6 is literally nothing more than one big advertisement for their next game.
<br>
<br>This game will leave you incredibly unsatisfied.</span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s as if the developers watched an entirely different Game of Thrones than I did. One where everything was set in stone, with mind-numbingly unbelievably corny and hyper-unrealistic personae and where there was no ultimate progression except the high-profile deaths. The one I watched had dynamic and believable character development, mobility as well as diverse types of stories and interactions.
<br>
<br>This &quot;game&quot; on the other hand, offers only misery in seemingly endless proportion. The family viewpoint I&apos;m afraid is exactly to blame for that, resulting in the only tolerable way to get through the ordeal being to detach yourself as much as you possibly can. At the end I even resorted to muting the damn thing just to get it over with. And yes, I did (somehow) manage to play episodes 1-4.
<br>
<br>Now, that&apos;s what you&apos;re &quot;getting&quot; from this game, in terms of emotional palette. It&apos;s so **** black and white.
<br>
<br>In terms of game features, well I did give it a 4 overall...which simply means it isn&apos;t (technically) unplayable and it does have tolerable graphics and smooth performance.
<br>
<br>Now we get to the point of gameplay, of which there is actually none. It&apos;s a bunch of stupid QTE events (I learned from the first time the big Q came around I couldn&apos;t physically press it fast enough to actually do any of them, so I had to **** make a macro turned on permanently just to get through that BS) spiced with various assortments of clunky-robot strafing and panning around. To top it all off, some genius thought it&apos;d be a brilliant idea if you had to be ready both on QTEDR(?!?), the arrows keys AND the **** mouse (aim and click). I guess the new Jurassic Park wasn&apos;t that far off, we really can quite easily manipulate animal genes (like Octopuses, for example).
<br>
<br>The whole experience felt like being imprisoned inside someone else&apos;s mind, only ever being allowed to see their thoughts. In other words: Mental torture.
<br>
<br>If you want a good story-driven and choice-driven e-novel, I suggest you check out Tin Star (or similar). It&apos;s totally non-pretentious and all-text, but at least it does a damn good job of that. Here your choices will matter (a lot!), and you get to make them instead of the game either not caring or basically forcing you to pick one &quot;right&quot; choice.
<br>
<br>If you want a Game of Thrones game, there really isn&apos;t a good official one. Instead, go pick up the mods for CKII and M&amp;B:WB - they have everything: Freedom, engaging dynamic story and authentic lore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5366808">Expand</a></span>

<br>I usually don&apos;t give ZERO ratings but this game actually made me angry at the way the story developed and it&apos;s a game all about story.  I felt obligated to play through the game because I had purchased the season pass even though it was painful to play through.  On top of that.. I couldn&apos;t play any further through the last chapter because basically you lose at everything you set to accomplish and I was just done at that point.
<br>
<br>I won&apos;t ever be buying a season pass from Telltale again because playing this game was downright depressing.  Game of Thrones might be an amazing story to watch, but one that makes a horrible gaming experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5828781">Expand</a></span>

Hope is something that the novel has but HBO has decided to abandon in favor of &quot;shock value.&quot;  This game goes the same route by forcing the player to feel like they have any choice in witnessing the destruction of a family.  The story is terrible, and game-play consist of little more than pressing the right button at the right time.  Basically the game is a spin off of the HBO show not the novel.  If you  are like 99% of GOT fans you are cheering for the north and all who are loyal to the Starks.  This game, just like the show, uses this against you and forces you to witness the horror another family in the north had to experience following the events of the red wedding.  ***Spoiler alert*** If you enjoy watching Sansa get raped  or watching John get betrayed and murdered by his brothers on the Night&apos;s Watch then you will like this game.
<br>In conclusion, this game is all about the story and this story is HBO drivel written purely for shock value.  So many great places this game could have  the GOT licence, but it didn&apos;t, not even a little.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5397081">Expand</a></span>

Typical Telltale, linear game where the only difference your choices make (with the exception of one) is that certain people are more pissed off with you.  The game always ends up with the same damn endings, just like &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;
<br>
<br>Can&apos;t recommend at the $20 price tag, really.  Watch the TV show instead or better yet read the books.</span>

<br>
<br>People are left with cliffhanger ending and multiple questions whats gonna happen next. While its obvious that this is Telltale&apos;s way of making more money with following season in the future, its
<br>certainly a dick move towards your customers.
<br>
<br>You might only consider buying this, if you are fan of Telltale&apos;s previous games and
<br>you truly love Game of Thrones TV-show.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5842502">Expand</a></span>

<br>For the story its good but what really hurts is that none of what you do matters, yes you might get a dialog or an item of no importance but with those big choices you get in this series it really hurts to see them come in vain.
<br>If it wasnt for those half baked QTS which can kill you you could just sit back and watch the &quot;game&quot; play it self and damm would it be a good movie to watch but thats it, theres nothing more apart from a good story which makes you feel important but really your just a spectator in this buggy mess of a game which is not calling it self early acces even though you know deep down there no bloody difference between episodic  and EA.
<br>Buggy, old engine, barely a game which pretends you control its glorious story.
<br>9/10 for story the rest gets bare 2/10 over all 4/10

The video game adaptation is also beautiful and retains the whole GoT atmosphere. The decisions you make seem to matter a little; however the end of Episode 1 remains unchanged no matter what you did. Perhaps TellTale is trying to keep the story in line with the books?

If you love Game of Thrones, you will love this! +1 for the GoT theme within the game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=4788816">Expand</a></span>

To be honest I didn&#x2019;t even knew what &#x2018;tell-tale games&#x2019; were all about. About the game, the characters are displayed brilliantly and have interesting storylines. Furthermore they are connected brilliantly to the main characters and story we all know from the TV-series (and books). Especially if you are already a fan of Game of Thrones you should not hesitate about getting this game, as it is quite affordable (only &#x20AC;28 euro on Steam for all six episodes!). Some say it doesn&#x2019;t matter what choices you make in the game. This is partly true, but only for the first season. Without giving away a lot of spoilers I can say that every decision you make in season one can bounce back on you in the second season of this tell-tale game series. Also the complaints about getting no achievements in this game (for Steam users) are completely biased, why should one play a tell-tale game series for the sole purpose of getting an achievement? I mean you can&#x2019;t be a pro in this GoT tell-tale series, either you choose for war or diplomacy, which one you choose usually doesn&#x2019;t matter as with GoT death lurks around every corner! The graphics of this game are not extremely brilliant, but the style in which this game is made is brilliant! It looks like a living painting of the Renaissance! Not to mention the voice acting, which is quite convincing and the actual voices of the GoT actors are also used in this game, which for a game of thrones fan, is pretty neat. To say I had fun playing this game is an understatement, 10 out of 10!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=4949630">Expand</a></span>

This game had some of the most brutal choices I&apos;ve seen in any of their games, and they did a great job using 2 smaller houses to tell a story, while still having some Major characters from the world still be part of the experience.</span>

If the stats at the end of each episode are any indication, there are five major &quot;choices&quot; during the episode.  If each choice creates a distinct branch in the story, that means the developers have to create ten different paths for just the first episode.  Take five distinct choices in the second episode and you now have 100 branches.  By the sixth episode the developers would have to create 100,000 different story branches!  Just in the first season!  While there could be some overlap, they&apos;d have to track and trace all those paths to make sure there&apos;s no inconsistency.  An impossible task.
<br>
<br>Where this game shines isn&apos;t in branching story paths; that would be impossible to pull off on a large-scale basis.  Where it excels is in that your choices affect how different characters feel about you, and that when those few major divergences come up, the way the various characters feel about you can have an effect.
<br>
<br>This game feels authentically Game of Thrones.  It&apos;s not predictable.  It puts you in impossible situations with no outs.  It&apos;ll beat you up, then kick you while your down.  But through it all you&apos;ll have the desire to keep fighting...because you care about the Forresters.  And you want revenge on those who wronged them.
<br>
<br>Will you be defiant, even if it puts you at risk?
<br>Will you bow and scrape hoping for a few table scraps?
<br>Will you fight for what&apos;s right, or be ruthless to succeed?
<br>Can you outmaneuver your rivals?
<br>Can you see the twists coming and prevent a horrible outcome?
<br>
<br>Good luck.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=4964384">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s an interesting, varied, complex story that&apos;s well voiced, which for me are the most important parts of games like this.  Absolutely love the art style.  I thought it concluded well, assuming there&apos;s a season two.  Would love to give this a 7.5 if the scoring system permitted, but I don&apos;t feel it&apos;s quite an 8.  Seems like it could be considered canon, at least for the TV series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=6528076">Expand</a></span>

While some may say the ending isn&apos;t satisfying I would say that it&apos;s a perfect setup for a second season, if they don&apos;t decide to carry it on, which would be completely ridiculous and stupid due to how much they set it up for one,  then if an open ending bothers you don&apos;t buy it but if you&apos;re okay with it then definitely buy this game. If there is a second season this could be one of the greatest game series ever because of how powerful your choices are and how great the story is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=6231918">Expand</a></span>

<br>although I am really sorry for Mira - even though it she had the least action packed story line, it was by far my seconned favorite - fighting with words and clevernes of your character, since she is dead I am pissed that unique aspect will be missed from season 2
<br>
<br>Rodric/Asher ending = 7/10
<br>The storyline of Asher Forrester was by far my favorite - a sharp, funny rogue with a strong sword arm yet a silver tongue as well, again as with Mira he had a unique aspect in that he was in a diffrent continent other then Westeros giving us something fresh and new
<br>Although the ending seemed TOO MUCH like the saying &quot;it never rains, but it ours&quot;, it still made me feel like I did what I could and what I had too
<br>EXCEPT the for the ambush/poison part
<br>No wonder the ambush or poison plan went to **** - they killed a GUST under their roof, the one crime the Old Gods can&apos;t forgive - it may seem like a minor nuisence considering what the White Hills have done but in the world of Ice and Fire, or game of thrones if you have not read the books, its a **** big deal to kill a guest in your house - the ultimite discrase and show of betrayel, it&apos;s like spitting honor in the face
<br>
<br>GARED&apos;S ENDING = 7/10
<br>although it was cool to take a look beyond the wall, all the segments felt so wasted, we haven&apos;t seen anything new really or experienced the harshness of the enviroment and the winter except for your friends whining they are running out of food - weak immersion
<br>The North Grove was so easy to find, I don&apos;t know how anyone could think it was a myth
<br>they literaly saw it from miles away and went through a 10 meters of cave
<br>the North Grove itself is a big disapointement as well - no explanation about it&apos;s significance is given - the J-something girl tells you that it gives her the power to control her warriors yet after that uses blood magic to control them - what?
<br>also there is just like 20 of those guys so yeah - pretty ****ty army
<br>it&apos;s amazing that they are fearless and will fight and die without even a flinch or whine but **** me they will still can still die - eventhough each of them could easily take on 3-5 men they are still strongly outnumbered
<br>and what about the plot hole when they die - the power of the grow or the blood magic or whatever is useless cause you got no one to control
<br>the North Grove is one big plot hole staying or going south wont change anything - if you stay, the whights will overpower you eventually since while your men die their numbers grow, so youre dead
<br>- if you go, 20 berserks and a bear wont change anything
<br>esencially the North Grove storyline leaves more questions and more plot holes then any other and yet it was still fun to play
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t know what they are planning for season 2 but it better finish all the loose ends and make it over
<br>with because there is no more story to be gained here.
<br>the Forresters either die off or there will be some miraculous help that gets them from under the shadow of doom - but more then one more season would be stretching it
<br>
<br>overall - this game didn&apos;t give us anything new just let us experience the world of Ice and fire for ourselves
<br>the North Grove had the potential to be something new and epic but just left much to be desired</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5819278">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>So I wouldn&apos;t recommend buying/playing it if you just want a game. If you like the series or books I believe you will find it enjoyable and to some extent interesting in the sense that you will be given some tough choices, especially if you get attached to some characters (as with the books I would not recommend this based on the number of deaths...).
<br>
<br>The actual gameplay consists of making dialogue choices and some low level fighting which is dumbed down so it can be done on a tablet. I really believe there is little need for this fighting scenes as it is very easy and seems both stupid and unrealistic. The politics bit is nice but in general it doesn&apos;t matter that much. I would have much preferred if your choices could impact the outcomes and only converge to one same final outcome after episode 6 rather than converging within each episode but that is wishful thinking. I found awesome that they gave the statistics of the major choices people made, it gives an interesting view of people&apos;s psychology and decision making.
<br>
<br>All in all if you have read the first 3 books and/or watched first 3 seasons I would recommend this, else I believe you are better of reading the books, watching the series first and if you are looking for a game for the sake of the game, look elsewhere.
<br>
<br>Good:
<br>Storyline
<br>Real Characters true to their books/show personality.
<br>Major choices stats.
<br>Politics system in terms of choice.
<br>
<br>Mediocre:
<br>Graphics
<br>Your choices don&apos;t matter much in the end of every episode.
<br>
<br>Bad
<br>Fighting scenes
<br>Controls
<br>System resources usage compared to graphics performance</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5443439">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Telltales Game Of Thrones series may have not looked as well as many other games today but for the last couple years I&apos;ve been playing Telltale games I have really come to appreciate there artistic take to the visual styles of there games, IT feels like you in a story to me and that&apos;s what I want from a game like that
<br>
<br>Now speaking of story this series held up for the most part and most deaths felt meaningful furthered the plot, but others not so much and I was pretty disappointed in some of the deaths I felt as if they didn&apos;t really know how to handle the situation right and just went with it but that is up to the player to decide on that.
<br>
<br>The sound design is spot on in this game, every fight every &quot; OHH **** Moment fit perfectly with the score. The voice acting was also spot on in my opinion with keeping to the show and bringing in the voice actors from the HBO series was awesome it made the immersion even better.
<br>
<br>Now on the gameplay side it&apos;s what you have come to expect from a Telltale game it&apos;s mostly QuickTime events which isn&apos;t a bad thing per say I just would of wished for something different for this game but it didn&apos;t take away from my overall experience of the game but again that&apos;s up to the player if you don&apos;t like the controls of the walking dead you won&apos;t like these
<br>
<br>Overall I think Telltale created something really special here with fantastic character development excellent sound. It may not be anyone&apos;s game of the year but it certainly is enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone who really enjoys game of thrones as much as I do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5847518">Expand</a></span>

Nonetheless, as a big fan of Telltale Games, I can&apos;t say I didn&apos;t love their Game of Thrones.</span>

<br>There are really some cool executed QTE&apos;s and but not much else. The rest is some great diaogue with a lot of choices to be made.
<br>
<br>But there are some contras:
<br>- the choices you make have minimal affect to the course of events and the ending.
<br>- the ending itself contains lot of cliffhangers
<br>
<br>I recommend Game of Thrones to anyone who is familiar with Telltale Games, just enjoys a gripping story and doesn&apos;t really care about gameplay value.
<br>
<br>For the Story and its execution I would give this game a rating of 10, but because of the cliffhangers i decide for a score of 9.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=5837661">Expand</a></span>

It also feel like rehash of the original story with characters that are almost identicall to the book ones - the squire sent to the wall is basically Jon Snow, Forresters are similar to Starks. The only unique and interesting character was that banished Forrester and the girl who accompanied him and their story was quite interesting.
<br>The graphics are bad, and the reactions to the choices made are really quite idiotic (explained by user MetaAwesome).
<br>Overall if You are a fan of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; and want something new in the franchiese to soak in atmosphere then go ahead, You will have some fun like I did. If not, well You wont become one after playing this game so only other reason to play this i can think of is easy platinum if You like to collect those.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=7099285">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s quite transparent that you&apos;re playing as the Stark family, even though it&apos;s a &quot;new&quot; family, only mentioned in the books. To be honest as a visual novel it&apos;s pretty decent, some of the story elements are exciting and the multiple different characters you control splitting the storyline in 4 is a great idea. Overall I can&apos;t really judge it as a game, but as an interactive story it&apos;s not bad, I had some infuriating and some fun moments with it. It&apos;s a light 6 for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=7320962">Expand</a></span>

And it is a total failure, at developers have been given a free hand, the house Forresterov wasn&apos;t mentioned in series, and couple of lines in the fifth book. In what a problem to make the unique history? In general a game problem - the main characters and an event with them connected. The house of Foresters is so imperceptible, faded and is disgustingly registered that to it there are no feelings. What contradicts the concept of GOT. Show you 30 minutes of the character and kill him as if have performed routine work.
<br>Of course graphics in interaktivony cinema not the main thing, but I didn&apos;t see so careless work yet. Degradation of textures is executed at such level that even games on PS3 in 2006 can envy. Management of a mouse/gamepad too disgusting. And the main thing - degradation of textures and sensitivity of the mouse/gamepad can&apos;t be adjusted in settings. Still the gamepad from Xbox One was connected from the 3rd time.
<br>The ending is the last nail in a cover of a coffin of this product. This most ridiculous that I saw in the games Telltale. As if authors from Telltale scripted to series Lost. The open final, with an obvious reserve for the second season. Here only to whom he is necessary? If, succession of events begins to slip on the place on the 3rd episode of the first season, and further already you plays by inertia. Telltale obviously rolls down down and marks time, authors became hostages of the ideas.
<br>PS. A game only for true fans of creations of Telltale Games. It is even better for admirers of Game of Thrones not to watch at these tortures with fine a Universe fantasy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=7275662">Expand</a></span>

This game  starts off slow though really gets intense in the second half. Also the game has extremely difficult choices, especially in the 5th episode</span>

<br>
<br>There is no point to this game, there is no fun to be had from the art, the characters, the story, the gameplay, the choices or even the universe. Let me be perfectly clear here, every single person who says that the choices matter in this game is lying to you. The only choices that seem to have any effect are minimal and only at the end of the season. This is the kind of game that you can leave running while you eat, sleep, do something else and it will have played itself. Just like all Telltale games, if there&apos;s gonna be a second season then your choices towards the end don&apos;t have any effect but if they plan on robbing you again then they will give you some choices that would probably effect the non-existent sequels.
<br>
<br>Do not buy this game or any Telltale game after Strong Bad. Telltale is EASILY the worst AAA developer working today. EASILY.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=7316143">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You playing a family who gets bullied,beaten,crushed,tortured,humiliated from the beginning to the end and then gets butchered and lose everything,
<br>no little victorious, no payoff, no nothing, you lose and die thats the whole game.
<br>
<br>You might think &quot; but this is a choice game and you should have a full control over you character, is there no way to avoid this mess ? &quot;
<br>Its simply impossible
<br>Nothing in this game makes any sense, cause this game only wants to **** you over and over and over again
<br>In the most important moments your characters or family members either acting like idiots and get you punished or there is simply no logic behind and bad things happen to you for no reason
<br>You simply have no control over your characters
<br>This game takes your control and letting your characters do stupid things to get them killed and letting the bad guys win (like the entire time)
<br>or this game giving you no other options than insulting your enemies the entire time insteed of being reasonable and try to figure out a good harmless way to avoid these troubles
<br>And even if there is 1 or 2 options to do that, the enemies will react exact the same way like you insulted them
<br>
<br>In the game you will meet the TV stars from the show and you will talk to them, sounds fun doesn&apos;t it ? Well they actually ruined the entire game
<br>One of the stars is you enemy, that means you cant do anything against him
<br>All you can do is watching him butchering and killing you family and friends
<br>The other stars (the good guys allegedly) who are you in service are either complete **** for exploiting you or see you as a family member but then when there is a bad rumor about you they dont like you anymore and dont believe a single word what you say
<br>You can do whatever you want you will dissapoint them for no ****ing reason
<br>This is the worst storytelling i ever saw, the quality of this game is pure **** and i dont even recommend to watch this on youtube cause this is nothing but a waste of time</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/game-of-thrones-a-telltale-games-series/user-reviews?user_review_id=7361817">Expand</a></span>
