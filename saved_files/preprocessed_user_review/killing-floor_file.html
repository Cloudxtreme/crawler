It seems like they are missing a key element that makes this game fun and more than worth whatever they payed: friends. This is a coop game in every sense of the word. Yes, you can go ahead and play it alone, but, like these other people, you will not enjoy it all that much. This game shines in every respect when you&apos;re playing with friends or even just one friend. The game itself is also really great; it&apos;s satisfying to pop the heads of zombies and there is a wide selection of guns from the trader that you&apos;d be hard pressed to not be able to find a gun that suits you. People are complaining about the graphics... Why? This is in no way a bad looking game. It&apos;s not a great looking one either, but the graphics is in no way shape or form deserving of criticism. This is a very underrated game and it&apos;s ton of fun to defeat waves after waves of zombies with your friends. It&apos;s extremely challenging, but, of course, there are different difficulty levels. This game is GREAT.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2873765">Expand</a></span>

And with free content regularly coming out, it&apos;s stupid to miss out on this fab game. Don&apos;t compareit to L4D, and don&apos;t play it with L4D in mind. For a start, you&apos;re not killing &quot;zombies&quot; these are clones armed to the teeth with anything from claws to a huge minigun...more than 8 or so enemy types, around 20 weapons, not including those you can dual wield...crossbows, fire axes, shotguns, you name it... Fantastic maps and awesome features make each round a different experience. There&apos;s the run and gun, which usually gets you killed, or the weld the doors and direct the horde approach which goes down a treat. About 60 or so achievements which gives you something to aim for if the perk leveling system isn&apos;t enough...Just a fab game, and a low price too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=737947">Expand</a></span>

Left for dead had talent, but the sheer Cockney screams of &quot;Someone shat that b*tch up!&quot; more then overrule. Gameplay is non-pretentious, basically a good old fashioned point into crowd and fire deal, with an interesting trader function. Plus, the teamplay benefit is well enforced- the zombies come from everywhere, even with the biggest weapon in the game a sole player is overwhelmed. The graphics are awesome for an online-built game. The Z-tiem function is probably one of the coolest things I&apos;ve seen in an online shooter. Full marks, I have no qualms with this fantastically British zombie shooter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=82892">Expand</a></span>

I will have to admit that it is not as much fun playing Single Player, but as you can see it&apos;s through steam so there is a great community to play with. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves CO-OP as much as I do. As far as the gameplay goes, very well-developed, great use of Z.E.D, and has a very well-made HUD as far as Gun interface, merchants, and that you can outrun most monsters. The monsters are very well-made, however, the Patriarch, whom is the only boss, becomes repetitive. Killing Floor is very easy to learn and can even get intense at times when your teammates are dead. Overall this game receives a 9/10 for great gameplay, fun online action, and great interface.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=743230">Expand</a></span>

But gameplay is very much more important than graphics - as long as the graphics meet a minimum standard, people need to just stop caring so much. Though they won&apos;t... and never will.

Killing Floor is like almost the opposite. The beginning 1st &amp; 2nd round will start off easy. But later even in a group, may not be able to kill off the later stronger zombies. This is a major turn-off for most people. If you like a challenge &amp; plenty of teamwork, this game is for you. It also test the skills of the player as there is no cross hair and you have to look down the sights. A plus side to this game is that there is a &quot;perks&quot; system will player can level up, making their character more powerful, depending on the &quot;perks&quot; &amp; the weapons they choose. It may seems boring &amp; difficult to play at first but it sure gets a lot easier later. Players can also choose their difficulty which is a plus for new players. Got to try it out if you are not afraid to take up a challenge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1455488">Expand</a></span>

You cant say much about the graphics, as its an old game. The guns feel so good when you shoot. Especially when someone slow mo when your pulling off an headshot. Thats very satisfying. Best zombie horde game ive ever played.</span>

If you have a good vid card (8800GTX) you can max all the details and it&apos;s beautiful!! HDR, specular lighting, water effects, etc and on and on. Well worth the $20 asking price. Very underrated IMHO. If you like zombies, and like shooters.. this game is great and reasonably priced!</span>

<br>This game is pure win. Stop bashing it just because it used to be a UT04 mod.</span>

It&apos;s not perfect, but the developers are always improving on it and listening to the community. The only thing that annoyed me about the game was the idiots blocking the trader, but I&apos;m sure that will be ironed out eventually.</span>

Are you kidding me, at least KF has some fun to it. Yeah its not the best game in the bunch but whos to judge, it was never retailed to be a full game anyway, so to think about it 71 is actually nice, but i think it deserves well over 71.

                                        <span> Killing Floor is under rated, Mostly because it is related to games like, Left3Dead( or people like to think it is) Killing Floor could use some more advance features, and tune ups to thier A.I. maybe even a single player story line. But, over all, it is an amazing game.</span>

You&apos;ll definitely want an organized team and may wish to wait for further technical updates, but the title is good for possibly hundreds of hours of play.</span>

Graphically it isn&apos;t going to win any awards but that doesn&apos;t mean this game looks bad. What it lacks in graphics it makes up in gameplay, which in my opinion is the whole point of Video Games.</span>

Don&apos;t be surprised if you do not see more maps, tripwire made hopefully or even a Killing Floor 2. The engine is original and exciting. And from the number of players on-line it seems I am not the only one who feels that way. I recommend for the boys, girls excluded. Sorry ladies, you ain&apos;t going to like this one. Just us guys with the stupid gory senseless carnage.

The game is only about running if you don&apos;t know what you&apos;re doing or don&apos;t communicate with your group. So if you have a mic, or a fast typer, play this game!

It would have easily done the terrible l4d craze in and become the king of zombie shooters. While i believe its everything L4D was suppose to be its also at the same time lacks what L4D has. Reasons its good: 1. Perk system and leveling 2. Many different character Avatars. 3. Custom made maps which is something Tripwire supports greatly and even pays people for their creations. 4. Good selection of guns ( although they could really add a sniper rifle I mean seriously for sharpshooters you get an outdated Winchester rifle and a crossbow? ) 5. Very amusing and comical statements 6. Very good selection of zombies 7. ITS ACTUALLY DIFFICULT! the difficulties are very well balanced for new players to veterans with maxed perks. Suicidal is just that.. Suicide. With more work such as adding better zombie AI, Faster zombies, Faster characters ( enable sprint please.... ). Some better guns for sharpshooters, adding a actually storyline, and adding in a versus mode similar to L4D this game would have destroyed L4D in the ratings. Even with all these things wrong and lacking however this game still manages to be one of steams most sold games. every week sometimes outselling L4D due to fact its much much cheaper and easier to run on peoples computers. Overall its a decent game good to kill off some time. If Valve and TripWire team up they could make one sick zombie horror game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=83788">Expand</a></span>

Sure, they&apos;re both zombie killing games, but they each do it in such different ways that people really are comparing apples and oranges. I still play both equally. That said, I&apos;m of the belief KF should have at least an 80+ rating. The graphics are a bit dated, but that&apos;s never been my top concern for any game. There&apos;s enough craziness and killing to go around, coupled with an awesome soundtrack, that really makes the (admitedly somewhat basic) gameplay truly shine. The KF community is great, producing tons of new maps that range from awful to downright awesome, but each manages to be fun in its own right. Similarly, Tripwire really stands by thier game: it seems like every time a glitch or bug pops up, they fix it within a week or two. They also update fairly often with good amounts of content; as a matter of fact, just yesterday there was an update with new weapons, a new developer map, and modifications to the mechanics of other weapons. Is KF the best game ever? No, but there&apos;s certainly more than enough to keep someone who enjoys slaying the undead entertained for a good, long time (and for a low price too!).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=83966">Expand</a></span>

If anything, it reminds me of SmashTV in that you are in an arena taking out waves of enemies. It&apos;s a fun game and I recommend it.</span>

I gotta say I&apos;m glad I did because it turned out I really enjoy this game. First off, I give it an 8.5 out of 10 because it has the same premise of Left For Dead, but at a gloriously cheaper price *having pre-ordered it for 15$*. It might not be as polished over, but it gives you the same general gameplay wrapped in an atmosphere akin to the 28 Days Later series. For being only 20 dollars you get the same thing as L4D *which retails for a rather bloated 40$* BUT with a source engine promising plenty of mods and maps to be made. Honestly, the only real things I can criticize about it is the lack of unique features in the maps *although again with a clearly attendant game team constantly tweaking the bugs and SDK modders, this won&apos;t be a problem for long* and variation in music. Otherwise you get everything you bargained for- a simple but addicting online game with some potential to go far further. It certainly isn&apos;t going to redefine the video game industry, but you get a surprisingly good deal of fun out of a tiny can at an affordable price. I heartily recommend it for any fan of zombie-games who can&apos;t afford the more expensive contenders in the genre. I say Tripwire has some potential- we should give them the support.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=424490">Expand</a></span>

Play L4D, and think you would like a version with tougher, slower enemies? Then Killing Floor is for you. Its simple rules get a surprising amount of depth, and the various perks provide a sizeably varied experience. It also continues the trend L4D set of coop games where cooperation is actually required for something besides slinging more lead. It might lack the raw staying power of L4D (As you see, the comparison is easy), but the cost to content ratio is comparable, and there both polished, quality titles. If your looking for a coop shooter to round out your shooter diet, you really can&apos;t go wrong with Killing Floor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=424523">Expand</a></span>

Overall, it is not as polished as Left 4 Dead, but the graphics and game play are both excellent. This game gets my heart pumping faster than any other game I&apos;ve ever played. Definitely an amazing value at $20!</span>

                                        <span> I agree Killing Floor isn&apos;t the best zombie game around. But it is quite fun and has a big and active community. Many user-made maps come out everyday and since their launch in may, tripwire already made many updates fixing bugs and enhancing game play. I trully discredit this metacritic it received and I think this game is a 80+ metacritic game... 71 is just too harsh on it!</span>

When you consider that the engines is Unreal 2 based the graphics are incredible. Best fun to be had with mates. This is a better zombie survival horror than L4D. What with the new content released for free as well. A must buy especially at this bargain price!</span>

The graphics aren&apos;t the best, but not bad either, but you really don&apos;t mind that since you&apos;ll be too busy poppin&apos; ZED heads!</span>

I unfortunately didn&apos;t play the mod when it came out. I give it an 8 for the obvious cult following it will have for some time to come. Not serious in gameplay but still fun. Again, it&apos;s worth 20 bucks and with patches and additional content it&apos;s entertaining and mostly stable. I&apos;ll predict a strong CS-like following for years to come, easily.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=741753">Expand</a></span>

I never really knew why, but it just didn&apos;t feel right. Then when it came on steam for a much more reasonable $5.99 I knew it was time to pull the trigger. What can I say about this game? That it&apos;s not the most amazing game to ever hit the zombie/undead killing FPS and/or Mod of a more iconic FPS (ie Zombie Mods for COD) but I will say that it is certainly not the worst and a good way to &quot;kill&quot; time (HA!). Anyway, in playing Killing Floor it reminded me of a better version of the zombie mods in Counter-Strike (remember those?) It has the reminiscent buy guns model of play and the fact that once your dead, there is no re-spawn for the rest of that round. Anybody that&apos;s played the jail break mods of Alliance of Valiant Arms may see the similarity as well. All around the game is a no-brainer good time for killing brainless AI&apos;s but it&apos;s not without its fair share of frustrations. The fact that (when playing multi-player at least) every time ANYBODY gets ZED time you as a player experience it as well, frustrated me. This was especially  true when I was reloading, running from the ZEDs or not already iron sighted. Also, the fact that glitchy physics (getting stuck in the corners of walls and such) and the lack of being able to get out of a crowd of brain munching zombies once they&apos;ve cornered you made me grumble under my breath as my character was ripped apart. I think I would also appreciate the ability to move a bit faster. While your character can walk, and god do they walk slowly (heaven forbid you haphazardly toggle it on) their version of &quot;running&quot; (in my mind) is parallel to that of a 70 year old man going for his brisk Sunday walk through the park.  Overall the game is simple fun. The gun selection is interesting, the characters (while bland in voice acting) are enjoyable, and you get to kill things in waves. It even makes you think about survival as staying with the team becomes a real factor to living or dying and if fortification can be a successful method of survival as well. The game has some flaws, but then again, which game doesn&apos;t? and really, for the price it&apos;s a darn good time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2022836">Expand</a></span>

When a game features selectable classes, a ranking system, DLC and buying weapons, most people think they have the gameplay all figured out - and they are completely wrong. Unlike most class-based shooters, Killing Floor does not offer unique weapons for each class (called &quot;Perks&quot;). Instead, each perk offers an advantage with certain weapon types and certain overall abilities (such as accuracy/reload speed bonuses, headshot damage multipliers, speed boosts etc.), while allowing every perk to use every weapon and item in the game (for the correct price, of course). This affects the game in many ways. Firstly, players are able to make hybrid loadouts, and new perk/weapon combinations which were originally not intended but are very effective can be used. For example, the Lever Action Rifle is a sharpshooter perk weapon, however this weapon is GREAT in the hands of a medic because of his speed bonus while moving. By not enforcing specific player models on a perk by perk basis, the game manages to allow player customisability and yet allow easy perk identification through icons above players heads and in the scoreboard. This customisability can be enhanced further through DLC packs, which are usually around $2 each on steam. Despite being dirt cheap, these packs also have no effect on the gameplay, and as such avoid any possible &quot;pay-to-win&quot; situations. The game is also quite punishing, although it seems completely fair when a player dies. If you don&apos;t plan ahead with the rest of the team, you are likely to lose, especially on the harder difficulties. It is even possible to die on the first wave (which is usually a free money easymode wave) by allowing yourself to be surrounded.<br><br>The enemies are also very well thought out. Each enemy type has its own unique ability, such as the clots ability to grab and hold a player (preventing them from moving), which makes them extremely deadly in large groups or when up close.<br><br>Killing Floor also features an amazing ranking system, which manages to avoid many of the problems inherent in traditional ranking systems. Each perk is ranked up individually, which means the player will never achieve a new rank only to unlock a higher level for a perk they never use. It also gives every player, from the day 1 noob to the hardcore veteran, access to all of the game content immediately. Instead of unlocking new weapons or abilities, ranking up simply makes the perks more effective, which  keeps the game balanced, and doesn&apos;t enforce an artificial divide between skilled players and newer players based on unlocks<br><br>And now, the mandatory L4D comparison paragraph. The game has some similarities to L4D, but is definitely a different game. Many reviewers compare the 2, which is impossible because of their differing natures. While L4D is about completing goals and making it to the end of the map, Killing Floor is all about surviving, planning ahead, getting a good class balance within the squad, and making sure everyone has access to the limited resources available.<br><br>To make a great game truly legendary, Tripwire have been constantly updating Killing Floor and releasing free content and weapon packs, including community maps, and have a system in place to whitelist custom maps and mutators (small server-side mods) to allow people to use and level up their perks.<br><br>I originally got this game in a $4.99 sale around Christmas 2010. Best $5 I have ever spent</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2022567">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>AND the game is fully modifiable for tons of extra fun beyond the core game.</span>

The reviewers who reviewed it a year or two ago reviewed an entirely different, much more buggy game... and most of them STILL enjoyed it. Since the game has came out, the amount of weapons you can buy has doubled and the amount of characters quadrupled. The new guns, monsters and levels are all completely free updates to the game, while the &quot;DLC&quot; is vanity characters. Every few months the folks at TWI add in some new guns or a new level, and recently it looks like they&apos;ve been listening to the community they have.<br><br>Speaking of that, this is actually one of the most active games on steam with 7.8k players. There is, oddly enough, an active modding community, so if that&apos;s your game, there&apos;s both a presence and a lot of tutorials to help you.<br><br>Well, what about the actual game itself? Cathartic. When you shoot the guns, you can expect limbs to fly off in a bloody, satisfying mess, and when you use explosives, you can expect the &quot;specimens&quot; to turn into &quot;giblets&quot; - a euphemism for being in a lot of bloody chunks. After a few more updates the classes are more balanced than before with very defined and clear strengths and weaknesses. The difficulty of the game is nearly linear based on how many players are in the game - making it important to stick with your team (for the most part).<br><br>The graphics are nothing special. Bloom and AA can hide some of it, but the explosions still feel a little cheesy. Pretty good for its time, now it&apos;s just aging fairly well. There is a very wide variety of weapons to choose from now - not numerically, but functionally. Each gun has a different purpose, instead of basically being an upgraded version of a previous gun (with some exceptions to the melee tree). The perks are standard and push no envelops, but very well-rounded.<br><br>Some of the level design is a bit uninspired, feeling as if it has a color-sickness. The difficulty can feel two-sided (too hard, or too easy). The final boss can be out outrageously hard unless everyone knows exactly how to deal with him. Camping is a bit too prevalent which I feel is a bit boring. There&apos;s a lot of steam achievements, if that&apos;s your thing, although some of them you can only get during a certain time of year, during the events. Never-the-less, it&apos;s a criminally fun and active game with a good chunk of personality. You can log repulsive amounts of hours in this game and still find it fun - because, simply, it is fun. Pure, simple, fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2068449">Expand</a></span>

Killing Floor stimulates panic in the player by forcing them to do more than just camp in one spot for the round. If you do that, you will die! All of the zombies are well balanced and compliment each other. Each needs to be dealt with slightly differently. There&apos;s a lot of different maps too, many of which are very large. The Unreal 3 engine graphics are really great. Some faults: the AI isn&apos;t superb, the weapon pool feels shallow due to the number of classes in the game, can be hard to get people to play the more interesting maps, final boss is kind of cheesy. Overall, very fun and I recommend it to anyone who likes arcade style shooters or zombie-style games</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2096846">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>To keep it short Killing Floor has 5 great classes to chose from, great variety of &quot;zombies&quot;, awesome guns that actually feel powerful, really addictive gameplay (got over 200 hours on it), and great developer updates.
<br>This is a perfect game for people who enjoy:
<br>-Blowing off some steam
<br>-Repetition in games (you&apos;ll be replaying same levels over and over again just like L4D)
<br>-Killing endless hordes of zombies/mutants
<br>-People who value gameplay over graphics (since this is running on an old Unreal 2.5 engine)
<br>
<br>This game should be judged like a movie, don&apos;t listen to others opinions and try it yourself, I can almost promise you won&apos;t regret spending the $$$.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2523628">Expand</a></span>

Tripwire still updates it, and not just with maps or bugfixes, they still add weapons to it! And there are 3 events every year, Twisted Christmas, Summer Sideshow, and Halloween sideshow. In each, the specimens are skinned and given new voices to match the current holiday. Gameplay? Pick a map, pick a difficulty, (Easy, Normal, Hard, Suicidal, Hell on Earth), and play. You&apos;ll be thrown tons of stuff to kill, and you&apos;ll need REAL SKILL to survive all the way through. There are plenty of games to play, you&apos;ll never have trouble finding a server. And even though you will be doing the same thing over and over again, it just doesn&apos;t get old. You&apos;ll have hours of fun playing this game if you&apos;re willing to get past the learning curve, once you practice a little, you&apos;ll like it more I promise. As for system requirements, I started off playing this game long before I even MET the system requirements the worst computers will be able to play this game with ease. Worth it&apos;s total $20 price tag I guarantee! See you on the Killing Floor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2332031">Expand</a></span>

That said, it&apos;s cheap (i got it for $11) and i got about 20 hours out of it so far. It&apos;s not one of those games you can binge play, I can see how that would get old quickly. Whenever i pick up killing floor I play a game or two then move on and come back to it the next day, and it hasn&apos;t soured yet.</span>

Multiplayer on 6 player servers is satisfying when you have teammates that know what they&apos;re doing, and try teamwork when things are going wrong. Although it&apos;s every man for himself when the final boss arrives! Larger servers with 15+ players are absolutely hilarious, and everyone who has the game should try one out. Overall a noteworthy experience, with character levels offering the player something to work on in the long run that kept me interested after I tried everything out. It has a massive following, and rightly so at such a reasonable price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2565961">Expand</a></span>

<br>Throw in holiday zed events in which you are awarded new monster skins and a new level [maybe some weapons and character skins too!] and you are gonna have fun all year round.
<br>
<br>Im not saying the game is absolutely amazing for everyone, but i am saying that everyone must try this game! I saw it and dodged it forever, but while playing on the free weekend i was hooked and i have 170+ hours on steam right now. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=3810960">Expand</a></span>

It seemed like a simple, shallow, generic co-op shooter. Well, it is not.
<br>I can&apos;t even remember how it finally caught my attention, but I bought it and heavily regret I neglected this game.
<br>This survival co-op game provides a variety of different fun playstyles and has a huge selection of quality maps, most of which were created and selected by the community.
<br>The co-op element of this game is strong and well developed. Games like L4D2 promote teamwork by using cheap tactics from &quot;special enemies&quot; that completely disable a player, forcing them to be rescued or die. Killing Floor encourages players to work together through sheer enemy numbers and the necessity to have someone watch your back. You DO NOT want to be caught by a flesh pounder alone, not because he is cheap and will disable you, but because he is a complete badass.
<br>This is also just really good game design: the leveling/progression system is balanced and gives players an edge but is not a replacement for skill, the weapons are all viable although some are better than others especially when regarding classes, and waves/difficulty is adjusted to the amount of players in the map giving anyone the option to play with as many people as they want without ruining gameplay.
<br>I just got started at this 4 year old game and have sunk more hours into it than a large majority of the newer games that have been released. This game has a lot of playtime value for its buck.
<br>My only real complaint would be about the dated feel to the menu and match browsing feature. It almost feels...retro. But once your in game you forget about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=3293391">Expand</a></span>

<br>Its fun to play, specially with friends, getting cornered by the zombies. If you do enjoy zombie killing games you&apos;ll have quite a good experience. There are lots of achievements to make on Steam so there are DLCs.
<br>There are some classes and each has its specific perks, there are no big disadvantages or overpowered classes at all, each has its specific guns, though, you can still buy other classes&apos; guns but you wont do so well with them as you&apos;ll do with the guns&apos; specific classes.
<br>The whole pack including all the DLC&apos;s costs 30 euros, the game itself is 17 euros, on Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=3118017">Expand</a></span>

This game is debatebly  the best zombie fps yet. the weapon animations are smooth and so are the graphics. with open mod support and regular free updates this game is very community based. There are holiday events for every holiday, and every year. that is what really makes this game. the fact that there are zombie elves and santas on christmas and carnival monsters during the summer is awesome. please buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=3663381">Expand</a></span>

Good graphics, not entirely up to date, but still very good. The sound effects are great, and the soundtracks made by zynthetic are phenomenal. Overall, a great game that is underrated and should be played by more people.</span>

The game is simple yet addictive. Killing Floor doesn&apos;t hide behind shiny graphics or a carefully crafted backstory to get you &quot;entertained&quot;, it throws you in a map with guns, friends, and a horde of mutants and says &quot;enjoy&quot;. If you&apos;re more concerned with how well wet rocks reflect light than blasting that monster gnawing on your arm, then the game isn&apos;t for you. There&apos;s a ton of servers even after you put on plenty of filters, so there&apos;s never a worry about not finding a server to play on, the only downfall is that you never know what wave the server is on; joining matches where they&apos;re a round from the final boss or already killing it happens way too often. Overall, I give this game a 10/10 simply because the ratio of the hours I&apos;ve played verses money I spent exceeds 10; in fact, it exceeds 20. eat that L4D.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/killing-floor/user-reviews?user_review_id=740194">Expand</a></span>
