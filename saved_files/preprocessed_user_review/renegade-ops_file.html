I have three minor beefs that make this game a 9 instead of a 10. 1. You cannot rebind the keys. 2. It crashes from time to time. 3. Even if you adjust the master volume, the in-game voice acting volume remains the same as the windows volume (fail). Otherwise, this is excellent.</span>

<br>Well worth a 4-pack to play with friends, a very deep game as there is a stat tree where u can upgrade your vehicles and destroy stuff. From the creators of Just Cause 2 so the physics engine is bananers.</span>

The upgrade system works well making you choose your play style rather than maxing out a character turning the game easy mode. There&apos;s enough challenge to come back to it again and again.</span>

To call it old school or retro I think does it something of disservice, it&apos;s actually more original than that. Renegade Ops takes the old classics, then takes them to a modern level with co-op, persistent characters and tremendous graphics. The camera angle is familiar maybe, and the style of zooming round a large map taking care of different objectives is very Desert Strike (if you can remember that far back) but it&apos;s much more intense than any of the old Strike series, reminiscent of maybe an Ikari Warriors or Mercs style shooter. Of course it&apos;s a simple as a two piece jigsaw puzzle, get car, blow stuff up, but it&apos;s challenging and immense fun with it. It&apos;s a great example of a really fun game based on a really simple idea that is executed with care and attention to detail. Plus it&apos;s cheap like the budgie. I&apos;m not giving it a ten because I think it&apos;s the best thing I ever played, but because I can&apos;t recommend it more highly. It&apos;s definitely worth a go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/renegade-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=1817340">Expand</a></span>

Renegade Ops offers various way of controlling your car through a game-pad or a keyboard, whatever suits your gaming style. The campaign has an interesting climax to it with a dry sense of humor as you complete primary and secondary objectives. Altogether, a great co op game you can play with your friends.

I give this game a 7 because the music i didnt even notice cuz it really had no theme to the game. The gameplay can be frustrating since the vehicles slide all over and sometimes get stuck in places. and the upgrade system is pretty weak for example sometimes the first upgrade is far better than the last in a certain row, which was kinda wierd. Lastly the games replayability isnt really there...Difficulty is right in terms of easy medium and hard, story is good considering what the game is, ya thats it.

A scoring system and level up system adds to replay value though two-thirds of the unlocks are the same thing for all the different drivers. The combat is fun and there are tactical elements that are implemented such as enemies taking more damage if you shoot at them from behind. The grahpics are also very nice and the explosions and destruction looks very good. The controls, though, are not that good, especially with a mouse and keyboard. The way the levels are designed and how you can only move in 8 directions, you are often running into walls or off cliffs. There is also no way to go in reverse, if you want to turn around your car has to go forward and then turn all the way around. This is very frustrating when you are on the edge of a fire pit or are i na narrow hallway and your character will be unable to turn around and will just skid along the wall. Some of the enemies really seem to be a bit over powered, especially rocket trucks and the difficulty significantly increases when you reach the final level. Overall it was a fun little game and is worth ~10 hours of gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/renegade-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=2498416">Expand</a></span>

Because i found Renegade Ops, cooler action and happenings with athmosphere!. This game is A MA ZING   Range Rover. Check. Mounted .50 cal machine gun. Check. Even bigger gun ready to spring out of the boot. Check. Driver&apos;s name is Gunnar. Check. Why hello there &quot;Expendables, the game.&quot;  how are you today? No, I&apos;m not confusing the games here, this is the game that the Expendables license should have been slapped on, it has everything you could possibly want. Big over the top villains, a thoroughly ludicrous story, a main protagonist so masculine that you will feel testosterone seep out of the monitor, and a crew who either should be skydiving, in jail, or both.
<br>
<br>The game runs incredibly smoothly, even when there&apos;s a lot going on, and there&apos;s enough graphical whizzbangery combined with the over the top explosions (yes, everything blows up, and blows up spectacularly) that you&apos;ll feel like you just took a seat in a movie theater to be greeted by Sylvester Stalone and Jason Statham fistbumping. Athmospehre and feeling of great gameful action</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/renegade-ops/user-reviews?user_review_id=3881682">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The controls are easy to learn (should take a look at the options first and activate tank steering), and even though all the drivers look the same, they have unique powers (and different skill trees).
<br>I generally play solo, and I enjoyed this one. Playing with friends is also nice, so you have nothing to worry
<br>
<br>Overall, I enjoyed the game. The story doesn&apos;t matter, it&apos;s a straight arcade shooter, just to have fun destroying stuff. The only problem is that the game seems a bit overpriced for what it offers, that&apos;s for both the game and the dlcs.

It needs special game-pad and keyboard control is so bad, specially vehicle controls. Steering controls changing by vehicle rotation!! forward can be steer to left or right and backward become forward by vehicle rotation!!! the must awful control i ever seen in any game.
