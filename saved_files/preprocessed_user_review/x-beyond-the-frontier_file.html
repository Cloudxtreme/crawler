As a gamer who really misses Wing Commander: Privateer and the original Mechwarrior game for the PC, I&apos;ve been very pleased with X-BTF. It seems to have the same balance of combat tactics and resource strategy that keep the game interesting over the long term: You can switch from Businessman to Demolition Man and vice-versa as the mood takes you.
<br>
<br>As with most sandbox games, you don&apos;t start with much in the way of resources... but there&apos;s no point to playing an empire building game if the empire&apos;s already half-built by the time you start. For newcomers who find the complexity of the more recent games of the X series a bit overwhelming. I&apos;d recommend X-BTF as good way to get a feel for the combat/trading systems and the plot/setting without getting hit by option overload.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-beyond-the-frontier/user-reviews?user_review_id=2569106">Expand</a></span>

However this task of spending more time trying to fix a &quot;scratchy-assed&quot; noise through your speakers, then actually playing the game is left up to us consumers. I&apos;ll just chalk  this X-turd-box series up to a loss. I personally couldn&apos;t &quot;rate&quot; this crap any lower than I did, so I would highly advise steering clear of this, and any other EGOSOFT software in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/x-beyond-the-frontier/user-reviews?user_review_id=3128532">Expand</a></span>
