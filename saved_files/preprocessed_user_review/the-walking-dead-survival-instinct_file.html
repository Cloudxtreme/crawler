The animations look unfinished, concepts are there but not fully implemented, almost everything seems half-arsed and rushed. There appears to be no optimization at all. Changing screen resolution and graphics options crashes my game to desktop followed by a bunch of error messages. It&apos;s as if this was an alpha build and some idiot in charge said, &quot;Release this now!&quot;, and the developers gave up trying to explain to that person that the game wasn&apos;t completed. It should have spent a few more months in development. I don&apos;t even care that the graphics aren&apos;t the best I&apos;ve seen, I was just hoping for a game that actually worked and was finished, and had all the ideas FULLY implemented into them that were talked about while it was in development; a game that put me into the walking dead world and was tense. I just hate to have to give a game such a low score, but the fact that it was released like this with a $50 price tag ticks me off, and I want everyone to know that they should avoid buying this game like the plague. I seriously doubt they can fix (finish) this game by releasing a series of patches. It&apos;s just awful. The one point I do give it is for the fact that they put in RPG elements and the ability to lean to look around corners as well as a few other little things. But these little things that might surprise you and make you say, &quot;hey, that is cool!&quot; are just overshadowed by the gut wrenching fact that they are inside of a big steaming pile of over-priced pooh.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/user-reviews?user_review_id=3057727">Expand</a></span>

But it all let me down... This game became a piece of  The graphics are on really not that bad but still its so crappy! You will ALWAYS find freaking zombies ignoring you and just hitting the wall or breaking a door even if you are just by them! I would have gave this game atleast a 1 out of 10 if it had CO-OP but no! They said they actually wanted to focus on the STORY! Does this look like a good story for you?! The ending is way worse than the ending of Mass Effect 3! The voice acting is really bad and when you send out a survivor for scavenging for some stuff for you he or she will ALWAYS come back with with a tiny little bit of health! Also they will NEVER EVER get valuable stuff! About of 4 survivors you sent will get you about 2 or 1 piece of gas, food, ammo and weapons! They didn&apos;t even try to get the stuff you wanted! And while you fight zombies out there you can have them stay in the car just doing NOTHING! Not even helping you! As a huge fan of the show and the Tell Tale Games&apos; Walking Dead this is a HUGE piece of bull****! This deserves a very bad and stupid 0 OUT OF 10!! I can&apos;t give it a higher rating because of all this crap the game has to offer! Everyone who gives this game a rating over 7 is a dumb idiot who doesn&apos;t know what TRUE games are! Anyway thanks for thinking that this review is helpful so it can make idiots who love this game BELIEVE that it sucks!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/user-reviews?user_review_id=3122011">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m so glad I pirate games before buying them right now. I&apos;ve been hearing good things about &quot;that Walking Dead game&quot; from co-workers for a while, so I gave it a go. I was coming here to see why on Earth they recommended that to me. (Oops!)
<br>
<br>I was told of character depth and exploration, as well as meaning in choices not presented in a binary format. For this game, it&apos;s quite the opposite. Characters are just &quot;there.&quot; I guess you are expected to have seen the early part of this series, which I did not (wish I had, because I hear it was even better toward the beginning). There aren&apos;t really any meaningful choices in the game  which isn&apos;t objectively bad, but it doesn&apos;t have any character development, either.
<br>
<br>There aren&apos;t many weapons, but there&apos;s not an unreasonably limited amount of weapons, which I think would actually be good if the weapons were very different. Unfortunately, a machete pretty much functions the same as a hammer or a sledgehammer, and enemies are all the same, so the weapons&apos; differences (within their own classes [melee, handgun, rifle]) are mostly skin-deep. Melee combat is pretty boring, and I have no idea why auto-aim would be default-enabled on the PC, but melee and ranged combat is fairly well-balanced (that is, the increased power of ranged weapons is often outweighed by the disadvantage of grabbing nearby walkers&apos; attention).
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a &quot;companion&quot; kind of system in the game, but nobody ever fights alongside you in-game. There&apos;s not really any point to it. Survivors generally require more supplies to heal than they&apos;re able to scavenge (none of which I ever ran out of), there&apos;s no special reward, and there&apos;s no reason at all for them to be in the game, really.
<br>
<br>Levels are pretty small, and shockingly enough, repeated over and over in scavenge situations. The devs at least made item and enemy placement in SameLevel semi-random. Praise Jesus for the man who implemented that... I would&apos;ve quit the game early on if I had to go through the exact same scavenge missions.
<br>
<br>The game devs decided to limit inventory, both in how much you can store on-person, and how much you can store in your car. By doing this, they&apos;ve effectively limited how many weapons you&apos;ll ever use. Find a favorite weapon in each class (I brought the early bolt-action rifle and machete to the end), dump the rest.
<br>
<br>The game does a good job at getting a few cheap scares in. It&apos;s no survival horror, though. There were maybe four or five times it managed to catch me off-guard, and the first few levels gave me the sense of dread. They give you more powerful weapons as you progress and same-strength enemies, so combat ends up very uneven, totally ruining the atmosphere they appeared to be going for. That said, you can just go through the game with a first-level melee weapon without much trouble. I somehow managed to get the game to run at 2x speed (did this when I enabled &quot;windowed&quot; mode) on the last three levels and didn&apos;t have any problems getting through. It actually made the game feel much more intense.
<br>
<br>The game is indeed about 5 hours long. There&apos;s replay value in that you&apos;re forced to choose between &quot;story&quot; levels, so you can go back and do the other ones (not that you&apos;d want to). -But really, it&apos;s probably the shortest non-indie game I&apos;ve ever played. With a pretty mediocre graphics engine (or poorly utilized one, perhaps), it&apos;s shocking that this game takes up &gt;8gB of storage. I&apos;m not at all sure how they managed that.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a forgettable, unpolished game with little depth. I&apos;m giving it 3/10, but the game was running at 2x speed through the end level, so all I remember was shooting a bunch of super-fast zombies in the face with a machine gun, which was a pretty decent ending for me!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/user-reviews?user_review_id=3171452">Expand</a></span>

(The PC version) Has very little health and ammo powerups unlike from what I&apos;ve heard on the console that they have tons of health and ammo everywhere. This game completely disappointed me and I wish they would have taken more time to develop it as it could have been something great! But again it&apos;s a NAME cash cow game that takes the player by surprise after you buy it.

This is such a copy and paste shooter with a weak story line and brain dead AI. The quick time event is so annoying when attacked by a horde. I love the Tv show and I guess that is the only reason to buy this game. Instead get the telltale Walking Dead Game. IT IS AWESOME!</span>

But the rest of the game is just AWFUL, the game play is just so repetitive, the story is boring, lazy and pointless. The ZOMBIES have a terrible A.I, terrible and insulting ending for the fans of the TV show. Repeating side missions and broken mechanics. Worst game of 2013 so far.</span>

I could only stomach about 40 minutes of this trash until I wanted to throw my mouse at the wall.
<br>
<br>The graphics look like a Playstation 1 game, the sounds are repetitive and annoying, but the one thing that makes this game total garbage is the horrifying controls, most notably the forced Mouse Acceleration that makes aiming and navigating a complete disaster.
<br>
<br>Not only does it have the most retarded Mouse Acceleration, but the mouse aiming will just glitch out and start sticking on different parts of the screen.
<br>
<br>An unplayable travesty of a game. And to make matters worse, the devs still won&apos;t recognize or fix the horrible controls and mouse issues, which shows you how little they care. I couldn&apos;t play any more of this if someone was paying me.
<br>
<br>Stay well away from this abomination.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/user-reviews?user_review_id=3565199">Expand</a></span>

I seriously believe that this is what Activision has been reduced to: making bad games to cash in on licenses. This newest FPS cash in is very short so I will make this review short and spoiler free in regard. Walking Dead: Survival Instinct doesn&apos;t deserve $50 nor does it deserve $10. Survival Instinct is a complete disrespect to the license and its fans. On the PC version, you will experience horrendous frame rate drops from dated graphics that look like they could have been made for the PlayStation 2 and XBOX. A lazy story that ends abruptly with loose ends (though I seriously doubt Activision is going to release any DLC for this disaster). Terrible voice acting with some of the worst AI I&apos;ve ever encountered because on five different occurrences, the Walkers in this game RAN....yes RAN!!! Also keep in mind that Terminal Reality is used the same engine that was used for Star Wars: Kinect. With that in mind you will experience badly timed QTEs and mini games that probably come from iPhone games and climbing mechanics straight out of Minecraft. If you are a fan of the series then stick with Telltale&apos;s version of The Walking Dead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/user-reviews?user_review_id=3047605">Expand</a></span>

It looks like cheap games done 5-7years ago. I said OK... Nevermind, its all about athmosphere so i go on. I played like 30 minutes, got almost done 1st mission and suddenly... game crash! Checkpoints not saved, so i had to start mission over again from the beginning. Next bad thing about TWD: SI, it just freezes all the time, its hard to aim in it at all. There are some better things like map travels, equipment, but its definitly not worth its price. What a waste, especially when there are such awesome characters like Daryl and Merle used.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/user-reviews?user_review_id=3049258">Expand</a></span>

I have to agree with GameDev11 on this one and say it&apos;s a rushed title with little to no effort put into it, just to collect on the payout of the &apos;Walking Dead&apos; label/franchise. Save your money  I see this game dropping down to $5 just like Duke Nukem did within a month or two.</span>

The basics of the game is you travel from instanced area to area with one main mission with optional side-quests thrown in, allowing you to do things such as change vehicles, get extra supplies, and find other survivors. Vehicles determine how many extra survivors you can have when travelling from one area to the next. At the beginning of each area, you can assign tasks to the survivors such as searching for ammo, finding gas, or finding food (healing). It all sounded so cool and the ideas were there, the lore was there; but the execution was piss poor. The combat gets tired after 15 minutes and the gameplay repetitive, nothing you do or the choices you make really seem of relevance, you don&apos;t ever get into the story before it just ends. Pretty bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/user-reviews?user_review_id=3377539">Expand</a></span>

The oposite of &quot;The Walking Dead: A Telltale Game Series&quot;. The only good think is the recorded voice Daryl and his brother. Dont buy this trash! It is an insult to the franchize.</span>

<br>Gameplay:horrible.Its very repetitive and basic.It requires no skill no timing,nothing to be quite frank.Its just mouse button mashing over and over again.Weapons variety is poor and all the melee weapons do same damage also it takes 4 hits to kill a zombie no matter where you hit it.Also gameplay is very linear and map design isn&apos;t impressive at all.Also FOV is very narrow and there&apos;s no way for you to change it.
<br>Graphics:yeh,they are bad.But the thing is that its a game from activision it&apos;s not an indie game.It looks like the game is made out of clay.Everyone expects good graphics from such a huge company but be prepared to be disappointed.This game looks ugly,it&apos;s obvious that they didn&apos;t even try to make this game look good.
<br>Sounds:i guess its OK at best.Dialogues feel forced and since they are poorly written voice-over makes them sound awkward.
<br>Bottom line:an obvious cash in on the franchise.Game is rushed out,it has nothing unique in it,nothing worth while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/user-reviews?user_review_id=3042572">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is bad, the graphics are bad, the story is linear, and no effort was put to create this game, and the pc port is awful. Also, so many fake reviews and rates. Casually, some of these people have rated only and only this game high for all platforms. Pathetic.</span>

<br>taking out the fact of (poor) interacting with other survivors, scavenge of new items for continue adventure with new cars, weapons and more, the game include lack of graphics and Gameplay, that makes the game boring and repetitive...
<br>The history isn&apos;t that bad, but isn&apos;t good though, resuming: only a REAL fan (like me!) will TOLERATE a ONE time gameplay (you finish the game, and you put on your game stash and never touch him again...)
<br>Other positive point is the GREAT voice os Norman Reedus and Michael Rooker, they were good in the series, they were good in the game too...
<br>Well, if you aren&apos;t a REAL BIG FAN of TWD, i think you should prefer to play Left 4 Dead, or No More Room In Hell, even The War Z (just kidding, haha)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/user-reviews?user_review_id=3049915">Expand</a></span>

<br>This wasn&apos;t a megadevelopment project by EA Games (hey look you weren&apos;t robbed!).  Regardless, the graphics aren&apos;t notable, but they don&apos;t really detract from the game once you get into it.  It is EXTREMELY immersive.  The survival aspects are really fun.  If you start firing a rifle in the middle of town, the hordes are coming for you and you&apos;re screwed.. this I&apos;ve never seen in another zombie game!  You can use stealth and cunning to more efficiently take zombies out.. it&apos;s kind of a sandbox in that you have tasks, but you are free to complete them however you like.  Norman Reedus does an outstanding job of doing the voiceovers (sooo much better than what other actors have done in video games!), and his voiceovers aren&apos;t just in cut scenes, but also when he&apos;s killing zombies or gathering supplies.  The storyline is consistent with The Walking Dead.  This was done in collaboration with AMC, and was obviously written by the show&apos;s writers.  Even if it wasn&apos;t so much fun, so scary, and so challenging, it&apos;s a look into how the Dixon brothers got where they were in Season1 Episode1... and that&apos;s some really sweet icing on the cake!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/user-reviews?user_review_id=3042894">Expand</a></span>

<br>The gameplay, brings something new to the table, you have a fairly deccent item manager, you can gather supplies which is pretty cool, and you can get survivor for your group.

<br>The graphics looks like the game has 10 years, the playability is not bad, but is not smooth and therefor is not good either.  The story is kind of lame and confuse. And I passed it really quick.
<br>The thing that it really lacks, and I missed it a lot, was the loot system. It doesn&apos;t have one. I wanted to loot everything! But I got nothing.
<br>But, it&apos;s not everything bad. It requires you to be stealthy because fight more than 2 zombies will get you killed. Which is a good thing. Daryl shows up, as well as Merle, but rare are the times you see Merle.
<br>Zombies are dumb, slow, and ugly. But they are not scary. Not sure if it&apos;s a good or bad thing.
<br>The weapons are cool, probably the best thing in the game, but when you have the really nice ones, where you can kill hordes of zombies, the game ends...
<br>Well, I give it a 5 because the game is not that bad. The thing is: It was pretty disappointing. I expected a nice game, playable, looking good and maybe some rpg experience. But instead I got an ugly, hard to play, confuse and too linear.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/user-reviews?user_review_id=3093827">Expand</a></span>

This game is not for you if you are trigger happy. Guns are used sparingly and only in a bind. You draw a herd and you will most likely die.  If you love the show...  I recommend.</span>

<br>
<br>I felt the AI was aptly responsive and worked very well. This is not the Left 4 Dead series... getting hit means soemthing... Stealth is somewhat required.
<br>
<br>Sure, there could be more graphics tweaks, or coop, or pvp... but the game was just released... who knows what they may have in store later. Until then I found the game stimulating and entertaining all around. I also experienced no glitches or bugs.
<br>
<br>At the end of the day.. this game was created for hardcore Walking Dead fans... which I am  and I love the game.
<br>
<br>The game could be salvaged from a &quot;marketing&quot; standpoint quickly by releasing more meaty content for the game.. and not charging the players for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/user-reviews?user_review_id=3118100">Expand</a></span>

The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct focuses on a character who is exclusive to the TV show called Daryl Dixon and is currently a fan favourite. Daryl Dixon started out as a racist redneck who only cared for his own survival, since the second and third series of the TV show, the character has changed a lot and has attracted a large number of fans.
<br>
<br>The game is a prequel to the show and you start out by learning what happened during Daryl&apos;s early days during the undead scourge. While there aren&apos;t any amazing revelations, you do get a bit more information about the characters and there are some characters that get referenced in passing.
<br>
<br>The good things about this game include a solid combat engine and a range of weapons to choose from. While the combat is not quite as good as Dead Island, you can reliably take down Walkers with stealth attacks and later get stronger weapons.
<br>
<br>Each melee weapon is different from the speedy but weak hammer to the heavy and slow sledgehammer that can take down walkers in a single hit. In terms of guns you have pistols, shotguns, rifle and of course Daryl&apos;s trusty crossbow. You&apos;ll want to use the crossbow as much as you can to kill walkers silently and retrieve your crossbow bolts.
<br>
<br>Silence is important because walkers pick up on sound a lot. One way you can draw walkers away is by throwing a bottle or a flare in the opposite direction, when they charge towards the noise you slip past them the other way.
<br>
<br>As you progress through the game you&apos;ll want to pick up food rations, weapons, ammunition and fuel. Fuel is important for making your way across the map on the road sections. Some of these sections will give you a choice, do you move the car stuck on the road or take an alternative route?
<br>
<br>One great feature of the game is the survivor management. As you progress in the game, you get access to different survivors. You can only pick up a certain number of survivors, based on the size of your vehicle. While you may sometimes want to save everyone, ultimately you sometimes have to choose a location and hope for the best. Some survivors are also only found on the random encounters and so can be overlooked. It&apos;s worth helping them survive since you get a bonus at the end of the game.
<br>
<br>Sadly it&apos;s not all non-stop fun and there are a few bad points about this game. This game is relentlessly hard, with no difficulty select screen. This means that if you&apos;re not careful, you will die many times until you learn how to move around properly and what areas are dangerous to be in. You can sometimes get away from walkers in buildings, but often you can get trapped and face an early demise.
<br>
<br>Another gripe with many people is the game length. At most, the campaign mode can be completed in around 5-8 hours. In other games this isn&apos;t such a major problem, but since there is no multiplayer or co-operative modes of any kind, it&apos;s a big big problem. The ending is also a bit of a let down as it doesn&apos;t really fill in any gaps or explain anything of importance.
<br>
<br>If you have the option of getting Dead Island then I would suggest that you try that game out first, as it&apos;s fairly cheap. Otherwise you could potentially get this game but I would say you should get it cheap, simply because of it&apos;s length and problems. It&apos;s still pretty fun at times though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/user-reviews?user_review_id=3063790">Expand</a></span>

The game is not worth 50 bucks, that&apos;s why i bought it on sale (50%off). The game-play and voice acting are pretty well done. If you are a fan of the walking dead tv series then this is the game for you. You do need some patients for this game though. Over all this was a pretty fun game.</span>

<br>
<br>The Walking Dead: Survival Instincts brings you into an apocalyptic world where zombies roam the world. Throughout the game you play as Daryl Dixon, one of the main characters from the television show. In Survival Instincts, the story line gives general players and fans of The Walking Dead and insight look of how Daryl, and his brother Merle Dixon, met up with the main group and what they went through before that time occurred as well as show how Daryl achieved his ever-so famous crossbow.
<br>
<br>The Graphics
<br>
<br>Graphics quality in Survival Instincts somewhat lacks a dynamic punch, for example a walkers, otherwise known as a zombie, hair looks like it was made of glue or clay then molded onto the head. However, the diversity of each walkers face has it&apos;s own unique pattern of bite marks, scratches, shapes of the jaw, teeth and more, these all add to a good fright factor at the right moment of time e.g in a dark room, turning round and a walker attacks you out of no where. There are a great amount of bugs relating to graphics, such as broken fence pieces still floating midair, gates flashing black when opened, walkers floating when killed. All around missions have invisible walls, preventing you from going further away from the current map without any sort of police barricade, for example, taking away a bit of the realistic touch.
<br>
<br>The Mechanics and sound
<br>
<br>The AI is very sloppy, throughout gameplay I had opened a metal fence and the walkers still attacked the fence, paying no attention to me whatsoever, I then began to kill them one by one. When one walker died another took its place, as if they were lining up to die. The scavenging mechanics allow you to gather survivors and send them out to gather supplies, but the amount of survivors depends on the size of the car you currently have. That said, there are missions that allow you to find car keys to either bigger, or smaller, cars. When sending out survivors to scavenge for supplies, there is always a chance of getting them killed by walkers, depending on what item you give them to defend themselves with as each survivor has their own skill trait such as being good at using blunt weapons. There were countless sound bugs within this game, fences breaking with the sound of wood getting chopped, walkers dying with the sound of a metal fence breaking and more. The game includes a feature where the player can choose a method of travel such as highways, streets and backroads. Depending on what method you choose, one method can either consume less fuel or another method may take a road such as backroads where it consumes a lot of fuel with a high chance of breaking down. If, by chance, your car breaks down or runs out of fuel, a side mission will take place allowing you to scavenge the nearby area for fuel or car hose. The issue with the side missions is that they&apos;re very repetitive, as there are about 3-4 different areas.
<br>
<br>The Gameplay
<br>
<br>It felt a bit stiff trying to kill walkers, e.g using the sledgehammer was a lot quicker than normal. One thing that gives a good addition to gameplay is sneaking around, trying to sneak past walkers and stealth killing them by sneaking up from behind and executing the stealth kill action. Like any realistic movie or game, gun fire attracts walkers to your location so be sure to only use your gun in dire situations and ammo is scarce to watch out, you don&apos;t want to run out of ammo when you desperately need it. If you ever happen to get grabbed by a walker, it activates a grappling mechanic where the player must place the circle onto the walkers head, activate the attack trigger and stab them in the head. This method breaks fighting gameplay by 50% due to the fact after killing the walker that grabbed you, if there is another walker, it will grab you almost instantly after you let go of the previous walker, this allows you to kill over 15 walkers without using any ammo, losing any health and just drains the fun and realism out of the game entirely. On the last mission, near the very end the last thing you did is mount a military vehicles machine gun and kill any incoming zombies, after which it cuts to black screen and goes to the credits, without showing you how exactly Daryl and Merle met the group like the game was purposely made for.
<br>
<br>Final Verdict
<br>
<br>The game seems rushed, only to gain quick money. For the price of $49.99 or &#xA3;31.99 makes the game a complete rip off, due to the lack of effort of the game. I feel the only reason others need to buy this game, is to play as Daryl Dixon and get to see Merle, even though he is barely in the game. A poor effort to a great series that could have become something incredible if more time was put into it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct/user-reviews?user_review_id=3604952">Expand</a></span>

Graphics, as you say  in general, the game is similar to the first part of the Diablo drawn in Paint.

Do not understand why it was build as 2 brothers surviving together and all u see is merle standing outside the mission zone. The water/food idea good but again poorly executed. Like the scavaging aspect AGAIN POORLY EXECUTED. Found myself running through majority of herds. The ability to choose your route is cool but should have been 2 endings 1for each route u took. BIGGEST GRIPE. You tell me I GET TO BE DARYL which is my favorite  and lots of peoples fav. His signature weapon is what? THE CROSSBOW!....When do you get the crossbow....AFTER YOU BEAT THE ENTIRE GAME! Seriously!!! Co-op LESS BUGS and not being rushed so much would have gotten at 6or7 from me for at least trying to give us what you built the game up to be.  for now   A 5 OUT OF 1O &amp; Lucky for it.  Only positive is it is not 2 long  has easy achievements for you hunters out there. and you do get some pretty bloody zombie kills and will get ur hands on a somewhat decent variety of melee weapons and slightly less variety of guns. UNTIL OF COURSE YOU BEAT THE GAME.  cheap way to get replay value almost brought me to give them a 4 but To be honest a 5 to me means  not total garbage &amp; unplayable  but not something i&apos;d play multiple times over or recommend to people

When telltale&apos;s game got the game of the year reward, they saw it as a opportunity to earn money, and out came this game. The game has some interesting ideas, but if they took the time to actually make the game good, then this would have been acceptable.
