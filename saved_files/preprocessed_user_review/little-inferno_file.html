It is a game from the developers of &quot;World of Goo&quot;, visually and stylistically they are very similar. However, this is where similarities end. &quot;Little Inferno&quot; is not a game in a normal sense of word, you just take different toys and watch them burn in the fireplace. With over a hundred different toys with different animations you will have some fun indeed, but it quickly get repetitive. You will skim through all toys in a few hours, There&apos;s no real challenge. You need to find &quot;combos&quot; (burn specific items together) to progress, and while the game gives you hints on the available combos, it is still largely trial and error. Having to accumulate money to buy toys and wait for them to deliver/restock makes this process more of a burden than fun. The story is thin and unsatisfying. While some fourth-wall breaking adds a pleasant twist, it just is too simple. It doesn&apos;t really develop most of the themes hinted through the game.
<br>
<br>Overall, while this game can be fun, it definitely a very short one and also a fun not for everyone. Nowhere near to World of Goo.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=2777103">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is sadly a joke. Its about putting stuff inside your fireplace and burning them. Which might sound like an intriguing setting for a puzzle game. This is however not a puzzle game. The gameplay is based around buying stuff from a catalog, waiting for the stuff to arrive, putting them in your fireplace, lighting them on fire, waiting for the fire to go out and then repeating the process. And this gets old kind of fast. The only puzzle-like element in this game is that you get combos needed to advance by burning two specific items together based around a vague achievement-like sentence found at the top of your screen. Which aint all that satisfying. The story in this game might have its charm but when the gameplay is both dull and unsatisfying you start to wonder why they chose to make a video-game instead of a movie. But it doesn&apos;t  matter if you consider this an interactive movie or a video game. I do personally not recommend this entertainment product since i didn&apos;t have a good time with it. And it aint more complicated than that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=3038505">Expand</a></span>

It has an interesting &quot;story&quot; if you will that gets you thinking. Not much of a reason for another play through after you beat it.

Little Inferno will never be remembered as a great game (it&apos;s not really &quot;great&quot;, and it&apos;s not even really a game) but it&apos;s a funny way to spend some hours.
<br>The final sequence is boring as hell but ehi you don&apos;t have to watch it all.</span>

<br>
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, this game has some flaws of course. First of all, it is not that long and will not take long before you complete it. Some puzzles are really easy or requires some sort of common knowledge, but Google usually helps you with references. Also some more animations or special items might have been better and finally, this game requires a DLC A.S.A.P.
<br>
<br>The game is simple: you are basically burning up things and get money from them and with that money, you buy other stuff to burn. The trick is, there are some combos between some items that requires you to burn them together. For example (this is not a spoiler since this is not an existing combo) burning a sugar and a car will get you Sugar Rush Combo. Puzzles depends on the name of items, the description of items or some pop culture references.
<br>
<br>As of today, the game is on Steam Summer Sale so I strongly suggest you to buy it, you will not be sorry </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=3283544">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s fun to watch how things burn, but there&apos;s not a lot of challenge apart from finding combos.  The quirky humor caries it through the few hours you&apos;ll spend playing it, but there&apos;s not a lot of replay value.  The soundtrack and art aesthetic, however, are fantastic.</span>

There&apos;s no story, and it&apos;s certainly not a masterpiece, as some reviews claim. There&apos;s also a very weird time delay on the stuff you can burn. I found myself literally staring at the screen waiting for my items to arrive from the ingame shop.. in a single player game. That&apos;s just inexcusable. Why would a developer want to bore their players like that? It&apos;s kinda like having a 2 minute respawn-time if you die or reload your game in Half-Life.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=2858311">Expand</a></span>

Developers might have tried to do simple and fun game, but game is too simple and idea does not evolve during gameplay. It is the big minus. Maybe this game could be nice and simple for kids.</span>

It was a work of art from the art style, the music, the puzzles, and most importantly the gameplay and story.  Right when I saw Little Inferno on steam I got very excited to see what these guys would bring in the realm of great puzzles and interesting stories next but I was extremely dissapointed and honestly feel ripped off.  Not many games have made me actually feel ripped off as if I payed too much for the product.  Off the top of my head the games that I have honestly REGRETED purchasing were dead island, AC revelations/brotherhood, and now Little Inferno.  The great art style and amazing soundtrack is still there but thats where anything good ends.  Let me summarize this game for you so you can decide if you want to purchase this without any spoilers:
<br>
<br>-The game consists entireley of buying (with fake currency) a toy or object, dragging it with other objects into a sqaure fire place and buring them together trying to get combinations of 2 or 3 together.  A small hint is supplied for each combo.  That is literally 99% of this game.  There are a few cool effects that some of the objects have with each other or with fire but thats only cool the first time, not the [explitive] 30th time you burn that crap.  I literally felt nauseaus and had a headache after playing this game, there is no actual puzzle to stimulate your mind or challenge you, it is literally just reading a hint like &quot;bear trap&quot; and buying a bear toy and a trap toy and burning them together to get more coins to do the whole process over again with a different toy.  My intelligence felt insulted from this game, I started playing it thinking, &quot;Okay this is just the beginning, the whole game cant possibly just be this&quot; and lo and behold that is all the game consists of short of a ***minor spoilers*** very short, confusing, and non interesting albeit slightly funny ending sequence that Tomorrow Corp (2D Boy) tried to make seem interesting with slightt &quot;mysterious&quot; letters sent to you throughout the game.
<br>
<br>Please dont think for a SECOND that this game is anywhere near as good, interesting, or even charming as World of Goo.  Thats the only reason that I bought this game and I will NEVER be tricked by 2D Boy again, even if they change there name a third time.  This literally felt like a [expletive]ing childs game suitable for an age range of 2-at the very most 10 but whats worse is I wouldnt even suggest it for children because it could give them the idea to play with fire so it obviously wasnt even geared towards children.  Save your money but if you absolutely must have it and dont beleive me, then at least wait for a steam sale or a Humble Indie bundle with the game, I wouldnt even buy this game for $5 unless that went to helping a charity.  Youve lost a big fan 2D Boy aka Tomorrow Corp, but world of goo shall still remain one of my favorite games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=2778962">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t see people playing this more than a day but it&apos;s relatively cheap so it is what it is as they say.</span>

The story and ending MORE than make up for it though. I liken it to Portal 2  in that I personally found the puzzles tedious to traverse, but it was well worth getting through them to see the epic bits of the story in between. Much like Portal 2, it&apos;s one of those games where the experience will stick with you for a very long time. The gameplay is based around burning items, which drop &quot;Tomorrow Bucks&quot; so that you can buy more things to burn. There are combos to achieve and many items have unique effects when burnt, so that side of the game is surprisingly fun. What I don&apos;t like is that you have to WAIT for the items to be delivered. It&apos;s not too bad in the beginning when they only take about five seconds to arrive, but for the last items near the end of the game you have to wait around five minutes, which is absurd. There are express delivery tokens which each take about thirty seconds off the delivery time of a single item, that you can get from completing combos and sometimes from burning items. But there are never really enough of them  so you will end up running out a lot and having to wait the full delivery time.

<br>The music, is excellent. I actually have some of the OST in my music playlist. The story I won&apos;t spoil but trust me, it is very very good. As for the cost, on Steam it has almost halved since the release, now costing &#xA3;6.99.
<br>
<br>I can see why people thought that &#xA3;12 was a waste of money for this, as it only really takes about three to four hours to complete. But despite all of this game&apos;s little flaws, even for that much money I have got WAY more enjoyment out of it than your average generic and brown shooter that costs three times as much, And especially seeing as the price has dropped, I would highly recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=3033502">Expand</a></span>

<br>Buy this game when it&apos;s on sale. Like it is now. Go buy it on steam for 4$, unless you are reading this after March 18 2013.

<br>This is the entire game. There are no tricks to this  you can just set anything on fire by clicking on it. There&apos;s nothing else to the game. It is 100% setting things on fire in your fireplace. Over and over and over again.
<br>
<br>There is some attempt to add a puzzle to the game with &quot;combos&quot;, where you get a little gold star for burning the right two (or three) items together, but there&apos;s nothing special about burning them together other than the specific combo name  nothing special happens.
<br>
<br>The game is not really even a game so much as it is an utter waste of time. It feels like some terrible social game, as you don&apos;t even get the items you ordered instantly but have to wait for them to arrive, just so you can burn them.
<br>
<br>The game takes hours to go through and gives you nothing in return. Do not buy this game. Do not play this game. It is utter drivel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=3428649">Expand</a></span>

And never has a game managed to make me question myself and the whole gaming world as much as in the final few minutes of this game. It&apos;s true, it&apos;s not really a game, it&apos;s a statement. An epic interactive story which makes you think and question the way games are played nowadays and how big corporations try everything to pull as much money as possible out of your pocket.
<br>You can also see it as a story of hope, a kick in the a** if you will.
<br>Some people don&apos;t want that from a game, i understand that. These people won&apos;t like it at all.
<br>This is a wonderful breath of fresh air and will not be forgotten very soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=2784658">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Innovative, quirky, and fun despite a very Seinfeldian &quot;about nothing&quot; premise. You buy toys, you burn toys, and then you buy more toys. You burn them in combos to earn extra coin. The commentary and light story along the well are very well done. The graphics are cute and fit the game well. It was a fun 3 hours and I recommend the game if you can find it on sale.</span>

<br>
<br>This is not the sequel to World Of Goo, While the game is referenced multiple times, it&apos;s purely a fan factor inserted by 2D, This is again going to start a new genre of casual gaming that isn&apos;t dull puzzle games(Which lets be fair, World Of Goo started), for a &#xA3;6 title, this game is worth every penny and right now, you can get it for &#xA3;4 on humble bundle with 6 other great indie titles! The critic&apos;s do the game no justice, 2D attempted to make a dynamic sandbox fireplace game and they did it well too, This game is no more and no less than that and I found it incredibly entertaining and not once did a flaw jump out at me, thats why Little Inferno gets a perfect score!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=3191009">Expand</a></span>

The story is vague but that&apos;s what makes it unique and the little point and click adventure at the end throws some variation into the game, using some very cool narrative storytelling to finally explain what you have been doing all this time.

Their most famous other game is the legendary World of Goo, a game that was so deep and so challenging, that it tickled minds while blowing them at the same time. So, is Little Inferno of World of Goo Quality? I&apos;m sorry to say that that&apos;s not the case here. Nothing could be such a masterpiece as World of Goo was, even if it&apos;s by the same people. But of all the games I&apos;ve played, Little Inferno game me the familiar feeling that I was playing a game by the same people. It was a nice feeling as it always is. Little Inferno is really more of a fun experimental game rather than a real big game. The gameplay to it is so simple. Buy things, burn them for more money, find combos. Rinse and repeat. But where the game truly shines is in its storytelling. It tells a story of a world that&apos;s freezing as it constantly snows. It has gotten to the point where a fireplace where you burn whatever has been considered a toy for entertainment. How aware this game can become and how deep it&apos;s meaning becomes is just amazing. But there are three glaring issues. Since it&apos;s by the same people, the game has to be compared to World of Goo, and putting the two against each other, Little Inferno sadly doesn&apos;t stand a chance. The second problem is that the game is way too easy to beat. There are few combos that really make you experiment as many tend to be so easy, it&apos;s almost idiotic. The last problem I have with it is that for how little game you&apos;re given, they ask for quite a bit for a game that wastes your time quite a bit just to make a point. They do it quite well I will admit, but this game shouldn&apos;t cost us $10. I got it on sale but it wasn&apos;t really worth as much to me. I bought World of Goo for that much and it felt like it was worth so much more. So whether or not you think Little Inferno is worth your time is up to you. Despite all my complaints, I loved the game. The question really is: How much patience do you have? The game wastes time, but do you think it will be time well wasted?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=3054754">Expand</a></span>

Had I paid another cent I would&apos;ve been furious. As it is, I&apos;ve beaten the game within four hours today and have paid $1 per hour of fun. For a game that typically boasts a $10-$15 price tag there should be MUCH more content. While everything I&apos;ve said is nothing you haven&apos;t already heard about this game I&apos;ll offer this: If you can get the game on sale (Like this weekend, 3/15/13 until 3/18) do it and do it with the knowledge that you&apos;re buying a $4 toy, not a game. That&apos;s what Little Inferno is: a toy. Sadly, this toy loses it&apos;s charm after the first play-through, and the &quot;ending&quot; is about as useless as a flat tire (and that&apos;s how it comes across: flat). Come to think of it, perhaps the $4 sale price is STILL too high. If you have $4 to burn (pun intended) and you haven&apos;t already played the Binding of Isaac (or another excellent $4/$5 game), you could do slightly worse than this somewhat charming game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=3033340">Expand</a></span>

This game, whether for 10 dollars or 4 dollars, at the price I bought it, is worth every single ounce of work you put behind that currency to buy it. It&apos;s relatively 4-5 hours long, depending on how long you wish to play with the effects and your ingenuity, but Little Inferno possesses the tones and themes of a classical literature piece. While at face value it either appears to be &quot;yet another moody indie game&quot; or just a sandbox waste of time, it slowly sheds this shallow skin, and when accompanied by such a moving and triumphant musical score, brings emotions to the surface.  This game is not for everyone, but I will say that if you are either at an impasse in your life, waiting at the brink of something grand, or you are sitting stagnant for far too long, then it will resonate with you. The climax of the game is almost a religious experience, as if the tale of Oedipus embracing his blindness to shut himself off to the world, but played in reverse. Somehow, 2D Boy was able to keep me leaning forward, staring at a fireplace that had not changed for almost 4 hours. Truly, those who did not play till the very end are just like our friend Oedipus, earnest heart, but blind to the world.  In short, this game surprised. I would recommend it. Also the gameplay is fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=3035444">Expand</a></span>

Much like games like Doodle God or Little Alchemy, Little Inferno is about combining things; combining them, and then obliterating them with all-consuming fire. The game is darkly satirical, and it personally struck all the right chords with me. While the game is ridiculously simple in its one main form of interaction, it is strangely absorbing. A sick sense of morbid delight is elicited from you as you burn up sometimes cute, sometimes creepy toys and objects.  The game has some strong themes reminiscent of Aldous Huxley&apos;s classic dystopian novel, Brave New World. While it provides cynical laughter over Huxley&apos;s pessimistic grimace, Little Inferno is genuinely moving from time to time, and upsetting and unnerving at others. Little Inferno&apos;s main problem is that it&apos;s rather short. My first playthrough (that is, from beginning of story to end, not a 100% completion mark) lasted a little over three hours. During all that time, though, I was either having fun or ruminating on the concepts the developers presented in a subtle, clever way. I do hate that, later in the game, when items get costlier, they also toke longer to generate; I would sometimes stare at my fireplace for a few minutes while they were shipped to me. It was an irksome stumbling block for my destructive habits. Finally, the final phase of the game was kind of slipshod. It felt tacked-on, rushed, and not altogether there. The final phase wasn&apos;t bad per se, or any less interesting than all the rest, it just introduced game play elements that didn&apos;t need to be there. Still, this game is worth experiencing, if only for the five hours spent revisiting the kid in you who used to burn anthills with a magnifying glass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=3184614">Expand</a></span>

<br>I had expected a terrible game after reading some of the reviews. I hated Doodle God with a passion, and Little Inferno has similar gameplay. However, I found myself loving this game for its short duration. The game&apos;s atmosphere is wonderful, and the story is short, but very enjoyable. I love the items too... they&apos;re funny and they&apos;re entertaining when they burn.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is a bit lackluster. The combos make sense most of the time, but a small handful of them require some moon logic. A bit of the time is spent waiting for items to arrive... you really have to manage time well to avoid sitting and doing nothing.
<br>
<br>Thankfully, everything else makes up for the gameplay. The story, graphics, and sound are on par with World of Goo, which was phenomenal. Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable experience, and I&apos;d recommend it to anyone that can enjoy a more patient game. Wait for it to go on sale, though... I beat it in only a few hours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=3186203">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a brief, incredible experience that force you to wait, and in turn to idle and think. A beautiful story not nearly as simple as it seems on the surface, wrapped up in fascinating moral dilemmas and tests of the player&apos;s humanity will blow your mind and make you think. I played it a good three and a half months ago and still think about it all the time. i still listen to the soundtrack, I still debate in my mind what the true messages were. Don&apos;t look it up. Don&apos;t read reviews. Stop it. Close those tabs. You found your game. The gameplay isn&apos;t &quot;fun&quot;, but it isn&apos;t supposed to be. Especially recommended to fans of classic movies, literature or ESPECIALLY creative writing and advanced English studies. The less you know going in, the better.
<br>
<br>Just don&apos;t quit until the ending. Believe in your heart that every seemingly monotonous task WILL be worth it in the end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=4608714">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s quite simple and slow paced, but is quite enjoyable playing relaxed and attending to the hidden story.
<br>Maybe I&apos;m happier with it because I took it on a Steam offer, getting it for 2 bucks or similar...
<br>In my opinion, good game!</span>

I found myself completely immersed and entranced by the games universe that is filled with quirk and morbid charm.

This game took me only 5 hours to finish which is short but the ending alone really makes this game special for me. In fact, the ending to this game is probably one my favourite endings to any game I&apos;ve played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=3109350">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This game is a fun little toy...You burn stuff. Thats all there is. The items do special stuff (Like credit card burst into money.) And there are some puzzle aspects in the game like combining items. But the part that I LOVE is the story and art design. the first 2 hours is you burning stuff but the last 15mins is a amazing story. I would wait tip this game is on sale it is not worth the price.</span>

It certainly isn&apos;t for everyone, but it is an indie game, indie games are not for everyone. The art style and story telling are still in the same style that you are used from World of Goo. However the game play is certainly different.
<br>It is a game about burning items and while doing so it both mocks itself as well as the micro transaction trend in the gaming industry. Besides that it has an interesting story that is even more important than it was in World of Goo as well as more interesting. That is also necessary since without the story the game play alone wouldn&apos;t be enough to make this a good game, with the two combined it makes it an excellent game. Since it is often sold in the humble bundles you can get it for just a few dollars, for that price it is just perfect. A couple hours of fun and a nice story, going to the movies is more expensive and lasts shorter.
<br>
<br>However if you don&apos;t care about a story a game is telling and only care about game play, this game probably isn&apos;t for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/little-inferno/user-reviews?user_review_id=3882007">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros:
<br>Charm
<br>Surprisingly emotional
<br>Unbeatable soundtrack
<br>FIRE!!!!
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Item delivery times get tedious
<br>
<br>Little inferno is unique, but can be slow at times...you can also burn a toaster, what more could you want?</span>
