<br>
<br>This game caught my eye when it was still pay to play and in the beginning I enjoyed playing it quite a lot.
<br>The tutorials are great, although I think they should actually be somehow enforced to avoid completely unaware players of diving into PvP without any knowledge of the game&apos;s or heroes&apos;s mechanics.
<br>The maps were plenty and new ones were being introduced with updates. They were symmetrical so there were no balance issues.
<br>The ORIGINAL heroes are well thought of and relatively well balanced. The ninja was only OP if the enemy team doesn&apos;t actually play as a team, which happens very often.
<br>The graphics have that cartoonish look which to be honest I don&apos;t mind that much, not every game needs to have outstanding textures and special effects to be good and I think this one did that.
<br>The control and movement does need some work, sometimes it feels like you&apos;re playing on ice and it often ends in you falling, sometimes into lava.
<br>
<br>But then the bigger problems started appearing...
<br>
<br>The player base was small, which was expected since the game had not been released for too long, and as a consequence joining a game sometimes took longer than 45 minutes.
<br>Barely anyone talked during a game and there was rarely any sort of communication as a team.
<br>The matchmaking algorithm is absolute trash, placing someone who just finished the tutorial against players with level 60.
<br>Only one region for all of Europe, which generated huge amounts of lag and made many players go crazy because of shots not being registered, being disconnected, not being able to move, etc etc. You obviously can&apos;t expect someone from Amsterdam and someone from Portugal to be playing and everything going smoothly, it just won&apos;t happen.
<br>New heroes started being introduced, and although I welcome new content with open arms for a game that I&apos;ve paid money to purchase, I HOWEVER do not welcome new content that allows players to exploit lame tactics with new heroes or new content that allows players to be overpowered because they paid to be able to use an overpowered hero (two major issues here, one is allowing the game to be exploited by the use of lame tactics, the other is P2W).
<br>Cheater (not many) ingame. Imagine a Cogwheel shooting his minigun and only doing headshots... Yeah, not much fun to play against that one.
<br>
<br>And then ranked was introduced...
<br>
<br>And it was actually introduced correctly, there was a queue for normal games and there was a queue for rankeds, which is great!
<br>Players just looking for a relaxed and fun game can just go for normals and players looking for a more competitive edge can go for rankeds.
<br>
<br>BUT, they screwed it up. They made it all into a single queue. There is no more normals queue and no more rankeds queue. Now you just press Play and the ranking system is forced upon you.
<br>And with a ranking system forced upon you, you can either be playing with someone who&apos;s just there for the hell of it or you can be playing with someone who&apos;s actually there to play as a teammate.
<br>
<br>Now, if you&apos;re into normals, you&apos;re fine, you&apos;ll just play your game and you&apos;ll enjoy yourself.
<br>But if you&apos;re into competitive, well, you&apos;re not going to enjoy it very much when that guy that just joined for a normal does absolutely nothing the entire game to help the team but instead spends his time building a tunnel under your own base.
<br>
<br>Matchmaking remained trashy, placing folks 1 or more players in the top100 against people with Gold 3.
<br>Even more new heroes came out, and again, more P2W heroes that were overpowered.
<br>
<br>And now they&apos;ve gone one step further (and in my opinion, downhill) and made the game free to play.
<br>Probably hoping that this will bring expand the player base considerably.
<br>
<br>Not only have they completely disregarded the many people that have paid for this game and just told them &quot;Thanks for your money but now that we already have what we want, screw you&quot; but they&apos;ve opened the gates to every player with a half decent PC.
<br>While I find it great that the queue has diminished, I absolutely hate the fact that now anyone can just install, cheat and even if banned, just install again and cheat again.
<br>And obviously the amount of normal players will increase dramatically since it&apos;s another game you can just have for free in your library and play whenever you want.
<br>
<br>This was the final drop and what made me stop playing the game, and I consider it unplayable at this point unless you&apos;re just going for normal.
<br>It has clearly changed a lot from what I purchased and Jagex have ruined it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/block-n-load/user-reviews?user_review_id=6482246">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There is a construction element which is pivotal to the game, you use your resources to build defences around your base (like radars, mines etc), and to build mortars, bombs, spawn points and other offensive items for attacking the oppositions base. You can gather more resources by mining blocks, and you can practically mine the whole map so you can dig under your oppositions base, to attack them. It&apos;s quite fun placing massive bombs under their base and watching the panic as they try to stop it!
<br>
<br>Great if you can get a couple of mates to play together so your on the same page, but if you cant then just have a blast with anyone. I can see so much potential for future champs, and maps, and who knows what else they&apos;ll add-in. Nicely balanced too, and being able to choose not only your champ but their skills is a great added dimension.

<br>
<br>Block N Load is the sequel to Ace of Spades and fixes all the problems caused by Jagex, I never played any other Jagex games before, but from what I heard, a lot of people hate them and don&apos;t trust them, normally seeing this makes me want to avoid buying certain games like COD, Battlefield, the new sims games, Train simulator and more.
<br>
<br>However this time Jagex has said they want to make this a great game and fix all the bad they have done in the past, and I beleive them because right now, any feedback/bug you report is pretty much instaintly noticed by a memeber of Jagex, well not instaintly but around 97.5 times more faster then most Devs. Plus everyone makes mistakes, we are all human in the end and we all make mistakes.
<br>
<br>So back to the game, is it good? I just said it has become one of my favorite games on steam, it has a lot of competition so how did it get up there with my favorites?
<br>
<br>Firstly is the class system, right now we have 6 heros and we are getting more soon, all 6 right now are very well balanced and all 6 are fun to play as, my favourites are Sarge Stone, Cogwheel, Ninja and Nigel, however I try to be an all rounder so I can balance teams if no one chooses a support character. One downside of the class system is that the more harder classes like Ninja aren&apos;t locked, so new players just pick him and go 0/27 and rage quit, it would be nice if Ninja was locked for a bit so new players can get used to the game. Overall all 6 heros are fun as hell to play as and the next heros are gonna be awesome too!
<br>
<br>Secondly is the artstyle, instead of taking the overused approach of making everything pixaly like Minecraft, Block N Load gives us some fantastic graphics and lighting, everyone and everything stands out! Plus I love how all the characters have Block like features, but NOT fully blocked like other Minecraft styled games.
<br>
<br>Thirdly is the music, even though right now the soundtrack is REALLY small, it&apos;s very good and all the songs are memorable and I always hum or click my fingers to the beat!
<br>
<br>Fourth is the hit detection, this is something I usually bring up in other games, however I&apos;m gonna say it, Block N Load has the best hit detection of any Multiplayer FPS I have ever played, the source engine could take some lessons from this game, I can shoot someone AND IT HITS! NO B*LLSH*T BLOOD FLYING OUT OF THE ENEMY AND 0 DAMAGE!
<br>
<br>Fifth is the Devs, I mentioned they wanted to start fresh and fix their bad reputation, and honestly I&apos;ve never seen such active devs, most devs isolate themselves and maybe come out once and a while, however here they are so close to the community and so friendly... one day Senpai Jagex will notice me.
<br>
<br>Sixth is the price, I bought this game for around &#xA3;15-&#xA3;20 when it was EA, look at the price now, it&apos;s even cheaper then it was before so if you want a new game, grab this! As for my &#xA3;15-&#xA3;20, I&apos;m glad I payed that amount because it&apos;s been a blast playing this.
<br>
<br>Also now for the F.A.Q!
<br>
<br>Q. Is this Ace of Spades 2?
<br>
<br>A. Yes and No, Block N Load is the sequel to Ace of Spades, however the gameplay is much different, TF2 is the sequel to TFC, however just because it&apos;s a sequel doesn&apos;t mean the game is the exact same, yes there is similarities but both games are different, this is the same with Block N Load and Ace of Spades.
<br>
<br>Q. Are you serious about Jagex?
<br>
<br>A. Yes, they have truely turned themselves around and I wish luck on them with this game and future titles... pls notcie me Senpai Jagex.
<br>
<br>Q. Are all the heros balanced?
<br>
<br>A. Everyone is balanced, however I personally find Eliza a bit op with her DOT, but that&apos;s just me, right now the game is very well balanced.
<br>
<br>Q. Any tips for a new player?
<br>
<br>A. Do not play Ninja for your first few matches, play as Sarge or Cogwheel to get used to the game first.
<br>Always pay attention to your map, announcer and HUD for information, a supply drop might appear and they can turn the game around!
<br>Try to help teammates when you can, this can mean helping them dig something, build a base or help with a deadly assault!
<br>Try your best to do the objective, you might die over and over but your slowly crippling the defence of the enemy and distracting them from other teammates.
<br>Always think and don&apos;t go Rambo unless your forced to.
<br>And remember it&apos;s only a game :)
<br>
<br>Overall Block N Load is a blast and I highly recommend it to any of my friends or anyone looking at this review.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/block-n-load/user-reviews?user_review_id=5287390">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game plays like a MOBA, before the match begins you can choose your character, each with their special skills and abilities. What I like is that, once you locked in with a hero, you can&apos;t change it (unless you just started and you player level is under 10). It forces you to think about what class to pick carefully.
