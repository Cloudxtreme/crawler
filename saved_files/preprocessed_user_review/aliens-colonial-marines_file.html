The main problem of the game is the DUMB AI. This ruins the fight with human enemies, but ultimately ruins every part of the game where you are teamed up with human npcs. Team mates get stuck frequently, they are left behind, stay in front of you at the wrong times (basically they are useless and annoying...I would rather go alone, than with a marine that is not good for anything...). The second part is set on LV-426 (Aliens took place here). I would rate this part of A:CM average, with some better than average parts. It was fun to encounter the sets of Aliens (especially if you love the universe of the movies). Here the game focuses on the aliens. There is also a mission where you need to rely on stealth (it was a highlight of the game, with creepy lighting and sounds). There are some tense moment in the game, but I never felt scared (There were some intense moments, but I felt the game is lacking tension). The movement of the enemies felt clunchy. This is probably due to the small and closed spaces where most encounters with aliens took place. Many time they are spawned behind the player or just running around. Weapon customisation was a nice addition. The story is average, while characters are very &quot;two dimensional&quot; (with many cheesy dialogues....). Overall the game felt like a generic shooter, set in the Aliens universe, which would deserve a better game than Aliens: Colonial Marines.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2947449">Expand</a></span>

The Aliens were difficult to track if you lost them especially the face huggers. 80&apos;s iconic symbols always seem to get ruined when created now, so sad so much more potential tech wise and I feel like I wasted $67 dollars</span>

There&apos;s a lack of suspenseful atmosphere (except for one level), the AI is atrocious, acting is bad, and the storyline is worse. Hadley&apos;s Hope? Un-nuked, I guess. Whatever. Multiplayer is a better experience than single player, but suffers from some major issues. Marines level up from the campaign and multiplayer, while aliens can only level up from multiplayer. This means that pretty much right out of the chute marine teams have a gigantic advantage over the alien team. 6 hours after launch I was running into marines between level 10 and 23 with fully upgraded weapons, and today all my matches have consisted of max level marines vs. level 1 to 7 aliens. Customization options are far more in depth for marines, with aliens being limited to 3 heads and some slightly differently colored skins. Finally, there are no dedicated servers, and if the host leaves before the match is over, you are kicked and lose all your progress. So, bottom line, multiplayer is the only way this game can redeem itself, but even that has a long way to go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2949690">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s is glaringly obvious within just a few moments of starting, A:CM is a steaming pile of crap, cobbled together from various farmyard animals.  It&apos;s almost a parody of what it is supposed to be, the bugs are so amusing, you spend more time frowning or laughing than flinching in terror, in what is supposed to be the supreme horror suspense franchise, from which all others stem.  Just look at the critic reviews, who are often accused of being paid to give high scores, completely denounce this product as utter rubbish.  The lies spewed forth by the aggressive marketing campaign only adds salt to the wound, a developer desperate to claw back some of the money they spent over the SIX YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT that this game had.  Aliens: Colonial Marines has left me feeling disappointed,  ripped off and angry.   SHAME ON GEARBOX!

<br>
<br>Feeling: (Alien)
<br>Switching to the third person view may be a good descision for making gameplay more smooth, but the lack of proper animations and the fact that the alien moves like your put a stick up his  and now pulling some strings absolutly ruins it. Feeling: (Marine)
<br>It&apos;s ok. I&apos;m missing some kind of distant radio. I had a guy with his micro not muted and i could hear the dampened gunfire while catching up with the group. It was actually pretty cool. Otherwise the game lacks a proper envoirement sound set. If you spawn after death somewhere you can&apos;t hear nothing. It&apos;s so peaceful, you may settle down and have a picnic with a nearby spitter. Also the guns feel somehow cheap, like made out of lego bricks. To be honest all the models feel like i bought a 14,99 Indie game.
<br>
<br>Maps:
<br>The maps i played so far are uther rubbish. Sorry envoirement artist and level designers, but did you play your maps once? There&apos;s no tatic. It&apos;s just &quot;find the best spot to sit on&quot; and stay there and shooting the aliens coming from two directions. Forget vents, they&apos;re placed almost randomly without strategic purpose.
<br>
<br>Season Pass:
<br>You expect me to pay 30 bucks for you to maybe fix this, really?
<br>
<br>There are some things cool about this game but it doesnt compensate the games overall cheap feeling and bad, bad, bad, BAD map design. Just my personal opinion on this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2947714">Expand</a></span>

Do not buy it, especially not for the ridiculously high price on steam. this game would be somewhat reasonable at 10 dollars, but even then, do not buy it.

A dull traipse through badly designed levels with &quot;rent and idiot&quot; characters and so little in the way of gameplay above &quot;it moves  shoot it&quot; that it might as well be Quake  with better graphics. The difference being of course, that every game must be taken in context, and of it&apos;s time Quake was innovative and excellent  but that time was  17 years ago. I was temped to give this a zero just becasue I&apos;m so cheesed off as a massive Aliens fan. Why buy the rights to an iconic franchise and do this? Why Gearbox WHY? I got nervous when they said they were removing the single player squad system to make the game &quot;more accessible&quot; (i.e at best &quot;dumbed down&quot; at worst &quot;we couldn&apos;t be bothered or don&apos;t have the skill to implement a system like this&quot;) But this game is just so DULL. It doesn&apos;t crash, the graphics are ok the sound, though taken from 26 year old samples it seems, is very good  but that&apos;s the best I can say about the game. The old samples used for gunfire polish up well considering how old they are. That really is the best I can say about this game. The gameplay is as generic as &quot;Jenny Generic and her Generic Geriatrics&quot; cut and paste gameplay that is soooooooo old. How could this game have taken more than 6 months to cobble together from exising gameplay mechnics with a new lick of GFX on top? Anyway  I&apos;ll give it 1 out of 10  which is 2 (yes 2... I considered minus one but I couldn&apos;t push the slider back that far) more than I wanted to give it 10 minutes ago.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2947565">Expand</a></span>

AI is  you can actually run through the whole game without fighting or taking on an alien. Check on youtube for the video for proof. This is a joke game. Not worth $60.00..save your money.</span>

<br>
<br>This feels more like a mod or total conversion than a game of it&apos;s own. Graphics are dated, animation and blood/acid effects are very poor, sounds effects are very nice but what we have here strikes me as overall unfinished, unpolished, rushed, underdone. You would have to love James Cameron&apos;s film A LOT for this title to be salvageable, and I do, and it isn&apos;t.</span>

If you are a graphics enthusiest then this will make your eyeballs bleed.  I have a fairly stout computer and was hoping for some meat on this thing, there is none.  The first thing that came to mind (an after reading these reviews, many others as well) is Doom 3. and not the BFG edition.  Some may argue that it is uglier.  Its pretty bad.  It is kind of fun though, but that is comming from a guy who is not a serious FPS player.  I do enjoy cod series but if thats what you look for in all shooters, dont even come near this.  But if you like shooters to a degree and are tired of the hardcore ones, and reminse about the days of return to wolfenstein and the like then this may be something to try.  Not for 60 bucks though. 20 at the most.  If you buy it now you will feel ripped.  Being an aliens fan dosent hurt either but not being one will destroy any enjoyment you hope to have.  The only reason it gets a 3 is cause of the alien thing.  its not a bad shooter, just not a serious one, and a very very very very very ugly one.  Its so ugly you will be floored.

Usually I will wait for the game to be released, have a look at the general consensus of online opinion, and then buy the game if I feel it&apos;s worth it. But I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t wait, because my opinion of this game is very different from the consensus so far and in hindsight it would have been a shame to miss out on it. Graphically, the game is solid, if a little dated at times. There is some evidence of console-porting in that the items that matter (guns, creatures, characters) are highly detailed and look pretty damn good, but many incidental environmental textures, such as certain switches, signs, monitors are quite low-res, presumably to save memory usage. At first I was a little disappointed but it stopped bothering me very quickly as the overall atmosphere, look and feel of the game drew my attention. I hope that perhaps there will be a high-res pack for PC users released as there was for Crysis 2 and Skyrim, but even if there isn&apos;t, it still looks pretty awesome. The sound design is simply amazing, weapon and creature sounds, music, and almost everything else that you can think of is taken straight from the films, and serves to completely immerse the player in the world. The sound of a battle of Xenos vs. pulse rifle-wielding marines really got my heart racing many times. While the story leaves a bit to be desired, I didn&apos;t find that a hinderance to my enjoyment. The game was rather well paced, with moments of high-tension interspersed with action setpieces at complimentary intervals. I was constantly excited to see where we were going next, what locations we would discover, and frankly, I didn&apos;t want the game to end. Complimenting this are some spectacular moments, e.g. a space battle between two FTL ships, your first sight of Hadley&apos;s Hope as rain pelts you sideways and debris falls from the sky, the eerie silence of the ruined corridors when you first set foot inside the colony, and the enormous interior of the derelict ship. Lastly, the voice acting is full of emotion and truthfulness (the only exception I felt was, surprisingly, one of the original film&apos;s actors, who sounded rather dead a lot of the time). I found all this was enough to keep me eagerly moving through my 6-hour completion time of the campaign. Now if you are inclined to complain about the length of the campaign, I ask you to think of any of the modern CoD games, which all can be completed in 6 hours or less. I&apos;m not implying that this is a virtue, but merely offering a comparison. For example, Modern Warfare 3 was repetitive, entirely derivative of its predecessors, and poorly paced with an overemphasis on mindnumbing and relentless action, and yet it gets 80% across the board and this gets 40%? Ridiculous. One more thing I&apos;d like to mention is the MP. The MP aspect of the game is equally as rewarding as the single player campaign. It pits Aliens vs. Marines in alternating teams, in a number of nuanced, and varied locations. At first I felt that the teams were unbalanced, as I began as a Xenomorph and had trouble competing with a skilled group of marines hiding in a corner. But after a short while I came to see how deep and rewarding the combat system was  Xenos must be cunning, finding ways to surprise Marines and force them to respawn whereupon they can be tracked down and taken on 1-on-1, while Marines must work together and cover each other, blocking each possible method of infiltration. The variety of Xeno classes allows varied tactical opportunities for the skilled player. Similarly, a strong sense of team-work and one eye on the motion-tracker is invaluable to a Marine. There are bugs, tow be sure  the wall-climbing is not quite perfect, and my game locked up when I used the Lurker&apos;s pounce ability, but I have no doubt that a simple patch will fix that right up. All in all, I am loving this game. I can only imagine that the nay-sayers are playing on console, or held immense expectations. I however, found it to be as entertaining, and more immersive than I had anticipated, and the MP is truly enjoyable and compelling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2948234">Expand</a></span>

I think the development cycle was far too long for it. It came out with too many hands in it&apos;s honey pot I think. A few patches and the game will be golden. On the other hand, this game was definitely made for fans of Aliens (the second movie in the franchise.). As fans know, Aliens was the action oriented movie out of the franchise, and focused heavily on Hicks and his marines, and a lot less on scare&apos;s and horror movie tropes as Alien, Alien 3, and Alien: Resurrection did. As such, in ASM you take the role of a marine in a squad and similar to the film, you shoot your way through dark and dimly lit areas where aliens and other things are creeping around every corner. The graphics  are a mixed bag, the Aliens models look fantastic, where as the marines look quite dated. Textures in areas range from muddy to acceptable. Lighting effects are fantastic, and sound effects and music are stellar and way above par and fit with the Aliens theme PERFECTLY. I love the sound of my pulse rifle going off.  The plot is dull in the first mission, but picks up quickly and steadily gets better and better as it goes.  Multiplayer is truly where it&apos;s at with this one, tons of fun to be had through co-op and various player vs player modes which i can see being filled out even more with DLC in the future.  As i said though the game is a DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH, and is in need of a few good patches. Some animations in the game, especailly alien ones, seem janky and disorienting, i&apos;ve seen aliens get stuck in terrain and obstacles, or face the wrong way at times. Other times they crawl across walls and ceilings to drop down on you from behind which is fantastic.  All these issues can be easily fixed with a few patches. Though it is frustrating when the game has been in development for over 6 years and still has these issues. Though who knows how much development actually went on in those years?  In the end, the game is fun. It&apos;s a love-note to fans of the movie and the series in general, and those of you who are big fans will take note of the lovingly re-created areas, sounds, weapons, and characters from those films. It is a must play for franchise fans. If you are expecting a super polished 200 million dollar budget title in the vein of Battlefield 3? You are going to be disappointed.  If you enjoyed aliens, or enjoy varied and robust co op and multiplayer (Left 4 dead fans look within!)  you will find a lot to enjoy here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2947683">Expand</a></span>

This is just not a very good game.
<br>
<br>The story is just bad and i refuse to acknowledge it as cannon.    For one it fails to explain major plot holes, and don&apos;t even get me started on the ending.   A marine from the first movie survives???  what were these guys smoking when they came up with that.  Any true alien fan would be disappointing with this game and I believe we expect a certain amount of quality to be involved when it comes to this beloved franchise.  Yes expectations where high and rightfully so.  The sound is great, love the sound effects like the pulse rifle and others such as aliens dying.  The AI is bad and ruined the immersion for me on more than one occasion.  For instance aliens standing in front of my AI squad mate for seconds attempting to kill him or navigating around him to get to me or like on most occasions my squad mate  just firing his smart gun for long periods of time doing absolutely nothing.  The graphics are bad which is something that caught me off guard.  textures are terrible and character animation is amateur.  the lighting ,one of the most important features in anything alien is mediocre which is extremely disappointing. i could go on but you get the idea just not much of a game here multilayer is better but doesn&apos;t make up for the terrible campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2976363">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I have to agree that game graphics is not as good as other latest AAA games. But I cannot say visuals are bad. A little bit outdated  yes. Bad? Not at all.  I would say graphic is good enough to have this special atmosphere of Aliens move  together with sound it made me jump few times. I dont agree that pre scripted aliens are not scary and behave weird  they do what they are supposed to do: they crawl the ceilings and walls and they quickly advance at the player (often by jumping)  this is what xenomorphs do.
<br>On hardened difficulty setting you can get killed easily  it is not that easy to kill xeno on the wall.
<br>
<br>NPC AI is ok, not as good as in CoD or BF but acceptable  they shoot things and can draw enemy attention to themselves. but I wouldnt count on them to do your job in the heat of the battle. another thing is that xenos will attack YOU if your soldiers are already attacked by their comrades. In game you will meet enemy human soldiers as well. They are not too hard to kill and act OK. Nothing special but not bad at all.
<br>
<br>I wouldnt spend &#xA3;30 to buy this game, but I got it on Steam offer for &#xA3;3. At this price it is really good game and all you Aliens fans will love it </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=3761624">Expand</a></span>

<br>During presentations I wasn&apos;t stunned by the level of graphics, so I didn&apos;t expect much. The visual part will not make a gamer happy who has spent time playing Battlefield 3 or Crysis 2. But yet it gave enough detalisation so you could imagine yourself being away on a deserted planet. Face animations have no &apos;life&apos;, still I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a big problem.
<br>Sound effects is important part for a game in a universe of Aliens. It seems that music and sound is not what is usually discussed in reviews, but when these elements are done badly you can&apos;t miss such flaws. Using rifles made me want to skip all shooting sections. It is sound that ruined &apos;feeling&apos; of a weapon. Too bad, because the design of weapons was not that bad.
<br>The design of levels is poor, 4 gamers on a level would feel lack of space. Despite the fact that it usually took me around 20-30 minutes to complete a level, everything that you keep in mind after completing one was running, shooting, running, loading.
<br>There was only one time when I was in a team of 4 players. Thing is that I started playing two weeks after the game&apos;s release date. By that time everyone stopped playing the game. Absence of server browser made me watch searching for other players for tenth of minutes before I had to go into singleplayer journey.
<br>The worst thing that made me angry was the storyline. Idea of connecting characters from original &apos;Aliens&apos; movie with the ones in the game was horrible and had no logic.
<br>But I have to say that the competitive multiplayer was good. Maps and different classes is the strongest part of the game. It is far away from the gameplay that we have in &apos;Left 4 Dead&apos;, but it is worth playing.
<br>I&apos;m sorry for those who bought season&apos;s pass in advance for the game that disapoints starting from the menu. Finally I have to say, that expectations for the game were too high and I&apos;m 100% sure that the year&apos;s biggest fail has already arrived.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=3246932">Expand</a></span>

Game technology has moved on, so it falls short of expectations. However, it makes what I feel to be a very strong attempt at putting the gamer in the position of a marine living the Alien storyline.
<br>
<br>In detail, the story is strong, placing the gamer in all the environments of the alien story, although no new ones. Close knit corridors, spacecraft and rocky planet surfaces. The enemies you face are varied  both in type and species, meaning that combat is mixed up nicely. You also progress with a set of likeable comrades, which prevents the game becoming &apos;lonely&apos;.
<br>
<br>However, as a game coming out close to &apos;crysis&apos;. It really doesn&apos;t match up. The graphics are average and the AI is pretty weak, especially for allies that occasionally get lost.
<br>
<br>I enjoyed this game, but it suffers from a poor technological footing and the resulting failure to meet expectations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=3825794">Expand</a></span>

<br>I saw a walk-through guide and the 2 npc&apos;s who is with the player at the time, is suppose to follow the player inside and come up with a solution to get by the turrets. In my game, they stand outside doing nothing. I seen this before in the game and when u reach some point, they start moving again and catch up. But this time, u cant go back or forward. U need those 2 inside, but they freeze outside. Game over!
<br>
<br>So that said, they AI is broken, running around like chickens with no head, its pure FPS action - no scary elements u would otherwise link with an Alien game or movie. For a 2013 game, the graphic is terrible and a mess. In 1920*1200 resolution, I hit better at range with a red dot indicator, firing from the hib, then taking a aim.
<br>
<br>All in all, not recommended and i just un-installed the game since im stocked half way through the game anyways.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=4811007">Expand</a></span>

<br>to be honest i wish i had never tarnished my memories with this game. to start it was virtually unplayable, in fact it just was unplayable. then i did a few recommended tweaks and it went up to the level of highly irritating.
<br>the brief time i have spent trying to persevere was seriously disappointing. either it would lag so bad that you die in seconds or the alien just stands there waiting for a bullet.
<br>then just to top it off, when you just want to close it and forget it ever happened it bugs out and constantly restarts itself until you have to turn off the computer. there is apparently a fix for this but i dont want to know. i paid &#xA3;6.99 for it and its uninstalled never to be messed with again.
<br>maybe if it was a couple of tweaks and it was fine i could have enjoyed it. however i spent 6 hours trying to make this game playable. one of those was just trying to get the thing to shut down and stay shut down!
<br>frankly, i expected more in this day and age. considering AVP2 before this i was expecting something halfway decent, this is not it though. the standard of games these days is pretty good, and to fight for a corner of the market is tough. i think this was just a way to exploit alien fans and their curiosity.
<br>there is just nothing i can recommend about it. i regret buying it, i regret installing it, i regret trying to make it work and i regret not stopping to find out about it before i paid for it.
<br>save your money, buy a couple of beers and watch the movies. it would be a much better use of your time and money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=4327214">Expand</a></span>

<br>In Aliens: Colonial Marines you play as one of the colonial marines on a rescue mission&#x2026;
<br>And you go through the same recycled locations for 6 hours, shooting spongey alien creatures and humans&#x2026;
<br>This is hands down the most boring first person shooter I&#x2019;ve ever played&#x2026;
<br>I spent the entire game waiting for it to intrigue or excite me.. But it never came...
<br>Its generic feeling from start to finish&#x2026;
<br>You get a few moments outside of a ship, but for the most part you&#x2019;re in doors in areas that all look identical from each other&#x2026;
<br>You have a scanner that goes off when enemies are near and you can also use this scanner to give you an idea where to go to next.. And again... everything is recycled and looks the same... you&#x2019;ll need it&#x2026;
<br>You have a great variety of weapons you can switch freely and upgrade as you level up by collecting items and completing challenges in the game&#x2026;
<br>But shooting feels hollow&#x2026;
<br>There&#x2019;s no feeling of true hit detection here&#x2026; spongey enemies&#x2026;
<br>Satisfaction is completely missing from the gameplay&#x2026;
<br>So what&#x2019;s left.. Why play this game?
<br>The only reason to really play this is if you&#x2019;re an Aliens fan and need the lore&#x2026;
<br>There&#x2019;s a queen alien involved... face huggers&#x2026; and intriguing struggle within the story&#x2026;
<br>But not intriguing enough for someone not a fan of the aliens franchise to justify checking out&#x2026;
<br>There&#x2019;s the ability to play co-op with 4 players as well as an online mode.. but it&#x2019;s hard to find matches outside of the standard team death match&#x2026;
<br>The multiplayer is miles more fun than the single players as its aliens vs marines&#x2026;
<br>and you switch sides&#x2026;
<br>I feel the aliens are a bit more powerful than the marines&#x2026; but not enough that I had any issues killing them&#x2026;
<br>But on the aliens side kills are way easier&#x2026;
<br>And of course at the time of this review this game is about 4 years old.. the community is dying and in no way justifies picking this game up on its own like a call of duty multiplayer mode would&#x2026;
<br>Colonial Marines is a dud&#x2026;
<br>It&#x2019;s for the fans and no one else.. And even then it&#x2019;s an insult&#x2026;
<br>I Give Aliens: Colonial Marines

What we ended up getting is a below average run-of-the-mill FPS. I shan&apos;t go into more detail, since others have covered it over and over again. Simply avoid it, even if you are an Aliens fan.

The games storyline is even supposed to pick up where the Aliens movie left off, which is a really nice area to fill in some details. After Ripley leaves the planet in Aliens we never really get to see what happens so it will be really cool to finally find out, right? If the game had not been so half-assed then I would say yes, however it was definitely a half-assed attempt at an Aliens game.
<br>Well I guess we will just dive into the gameplay and figure out what we enjoyed out of it. After playing through the game I have to say I did actually enjoy the environments quite a bit. From the opening scenes to the end of the game they definitely hit the overall atmosphere and feel of LV-426 perfectly. I actually really enjoyed being able to &#x201C;set foot&#x201D; on the planet and explore a piece of iconic history with a character. Now if everything else had been as good then it would have been a perfect experience. When looking at things like the AI you can really tell it was rushed though and never got the time it deserved. While playing through the story-line the AI companions just seemed like puppets on a stick reacting to things around them. There were countless times during firefights when my companions would be downed because they would attack aliens far away from them instead of the ones wailing on them point blank. In small fights this isn&#x2019;t so much of an issue because the player can contend with them, but in larger battles it was a serious pain in the ass. The Alien AI was also absolutely terrible from what I witnessed. Even after all the patching that was done by Gearbox after release the Aliens still just traveled from point A to point B, then attacked. There wasn&#x2019;t really any variation to the attacks, no tactics, nothing surprising. It really depressed me because the movies showed us such a cunning enemy, and the game delivers an obvious robot following a preset path. It wouldn&#x2019;t be so bad if this was 1995 but we have seen better AI in games in the last 10 years.
<br>Now with the gameplay pretty botched you would think they used this time on the story-line to give us a great experience. Oh man how I wish that was the case. In all the time playing the game I just felt the story was scattered, if not almost completely absent. We know that we are another team responding to the issues plaguing the first team, but they don&#x2019;t really give you a purpose beyond that. You don&#x2019;t care about the characters you&#x2019;re with or really get a lot of info on why you are doing what you are, other than the simple go here and do this command. The lack of attachment to the characters really irritated me because that is a basic element in any storytelling. When you are attached to those around you it makes protecting them much more important, and in the event that something happens to them it has a profound effect on the player. Yet all that was completely absent here.
<br>Since there is not a lot more you can say about the story of the game we will go ahead and move on to the graphics. The visuals in the game are also part of a fairly heated debate since the demo footage seemed to be better looking than the actual released version. Now since release Gearbox did add a massive 4 plus gigabyte patch that made the visuals in the game better but it&#x2019;s still hard for gamers not to feel cheated in the beginning. The bad thing is that even after the massive patch Aliens: CM still looks rather dated for a game that has released in the last 5 years. Now I am usually not one to rag on graphics but when you don&#x2019;t have a storyline to make up for it then it&#x2019;s difficult not to be hard on a game. Something else that really bothered me is the amount of frame lag I got while playing the game on PC. I could understand having this if I was playing the game on a low end PC but that&#x2019;s just not the case. I am not sure if this happened on consoles as well but I would be interested to see if it did. It&#x2019;s just disappointing to see a game with this much potential being kicked to the curb in the graphics department.
<br>I can say that the one place I did see real quality was in the sound effects. I know that they were most likely ripped directly from the movie, but all the sounds had a great presence in the game. It&#x2019;s always nice to be hit with nostalgia when playing a game based of something so beloved. With the sound effects being as good as they were you would not expect the dialog to be as jacked up as it was. There were a few times that the character&#x2019;s mouths and dialog didn&#x2019;t match. It seriously took me back to the days of old school Godzilla movies.
<br>All in all, this game is worth playing as a rental or in the discount rack but as for buying it at full price, just don&#x2019;t. Gearbox was given the keys to a Lamborghini with this IP and they somehow modified it into a rusted down Pinto. The concept and potential was so great, and yet in the end the finished product just didn&apos;t deliver.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=6356362">Expand</a></span>

That is right Weyland-Yutani then the spaceship crashes on the planet then find Hadley&apos;s Hope after that the story is BULL****!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2955895">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Kicking in steel doors, diving through the  of a marine dropship that an Alien Queen cant even get through
<br>- Aliens that either rush right at you or stand motionless
<br>- Aliens that rush up to you, strike once, then idle
<br>- Weyland Yutani mercenaries by the boatload. Seriously, forget the Aliens. This game is about killing people.
<br>- Acid Blood doesn&apos;t hurt
<br>- Unless it&apos;s specifically chosen as a weapon, in which case it mystically hurts
<br>- Remember the first sign Alien 4: Resurrection would suck? The alien in a glass cage that lets you see every orifice? This game does it too! WITH EVERY VARIANT, including the ones not yet seen.
<br>- Xeno variants that couldn&apos;t have possibly been bred. What? Why are they spitting acid? How did a facehugger impregnate a rhinoceros?!
<br>- Graphics suck, unlike the graphics they sold preorders on.
<br>- Duke Nukem Forever made an Aliens game worse. I mean are you for ****ing real?
<br>- Fire extinguishers react to your fire. By disappearing.
<br>- a chestburster farm in a lab... with 0 containment for the chestbursters.  What do you do with xeno infested humans? Mercy kill. Nope, not these ones. They&apos;re made of iron.
<br>- Every single ongoing Weyland experiment fails catastrophically as soon as you look at it.
<br>- Oh a captive queen. How quaint. Oh look, she suddenly figured out how to break free. She&apos;s smashing the glass to get at me! Uh oh, she broke through the glass!  Phew, she gave up.
<br>- Aliens for the most part cannot transition surfaces while climbing. No clue why. If you want to get onto the ceiling, you need an app for that. Oh sorry, I meant a &apos;perk&apos;.
<br>- controls randomly invert when climbing as an alien. Yes, ALL of them. Because wall movement wasn&apos;t hard enough.
<br>- Xeno pounces have a wonderful 5% chance of failing, leaving your lurker pinning down a marine until either the match ends or another player comes along and either kills you or steals your kill.
<br>- Claymore mines can be dropped instantly, and while in the midst of another animation. Lurker just pinned you and about to chew off your face? No problem. RETROACTIVE CLAYMORE!
<br>- You can also sit on your claymores, because strangely they just don&apos;t hurt humies.
<br>- Challenge order. Bizarre. Three challenge types, one of each on offer at any given time. Usually the hardest ones straight at the beginning.
<br>- There&apos;s a mission where PMC&apos;s and Weyland techs run from your team despite superior numbers. They escape through doors in the side of the ship. Looking out a window  you notice they are doors directly to space.
<br>- Super weapon backpack. You have access to something like 16 weapons and 4 tacticals and thousands of rounds plus secondary rounds on you at all times. D&amp;D did it first!
<br>- There are 9 multiplayer maps split between 4 game modes. On many of the maps, you could smell an opponents fart on the opposite end.
<br>- Mapping orbs! &quot;Look, we can Prometheus, too!&quot; exclaims Randy Prichford with a piggish squeal. &quot;ugh&quot; exclaims you, whose quite sick of the half-assed &apos;nods&apos; without any obvious love for the material.
<br>- PRE RENDERED cut scenes! WOW! Why did developers stop doing this? I mean, the gamer was never immersed in the first place so you don&apos;t have to worry about that jarring transition, the 12 frames per second of the video is TOTALLY unnoticeable if you pack in enough ACTION!!!, and frankly, We miss running a server-farm for weeks to render this junk.
<br>
<br>Ok. I&apos;m out of obvious things. You guys take it from here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2958776">Expand</a></span>

Aliens even get stuck doing what they &apos;re good at, clinging to walls! The level design is appalling! It&apos;s like a CoD game where you keep pushig forward. The graphics are so, soo, sooo dated! Even the collisions aren&apos;t working, with aliens running right through NPCs and bullets impacting on, well nothing! Coop is a joke! Other players somehow mysteriously teleport in from nowhere and have no idea what they should be doing, except shooting. Multiplayer is probably the only thing that is good about this game, but even that is flawed. No dedicated servers, imbalanced matchmaking system and in the right hands an alien can be OP because they can see through walls! From Borderlands 2 to this? Gearbox, You need to shift up to 6th because this is unacceptable!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2953294">Expand</a></span>

<br>Overall it&apos;s not a total disaster, the intro sequence was good, Henriksen and Biehn presence was also a good sign, but it all ended before it started. P.S.

The single player campaign is so boring and so boring that I stopped playing after 1 hour, more or less. Obviously I did not buy the game. The internet must serve for something in that regard. Whenever I like a game, I sure buy it, but this time I am not going to. Even if this game cost 20 euros, I would not buy it. I would give 10 euros for it, and that is a lot of money for this game. I feel revolted to see that this game has a price of 49.99 euros when it is obviously worth no more than 10 euros. I know the company in charge of production took years to build it, but that is not how the game should get its worth from. First the producers must have real players test it and give their sentence about price and other things, and I am sure they did that, so why they are charging so much more? I tell you why, because when clients see a game for a good and high price, they are more likely to buy it and not research about it, so the company makes a lot of money in the first week, and in the next ones, when the heat is off, when all criticizers publish their critics, clients start realizing the game is BS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2960500">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is chock full of bugs, clipping issues, and stuck enemies. Voice cues will trigger after you&#x2019;ve already cleared a room. It&#x2019;s so bad that I was instructed to &#x201C;cover the right flank&#x201D; when there was nothing but a wall to my right. In larger arena-style areas, it isn&#x2019;t uncommon to wonder why nothing else is happening, only to find a bad guy inanimately stuck next to a box just waiting to be killed.
<br>At least your sonar-style motion tracker will be useful in finding those stuck guys because it&#x2019;s pointless otherwise. You&#x2019;ll use it before opening a door, not see anything of concern, then enter and get attacked anyway. But it doesn&#x2019;t really matter because the xenomorphs are fragile idiots. Their AI is on par with the standard Infected from Left 4 Dead, but now they get to climb on walls. Xenomorphs conveniently ignore any squadmates nearby and come right at you. Sometimes they&#x2019;ll crawl on the ground, but most of the time I was shooting at awkward geriatric people that should be in nursing homes with walkers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2960891">Expand</a></span>

<br>One of the redeeming factors of the game however is that it has decent music, but that&apos;s it. If you&apos;re having trouble sleeping, I definitely recommend this game because there is no way you&apos;ll still be awake after 30 minutes. Gearbox over-hyped this game and just ended up deceiving Aliens fans. I highly recommend you look at game footage before you commit to buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=3138589">Expand</a></span>

The game AI is terrible, they run around with bad ai decision sometimes even running past your team mates in single player games just to shoot you. the gun sound effects are awful and movement in general feels so unatural and stiff. if you like the feeling of cod s movements, aliens is completely opposite you feel like a robot.  MULTIPLAYER IS  you cant choose your sides, the matches are about 2 minutes each so once you get the hang of things your automatically playing an alien role and have no clue what your doing... multiplayer can only hold 10 so 5 vs 5 and because the matches are literally like 2 min each round you cant make technical or team work decision its really just a run and shoot whatever moves in your sight.

The quality of the textures especially in some places like the truck in the 3rd level was dumbass designing 101.  For gearbox to present themselves with this product is so bad and with the devs blaming each other doesn&apos;t help the franchise and IP.  The AI is terrible and sadly the only time personally, I find a good AI is in ultimate badass which is the highest level.  If you do play at a lower difficulty, prepare for bad AI and the characters stories and how they act are the worse and don&apos;t even expect good facial or quality character models.
<br>
<br>Although this is negatives, there are some positives  Drop in, Drop out works, Some of the levels were enjoyable especially the 5th one in but the main positive is the Modding community actually modding so fast to allow it to look better than what it is. Sadly the devs have been so unresponsive, the modders came in and actually made it look better which is a positive which is why i feel bad for console who can&apos;t get these mods....
<br>
<br>The story which i won&apos;t go into strongly is badly written, badly executed and not good especially within many of the levels.... however there are the occasional good point throughout but its not at all AAA.
<br>
<br>However it isn&apos;t the best, it is enjoyable to a point and playing a lot of games its not the worst... sadly that still goes to Orion: Dino Crisis and WarZ but sadly this game doesn&apos;t show the IP and Gearbox in a good way at all... and i feel bad for sega for allowing gearbox to design this Crap.
<br>
<br>Shame on you gearbox!
<br>Shame on you Randy Pitchford!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2968620">Expand</a></span>

It doesn&apos;t capture the feel of the Aliens movie, it looks dated and it&apos;s short and not very interesting.  In no way does it live up to the marketing and hype around it.</span>

And even tough game has alien in its title i think they could use something else  instead of aliens. aliens dont die with 1 shot of shotgun  and thats at hardened diffuculty) and they dont act like they are high on drugs, they dont wander around you meaninglessy while u have the time to watch them and wonder what are those bugs doing around running above your head at ceiling. I waited intentionally for them to kill me but they just attack once and than go back wondering around. The enemy ai is terrible, but whats even worse is friendly ai, friendly ai can just watch you die and do nothing at all,  also u can easily understand if u are going to get in trouble or not, thanks to obvious scripting. If you see your teammates staying behind or running forward very fast and away from you make sure you get ready because you are about to get attacked.
<br>
<br>Another thing is the scan sound of motion tracker, whenever an enemy spawns you hear it bleeping, even tough u arent holding the tracker so all you have to do is to look around when you hear the sound. So overall Ai and scripting the scan sound is terrible.
<br>
<br>Now those are big issues but it is not enough to give game a big 0 especially when it carries alien title. In real life you can see aroun 120-130 degrees around you. This means you can see your right 45 and left 45 with ease. In this game you cant see it, you have to turn right or left to see your 45.  You have around 60 degree of view. So you have to turn right left crazy to see where the aliens are coming. This creates a very bad gameplay feeling, not because it makes the game harder but because it makes game play uncomfortable.
<br>
<br>The graphics are ugly and i play the game with my high end pc at  1600-1200 with everything on at max using a 40 inch samsung led tv. The atmosphere the darkness of screen is well adjusted but light effects, animations just dont give you the alien feeling.
<br>
<br>Overall i wasnt waiting much from this game, but i wasnt aware of the gameplay videos at e 2011 and e2012 either. In those demos graphic are actually great and aliens die with at least 5 6 shots of shotgun which is the way it should be. Anyhow the game promised and the game delivered are so different and this creates another negative impression. I could give a 3 maybe 4 to this game but fooling around with e 2011 and 2012 videos arent cool there goes your ZERO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2952219">Expand</a></span>

If you tend to buy this game,just stay avoid this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2967079">Expand</a></span>

The immersion promised in the pre-release video was stripped leaving behind the husk of a generic shooter. The dialog is awful with its forced, rehashed lines from Aliens. The corny try-hard attempt to recreate the attitude of the characters from the movie. A boring (DLC READY! :D) story with a... well... I would&apos;ve called it a cliffhanger ending but truth be told I simply don&apos;t care. The game play offers virtually nothing to offset any of the above. It&apos;s functional, usually, but that&apos;s where the praise ends. The alien AI feels like it was written by some poor intern that doesn&apos;t even like FPS games. It&apos;s pretty standard copy/paste game play beyond that. With the gratuitous weapon unlocks and totally linear map design.
<br>
<br>The worst offenders by far are the lifeless boring levels. The fact they took the source material of aliens and turned it into this is upsetting, if not flat out depressing. The animations are laughable (power loader anyone?) and the textures would make Ray Charles weep. The lighting? Mods to &quot;help fix&quot; the lightning were out in less than 24 hours. At least Duke Nukem Forever won&apos;t be lonely at the bottom of the barrel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2957989">Expand</a></span>

<br>Aliens: Colonial Marines (read  Aliens: Colonial Morons) is the perfect example of why I don&apos;t /ever/ pre-order games. The Good:
<br>+ I&apos;ve been told... Badgered by others insisting that the multilayer is passable, It&apos;s playable and competitive. So despite my personal feelings that the Multilayer portion of a game that has a singleplayer campaign should ever be a centre-point of a review, I&apos;ll let this one slide.
<br>The Bad:
<br>- Dreadful attempt at atmosphere. I can tell this game tries so hard to be something it isn&apos;t... As an Aliens game, expectation dictates that the atmosphere has to be on par with an expertly directed horror film. With an enemy that surpasses our little human character in almost every attribute- I want to feel hunted and isolated in an almost hopeless situation, fighting for my very survival. Any attempt at the before-mentioned feeling is destroyed the moment one of your companions opens their mouth... and then further trashed when you move through the campaign mowing down hundreds of the Aliens as if they were made from toilet tissue.  The AI, frankly, sucks. My Graduate games programming project had better Artificial intelligence than this. You constantly see the human characters getting stuck, taking insane path finding routes. This may just be me however as I have developed an eye for such things.
<br>- The visuals  I am not one to criticise a game based on it&apos;s graphical quality. However, I expect a AAA, multi-million Dollar budgeted game to provide a certain degree of graphical quality  especially if the marketing material boasts scenes that show off lighting and rendering techniques used by the latest DX11 technologies. But this is a small point... ugly textures and ugly lighting doesn&apos;t kill a game  but it does not help it ether.
<br>- The Feel of the gameplay is off. I can&apos;t accurately articulate it because it&apos;s not really something tangible, but when I play a shooter, I expect the game to provide feedback in a certain way, Aliens: CM, does not provide this feeling.
<br>To summarize   I am disappointed that 7 years of development couldn&apos;t produce something better. But, I have a feeling that this suffered from the same problems as Duke Nukem: Forever in that it has been outsourced to so many companies and been messed about with so much over the past 7 years  The end result maintains no real identity  It&apos;s a game that consists of poorly mashed together bits from all kinds of different places and it is a real shame... A perfect example of brilliant marketing on Sega&apos;s part to sell a bad game so well though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2960456">Expand</a></span>

Not much more to say Feeling: (Alien) Switching to the third person view may be a good descision for making gameplay more smooth, but the lack of proper animations and the fact that the alien moves like your put a stick up his and now pulling some strings absolutly ruins it. Feeling: (Marine) It&apos;s ok. I&apos;m missing some kind of distant radio. I had a guy with his micro not muted and i could hear the dampened gunfire while catching up with the group. It was actually pretty cool. Otherwise the game lacks a proper envoirement sound set. If you spawn after death somewhere you can&apos;t hear nothing. It&apos;s so peaceful, you may settle down and have a picnic with a nearby spitter. Also the guns feel somehow cheap, like made out of lego bricks. To be honest all the models feel like i bought a 14,99 Indie game. Maps: The maps i played so far are uther rubbish. Sorry envoirement artist and level designers, but did you play your maps once? There&apos;s no tatic. It&apos;s just &quot;find the best spot to sit on&quot; and stay there and shooting the aliens coming from two directions. Forget vents, they&apos;re placed almost randomly without strategic purpose. Season Pass: You expect me to pay 30 bucks for you to maybe fix this, really? There are some things cool about this game but it doesnt compensate the games overall cheap feeling and bad, bad, bad, BAD map design. Just my personal opinion on this....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2954044">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The start of the solo campaign honestly filled me with hope and a little apprehension. It leapt in a little fast for aliens and some of the mood might have been lost but the first 10-20minutes of the game was great.
<br>
<br>The problem was, the more I played it the less I liked it. The more I progressed the less scary the &apos;perfect killing machines&apos; became and more irritating as they jumped down onto their prescripted ledges and stood there to be mowed down. Occasionally some would survive and start running at you, slower than a marine I noted. When I got sick of murdering mindless rabbits I let my NPCs  invulnerable, almost untargetable and with infinite ammo (not that ammo was ever once an issue during the campaign)  mow them down as I ran in circles. Gone are the dismembering of body parts that only slightly slow them down (avp1) and gone is the atmosphere, threat and any real challenge.  Where in previous incarnations aliens were something to be feared, in this they are simply fodder to be tediously dealt with as you muddy your way through an increasingly weak story.
<br>
<br>This game had an engine that rivaled half-life in clunk and AI approaching, but not outdoing, castle wolfenstien. To date multiplayer has been a graveyard of failure and disheartened souls. The weapon mods were basically pointless, especially when combined with the built in, unremoveable autoaim which over writes the shoulder weapon function. So those braindead mooks starting at you from behind a box are literally invulnerable as you empty clip after clip into the box despite your best efforts to overcome the games desire to aim for you. In the end I found they dropped enough ammo that, with a little weapon cycling you could simply kill them all with grenades.
<br>
<br>There are a few redeeming features, the actual maps are, for the most part, beautiful points of nostalgia  as long as one can ignore the poorly rendered dodads that have been haphazardly scattered through them  and the weapons look and feel (until you actually try using them on real targets) like they should.
<br>
<br>The leveling/unlock system feels utterly redundant  it is possible to gain several levels in a single mission without trying and there are missions it is possible to farm for the truly die hard. If the game was designed to feel like a high texture version of a mid 90s FPS it has succeeded, if they expect that to make it a great success they have serious issues fast approaching. As a release under the &apos;aliens&apos; franchise it feels like a cheap knock off designed purely to make money off the past before anyone notices what they have done to it. I cannot honestly believe that any dev looked at the finished product and felt happy with it. Where the blame lies is ultimately irrelevant however, the key point being it was a waste of money and if steam offered a refund I would have turned this in with a package fresh from my cats anus to return to them what they had given to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2952894">Expand</a></span>

I waited 5 years for a game that makes DNF look like a masterpiece. I had to REALLY force myself to finish the campaign. What makes this game so bad, you ask?
<br>
<br>1- The AI. That damn AI...the worst I have EVER seen. Enemies can&apos;t do anything but run straight at you, your comrades will shoot walls in an (obviously futile) attempt to hit an enemy: they can&apos;t &quot;see&quot; the obstacle! Of course they will shoot through you as well. Sometimes enemies stand still in the middle of a room. Even at the highest difficulty the bad guys are just too stupid and that results in the game being extremely easy.
<br>2- The plot makes no sense, the character&apos;s reactions are completely off and you&apos;re left wondering whether the authors behind this were 5 years old fans. It&apos;s that stupid. Oh, the ending makes you want to punch in the face whoever wrote this garbage.
<br>3- No atmosphere. I remember the old AVP1/AVP2. Those games were terrifying when playing the Marine campaign. In Colonial Marines you feel nothing...well sometimes you get angry over how stupid everything is. It&apos;s that boring.
<br>
<br>These are just the three main issues with the game, but there&apos;s a lot more, for example the bad animations and the mediocre (at best) graphics but that&apos;s not really something I look at when judging a videogame. There are a few good things, though, like the guns (they sound really nice), one of the levels (although it doesn&apos;t last long) and the MP, which isn&apos;t horrible.
<br>
<br>Overall, this game is extremely bad, and may very well be the worst game I have ever played. If you&apos;re thinking &quot;I&apos;ll try it anyway because I&apos;m a fan of the Alien Saga&quot; then listen to me and DON&apos;T do it. You&apos;ll be even more disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2957566">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Split screen is horizontal only
<br>-Co op doesn&apos;t allow 2nd person to save their own progress and character for those playing together at home.
<br>-Pathing is horrible for mobs  AI team mates, they tend to get stuck
<br>-AI is poorly developed and doesn&apos;t offer challanges
<br>-Graphics were not as advertised and seem very dated like 6+ years -System was supposed to be built off &quot;experience&quot; idea.  However Experience upgrades are limited and not very imaginative.  You get a shot gun, now you have a shotgun with a scope...
<br>-mobs are cookie cutter and even human opponents tend to all look the same.
<br>-The tracker pinging for aliens when you aren&apos;t looking at it isn&apos;t very realistic.  Being surprised would be nice, isn&apos;t that what all of the movies are about?
<br>-A map would come in handy.
<br>-Game is dark and turning up brightness doesn&apos;t help at all.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t buy this game, and be wary of pre ordering Gearbox games going forward.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2962970">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Well, I guess we all saw those Randy Pitchford videos where he was creaming in his pants talking rubbish about how he is a massive fan of the Aliens movie that James Cameron directed. Well Pitchford, you should be ashamed of yourself as this game is awful! If you loved the franchise that much, why is this game so S**T? Why did you not endeavour to make this the best Alien game available? All these questions will never get answered and really, we all should have known better because he talked up Duke Nukem Forever as if that was going to be some kind of genre defining game which also turned out to be S**T!
<br>
<br>Anyways, what we have here is a first person shooter set after the events of Aliens. The game follows a team sent to find out what has happened to the Sulaco and of course, what happened on the planet LV-426 (although that is not the same location the game goes too, it&apos;s LV-244). The game looks like Aliens if you ignore the poor graphics, awful animations and clippings, and the vast amount of bugs. It&apos;s funny but the E3 demo that Pitchford again was showing off with such Glee looks nothing like the product I have purchased??? False advertising most definitely as the released version looks 6 years out of date whereas the E3 demo was full of lovely shadows and lighting and had a much crisper visual and colour palette set (looked like advanced current gen).
<br>
<br>Gameplay wise, the story is a complete mess. It&apos;s hopelessly derived   and should have been handled with much more care... where&apos;s the love Pitchford??? The guns sound great but feel underpowered. Locations feel samey with textures that are low resolution and adding to this is the minimal physics used on objects within these rubbish environments, the actual feeling of interaction is ZERO. It&apos;s just not that great to look at and my god it&#x2019;s even worse to play.
<br>
<br>Enemy A.I consists of over erratic cover seeking morons that pop up and downs three times whilst shooting, then move to a different location, repeat the same process; and then move back to the previous location until you put their idiotic path finding body fodder down. Aliens sometimes move authentically but this immersion is broken once they glitch into a wall or turn 90 or 180 degrees in one motion... Its school boy error stuff and the question of this game getting through quality control is a bitter pill to swallow.
<br>
<br>It is hard to pick out redeeming moments from this game to be honest. It is not worth the time or money and unless you are a person that isn&#x2019;t overly critical when it comes to games, you will have a tough time playing through to the end. With A.I that has the simplest of path finding code, aliens that act like drunks rather than predators seeking out their prey and a story line that is so redundant, you don&#x2019;t really care; it&#x2019;s hard to actually want to keep playing this game. The hardest part of the whole process of playing then reviewing a game based on my favourite movie of all time was the fact that I didn&#x2019;t really have high expectations for it. I didn&#x2019;t want a 10/10 game&#x2026; I just wanted to feel like a bad ass playing in the boots of a Marine. Feel the feedback of the Pulse rifle when I offloaded a clip into a dangerous xenomorph. I wanted to seal doors with my hand held welder (you do this but it&#x2019;s irrelevant and has no impact on the games mechanics) and lock down an area as if it&#x2019;s a &#x2018;last stand moment&#x2019;&#x2026; Using the motion tracker is pointless and is not even needed in game, yet they have included it&#x2026; WHY? SO IT LOOKS LIKE AN ALIENS GAME!!! Pitchford you&#x2019;re a fool and so is your team! This franchise has so much quality material you couldn&#x2019;t go wrong yet you have churned out this disaster! If the game was not very good, why lead everyone down the garden path with the hype videos and e3 demo showing the quality that would never feature in the final product shipped? They should have just cancelled it or gone back to the drawing board&#x2026;
<br>
<br>This game is not recommended  2/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=3138308">Expand</a></span>

I played it for a few hours and I couldn&apos;t believe the bugs (no pun intended) littered everywhere. After realising how bad it is I found out that the Alpha gameplay demo is in fact a far superior version to the actual game. It actually looks like a different game. I have been scammed out of my money along with many many other supporters of this game. I loved Borderlands 1  2 and I had absolute faith that Gearbox could deliver. But this just isn&apos;t the case. If there is a game to avoid this year, then Aliens: Colonial Marines is the top contender.  I wouldn&apos;t even get this out of the bargain bin, and if you are a big ALIENS fan. Then I would stay a nuclear bomb radius away from this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2952926">Expand</a></span>

Not only does A:CM not have any of the graphical power seen in the 2011 E3 demo nor the interesting level designs, the entire game is essentially half broken. Enemy AI is ludicrously dumb and glitchy, the friendly AI is almost broken with some of the worst pathfinding Ive seen in literally years. The plot itself starts off well and actually has some interesting aspects to it throughout the middle but after a few levels, it just falls to pieces, as if they ran out of time and had to add in a horrible, poor-executed climax and conclusion. For fans of the franchise, you will be hooked by its generic xeno-killing gameplay but this excitement only lasts as long as your love for using the Pulse Rifle. There&apos;s a wide range of weapons but in all honesty, you&apos;ll probably only use 2-3 of them. Thankfully, the Smart-Gun and Pulse Rifles have been well designed and executed with their familiar sounds and impact (though the recoil for the Pulse Rifle is a big ridiculous). Another positive is the inclusion of legendary guns from the second film including Vasquez&apos;s Smartgun, Hudon&apos;s Pulse Rifle, Norman&apos;s Pistol etc. The NPC&apos;s you meet are generic as hell and have the worst lines (though the voice-acting is solid). The game cutscenes are poorly rendered and overall, the engine has a 2005 look with excessive lighting and poor textures. Multiplayer-wise, it holds up well but ultimately, compared Natural Selection 2, its inferior. Co-op just feels tacted on and is fun for a few levels for at the end of the day, its probably one of the worst implemented with player warping and a lack of Co-op features. Aliens: Colonial Marines is a total letdown and my biggest disappointment of a game since Mass Effect 3 last year. They have recently released a new patch that does enhance the AI and graphics as well as a solid Bug Hunt DLC but all in all its like adding extra icing and fresh seasoning to a chocolate cake gone bad: too little, too late. Unless you&apos;re a big Aliens nut like myself, than avoid A:CM at all costs. Its Game Over all right. Game Over.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=3053725">Expand</a></span>

<br>We got to the stage where you take 3 steps then have to let your character stand still for 2 minutes, then another 3 steps before standing still again while the Aliens sniff you (move the mouse to look and you&apos;re dead) and it was at this stage we realised that we were punishing ourselves for buying the game.
<br>Money down the drain.

If you want to develop a revenue stream based upon sustainable growth. This is an example of how not to do it. Make sure this idiot and his company are relegated to the unemployment poverty stricken hell they so richly deserve.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2952971">Expand</a></span>

<br>What it does right: The game level design, sound and music are all true to the license. It has some really nice references to the movie hidden throughout. The graphics are not ground breaking but are good enough. In other words, they set the scene for an awesome aliens game really well.
<br>
<br>What it does wrong: It completely removes the atmosphere the aliens franchise is known for. There are no moments when your fighting for you life. There are no jump scares. And the aliens do not behave like a dangerous opponent, in fact they spend most of their time walking at a reasonably slow pace with very little climbing on walls and roofs, and are just simple head straight towards target AIs like Serious Sam and just walk mindlessly towards you. Unlike Serious Sam you don&apos;t fight hordes of enemies or need keyboard agility to avoid them. In fact you can kinda half be asleep while in heavy combat in this game. The other thing which brings the game down is the fact you can carry all weapons and ammo at once, this basically turns you into a tank with unlimited ammo and in the aliens franchise ammo conservation is an important part of the fear factor.
<br>Summary: If you looking for an alien fix and don&apos;t mind the other species your best bet is still Aliens Vs Predator (The original one not the new one) and its sequel and play through the marine campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2953583">Expand</a></span>

But I have played it with as an objective perspective as possible.
<br>
<br>My initial impression was actually quite mixed. For a bit, even though I knew how cut down the atmosphere and graphics were from the marketing demo we saw: I actually liked the atmosphere and lighting even though it didn&apos;t feel really new and awesome. It was dark, intense blinking lights, etc. It really gave me a nice sense of fear and creepyness.
<br>What was bad however was the presentation of the plot and the really wooden and clich&#xE9; characters. Even by game standards it was just not even close to par with games that have decent dramatisation and dialogue.
<br>
<br>From here on it goes downhill fast and stays there. The gunplay couple with the enemy and buddy AI is just complete rubbish: as bad as Brink. Just as in Brink your buddies are useless and their gun-fire is more visual effect than effective. The AI is just spawn spawn spawn and jump jump jump around: compounded by all the guns being weak pea-shooters with small mags and clumsy handling. Like I said: exactly what made Brink so bad.
<br>The Xenos are just really not good in terms of modeling, behaviour and danger. We have this image of the Xenos from the movies as unbelievably good ambush masters that need to be killed from atleast 10 yards away or longer if you don&apos;t wanna die. In this you just constantly shoot at them while they&apos;re in front of you in a stale &quot;a blooga blooga boo!&quot; stance. It reminds me of old 90s arcade games where you just had a big sprite in front of you and it didn&apos;t really animate in any way.
<br>So yeah instead of amazing sneaky and lightning fast xenos we really don&apos;t get anything more complex than doom3d enemies coming at you going &quot;rawr&quot;. That&apos;s the one move they have: they spawn and climb stuff to get to about 10 yards away from you. Then they kind of crouch and wiggle their hiney followed by a silly pounce in front of you. It&apos;s like you&apos;re playing against cats in xeno costumes.
<br>The way they behaved in the AvP games was actually kind of good: to go way way way down in quality after all these years is just pathetic.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d go on but I&apos;m already tired of pointing out all these inadequacies. It&apos;s a bad game with gameplay that in parts is as simple and archaic as doom3d and some parts at best live up to 2004 gaming standards. If I had developed this I would be ashamed of myself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2968310">Expand</a></span>

This game will likely be 5$ on a steam sale in a year for sure. I got sucked in as a die hard aliens fan. Before this game even got released I had a feeling it was going to be bad. Not because of something we were shown, but because of what we WEREN&apos;T shown. A day before release and I&apos;m sitting there paying for the preorder through steam, thinking to myself &quot;isn&apos;t it odd that there isn&apos;t a single actual gameplay video for this game? No teaser no nothing that is relevant to the release candidate?&quot;. Well I learned my lesson we can say that. I am not going to sum up everything I thought was wrong about this game, but I think I was one of the few that actually didn&apos;t mind the graphics. The worst part was the gameplay itself. It&apos;s an aliens game that is actually more difficult during the parts where you fight humans. Which happens roughly 50-60% of the game, or at least feels like it because it&apos;s harder. There are WAY too WY soldiers to fight in this game. The aliens in this game are laughably bad at what they do, so much so that it&apos;s not even scary to fight the aliens, not even difficult to say the least. They either run straight at you, or are a &quot;spitter&quot;  alien (dreamt up by someone who theorized it would make a good game element in multiplayer probably) with a glowing head that you can see from a mile away. The multiplayer while it is somewhat fun, is basically just a back and forth with aliens and marines in a small call of duty arena style battle. Good luck getting into any other game modes beyond team deathmatch because everyone has already moved on from the game. If this game ended up going the multiplayer route of natural selection 2, this game could have actually been  awesome. Even if all the other gaping flaws still existed, the natural selection 2 multiplayer model with an aliens theme would have been so so sick.
<br>
<br>The worst part about this game is without a doubt the alien melee &quot;pistol&quot; finishers. I have never seen such a  waste of animation in my entire goddamn life. Let me put it this way. In an aliens game, if you put your entire hand and pistol in an aliens mouth (and alien with molecular acid blood) and pull the trigger, you better be either pulling a half melted pistol out of it&apos;s mouth or be screaming while the bones fall off your hand for me to even START believing the character just did that. But no, your character will  jam his pistol and hand into the aliens mouth, pull the trigger, and pull it out completely unscathed. I&apos;m SHOCKED I haven&apos;t seen more complains about this, because this is the stupidest thing I have ever seen. The lack of realistic consequences in this game absolutely kills any potential of fear.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=3068350">Expand</a></span>

However.......changing the AI so that every single alien on the screen runs straight at you AND only you regardless of how many other marines are standing around is even dumber.  Plus those said marines still have dumb AI that don&apos;t actually help you at all.  Then you get up to the first human rivals and they have an uncanny ability to throw grenades directly at you and frequently, all the while ignoring the rest of your marine teams which still stand around scratching their balls.

It is like an arcade game where an alien or copany guy pops up so you can shoot them. Don&apos;t worry about them harming you. People have made videos of sidestepping aliens thru a later level without firing a shot. The multiplayer is somewhat redeeming. The biggest problem is they put out a horrible game and without feeling an ounce of shame, they felt they could sell new content. They even have the nerve to sell a single player add-on, really??? This should be the lowest rated game of the year. Maybe Simcity would beat it other then the initial launch, but overall gameplay, this is hands down the worst of the year. There is no way they should charge 50 for  the game then charge for the season pass. Give it away to make up for this abomination they tricked people into buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=3369355">Expand</a></span>

Blame the casual players! This game was supposed to be an awesome survival experience, but to make the game more accessible to a larger public, the incompetent directors of Sega and Gearbox decided to make it a Call of Duty clone. You don&apos;t even need to use the motion tracker one single moment on the entire campaign even on the hardest difficulty, because no enemy will ever spawn behind you. But if you can go through the festival of bugs, and the awful ending, you will able to enjoy a somewhat fun shooter with an actually good soundtrack.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2958677">Expand</a></span>

When I saw the reviews on its release day, I wasn&#x2019;t expecting a great game but it was worse than I imagined. Graphics from 5 years ago and gameplay from 10 years. It&#x2019;s not scary, it lacks atmosphere, the weapons feel weak, the AI is atrocious, the NPCs constantly glitch and the animations of the aliens are so laughably bad at times it breaks any possible immersion into the game&#x2019;s world. And why am I spending more of the game shooting men than HR Geiger&#x2019;s monsters? I didn&#x2019;t buy a game set in the Aliens universe to shoot at other marines. The multiplayer isn&#x2019;t much better. I was hoping that it would be like a cross between Valve&#x2019;s Alien Swarm and Tripwire&#x2019;s Killing Floor, both tactical co-op shooters that employ strategy, different player classes, a varied range of weapons and equipment, and which require planning and strong co-operation and co-ordination between players (at least on the harder difficult settings). Instead it&#x2019;s a poor imitation of the versus mode from the far superior Left 4 Dead. The maps are badly designed, the game mechanics are poor, the controls are clumsy, and there are no player classes and a very limited range of weapons. If you want to play a co-operative game set in an Aliens-like universe then I strongly recommend Alien Swarm, which is a 100% free game available on Steam.
<br>
<br>The game feels unfinished and from what I&#x2019;ve read about its disastrous six-year development it sounds like it was a rush job done in nine months in order to get rid of the project and appease publisher Sega. It&#x2019;s hard to believe this is the same developer (ie Gearbox) that brought us the excellent Borderland games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2995498">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>60% of the time the AI have aliens right next to them and don&apos;t do a damn thing because they are invincible why would the human AI care?
<br>
<br>Some of the aliens don&apos;t actually attack you and they sit there on the ceiling moving alive and invincible...
<br>some of the cinematic killing scenes don&apos;t work properly 70% of the time.. really choppy or missing parts of the scene
<br>
<br>the AI just stand in front of the auto turrets and continuously get shot lol..
<br>
<br>i played through a very good portion of the game and they pretty much ruined it. I can&apos;t list everything wrong with the game but I&apos;m sure you can look for yourself. I hope they start from scratch and remake this game the way its meant to be made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2966284">Expand</a></span>

And yet, the pairing eludes a happy ending once again. Aliens: Colonial Marines isn&apos;t disappointing because it couldn&apos;t live up to lofty expectations, it&apos;s disappointing because it turned out to be such an unfettered disaster.</span>

Aliens swarm at you in massive numbers, die easily, and look they&apos;ve been hit by paintballs as they lie dead. I love the Aliens setting and thought I would give it a chance, but I can&apos;t even bring myself to play it, it&apos;s simply not fun at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=3459002">Expand</a></span>

<br>On the bright side, The multi-player was fun while it lasted, Shame really as Gearbox seemed to care more about the online gameplay  than the actual campaign.

I would not recommend this title, not even to hardcore fans of the Aliens franchise. There&apos;s nothing to see here, even as pure fanservice it falls flat. It&apos;s not worth enduring Colonial Marines&apos; below average gameplay to experience this &quot;canon&quot; continuation of the series, as you&apos;ll probably also end up disappointed by the retcons and sophomoric writing.

I&apos;ve been playing the game in campaign coop mode with a friend and it has been a great experience. The gameplay dynamics are solid, with good controls. The graphics are decent with great lighting effects. Progressive weapon upgrades add to the experience.  The story augments the play. I can only think that the game was released with too many bugs or something for people to rate it so low. We&apos;ve not experienced any issues, so can only assume any problems have subsequently been repaired. Playing on Steam, drop-in/out connectivity is superb and well integrated. Good solid aliens fun. If you&apos;re a fan of the genre, I don&apos;t know how you couldn&apos;t find at least the current $20 asking price worth of fun and entertainment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=3629646">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you close your eyes you will feel like you&apos;re really into one of the Alien movies, but when reopening them you will be really disappointed by the stupid A.I., the poor storytelling and the bad presentation.
<br>Gameplay would be fun if not affected by all those bugs, the enemies act like they&apos;re animals, the strategy that you expect from the creatures just does not exist in this game, the human enemies will randomly leave covering position and your fellow soldiers are more a pain in the ass than an aid (the worst thing is that most of the issues could be corrected by a proper debug phase).
<br>Graphics are 6.5/10, but the use of lights and shadows is light years far from the 1977 masterpiece and some of textures are so much low res for a 2013 game.
<br>Sound is good in complex, but some audio effects are missing and the music is simply trivial.
<br>The weapons upgrade system is nice and the unlockable add-ons are well distributed.
<br>In conclusion, if you are an Alien fan that can close one eye (or two), you will enjoy shooting some xenomorphs.
<br>Otherwise just run away without looking back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2961249">Expand</a></span>

In fact, if you are dying to play an Aliens game, play that one instead  you can probably get it relatively cheap.</span>

The most honest and true review I found for this game can be found here at http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/02/12/wot-i-think-aliens-colonial-marines-single-player/ Please do not waste your money, time or effort with this game. The AI is so terrible that the enemies/aliens will run away from you or will stand still and let you shoot them. You take more damage from enemy humans with guns than you do aliens. The level design is horrible, all you are allowed to do is open doors and hit checkpoints. You can literally play this game on the hardest settings and run from checkpoint to checkpoint barely killing anything. This does not feel anything like ALIENS.
<br>
<br>The graphics are circa 2005 and use Direct X 9, that&apos;s right... the game is very bright, and does not convey any sense of visual moodiness to it, at no point is there anything to shock or awe over as far as eye candy goes.
<br>
<br>Factor in that there are terrible bugs found throughout the game, no dedicated servers for a bare bones multiplayer mode and you can easily tell hands down that this is probably going to win WORST GAME OF THE YEAR 2013. But hey dont take my word for it, Youtube a few videos for yourself and see the vast majority of other critics reviews. A lot of good people got fleeced when they bought this game, dont be one of them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2965636">Expand</a></span>

The graphics (which do not make a game good) are dire here with textures that seem to hark back to 2006 if not earlier. The campaign is nonsensical with terrible AI on both sides of the player and a plot line that seems to just make things up as it goes along and fail (although promises) to provide explanation. The NPCs, you just end up hating them, especially O&apos;Niel who is meant to be &quot;your guy&quot;. He either does nothing and just watches you battling moronic aliens or when he does shoot he seems to have forgotten his real smart gun and brought along his nerf version  utterly pointless. As for the voice acting, lets just say it&apos;s bad. I need to go back to the AI again here  because it&apos;s so poor, so bad, you have no feel at all of suspense or terror. The aliens are dumb (not that you&apos;ll end up fighting them much in this game). Instead of the creepy, could come from anywhere alien, they leap into the center of the room  and then barrel roll at you allowing you plenty of time to blow them away. If they actually manage to get close enough to you to hit you, they hit you once and then leap away, allowing you to blow them away  what&apos;s the point?
<br>
<br>The multiplayer  as long as you&apos;re a marine you&apos;ll end up ok as the controls are easy and pretty much what you&apos;d expect. As the alien you&apos;re completely screwed, the controls don&apos;t seem to work and nothing is fluid about it. When I try and wall climb my alien has a fit and I end up being shot for trying to play as an alien!!!
<br>
<br>Good points  They&apos;ve got the sound and music right, but was that really difficult?
<br>- It works. It has yet to crash on me to be fair and everything seems to work the way it was meant too.
<br>That&apos;s it.
<br>
<br>There was so much opportunity with this game to offer up something great, the breath new life in to the Aliens franchise, but it was squandered. What could have potentially been Gearbox&apos;s best game turned out to be something they don&apos;t even seem to want to comment on except blame other developers and Sega. I think I can speak for fans when I say I would have preferred another 6 year delay and a good game rather than this copy and paste COD shooter that contains all the horror and suspense of a jar of pickled eggs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2993072">Expand</a></span>

None of which are present in this game. The poorly textured repetitive environments are a bore, where you&apos;ll always find the same poorly programmed Xenomorphs glitching around on the walls trying to feebly slash at you, or even atrocious gunfights against humans. It&apos;s a totally rinse and repeat formula after an hour or two, there&apos;s barely any variation whatsoever. However, there is actually one good stealthy level where you have no weapons and are completely vulnerable to wart-covered, husks of Xenos. There&apos;s also a relatively good level of authenticity for the spaceships and planets, even linking directly back to the films. I really don&apos;t know why, but even on the hardest difficulty the Xenos are just not terrifying enough. There&apos;s never a moment where you have to hurry and prepare and wait for them to come knocking at the door, it&apos;s just a random sprawl of enemies jumping on top of each other and slashing at friendly AI. I do think this is meant to be a horror game, not a military shooter, and this game leans more on the latter. You can carry EVERY gun you&apos;ve unlocked at once, completely knocking out the immersion factor straight away. The story is all over the place with utterly dislikeable characters who you couldn&apos;t care less about. The low resolution PS2 cutscenes don&apos;t do them any justice either. Moments of intrigue and horror are blown out with moronic dialogue like imitating the Xenos, &apos;They were like, oh yeah, we&apos;re gonna blow up now!

All the hype and promises lead up to this pile of useless garbage? How can this even happen with a 50$ game, it&apos;s mind-boggling. It is so bad, unpolished, buggy, cliche... just thinking about it makes me nervous. The graphics are very dated, it&apos;s like the developers didn&apos;t even care. The textures look like they&apos;ve been taken from a 2007 game on medium settings. Animations made me want to gouge my eyes out, the way a limping man just glides over the terrain? Aliens who just die into a stiff ragdoll? The way their wounds are just yellow blood textures on the models? Concerning the gameplay, it is nothing but another lame, generic FPS that is exciting for about the first two encounters. It is the same old s**t, clear a room, move on. Hold the button to weld a door. Rapidly press the button to punch an alien and stun it(ridiculous). Multiplayer? Oh look, suicide bomber aliens. How original. The story, you won&apos;t even care for. All the shock value of aliens, chestbursters etc. is gone for any fan of the franchise. It is slightly unsettling for the first 5 minutes before your first alien encounter, when you go back to seeing them as cannon fodder that walks up to you and slashes the air, cause that&apos;s how they attack, if they don&apos;t pounce on you and initiate the same quicktime event for the millionth time. I had that exact quicktime event 3 times during my first encounter with an alien. AvP 3 Marine campaign has better atmosphere than this worthless trash, which says enough. With all things taken into account, this insult to the franchise deserves nothing but a 0.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-colonial-marines/user-reviews?user_review_id=2950187">Expand</a></span>
