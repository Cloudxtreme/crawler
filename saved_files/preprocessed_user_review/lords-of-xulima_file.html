I was in between games &amp; looking for something different to play when I ran across this game in a thread about good RPG-Tactical Games. I am glad I gave Xulima a try. It has a nostalgic feel to it and that old fashioned D&amp;D appeal (I date back to the white box/3 booklet early D&amp;D Pen and Paper Days) that some of us old timers still remember. This feel though, is coupled with some very nice (albeit very basic) game mechanics that just simply work for the type game it was designed to be. At first glance, I thought that the combat mechanics were a little &#x201C;hokey&#x201D; but they work and they work elegantly. I look forward to the battles and they make you think and plan each combat turn. In addition to the combat and questing, there are some nice surprises in your exploration &amp; adventuring. For us old schoolers that enjoy some logistics, there are some simple but elegant food &amp; rest requirements that work without being tedious. To me, the best part of the game is the old school leveling up and making hard choices in your skill &amp; attribute allocations as you advance. If you are a &#x201C;instant gratification / pew-pew&#x201D; gamer that needs high end graphics and action, stay away. But if you can use your imagination a bit and want a nicely done, old school adventure game, Xulima is your ticket. I hope they follow with a sequel&#x2026;I havent been addicted to a game this bad in along time&#x2026;
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>Old School Nostalgic Feel
<br>Nicely Done Game and Combat Mechanics
<br>Immersion
<br>Elegant Logistics, basic but not tedious
<br>Nicely done advancement system
<br>Challenging (recommend the medium or hard settings, don&#x2019;t play on &#x201C;normal&#x201D;)
<br>Overall game package just works &#x2013; good feel, fit and finish
<br>Hours and Hours of RPG Adventure Fun
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>Simple but elegant graphics &#x2013; no huge explosions or 3D action here
<br>Might feel grindy for some
<br>Some might miss the &#x201C;follow the green arrow&#x201D; tips of other games ie., this is a thinking persons game&#x2026;
<br>Combat system may be too quirky for some (again, no &#x201C;pew-pew&#x201D; here)
<br>Some may miss the &#x201C;Monty Hall&#x201D; fell of other titles&#x2026;you work for your loot here&#x2026;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lords-of-xulima/user-reviews?user_review_id=5515264">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Let me explain. The game is very forgiving on the lower difficulties and significantly less so on the higher difficulties. On all of them however it is at least somewhat complex, requiring some degree of planning and common sense from you. There are no green arrows that tell you where you should go next. At the same time it&apos;s not entirely without direction, as NPCs will tell you about other regions of the world. Many call this game linear because &quot;Titanic&quot; encounters block all the &quot;incorrect&quot; paths. First, those are blocking shortcuts and not paths. Second, most of them are defeatable early anyways even on the highest difficulty allowing for a great deal of sequence breaking at least on par with that of a Souls game.
<br>
<br>The second thing a lot of people have trouble with is the presentation. Yes, the graphics are simple and the animations a bit clunky. This is an indie game made on a tiny budget and one of the very few Early Access success stories that exist. Sacrifices must be made. Likewise the story is fairly generic... this game is focused on the game mechanics first and everything else second and as a result the core game is solid.
<br>
<br>The third thing is the difficulty. As I mentioned the low difficulties are very forgiving. A lot of modern gamers will struggle even there as even the &quot;Casual&quot; difficulty still demands something from you and most modern games do not. Exercise even a little forethought however and you&apos;ll be right at home on the middle difficulty for your first run and either after completing it, or hitting the halfway point and finding it easy you can then charge right back in on the highest difficulty and complete that. And then if that&apos;s STILL easy, some crazy guy (me) is making a mod that makes it harder still. I&apos;ve easily gotten 450 hours out of this game and I am nowhere near done with it. Forget all that pretentious generic crap, this is the best game I&apos;ve tried all year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lords-of-xulima/user-reviews?user_review_id=5640763">Expand</a></span>

<br>Exploration from an isometric perspective and first-person turn-based battles with a party of six.

<br>The game is deep, but easy to understand. Challenging, but also accessible.

<br>
<br>This game is about the love for RPG&apos;s. The love for playing games like the way they were meant to be played, with enough own imagination.
<br>
<br>For me a game is all about wanting to continue, curious about what&apos;s coming next, when am I strong enough the defeat that certain boss, discouvering new areas. This game has it all and mostly, it shows the love the desingers have for RPG&apos;s. Not to cash in enough money to make part 2.
<br>
<br>I love it, you should try to love it too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lords-of-xulima/user-reviews?user_review_id=4741704">Expand</a></span>

<br>Mix in a Development team that actually listens to it&apos;s community, and adds patches/upgrades faster than you can say &quot;Kill That Ogre&quot;, and you just can&apos;t go wrong with this game.

The game&apos;s graphic style is unique and refreshing; classic 2D top-down perspective, but with a level of detail that is easy on the eyes.  The combat is addictive and challenging.  The music is the best I&apos;ve heard in a game in a very long time.  Overall, fantastic game. Highly recommended.</span>

Guided by a dream sent by the gods of his world, Gaulen sails to a forgotten continent. During exploration, the game is very similar to classics like Baldur&#xB4;s Gate, but once combat begins, it will look like a mixture of Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy 10 and the newer Etrian Odyssey series. It is also often compared to the Wizardry-series.
<br>
<br>Major Features:
<br>
<br>- A charming atmosphere, travel through a mystical world and explore secret graves, forsaken temples and more.
<br>- Challenging and strategic combat. Very original due to the elaborate debuff system.
<br>- Character skills and equipment management are rich and rewarding.
<br>- Recaptures the feeling of oldschool rpg series like no other game
<br>
<br>Possible weakpoints (depending on your taste):
<br>
<br>- Story plays only a secondary role. Exploration, combat and character management take the main spotlight.
<br>- Recaptures the feeling of oldschool rpg series like no other game. You wonder why this is repeated in the negatives list? Because nowadays we are so accustomed to arrows that point where we have to go and other such luxuries that the transition can be very rough.
<br>- Hard to get going. You have to manage the party, food reserves and find your way in a huge non-linear world. (If you have troubles, try the easiest difficulty. There you can learn the basic game mechanics without getting your head chopped off for every mistake.)
<br>
<br>Minor addittion: You CAN run in this game, the trailer shows only the walking speed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lords-of-xulima/user-reviews?user_review_id=4737966">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Good:
<br>
<br>Old school style with new school mechanics:
<br>it has kind of an old school feel of ultima in a way but it&#x2019;s supported by new age combat and graphics.
<br>Interesting combat game-play:
<br>basically if your enemy is using a melee weapon and he&#x2019;s to the far left of the screen he can&#x2019;t attack the far right without moving first, which costs half a turn to move. In addition to that it&#x2019;s all turn based combat with weapons and skills that can stun and while not as comprehensive as say final fantasy x and it&#x2019;s turn based system it&#x2019;s still pretty good.
<br>The voice overs are pretty good:
<br>often the proper voice can make or break a game, but they pretty much nailed it here the narrator and the voice of god sound very appropriate and usually are dipping with dramatic feel to it.
<br>The environments are pretty well detailed and everything looks good:
<br>it actually a good thing to be a developer on Steam and not have your game look like it was done in MS Paint and here it looks really well done, with good detail in pretty much everything you encounter and every where you go.
<br>It has a Steam workshop:
<br>there is too many mods and for the most part they haven&#x2019;t done too much in terms of really outlandish stuff, but it&#x2019;s always nice to have.
<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>
<br>The outright necessary grinding:
<br>I&#x2019;m not kidding here you WILL grind in this game you WILL kill every enemy in every area if you want to continue on your quest there is no maybe here.
<br>but wait there&#x2019;s more! the enemy&apos;s are finite and you get a bonus for killing all of them that you will need, so you LITTERY have to go everywhere to fight every enemy.
<br>The lack of skills:
<br>the ones they do have are more trial and error and outside of the divine summoner class it feels like most characters really don&#x2019;t have a lot of skills in the beginning and as they level up they still feel really under powered.
<br>Complete lack of explanations:
<br>most of the skill icons you can&#x2019;t click on so you don&#x2019;t know what they do same with the icons on the weapon stat&#x2019;s, even concepts like when poison or bleeding will affect you is never explained, Also it never gives you a look at what skills you character will receive way down the line so you&apos;re never sure what you&apos;re building towards.
<br>Often times completely unrealistic with its difficulty:
<br>somehow even after you take down nearly EVERY enemy in EVERY part you can go in a map if you didn&#x2019;t build you didn&#x2019;t min/max your characters correctly then congrats you get to start all over again from the beginning of the game.
<br>it has such an unforgiving difficulty that even if you have been playing CRPG&#x2019;s your entire life you&apos;re still going to lose, that being said however you&apos;re probably going to restart to get your revenge (after you buy a new keyboard).
<br>The DLC feels like a slap in the face:
<br>I swear it like the devs when they making them were like &#x201C;aww is it too hard for you? that&#x2019;s ok you can just spend more of your money too make it allll better.&#x201D;
<br>It has a weird stutter when you run:
<br>this could just be my computer but it has a really weird jerky stutter when your character starts running again it could be just me but it&#x2019;s weird.
<br>
<br>The Summary:
<br>
<br>This game just is not approachable by anybody who isn&#x2019;t direly serious about needing a challenge in a CRPG and Dark Souls &amp; Bloodborne just aren&#x2019;t your thing, everybody else just needs to stay away from this title because the only thing you&#x2019;ll find with this game is frustration and a lot of broken keyboards, but if you can make it past all that there is a good game here albeit one I can&#x2019;t recommend but a good game all the same.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lords-of-xulima/user-reviews?user_review_id=5995130">Expand</a></span>

<br>I really loved this game for a while.  Reminded me a bit of the simple fun I had playing the Ultima games back in the 80&apos;s.
<br>It&apos;s got the usual things that you like from RPGs.  The character creation, the battle with monsters, the loot, the leveling, etc.
<br>
<br>Again for a while but then after so many hours, you will see a lot of it is the same; in particular you spend the majority of the time in battles.
<br>So repetitive my shoulder actually started to ache from the same repetitive moments, and I&apos;d literally get sleepy doing the same things over again.
<br>Although this goes a lot for other RPGs of this style (like the final fantasy style et al).
<br>
<br>Then at first you see a lot of the world is the same and rather bland.
<br>
<br>It lacks direction.  There is a story behind it, but it feels like it&apos;s a lot of aimless wandering, again over
<br>a lot of scenery that  got bland.
<br>
<br>Finally the classes are not hashed out as good as they probably could be. Some are over powered, some are basically useless.
<br>You would expect that a typical balanced party setup like:
<br>A tank, cleric, thief, and Mage, then one extra like a Bard for the buffs or CC, would work great.
<br>But it turns out the way the game balance works you&apos;ed be better off with more tanks, or otherwise high HP and defense guys.   I though a thief was needed to have a lock picking, disarming expert, but it
<br>turns out I could have had the main &quot;explorer&quot; character learn those skills and a thief archer was almost useless in battle.
<br>The mechanics are that AOE CC (area of effect, crowd control) characters are some of the best, as the simple fact that whom ever has the most to attack gets the most hits in.  If you can lock the enemy up the less damage you will take, and killing them faster en mass will save you a lot of the tedium.
<br>You are best to read some kind of guide before you start, rather then using your intuition from previous RPG experiences.
<br>
<br>Overall worth the price since you will get a lot of RPG enjoyment out of it, but I doubt you will make it to the end..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lords-of-xulima/user-reviews?user_review_id=4785659">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As a CRPG player from the 80s, I can say that I&apos;ve had my share of both good and bad CRPGs, forgiving and what might have ultimately felt impossible to finish. Lords of Xulima brings the old school back with a vengeance, but with that little bit of new flavor that&apos;s enough to feel fresh for us old timers, and possibly enjoyable for younger CRPG fans (and by younger I don&apos;t mean your age, but number of years you&apos;ve been playing in the genre).
<br>
<br>The story is nothing to write home about, as you are a hero who has been assigned with a task to clear some temples built by Gods that are being abused by an evil prince and witches, but the story is still gripping. The writing is a tiny bit cheesy, but it&apos;s nothing to complain over. Personally, I&apos;m not bothered by it, and I feel it sets the tone for the game.
<br>
<br>The game play is also nice. You have a party of 6 adventurers; the hero which is pre-made and 5 fully created characters of your own. There are several classes to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and while you can&apos;t really customize the skills and stats at the front all that much, you can fully customize as you level up. Also, if you get tired of your character&apos;s ugly mug, you can change it on the fly with any of the other portraits available (I do like this feature a lot, though it might seem silly to some). Your party is identified by your main character traveling in an isometric view of the world. You can interact with people, items, etc. Food storage is important in this game. Those who played the older Might and Magics or even Ultima Underworld I &amp; II will remember how important food was. The biggest gripe I have about it in Lords of Xulima is that EVERYTHING you do uses up food; from just walking around, to bashing open chests and of course, resting. While consuming food while resting is great, I feel just walking around and using up food stores is a little bit too much of a pain in the butt, especially since gold is limited in this game. There are other alternatives though to this food issue, providing you&apos;re patient or resourceful.
<br>
<br>Combat can be VERY unforgiving in this game. It&apos;s turn based and does require some strategy, which old fans like myself of the genre will enjoy. However, at the beginning of the game, you&apos;ll find yourself being beaten down by the easiest of foes if you&apos;re not careful. A lot of this is due to the game not pointing out buffs you can receive in the first village. If you&apos;re willing to pay for these temporary buffs, they will make combat more manageable in the beginning, but they add up in expense quickly and again, gold is limited in this game.
<br>
<br>Lastly, my final issue with this game is the loot. Most loot you come across is &quot;meh&quot; at best, and a lot of your bigger and better items will come from lucky rolls at the shops. I&apos;m glad this game isn&apos;t a gear grind of boring farming for hours to find one piece of upgradeable equipment.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t let my review deter you though, if it sounds negative. Overall, the game is actually quite good, especially for the money. It&apos;s definitely challenging, and might disappoint those who thing this is a game you can just steamroll through. It does take a little bit of thought and careful planning, but it&apos;s definitely worth at least one playthrough. I give it 8/10 because of the somewhat disappointing loot, and the food system is a little too much for me. Give it a try!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lords-of-xulima/user-reviews?user_review_id=5054509">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;m a fan of turn based RPGs, and this one is getting on my nerves - I find myself thinking - why am I clicking on these monsters for hours, cant I go play something better? Wizardry8, Jagged Alliance, King&apos;s Bounty and more recently Divinity Original sin - all of these are examples of superb turn based games, where the core of the game - turn based combat was fun and challenging. In this game battles are too long and too tedious to be enjoyable.
<br>
<br>Sure, the game promises 100 hours gameplay, but you will soon realize why it is so - you will be repeating the same boring fights over and over and over again. For example the forest of Nabros has the same patrol of 10 soldiers, which you will be running from until you can defeat them. Guess what? Once you can beat one patrol, you can beat all of them, and it becomes a grind. Then you will be running to town to buy your +5 speed blessing every 24 in-game hours.
<br>
<br>While you can push towards new lands and get more challenging fights, you will still be pestered by hordes of invisible roaming encounters which offer you an option to run/camouflage, but no autoresolve, meaning you WILL evenbually be forced to fight these.
<br>
<br>The game deserves a credit for exploration - this is the true strength of this game. Dungeons are pretty cool - there are 4 castles, 8 temples an 8 towers to explore plus a number of smaller dungeons. These are well thought out with traps, secret doors and various hints dropped around.
<br>
<br>Puzzles are decent, there&apos;s a number of &quot;type answer here&quot; kind of riddles.
<br>
<br>The game offers some non-linearity - you can go as far as you can, as long as you can defeat the guards at zone transitions. Unfortunately the power levels of these game are rising steeply - you simply won&apos;t kill a group of 200hp guards which hit for 30 damage if your toughest tank has 100hp and 20 damage. Large portions of the game are blocked off by these &quot;Titanic&quot; challenges that you cant beat until much later.
<br>
<br>If you made a mistake of attacking guards in the first town too early, you will be locked into a very small game area where you will have to grind for 3 hours before you can defeat the 10 man patrols that box you in from the northern lands.
<br>
<br>This brings me to the next gripe - ridiculously beefy enemies which offer no challenge. 400hp treants, 800hp dinosaurs, etc. 3 of my damage dealers can do 20-40 damage per attack. There&apos;s no challenge to these fights -tank and spank, repeat.
<br>
<br>The RPG system is OK - your characters can learn new skills as they level and spend skillpoints on improving existing skills. There are skill books and mushrooms that reward exploration by improving character stats.
<br>
<br>The equipment system is rather poor. Too often I found chests with like 100gold x 5 - all slots in the chest are filled with gold, there&apos;s rarely any equipment drops. The two vendors I found don&apos;t restock frequently, so at level 14 I&apos;m continuously sitting on 6000 gold that I have nothing to spend on.
<br>
<br>Most of the equipment is both skill level and stat locked, so a sword might require 8 sword skill and 18 strength and agility.
<br>
<br>Overall, I doubt I will play this game through the entire 100 hours of gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lords-of-xulima/user-reviews?user_review_id=4705466">Expand</a></span>

Most of the positive reviews were written mere days after release, which is a red flag for a game as big as LoX.
<br>
<br>The game purports to have 100 or more hours of gameplay, but all of that gameplay lacks much nuance or variety.  The first couple of hours are the only fun hours.  It boasts an &quot;open world&quot;, but in reality, where you can go and what you can do is strictly limited by what level you are and what you have already done.  The quest and dialogue options are pointless, usually not even giving you the illusion of control.
<br>
<br>Poorly written quests and dialogue contain quest information that you have to piece together, so just breezing past all of it is not always an option.  While monsters aren&apos;t level-ramped, the in-game economy is, so as your level goes up, your costs go up, too, even for what should be fixed costs, like food.  Given how important food is in this game and how little of it you can carry, and how much pointless walking there is in this game, the game feels like it punishes you for success.  Having the right mix of character types is critical, but this is hampered by having the main character loaded with essential support skills that if you don&apos;t pick will make the game pointlessly difficult.  The tradeoff is that if you do choose these skills, the character is nearly useless in combat.
<br>
<br>The items boil down to a dozen or so basic items, the only difference being the amount of stat bonuses they give you.   There are no weapons or armor which, for instance, will make you use a given character differently.  The entire game feels very incremental, and there is never a satisfying feeling at getting a new item - it&apos;s just always a matter of trivial increase, over and over.
<br>
<br>The game is profoundly buggy, which sometimes results in over-paying the player for items, locking up fights before they start, or skipping key fights.
<br>
<br>The balance is completely out of whack, with the game being at once very linear in what it expects you to do next, but very arbitrary in where it has put the next place you need to do it.  This often results in your party finding itself in an area where every fight is a 100% chance of losing until you find the area you&apos;re &quot;supposed&quot; to be in.  This gives the lie to the claim that there is anything truly non-linear or open about the game.
<br>
<br>Skip this celebration of everything bad about the worst RPGs of the 1980s and 1990s.  You can find better for your time and money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lords-of-xulima/user-reviews?user_review_id=5166265">Expand</a></span>

<br>On paper there are lot of skills and character choices but due constant lack of skill points you cannot pick even half of them. You cannot experiment, you must strictly specialize or you will be punished.

<br>
<br>This could have been an 8, easily, if not for the explorer and the battle loading screens. Lemme tackle these separately:
<br>
<br>Why on earth are we allowed to create 5 party members of whatever we want, then this explorer is FORCED upon us, whether we want him or not, whether he works for our group setup or not? At least make his thief skills more affordable so if we want to go that route, we aren&apos;t stuck with a gimped half-fighter. Let me say that I do understand enough about the game to know that the skills only he has are useful, I just wish he had more flexibility.
<br>
<br>The battle loading screens are even more annoying than they sound. Part of this game, apparently, is avoiding enemies higher than your level, coming back for them, or risking a fight with them. If you do risk a fight and lose, you&apos;ve got to save your game, wait for the battle to load, try the battle, wait for one of your guys to get a turn (which, if you&apos;re losing, could take a while), then load your saved game. It takes way too long. Is it supposed to be so punitive for trying a harder fight?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lords-of-xulima/user-reviews?user_review_id=6885776">Expand</a></span>
