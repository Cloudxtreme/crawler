<br>The first few minutes of Super Mario are to teach how to play and it does so via events. (Braid quotes Mario in these first few minutes quite a lot). That kind of tutorial is an intelligent learning experience. There are obvious actions to take, suggested actions and hidden actions to experiment if you are curious. The Witness is a whole game dedicated to this!
<br>This game is not for casual gamers because it could walk as master example in a philosophy book titled: Phenomenology of learning.

And the inside of this game is shallow and uninteresting, just like the one-night-standee might turn out to be.
<br>
<br>Some 10/10&apos;s want to us to think that there&apos;s something more behind this whole walking around the island and solving hundreds of maze puzzles. Nope. There are no little story pieces, just some random quotes from famous thinkers, like Albert Einstein. It doesn&apos;t give us any background, they&apos;re just quotes.
<br>
<br>Then there are the puzzles. At first I thought: &quot;Oh, a maze puzzle, cool.&quot; Then I was: &quot;Oh, that was a clever one. I feel smarter by solving this one.&quot; But after the 100th puzzle I was thinking: &quot;is that all there is? I&apos;m going to solve hundreds of puzzles to get several ray guns shoot that big thing on the top of the mountain?&quot; Well, I looked it up and it turns out it&apos;s exactly that. Apparently you wander the island for hours and hours, solving one maze puzzle after another until you reach the end (which I didn&apos;t manage to accomplish, mind you) that makes all the puzzle solving completely futile. Neat. Why not buy a paper Sudoku booklet for like $.99 then, instead of spending $40 on a game which very principle is exactly the same - to get you thinking real hard.
<br>
<br>I won&apos;t go any lower than 4, because the game looks pretty. We had a one-night-stand together, but in all seriousness, I don&apos;t want to see it ever again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6047559">Expand</a></span>

<br>Apart from that, there are various technical flaws that should&apos;ve been sorted out during the game&apos;s long development, such as the absence of a field-of-view slider, mouse control in the menus, proper graphics settings, etc.
<br>Players will face some other design issues, such as the slow acceleration when you start walking, the initial lack of maps or any sort of guidance - which makes us feel overwhelmed and lost.
<br>If you can handle a considerable amount of frustration and much repetitive gameplay, you might even enjoy the experience proposed by Jonathan Blow and his team in this beautiful, yet boring game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6046108">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>You wander around these okay looking but ultimately bland and soulless environments looking for the next maze puzzle to complete. The maze puzzles get somewhat more complex as the game goes on and every now and then there&apos;s so extra trick to them like having to look at the environment and/or look at them from different perspectives but most are extremely simple and all boil down to tracing a line from point A to point B.
<br>
<br>Also the worst part about the praise this is getting from journos  isn&apos;t how it&apos;s being treated like it&apos;s good, it how it&apos;s being treated like it&apos;s art.
<br>
<br>Not worth $40, not worth spending time on unless you have absolutely nothing to do.

<br>
<br>The restaurant kids&apos; menu maze puzzles start out easy, quickly becoming more complex until you have to invest significant thought and time into every puzzle (the world quickly sprawls out into many different directions, so difficulty/obscurity bounces all over the place). You&apos;re never given much motivation to solve the puzzles outside the opportunity to unlock more areas with more pretentious, disconnected audio blurbs, and of course, more puzzles.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s aesthetics are lost on me. It&apos;s a minimalist, high-saturation rendition of random human junk (art) in a variety of environments, mostly forest. I&apos;m not willing to say it&apos;s an objectively bad game (and don&apos;t really like having to put a number on this one), but I personally didn&apos;t get anything out of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=7254617">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The puzzles in the game are basic line games. You draw lines in a maze like diagram where you have a start point and an end point. These open doors and routes around an island for you to explore.
<br>
<br>Sounds simple enough and it is for the most part but the game goes out of its way to make every iteration of these puzzles frustrating. Like the idea by itself wasn&apos;t versatile enough to give variety so they decided to break their own rules to make them more interesting.
<br>
<br>They failed. The puzzles were not more interesting they were simply frustrating. I LIKE puzzles but these don&apos;t feel even remotely rewarding or fun to work out. A lot of the time I was just putting lines in at random hoping to get a solution.
<br>
<br>The open world in this game is a bad idea as well. It wouldn&apos;t be so bad but there is NOTHING indicative of where you might need to go next.
<br>
<br>The problem is there are a variety of puzzle tiers. You can&apos;t unlock some puzzles until you&apos;ve been taught the basic premise of that puzzle. Unless you can work it out on the fly, which is usually impossible because of the way the puzzles are designed.
<br>
<br>This is made frustrating by the fact you find high tier puzzles as soon as you leave the first tutorial area. At first it was fine, I wandered off and started exploring and the path split into two routes. So I decided to take the right path. This then slit into another two paths, so I took the stairs leading into a castle like building. Got to the bottom of these and then ANOTHER split in the road.
<br>
<br>Before I knew it I was a LONG way from the starting area and totally and utterly lost with no doable puzzles in sight. They can give you a nudge in the right direction without it being hand holding. I don&apos;t want a map marker or GPS I just want some indication of which of the seven billion routes I should be taking!!!!!
<br>
<br>I just started getting frustrated by it. The convoluted island layout the BS puzzles where half of the board is invisible or smeared across a shadow. Then you also have the pretentious audio logs....
<br>
<br>In the end I didn&apos;t give a rats *** about this island or the people turned to statues around it. The ending would have to be AMAZING to get over the frustration of getting there.
<br>
<br>I decided to spoil the ending for myself. I&apos;m glad I skipped this game. I&apos;d have been annoyed as hell if I had trudged through to get that pretentious and pointless ending.
<br>
<br>Leaving a game in mystery is only good if the mystery is worth uncovering. In this case, the mystery isn&apos;t worth the time uncovering it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=7197977">Expand</a></span>

<br>If the question is &quot;should I buy this game&quot; then you have to ask yourself whether you feel its worth coughing the cash on a game that is essentially 600 maze puzzles, after all you can buy a mobile app game like LYNE for mere pennies. There was a moment for me in game when I was suddenly aware of what the detailed environment was all about, and if you are prepared to put in the time and brain power there will be a reward beyond the thrill of solving a puzzle.
<br>The truth is that in the final analysis, despite its spiritual philosophical themes, Witness is a singularly soulless experience. It&apos;s a lonely, still island, where nothing apart from yourself, water and machinery moves,birdsong is recorded and animals and people are mere statues, suspended in aspic. Your only purpose it seems is to keep solving puzzle after puzzle after puzzle in order to unlock more puzzles. A special kind of OCD hell.
<br>Hats off to you if you can complete this game without using a Walkthrough, and if you 100% it...Seriously dude get a life!
<br>Now, time for just one more puzzle before beddy time me thinks!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6112074">Expand</a></span>

We are not avid gamers, but we liked MYST and the sequels to it, so we decided to try it out. We were not disappointed. We cheated and looked up about 10 puzzle solutions on a walkthrough site. My rule was I would not spend more than about 1 or 2 hours on any puzzle.
<br>
<br>I give this game very high marks overall, but not a 10 because of a few defects as I perceive them.
<br>
<br>The first defect is that I could not use my gamepad controller in Windows 10. I had to use the keyboard arrows and mouse to navigate. This was a bit awkward at times and not so convenient.  I also could not get it to run on my main Win 10 desktop and Win 10 laptop. I submitted a problem ticket but have not got a reply. I did manage to find an older computer running Win 10 that could run it.
<br>
<br>The 3-D navigation can be head-spinning at  times and you can lose your way when things look very different from direction to direction. which leads to the next defect in that there is no &apos;map&apos;. I know the boat has a map, but I mean something that you can call up to show you where you are on the island. Ideally something that you could put notes on as well, like &apos;there is a weird door/monolith/figure here&quot;. Later you can check these off as you solve them.
<br>
<br>There is no &apos;save game&apos; feature which is really sad because you lose everything when you solve the main puzzle. It seems that the game is saved at some random intervals (I can load certain older games) but they are not under my control. After you solve it you will probably want to go into the various challenge rooms and special doorways. I loaded an older saved game and spent two days getting back to the inner mountain room just before the finale. I looked at the program files locations and could not figure out how the data was saved in order to make a copy and restore.
<br>
<br>I have complaints about some types of puzzles. The spectrum-based puzzles are very annoying. The sound-based puzzles also have annoying properties. These are sensory issues, not intellectual issues. I found myself having a serious head-ache sometimes. The spinning puzzles are malicious. I had to alter my video settings (brightness, etc.) to solve some puzzles with dark gray dots on a light black path.
<br>
<br>Then there is a type of puzzle that I really find annoying. Fortunately there are only a few of these. Some puzzles have multiple solutions (you think) but only one is correct from the author point-of-view. Since you have to read the author&apos;s mind to figure out what is going on, you are sometimes at the mercy of an arbitrary and capricious rule. As one example of this --- spoiler here --- I point out the hedge labyrinths. When I was solving this puzzle, I had just completed some of the mazes where you had to look around you for clues. I noticed that the hedges were completely identical except for a pattern of wooden outshoots at the very bottom. I manage to find a unique solution following that pattern, but it would not solve. Some puzzles give you feedback about what is wrong, but this one didn&apos;t. When I finally had to cheat I found that you had to listen to the sound of your footsteps for clues. This is a real bad deal because up til now the sound had never been an issue before and I had the sound turned down rather low so it wasn&apos;t in my attention.
<br>
<br>Now that I have completed the game, I looked at other sites and found lot of other interesting doors and puzzles I want to explore, but the lack of save game makes this a real problem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6109557">Expand</a></span>

Only flaw is a lack of actual story. This game is well on the level with Talos Principle and Portal, but the latter ones had a clear story, so they were more interesting in this sense.</span>

<br>
<br>I am a Myst fan, have read all the books, have played and recently replayed all the games, and this game was heavily advertised as a game inspired by Myst. Here are the similarities with Myst. Is in an island. That is it.
<br>
<br>Probably the best experience you get in Myst is that puzzles where really well though, and all of them were different. Different for me is that each puzzle you found didn&#x2019;t had the same buttons, the panel never operated the same way and sometimes you could even tell by solving the puzzles the teachings of the ages, and some of them were so well though that you learned how de D&#xB4;ni counted. Or the marble puzzle in Riven it was so well thought that it would be near impossible to solve in trial and error.
<br>
<br>The Witness on the other hand has the same panels and the puzzle to move a line inside different panels. No matter if you solve a puzzle you will eventually run into another panel that operates the same way it JUST need to be solved different. In other words the Witness has one puzzle, and 499 variations of the same puzzle. That is not a Myst game if something is Room Escape game.
<br>
<br>And a Room Escape Game at 40 usd is a joke. No one will buy it, and that is probably why so many negative reviews. I&#xB4;m sure that if the game didn&#xB4;t look as pretty there will be almost no positive reviews.
<br>So my advice if you are a fan of Myst games please do not consider this game anything like that, because you will be very disappointed. Think of it a Room Escape but instead of a door is panel.
<br>
<br>Also for a game the price the game has almost no options at all, that in the current era of gaming is unacceptable. So my advice is the game is worth buying later on when it hit 20 USD mark. And that is if there is nothing new worth buying or a good sale. I recommend you if you want and adventure exploration game, to buy Myst and Riven but can be bought for less than the Witness and both are awesome, if not Portal o Talos Principle are really good options going in the same puzzle just adding new variations. Or you can hold that money and wait for Obduction, which the creators are the same of the Myst series. Cyan and the game since it passed its kickstarter campaign will have VR support.
<br>
<br>Now for the developers if you&#x2019;ve been complaining so much about piracy in your product then don&#xB4;t abuse so much in the price, the gamers feel robbed but still want to play the game, might take another path. If you lower the price you will probably sell more, and people don&#xB4;t like it, they might save it to another day give it another go, not refunding it like me because for that money there&#x2019;s a lot out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6060085">Expand</a></span>

<br>No other game has left me feeling like an idiot one minute, and then a genius the next. I put it down several times, once for as long as a week, too mentally fatigued to continue. I even considered cheating or just quitting, but I just couldn&apos;t. It&apos;s too beautiful, and I&apos;m glad I stuck it out to the end.

<br>I&apos;d like to preface the review by saying that this game is not for everyone. If you&apos;re looking for excitement, you&apos;re not going to find much. If you know that you have a short attention span, or are easily bored by repetitive tasks, do not buy this game. If you can handle a little repetition, especially if there is some deep complexity within the repetitive act, then read on.

<br>The Witness is a puzzle game where you draw lines. The entire game revolves around the simple process of basically completing circuits. The puzzles become increasingly complex as time goes on, and often involve other parts of the world to solve. Their is a wide diversity of puzzles that encompass motion, light, sound, and other factors that keep things from ever feeling too similar. It&apos;s also just enjoyable to explore the island and look for hints or secrets than flesh out the game.
<br>
<br>Despite what others have said, if you do all the puzzles as you come across them, this game will teach you the required information, and will do so with as little intrusion to the game itself as possible. If you&apos;re getting the hang of things, you&apos;ll have many &quot;Aha!&quot; moments that are deeply rewarding.
<br>
<br>The art style is beautiful, resembling a sort of hand-painted, minimalist aesthetic. The island is vibrantly colored, and never feels dull or gray, except when its supposed to. The audio, while sparse, is also wonderful.
<br>
<br>The story is picked up primarily through scenery and little audio logs that are scattered across the island. It too is minimalist, but you start to get a sense of some underlying narrative as time goes on, even if its never fully revealed.
<br>
<br>The game often feels isolating, which is intentional, but can be uncomfortable if not deeply engaged in a puzzle. There is no musical score, and think that although it was omitted intentionally, it could have really added something to the experience. Though rare, there might come a point where you feel like you&apos;re missing some information when solving a particular puzzle. This is almost always the fault of the player, but sometimes it can feel like the games fault which is frustrating.
<br>
<br>There is also no way to keep track of your progress through the game, so if you need that organization be wary. I think it adds something to the experience, but keep a pen and paper handy if it makes you nervous.
<br>
<br>Again while this game is not action packed (even less so than Braid), the game itself is beautifully designed and implemented. I highly recommend to anyone with an appreciation for peaceful aesthetics and/or who enjoys puzzles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6042630">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Unlike the largely linear experience presented in most puzzle games, The Witness actually allows you to freely leave a puzzle in progress in order to go solve other ones around the island. You also don&#x2019;t even have to feel pressured to complete every single puzzle in the game in order to complete it, although I&#x2019;d imagine that should probably be your goal if at all possible. In terms of storytelling, this jumping around isn&#x2019;t prone to mess with much as the story is more of what you make it than really anything so established as a specific plot. Everything is all mysterious and nothing is ever quite fully confirmed, which definitely leaves things up to the player&#x2019;s imagination which I thoroughly appreciated. You&#x2019;re presented with the cold hard facts as they are- what will work and what won&#x2019;t, and that&#x2019;s simply that.
<br>
<br>Now, there is some loose basis of a slight hint of a plot to be found, and that is through select recordings scattered about the island in sometimes devious, sometimes easy-to-access areas. These won&#x2019;t do much to quell the questions, but they may sate some of your burning desire to get to the bottom of things, if only a little bit before the game&#x2019;s ending. None of this should really detract from the experience however as at its core, The Witness is a test of logic. There are frustrating moments, but nothing beats the thrill of successfully completing a puzzle or a series of puzzles and discovering something new about the world you&#x2019;ve been presented. Instead of questioning the purpose of things or asking the horrid &#x201C;why&#x201D; question, start exploring and figuring out how things work and what affects what. It&#x2019;s all almost brilliantly philosophical in some ways.
<br>
<br>Concept: Exploration and puzzle solving presented in a rich environment where no stone should be left unturned and no detail, however minimal ignored.
<br>
<br>Graphics: The art-style is uniquely rendered and attention to detail beautiful to behold. Some may consider it basic or simple, but then things don&#x2019;t need to be unnecessarily complicated to be gorgeous.
<br>
<br>Sound: There&#x2019;s more of an argument to be made for the ambiance than there is to be made for a soundtrack or voice work, but what there is of everything here is more than adequate and only adds to the sense that you&#x2019;re isolated and surrounded by mystery.
<br>
<br>Playability: Complicated puzzles can sometimes make games an exercise in frustration, but you should never be angered by difficulty even when you are stumped as the game is precise and easy to grasp once you get the hang of things.
<br>
<br>Entertainment: It&#x2019;s puzzle-solving at its finest or close enough thereto. Puzzle after puzzle will challenge how you think and what you know. Don&#x2019;t stop to question motive or intent, but soak up the rich scenery and equally rich gameplay elements.
<br>
<br>Replay Value: High.
<br>
<br>Overall Score: 9.0</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6207169">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game is a metroidvania open world puzzle game.
<br>
<br>You are on an island without any context for why you are there, it is a very cold open.
<br>You find a door with a panel on it displaying a maze, you trace a path through the obstacles to complete the maze.
<br>
<br>You do more of these, each puzzle providing a context that leads you to a better understanding of the puzzles around it.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s as if every panel is both a puzzle and a hint.
<br>
<br>You&apos;re probably thinking, &quot;why open world? Couldn&apos;t I just buy a book of puzzles?&quot; No, because the island that you are on is a puzzle in itself and, like the panels, the island puzzle is also a hint.
<br>
<br>I say it is a metroidvania game because you will inevitably find a door that you cannot open. It is not because you haven&apos;t acquired the proper weapon or tool, it is because you haven&apos;t acquired the proper knowledge to solve the puzzle blocking your path. The knowledge to solve those puzzles are elsewhere on the island.
<br>
<br>To dismiss this game as only a bunch of puzzles is to dismiss a song as just a bunch of sounds.
<br>
<br>I saw another metacritic call this &quot;the dark souls of puzzle games&quot; and it&apos;s definitely something I&apos;ve been thinking since Dark Souls was probably the last game I obsessed over as much as The Witness.

I am not at all surprised that (at the time of writing) 67 people didn&apos;t have the patience or brain functionality to understand the game. I am, however, surprised at how many people felt qualified to hop on Metacritic and formulate a representative and truthful review having fully admitted to only playing a few minutes of the game in said aforementioned review. This phenomenon is both mind blowing and discouraging. If you are on the fence on this one, I do hope reason guides your decision, and that you give the game the time of day. I mean, Blow blew like $6 Million and 7 years of his life on this thing... the guy that created Braid... it obviously doesn&apos;t suck. Just hang in there for half a minute and you&apos;ll enjoy this environment. It is quite literally the most beautiful place I have ever been.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6082333">Expand</a></span>

In this game your goal is
<br>to solve puzzles so if you love puzzles and challenges this is the game for you. Game graphically looks beautiful and it is based around exploration. I have seen some of the reviews here talking about no killing in the game at all and how that is bad but i think that is good for the game because it was focused on exploration and puzzles take The Talos Principle for example it was also like this game but it was set in a different time, of course it had different mechanics but the goal of these 2 games is the same. I am not a fan of walking around an area in the game and searching but i found walking around this beautiful island fun. Price is very high but you get hours of fun with that game. I would recommend it if you love puzzles otherwise you will get frustrated and rage quit the game. I enjoyed most of the puzzles and mazes but some were just too easy and some were too hard on which i lost 30 minute each. If you cant do without killing do not play this game. Good luck and have fun if you decide to play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6054583">Expand</a></span>

Some of them are interactive and &quot;advance&quot; the game, others just cause one to marvel at the cleverness and creativity of the developer.  Quite simply the best game I have played in years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6052981">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros:
<br>- Somehow makes maze puzzles enticing, teaching new elements seamlessly that feel like personal discoveries
<br>- Challenging but not brutal
<br>- Beautiful art
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- No musical score, this game is way different than Braid (featuring spoken word as opposed to written) and while there is the possibility that a score could subtract from the immersion/experience, I still missed it.
<br>Review:
<br>
<br>Let me just start by saying that this game should be rated M, there&apos;s no blood, no violence or nudity to speak of, but it is one of the most &quot;Mature&quot; games I have ever played.
<br>
<br>This game isn&apos;t for everyone, and isn&apos;t Braid.
<br>
<br>Braid was rightfully universally acclaimed by anyone with an I.Q. greater than 95, if you didn&apos;t like Braid, you were in the company of a very high &quot;Soulja Boy&quot; in that &quot;The game aint got no point&quot;
<br>
<br>The Witness however is a little more assailable, most of what both its critics and supporters say is true, On the one hand its immersive, thoughtful, and designed extremely meticulously (hence 8 years dev time); on the other, roughly 80% of the puzzles in this game could be placed onto a mobile app.
<br>
<br>I found myself wondering whether the &quot;plot&quot; elements were absolutely genius, or the incoherent ramblings of a madman... I settled on both.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6064687">Expand</a></span>

<br>No... seriously. I just had one of those moments, bursting out in loud laughter from pure joy while playing this game, figuring out and finding something I could do that I previously had no idea was even possible, that I didn&apos;t even think should be possible, but yet it all still makes some kind of weird sense. It was freaking amazing. To tell you anything more about it would be to give too much away.
<br>
<br>This game is beautiful, intriguing , and compelling, weird, abstract, and logical. It makes you think outside of the box, sometimes literally, but in a way which still makes sense once you change your perspective.
<br>
<br>This game is NOT just about mazes on a panel, though there is a lot of that and it is a main game mechanic. It&apos;s about what you do with them and how you learn from them to interact with and better understand your environment, your world that has been masterfully and meticulously crafted for your enjoyment.
<br>
<br>If you like challenging, involved, and sometimes frustrating puzzles that occasionally blow your mind (no pun intended), you have to get this game, and shame on you if you don&apos;t.
<br>
<br>That being said, I have to somewhat begrudgingly acknowledge that this game isn&apos;t for everyone. Some may even hate it, perhaps even for some of the same reasons I love it. This seems destined to be one of those games that many either love or hate. I&apos;d say that it&apos;s a safe bet that you&apos;ll at least be quite fond of it if you&apos;re into logical, challenging puzzle games.
<br>
<br>Well worth the full asking price and then some, in my opinion.
<br>
<br>Enjoy.
<br>
<br>...
<br>
<br>9/10
<br>
<br>Minus one for the current lack of some menu settings and extensive graphics options that should be including in a PC release, though the game is quite functional as is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6067454">Expand</a></span>

<br>But as I struggled to figure them I started to appreciate them. Moreover, the puzzles get better as you go farther, and more and more involve noticing clues in the 3-d world, which is beautiful. Many of the later puzzles are really good - almost on the level of Portal. In my opinion, its too bad that towards the very end they mixed in puzzles that seem almost intentionally cruel, but I suppose finishing them gives you more satisfactions. The game has a really satisfying way of showing you your progress too, as you make your way across the beautiful island.
<br>
<br>Just buy this game and make yourself play at least half it. I think you&apos;ll start to enjoy the challenge. I  felt more and more compelled to finish it, and actually got addicted to it, despite the fact that the puzzles seem tedious at first.
<br>
<br>I also recommend ignoring the story, which is very easy to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6193437">Expand</a></span>

The Witness is NOT a collection of maze puzzles thrown into a pretty 3D world; both puzzles and the world are masterfully intertwined (wish I could tell you more, but it would spoil all the fun), and will often lead you to gasp at the designer&apos;s cleverness, as well as your own. There was obvious care to avoid increasing difficulty by throwing laborious behemoths at the player; instead, the more difficult puzzles are often the ones that require the most lateral thinking. Most puzzles are actually quite small and could be solved in your head, if you wanted to (it would just take longer to solve them).
<br>
<br>The Witness takes a &quot;show, don&apos;t tell&quot; approach to story-telling. In a way, the story is in itself a puzzle, and this won&apos;t sit well with gamers who need a dangling carrot to drive them forward. This is the source of much criticism, but I think the real culprit is that the truly mind-blowing puzzles take a while to arrive as the puzzles work with a rather large set of rules which must be learned slowly and progressively. This means that the starting areas are a little dull. Also, new rules are very often introduced (never explained; you must deduce them) in consecutive panels of increasing complexity, in a specific part of the island (the island is split into several areas, each with their own theme). If you miss these panels and come across a more complex panel which makes use of these rules, it will be impossible to solve. Usually you can tell when this happens: if the panel has symbols you have not seen before, and it&apos;s not very simple, you probably missed the &apos;tutorial&apos; panels. It doesn&apos;t help that an area with a lot of advanced puzzles is fairly close to the start. This is probably the source of the &quot;it&apos;s too hard!&quot; complaints. I think anyone of average intelligence is capable of beating The Witness comfortably, but you need to be a specific type of gamer to truly enjoy it (inquisitive nature, easily immersed, enjoys a fair challenge).
<br>
<br>I would rate the game a perfect score, but there are a few technical issues I have a problem with: non-rebindable keys (sorry, lefties), very limited graphical options, and stutter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6106094">Expand</a></span>

Game is a bit challenging cause it doesn&apos;t tell you what to do, you should figure out everything by yourself but once you realized what your goal is and how this whole &quot;world&quot; works, game starts to become pretty friendly. There are several sections and in each of them game introduces you to different kind of puzzles. In rare case the challenge itself is to figure out how the puzzle works and after that it is just a matter of time for section to be completed. Cause the puzzles of hardest difficulty take 10-15 mins to complete at worst.  My the only complain: sometimes you will find audiorecords which are supposed to tie all game elements together: to give you an insight into the &quot;world&quot; and its visual and your purpose in this world, but that works poorly (Talos Principle did a better job with this). Hence, gameplay feels like an arcade puzzle game or an IQ-test. It&apos;s not too bad though, cause puzzles most of the time are good and very fair but in order for The Witness to be a masterpiece those elements should&apos;ve been tied a lot harder.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6132732">Expand</a></span>

The puzzles are a guessing game with overly cyptic logic and attempting to learn them involves more luck than brain. The open world implementation is daunting and creates the constant feeling that you might have missed something. Often times there is no reward for solving a section of puzzles or unlocking an area. Things just feel meaningless and there is little motivation to drive you. Graphics are not impressive, with stationary clouds and the same shade of blue making up the entire sky. The cartoonish art style is not original and is no acheivement. Interaction with the world is punishingly minimal. Settings menu is much the same. Without the option to change camera sensitivity you are stuck with what you got, and it isn&apos;t fast. This game is pretty much just several hours of wishing you were playing the talos principle instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6081707">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>&quot;The game is just maze puzzles.&quot; Yes, OR maze puzzles are simply the language we use to interact with the game environment and teach us some of what the game has to say for itself.
<br>
<br>&quot;The game has no story.&quot; The game has tons of story content, way more than almost any other game I can think of. It does not, however, present the story as a coherent narrative. Other art forms have explored disjointed narrative for decades but in video games players expect a simple story that goes from A to B. You don&apos;t get that here, but to say there is no story is absurd.
<br>
<br>&quot;The island is beautiful but superficial.&quot; No, the island is integral to the game. Every inch has been carefully designed in a way that is mind-blowing as you gradually unravel its secrets. You can tell the attention to detail and just the sheer quality of design here if you are prepared to invest some effort in actually looking closely (or very widely) at things. No other game comes close to this level of design imho.
<br>
<br>&quot;The game is not about anything, you could play the puzzles on a mobile.&quot; The game is &apos;about&apos; many things. The Buddhist idea of contemplation and patience. The way in which human knowledge advances. The distinctions or otherwise between art and science, the macro and the molecular. The spirit of adventure and exploration. And perhaps most significantly, the idea that perspective can change meaning. But the game&apos;s true genius is that it embodies many of these ideas rather than just talking about them. The more you think about it the more you understand what an achievement this game is, doing something with the medium that no other computer game has ever attempted to this degree. If you are close-minded and too wedded to your own expectations about what a computer game &quot;should&quot; be then you will not appreciate this game. If you think that there should be a tutorial, or you are annoyed that you cannot &apos;progress&apos; as fast as you want to, or you think it&apos;s just boring maze puzzles then you really, really haven&apos;t &quot;got it.&quot; Yeah, I hear you saying that it&apos;s pretentious and that there&apos;s nothing to &quot;get.&quot; But you are wrong. So wrong. From a different perspective, however, you are completely correct.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6062343">Expand</a></span>

Here the environment is the puzzle, the panel is where you put your answer. Explaining any further would spoil them.
<br>
<br>There are also puzzles that don&apos;t use the environment, teaching you many of the rules of this game that will be used and built upon in the future. It won&apos;t tell you how to do them though, this game is as much about learning the puzzle as it is about solving the puzzle. But the answers are there. It can be a very hard game when it wants to, but it&apos;s never unfair. If you&apos;re stuck, the open world is great to look around and solve other puzzles.
<br>
<br>And the art direction is just incredible, sometimes I&apos;ll just stare at how pretty everything is. You&apos;ll quickly notice the amount of detail put into it and how much thought was put into where and how everything was placed. I mean, look at this small blog post:
<br>
<br>http://the-witness.net/news/2015/06/polishing-the-architecture/
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t expect much story, though you can piece some together. This game is pure puzzle. No hand holding and no &quot;Good jobs.&quot; A game about observation, epiphany and logic that wants you to learn instead of being told. If you like puzzles, especially difficult ones, play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6086180">Expand</a></span>

We enjoyed solving the puzzles and looking for &quot;fooshes&quot; (environmental puzzles), and I kept wondering if we were going to help bring all the petrified people back to life at the end. The level of detail and the hidden puzzles, the different cues and ways to solve puzzles were fascinating. So far so good.
<br>
<br>We just finished and went through two endings (don&apos;t know or care if there are more) and I feel deflated, no, stomped on. All the anticipation and build-up only to find out I was a party to some pretentious mental masturbation. There is no payoff, no resolution at the end, only a flying tour of the island and, later, of Mr. Blow&apos;s house. Who the eff cares? I gave it two points because solving the puzzles made me feel like I was on to something and because the art was pretty.
<br>
<br>The game became monotonous and I kept on going because I thought I was going to discover a big secret and after all, I had spent $40. Can I get my money back?
<br>
<br>The game lacked a story or a goal, there was no interaction with anyone, none of the little recordings really had a point nor were relevant, and I was quite disturbed to see Mr. Blow coming out of a (drug induced?) coma, still hooked up to his Foley. He can stay a god in his little imaginary world, and I will retreat to mine.
<br>
<br>This game sucks, bites, and blows. Pun intended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6131881">Expand</a></span>

This game is not made to be rushed through in 2 days, or a week, you just take your time and enjoy the admiring work went into making these beatiful puzzles. I also think it would make a great game to play with your friends, everyone putting some input and solving puzzles together sounds like it would be fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6047426">Expand</a></span>

The real challenge in The Witness for the most part is figuring out what the rules of the puzzles are, which after figuring out, usually become a breeze to solve. It does become mildly/moderately challenging towards the end, but by then the game is pretty much over. The hardest puzzles are the bonus ones which seemingly have no satisfying affect on the world, which is disappointing when you&apos;re used to receiving acknowledgment for your work.
<br>
<br>Overall, I have mixed feelings about this game. The art was nice and seems to be a bigger part of this game than its puzzles, but the puzzles weren&apos;t much fun to play through due to lack of challenge &amp; reward (it would&apos;ve been nice if the puzzles revealed something artistic upon completion). I felt like I had to complete all the puzzles to see if I was missing a secret ending, but nothing grand happens as far as the community knows, only dull subtleties.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6066326">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I really hate this game because famous quotes/clips don&apos;t make something &quot;smart&quot;.  It&apos;s just an easy shortcut to sounding smart, so that you don&apos;t actually have to do anything smart yourself.  Like coming up with an original game idea, instead of just attempting to crudely copy a known success like Myst.
<br>
<br>Save your $40 for 40 sudoku books, because that&apos;s all this game is.
<br>
<br>0/10 for all of the 10/10s saying this game is clever.  Also, the ending is god awful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6235787">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is going to appeal to a very specific type of player, it&apos;s a game for puzzle lovers who have no problem finding their own motivation or incentive to move through the game world. So if puzzles alone are enough motivation for you to keep playing and solving them by all means give it a try.
<br>
<br>But the puzzles themselves are not perfect either though since they feel very disconnected to the game world. If you compare to Myst or Riven there were very different types of puzzles in those games which you had to solve in varying ways. But here in The Witness it&apos;s all different variations of the same &quot;on the screen line puzzle&quot;, it honestly gets pretty repetitive after a while.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m sure some puzzle lovers will like this game, but I keep wondering how much better the game had been had there been a story in there for us as well. And background music, a little background music would have gone a long way.
<br>
<br>Overall this game feels half baked, gorgeous graphics, some nice and clever puzzles...  but where is the story, the connection between the puzzles and the game world, the puzzle variation and music? What The Witness does it does really well, but overall it just feels lacking and shy of modern standards.
<br>
<br>Overall I think The Talos Principle is a much better puzzle game with an inspiring mix of puzzles AND story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6052061">Expand</a></span>

The graphics look low budget and kids-targeted with all the bright colors. Stones and everything are just plain polygons. The puzzles get boring after about 20 minutes of playing. You connect 2 dots in a maze. And then some more, dozens and dozens of times. New features appear in the puzzles, but too slowly to keep one&apos;s interest. Running is too slow, you can&apos;t jump or jump off walls. No story, no purpose, no music. I can&apos;t believe this game is from the dev of Braid... Asking $40 for this is insane. It feels like a book with math puzzles - why even use a computer for such stuff? A book or a newspaper page is a better format. Wait for a sale until the price drops to $3 or $2, then it&apos;s probably worth buying. But most likely you will just refund it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6055102">Expand</a></span>

The world is beautiful and fairly big - it lets you choose which order you complete the puzzles in - but other than that it feels lifeless and very uninteresting to walk around despite the large disparities between areas. Some of the mechanics are excellent, and others downright awful. One section has you using environmental cues to think outside of the maze format that every puzzle takes on. Another makes you draw around tetris blocks and segregate black blocks from whites, whilst controlling an invisible line that mimics your moves backwards. Others use environmental cues where parts are just broken off or hidden somewhere, and without giving into a guide and not feeling the satisfaction of completing the puzzle for yourself, it feels as if Blow wants you to know exactly what he was thinking when he made the puzzle. Most other puzzle games have at least an interesting plot development or a nice OST to go with them, but this one just feels like an empty unfinished island that someone has gone to the trouble of littering with recordings of random philosophy. Hell, maybe it&apos;s all a part of making the player feel intellectual as they complete the hundreds of IOS mazes. The price is absolutely not worth the game itself and I&apos;d advise anyone thinking of buying the game to wait for a heavy discount first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6077590">Expand</a></span>

<br>Dang! the Talos principle was annoying after a while with the frustrating puzzles and the lecturing phylosophyical rubish. What about so nerdy puzzles that you need a qr scanner to solve one of them?(you know whr&apos;s that in first place? I didn&apos;t)
<br>NEEEERDS!!!!
<br>The whatever religion parody crap:I&apos;m your god, good to you to know,behave worm, know this,bla,blah,blah,the moonlanding hoax promoted in the ridiculous cryptic impossible puzzle, etc. makes it the most obnoxious absurd puzzle game ever made.
<br>Now the witness (jeohva&apos;s witness? whatever religion propaganda crap) returns for more of the same,witth less interesting puzzles,less variety, puzzles with little dots,less visuals,same crap difficulty and same: I know more than you stupid sinner attitud.******!!!!
<br>What&apos;s most incredible is the overhype over it.This game is not worthy of your time and money unless you are a very religious person like nerdy puzzles and believe these biggots with all their selfish I know all  attitude and discourse.Shut up!

That&apos;s 10 dollars an hour that&apos;s insane. for 40 bucks you might as well save that money and buy battlefleet gothic or GTA. this game is horridly overpriced and the creator is a whiny asshat who is a ginormous snob. Half of these 10/10 reviews are just making a Last Name Pun to Johnathon Blow, people literally have no taste in anything these days and will do anything for the least bit of attention from devs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6049948">Expand</a></span>

The WItness is, overall, a disappointment; it was much too expensive at &#xA3;30 at launch, and does not provide enough for the price tag. The puzzles, whilst fun for a while, become very boring and repetitive, and the fact that there is essentially no story throughout the game makes continuing seem pointless.

<br>+ Hands down one of the most beautiful games or even simply 3D visual experiences ever created.
<br>+ Insane attention to detail in integrating unique puzzle mechanics into the environmental design.
<br>+ Overall strong puzzle design, teaching the player over time in unique ways -- as many have said, it is a game about &quot;learning,&quot; and it works successfully to achieve that description.
<br>? A fair amount of the puzzles are going to be rough, everyone finds difficulty in different places depending on how they think about things, but some of the puzzles are simply tedious.
<br>? The &quot;story&quot; of the world is controversially delivered in a manner that some would describe as &quot;pretentious&quot; -- the quotes and other bits are absolutely related to the content of the game regardless of anyone&apos;s opinions on it, but some of it can certainly be argued to come across stilted.
<br>- Purposefully avoids &quot;progression&quot; or &quot;reward&quot; mechanics due to a philosophical point the game is trying to make, but no matter how smart the delivery is, that doesn&apos;t change the fact that the user experience starts to feel stale by the end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=6959568">Expand</a></span>

The way the scenery of island is included into the puzzles is also amazing. The variability of &quot;one puzzle type&quot; was mind blowing. One point down for not strong (or not understood) story. Great job!</span>

<br>Look, it&apos;s just a glorified smartphone time-waster. There is exactly 1 game mechanic: line puzzles. That&apos;s it, hundreds and hundreds of line puzzles. Complete one set, and it opens the way to the next set. Complete those, and a passageway opens up to a roomful of more... you guessed it! line puzzles!
<br>
<br>The creators apparently didn&apos;t comprehend that giving us a reasonably pretty environment to explore (which is nice, but not particularly noteworthy by modern game standards) only helps a game when the environment is full of things to do and find. But here there is only one thing to do and find: LINE PUZZLES. They work overtime to add a little variety to how you solve these puzzles, but that doesn&apos;t change the fact that you will be sick of the damn line puzzles before you&apos;re 30% done, with hundreds of them still to go. Meanwhile there is no plot, no characters, nothing surprising or interesting or unexpected.
<br>
<br>However, if you cannot get enough #$^&amp;@#*$ line puzzles, this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=7731599">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>However, the game has a serious flaw which completely ruined it for me. There are no tutorials for the puzzles. You encounter multiple colored dots on a grid and you have no idea what to do with it. You come across many new puzzles (mid-game) for which there is no basic tutorials or intros and you need to figure out what to do with them.
<br>
<br>For example there is a puzzle where you need to figure out a particular tree branch nearby and look  through that at the grid. The leaves overlap the grid squares and that is part of the puzzle. Thaat&apos;s a really obtuse solution!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-witness/user-reviews?user_review_id=7034414">Expand</a></span>

My biggest gripe is how arbitrary the rules of the puzzles are. You need to find the rules through a lot of trial and error, and even then it&apos;s not perfect.
