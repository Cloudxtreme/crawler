While the single player campaign is certainly enjoyable, the light saber battles in multi-player are what really sets this game apart from the rest. Include a generous assortment of force powers to the mix and this is one incredibly entertaining classic. You can&apos;t call yourself a Star Wars fan if you don&apos;t own this.</span>

If you played Jedi Academy.. meh, not so sure you will like it. In my opinion, It&apos;s a game that achieves in every way excepted. The fights never get old. The thrills some cutscene can bring matches with Dark Forces 2 and the films. Level design and puzzles are milestones.</span>

The story is very good, I can&apos;t really say much before spoiling anything though. The graphics are good for its time and the voice acting is great as well as some characters from the movies such as Lando which is awesome! If all that stuff is great then why did you only give it a 6 out of 10 you ask? Because it&apos;s repetitive and the puzzles are frustrating and the gun play isn&apos;t the best I&apos;ve seen and the level design is bad and Kyle looks ugly. The first few levels is just guns and shooting Stormtroopers which I thought was pretty fun at first. Then after only a little while you get a lightsaber. But just because you finally get the epic lightsaber which is a blast to use it doesn&apos;t mean the game gets much better. The game makes you rage in so much ways but mostly because of the horrible puzzles which really lets the game down. The puzzles on its own takes 3 points away from me giving the game 9/10. The game has its fun moments from time to time as well as funny moments but most of it isn&apos;t very fun. Then the Multiplayer isn&apos;t amazing which took away 1 point. The Multiplayer is good but I find it to get boring after about two matches. There isn&apos;t much lightsaber customization or force power customization nor is there much game modes. You get to pick the classic Team Free For All and normal FFA as well as CTF and Duel mode. Duel mode is great, CTF isn&apos;t as fun as Duel Mode but is still fun but FFA and Team FFA get boring very quickly. You get to pick any character you want in Multiplayer which is cool and there is a lot of maps to play on but not all work very well when playing with bots. Often on maps with huge endless pits to fall down into the bots just walk off the edge. The bots are pretty smart though and are as much fun as playing with real people, unfortunately not much people play this game online any more. This game can be good at times but it has a lot of down falls that take away from me giving the game a perfect 10. I suggest  getting Jedi Academy which is the game after this one because I think it is MUCH better especially on Multiplayer but I think Single-Player is much better too. I give Jedi Outcast 6/10-OK.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast/user-reviews?user_review_id=2868651">Expand</a></span>

The technical side is ok, apart from the physics, which are irritating when it comes to the thermal detonators (seldom can you see such an unrealistic bounce, even in games using the same engine). Graphically, the game is very decent, taking into account when it was made, but one has to admit that the quake 3 engine has ages very gracefully. Having written that the game is one of the most frustrating ones I&apos;ve played in a long while. You start out with about 4 hours of boring, repetitive missions, puzzles which are often irritating due to their difficulty. The level design also leaves a bit to be desired, though its not very bad. The weapons are very nice, though the aiming system is less than acceptable (at least for me). On the whole, I tried to give this game a chance to grow on me, but it did not succeed. I actually enjoy Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight, with its dated engine, poor graphics, etc _much_ more than this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast/user-reviews?user_review_id=1373458">Expand</a></span>

Match repetitive and sloppy gunplay with constant hunt-for-the-button quests and you have a game so dull you never get to the &quot;good&quot; parts you hear about from your friends.</span>

The Single Player levels has a striking resemblance to Dark Forces 2 in terms of design, length and difficulty.
<br>
<br>Simply one of the best games released to PC.</span>

Such as:
<br>* The map designs are awful and you occasionally get stuck wandering about trying to find your way only to realize that you were suppose to go in a direction that doesnt make any sense at all (appearently i wasnt suppose to walk out on the lenghty bridge that looks like its leading on the right direction, instead you have to jump out of a window in a dark corner).
<br>* Enemy snipers are ridiculously accurate and fast on the trigger even on normal difficulty.
<br>* Scripted ambushes, get used to them.
<br>* Hitting enemies with laser pistols and rifles can be a tedious business. Trying to hit constantly strafing foes with laser lights that travel at the speed of small rodents gets old pretty quickly. Instead I just run in a straight line towards them holding down the fire button. Doesnt sound like an intresting gun fight at all now does it.
<br>* Grenade throwers, they are everywhere. Strangely enough often in tiny rooms.
<br>* Did i hit with my light saber or not? Maybe, who knows. The light saber fights are often just a shiny mess.
<br>
<br>So there are alot of frustrating issues with the game, but for some reason i keep getting back to it. I turn it off with a sigh but i still start it a few hours again later. So there is obviously some appeal in it, i dont know what it is though =P.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3150863">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is a guideline for how to properly review games. Many reviewers like to get a &#x201C;feel&#x201D; for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score.
<br>
<br>The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no &#x201C;half&#x201D; or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal.
<br>
<br>The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing.
<br>
<br>Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, if a game has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a &#x201C;feature quota&#x201D;. Games that excel in both areas of a section don&#x2019;t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section
<br>
<br>The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the &#x201C;wildcard&#x201D; section. This section is for how the reviewer &#x201C;feels&#x201D; about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3797456">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m sure that when it came out in 2002 that it was solid and lots of fun. These days, the mechanics are pretty aged. I didn&apos;t like the way that the crosshairs on the guns would shift based on where they thought I wanted to shoot. The lightsaber mechanics are miles ahead of where they were in Jedi Knight, but I was a bit intimidated by the complexity of the moves. I couldn&apos;t quite figure out how to get my lightsaber to swing the way I wanted it to. I also found the storyline to be very straight forward and not too interesting. The character animations and voice acting were pretty bad by modern standards as well.
<br>
<br>I found the levels to be a little too nitpicky, similar to Jedi Knight. Too often, you find yourself backtracking and trying to find switches that you overlooked. When the action gets going in a straightforward manner, the game is at its best. When you&apos;re annoyed because you don&apos;t know what the game wants you to do is when the game struggles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast/user-reviews?user_review_id=5220521">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s really important to have 1.02 because they cut the whole gameplay mechanics down in the patches. JK2 steam is patched to 1.04. So you have to downgrade it if you want to have full use of weapons such as blasters, lightsabers and of course force powers!
<br>v1.02 Gameplay: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eehKizfl0UM
<br>v1.04 Gameplay: http://youtu.be/PxcIa0UbB6Q
<br>
<br>Downgrade the game: http://www.file-upload.net/download-7546837/JK2VersionSwitcher.rar.html
<br>How to: unpackage it in the gamedata folder of JK2, start the JK2vs.exe to change the version to 1.02.
<br>If you got any questions, feel free to visit: http://jk2ffa.freeforums.org
<br>
<br>List why 1.03/1.04 patches ruined the game:
<br>Too high kicks, 2 times pressing of space for kicking (no combos anymore)
<br>When you are down you immediately jump up again and about 10 meters high. (no &quot;kick down and dfa move&quot; anymore)
<br>Highest saber damage you can do: 20 hp  Kick damage: 4hp
<br>No doubles, triples anymore with special attacks
<br>Force powers are useless at all
<br>You can&apos;t aim with special attacks  they made them stucked.
<br>You can kill only by saberthrow+kick spam or forward walking and red swing spam.
<br>Pull Kick yoyo or pull kick at all won&apos;t work anymore.
<br>Grip is useless, you can&apos;t move the contrahent by it.
<br>No doom throws with grip from long distances anymore.
<br>Movement is from SP  feels like in a pudding sauce.
<br>No straight strafe jumping anymore  no flying with adbs through several opponents
<br>On many servers swearing is censored and you can&apos;t kill people who pressed esc or are typing.
<br>If someone is shilding all the time, you won&apos;t be able to kill him  maximal dmg attack:  20hp.
<br>No uppercut flying anymore
<br>No yellow/blue fast-paced swings with overlapped hits (you know when he cancels one swing to do the other the same time which leads to multi hits)
<br>Invisible absorb until someone uses pull/push/drain/lightning/grip
<br>No saberfreeze as a tactic, no saberbug-attack in grip as a counter attack.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast/user-reviews?user_review_id=3143769">Expand</a></span>

Every music cue, sound effect, texture, object and character feel like they were pulled directly out of the film. The levels are sprawling, beautiful and immersive, making you feel like you are truly running around one of the sets from the movies. But what makes this game truly extraordinary is the gameplay. Never before and never since has there been a more elegant, nuanced and satisfying lightsaber mechanic in a Star Wars game. The force power system is also vastly improved here and the thrill of tossing around stormtroopers like rag dolls with the flick of a mouse never grows old. A truly epic adventure that I have installed on every computer I&apos;ve owned since it was released.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast/user-reviews?user_review_id=4667347">Expand</a></span>

The combat is fast, complex, challenging, and fun. The light saber mechanics can be a little wonky at first, but it just takes a little getting used to. The level design is intricate and expansive, but sometimes can make you feel lost as the path forward is not always obvious. This game does not hold your hand and can be very difficult, especially if you choose to simply rush into everything. It&apos;s best to save often, as the level designers love to leave sneaky tricks such as trip bombs, rooms full of snipers or grenadiers, and first timer traps. What, did you think being a Jedi mercenary was going to be easy? Boss fights can be a real bear, as the the main villain and his number two will fling your bantha-herding butt around like a rag doll if you let them. I highly recommend using the dismemberment cheat (it&apos;s not really a cheat so much as a hidden setting, as it affects you as well). This will make the saber combat much more fulfilling when you win a fight, as well as sobering when you lose one (there&apos;s been many a time that some sith sent my head bouncing down a flight of stairs because I grew overconfident). I also recommend keeping a dedicated save file for the level with the huge hangar, as with the appropriate cheats you can spawn hordes of enemy sith for a massive saber battle (Be aware that spawning too many can cause the game to crash, but that&apos;s usually more than 50). Want to see Luke fight Desann? Spawn some with cheats and pop some popcorn! Be prepared to sweep up Luke&apos;s chopped up bits, though, because he&apos;s a bit of a weenie. Anyway, this game will leave you with great memories if you can forgive its little flaws and aging graphics. Despite its problems, I give this game a 10/10 because I still feel compelled to play it, even though its been 13 years since its release. You will probably never find a game that will make you feel more like a real Jedi than Jedi Outcast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast/user-reviews?user_review_id=5546968">Expand</a></span>

The</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Being a person that loves lists, and especially making my own, I could not resist but make a JK&apos;s (my initials are fitting) Top 10 PC Games of All Time list. On this list, at number 2 sat: JK II: Jedi Outcast. Why you ask? The answer is simple and straightforward; obscure and even malicious to an extent.
<br>Shi**in bricks while playing this game might be called an understatement.
<br>
<br>The graphics, animation, sound and music, all flamboyant material. A top notch grade. That doesn&apos;t make a game go on the top 10 list however. We would have hundreds upon hundreds of top games if that were the case. Here comes the kicker: Its the gameplay.
<br>
<br>When I tried the Force Unleashed; a spasm ran through my body, intensifying to a strong belch; it was nigh impossible to contain the gushing flow of half digested bodily fluids about to break free from my belly. At last I contained it. Why did I experience this spasm? Due to simple mechanics: a click of the button made my character make a somersault and  slash the enemy straight in the face. *vomit now loading*
<br>
<br>Not here; in JK: you are the sword (or the saber rather). Every move Kyle executes is based on your input. You can of course click as if you are playing Cookie Clicker, but it would only amount to your immediate death. You had to learn the saber, and learn to fight like a Jedi.
<br>Rant ended.
<br>
<br>To this day I vividly remember: the family all moved to the living room to watch some movie, I was in the room with the monitor, smashing it hard. For 3 hours I was in sweet oblivion, fighting Tavion! What a fight that was! Till this day, one of the strongest gaming experiences in my life. For that fight alone, and for those sweet, unforgettable 3 hours this game get&apos;s a 10 and a ticket to the Hall of Fame.
<br>May the Force flow through you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast/user-reviews?user_review_id=6529082">Expand</a></span>
