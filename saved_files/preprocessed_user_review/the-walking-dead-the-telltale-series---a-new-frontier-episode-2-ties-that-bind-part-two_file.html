They launched with 2 episodes this season.
<br>
<br>I was hoping to see my dear Clementine again after all that time but they made me control this new Javier character, who is kinda a clone of Luke from the previous season.  Even after about 4 hours, my emotional care level for this Javier guy was only on par with maybe 1 of the 5 main characters from the 400 Days side stories (in 400 Days, you only play for about 30mins or so with each of the 5 characters).
<br>I think I understand the Telltale&apos;s decision in making the player to take control of a new character so that I can see how the harsh years have changed Clementine.  Players are unable to control her actions directly.  But occasionally, the game allows the player to take control of Clementine again in her flashbacks...  During my game, the narration and controls got confusing for me.  There was a Clementine flashback immediately followed by a conversation between Clementine and Javier, I was not sure who I was controlling at that time.
<br>
<br>In multiple moments, the actions/dialogues which I wanted to choose were not available.  There was a lot less exploration and the story felt very linear.  The quick time events felt a bit tagged on this time around.   Hard to explain some of the characters&apos; actions too.  I also got a bunch of unexpected reactions from some of the characters with my decisions...  Maybe because I was dealing with rebellious teenagers or maybe caused by multiple rewrites?
<br>
<br>It was cool to see some known face showing up but then I realized that it was probably a poor choice...  I already knew that character,  so he was immediately put on my trusty ally list, which was so not Walking Dead and it was tampering with my decision making!
<br>
<br>Overall disappointed by the 2-episode launch of the season.  Without the big twist at the end of episode 2, I would have given this game a lower score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier-episode-2-ties-that-bind-part-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=6918838">Expand</a></span>

Maybe telltale should release a game completely for once instead of zerging every review site with episodes that are shorter than a tv show. Anyways this episode is worse than the first one at least the first episode had a shock factor in it.</span>

<br>
<br>If you have any respect for Clementine or Lee, don&apos;t buy this game. It destroys everything from the past 2 seasons.
<br>
<br>This is an insult and a betrayal to all fans.</span>

Remember playing both seasons in 2014 just after TWAU and it was rather underwhelming. TWD always uses zombies (also thugs and people&apos;s mental breakdowns) as a convenient plot device to stir the **** up every once in a while and propel the story forward. Other than that there is not much going on hence the characters are usually in a state of grieving, arguing or fighting. Also when someone dies the game often tries to blame you but that doesn&apos;t seem so effective with such a lack of player&apos;s agency (at least now, when everybody figured out how Telltale operates). So the story has its issues though for a game it&apos;s pretty acceptable. The actual gameplay is insultingly easy and joyless, just like in any other TT game, and I wish they got rid of it entirely. Doubt anybody would miss it.
<br>All those problems are still there in the new season but now the game at least looks a lot more pleasant and is more polished overall. The voice acting is solid, art style is lovely, those laughable wooden animations are gone. As a result, the characters are more appealing and easier to sympathize with.
<br>P.S.: I can&apos;t buy the fact that the main character and his family were able to survive for at least 4 years on their own without bumping into someone and joining a larger group. I think they were even driving the same van.
<br>PPS: the conflict with New Frontier that caused lots of casualties and destruction of the whole settlement started because we ate their pudding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier-episode-2-ties-that-bind-part-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=6892734">Expand</a></span>

While the story may be a bit thrilling especially in the ending, this season so far feels way too rushed, as what episode two shows, letting players stumble upon rather ridiculous choices and non-immersive flow of story.</span>

<br>Rest in bloody peace: a series which once used to be great.
<br>
<br>Short 60 minute episodes (and the awful story makes it even worse), Clementine is playable for 5 minutes per ep, false advertisting pre-release, this is Javier&apos;s story for whatever **** reason even though we never asked for this and just wanted a GOOD continuation of Clementine&apos;s story (but this is an ABYSMAL continuation - this shouldn&apos;t even be called S3), The story is awful, and Clem is just a side character shoe-horned in when she was pretty much the main character for the previous two seasons. This isn&apos;t Clem&apos;s story, this is Javier&apos;s story - so this shouldn&apos;t even have Clem in it if Telltale wants to tell Javier&apos;s story so badly because she&apos;s just shoe-horned in and a side character. All the false advertising pre-release doesn&apos;t help either. Her being in every bloody advertisement also doesn&apos;t help. We played as Clementine in Season 2 and shaped our Clementine, and now Clementine is a supporting character again plus her personality doesn&apos;t change at all depending on your choices last season. Easy choices and deaths don&apos;t affect you because there is not enough character development and the game just pushes you forwards without any chance to talk to characters like in Season 1 (and even S2). This review would be too long if I talked about every issue, but SOME of the main issues are up there. SOME of the main issues. S2 choices don&apos;t **** matter for ****</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series---a-new-frontier-episode-2-ties-that-bind-part-two/user-reviews?user_review_id=7205891">Expand</a></span>
