It was released unfinished and untested. for example, in career mode, there is a bug that will not let you end your patrol in Brisbane, thus forcibly ending your career/game in 1943.

However, upon playing the game for the first time, found it to be so buggy that it proved to be unplayable. Ok, I thought, they&apos;ll release some patches that&apos;ff fix it up in no time! However, after the release of the second patch, news has hit hhe SSIV forums that , Despite the latest patch still leaving a host of bugs, UBI are debating whether or not to bother with a 1.3 patch!! So my advice, although the game has great potential, until UBI face facts and provide some support to its community, then u should never EVER buy this product. (or indeed maybe any other UBI product?) In short. Great potential, but made unplayable due to bugs that seem to never be fixed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hunter-wolves-of-the-pacific/user-reviews?user_review_id=398062">Expand</a></span>

However from my time with it I think it is a solid game. Whilst there are things that should be there (like proper tutorials and explanations on the differences between the different submarines) this game has been fun to play. Obviously this game is not for everyone, the game play is extremely slow, so slow that even on 8000+ time compression I still do spend a lot of time waiting for something to happen. However when something does happen, that is where the game is most fun. The combat isn&apos;t the best but it is extremely satisfying when you land you first manually aimed torpedo hit (even more satisfying given that there is no tutorial on how to do it). Overall this game is obviously for a niche audience and could be better. But it isn&apos;t a bad game (and is also relatively cheep).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hunter-wolves-of-the-pacific/user-reviews?user_review_id=2369626">Expand</a></span>

<br>SO-SO: 1) SH-IV patched to 1.4 - the very least to not crash the game. Some annoying bugs remain though.
<br>BAD: 2) SH-IV ver. 1.5 (with the U-Boat missions add-on) - the game gets buggy again!
<br>GOOD: 3) SH-IV 1.5 patched with one or more of the following:
<br>GOOD: 3.1) Webster&apos;s GFO 1.1 - fixes the bugs, hence the name &quot;Game Fixes Only&quot;.
<br>GREAT: 3.2) TMO 2.5 - fixes the software bugs AND changes the game balance to make it MUCH more realistic. It&apos;s feels like a very different game with TMO.
<br>USE WITH CAUTION: 3.3) OTC 1.5 (optical targeting correction) - enhances the optics in the game, making them much better. But the zoomed bridge view is annoying. (Though it can be easily reversed to FOV=75 by using the S3D editor). Although this mod is called &quot;Optical Targeting Correction&quot; - it needlessly changes some sounds in the game, making them (IMAO) much worse than in TMO.
<br>
<br>BTW manually tweaking things in the game is highly desired - there&apos;s a tool called &quot;Silent Editor&quot; for that. Learn to use it. It&apos;s not rocket science. Well OK, submarine science isn&apos;t that far off, but it&apos;s worth it ;-)
<br>
<br>With the mods: this game is a true SIMULATOR, realistic as a computer game can be.
<br>------------------------
<br>However, a fundamental con is:
<br>It gets repetitive over time. Much like a real war campaign, I guess. Subsequent missions/patrols aren&apos;t that much different from each other, and after maybe 30 hours of playing it or so you start getting the feeling that you&apos;re just getting more of the same. But it&apos;s something that&apos;s fundamental to simulating warefare - it&apos;s not an RPG with a fancy storyline and tons of different characters (although there are nice upgrades to your sub, they don&apos;t change the gameplay experience much, they just make you a bit better). It&apos;s a warship simulator, that provides you with the experience a submarine captain would get, year after year of service during a war.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/silent-hunter-wolves-of-the-pacific/user-reviews?user_review_id=4345656">Expand</a></span>
