I saw screenshots and honestly was expecting (and looking forward to) more of the same, but DAMN.. The engine has not been improved at all in five years except for adding a poor bloom, there is little to no new content (I recognize nearly every enemy and every weapon from the first game, and one or two from Overdose), and the level designs are buggy -- many, many surfaces without a texture and in one of the levels you can very easily leave the entire level area. The second level has some cool environments like the ones I loved in the first game, but it&apos;s the only one. They tried making the levels less linear and more open, which would work in any other kind of game, but anyone who&apos;s played Painkiller knows how poorly that would work in it. In short, looks, feels and plays like a mod. The only reason I bought it was because if I preordered through Steam, it was $27 for it, Overdose and Painkiller -- $9 a game, not too bad. Still, I almost regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/painkiller-resurrection/user-reviews?user_review_id=740283">Expand</a></span>

I got angry and so i had to stop the game with the hope the future will bring innovations and improvements. But nothing about. The Ressurrection is the same, long loading times, exept the fast loads, there is a message for an update but, as bevore, nobody knows where to get. What a pity, its still a good game and i hope they will not stop with it, but there must be a hand of professionals to intend and then i will hope to the next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/painkiller-resurrection/user-reviews?user_review_id=742598">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a game that should of remained as a mod, but I feel that I didn&apos;t waste my money with this one, as with the other installments; maybe I&apos;m one of the lucky few who didn&apos;t have any of these games crash. It&apos;s essentially Painkiller on steroids with nice kick butt music, even bigger battles, and huge open world settings that I find to be epic. I only reccomend this cautiously for true die hard fans like myself. Otherwise, do not buy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/painkiller-resurrection/user-reviews?user_review_id=1436198">Expand</a></span>

The maps were fairly diverse (but way too few of them), and they had some imaginative and fairly creepy aspects. There was definitely some atmosphere here - which was half the charm of the originals. But the bugs here are horrific, and the poor thing sputters and crashes - like the engine was an amateur drunk on New Year&apos;s Eve or something. The graphics suffer because of it. The monsters are crappy and crude, and gameplay definitely lacks compared to the original - which had plenty of bugs on its own. The one saving grace is that you can play bots by yourself in the multiplayer mode, which is nice because PK is sooo buggy that you can never get online to play anyone else. Ever. As an avid fan, I enjoyed it just because it was painkiller and had that spooky thing. But for anyone else, I gotta say stay clear. If this crew got together w/ the developers of the latest PK (Redemption - which was dull but bug-free), they would really have something someday.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/painkiller-resurrection/user-reviews?user_review_id=2091777">Expand</a></span>

Redemption is even more guilty of this, but Ressurection has the added annoyance of having long, difficult to navigate levels. Plus, the main character has a really weird accent. I actually kind of liked it, but the way he talks was just so... odd. Also, the only new weapon this game had was just a wee bit underwhelming, and the bosses were rehashed from the original Painkiller and Overdose. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this game and Redemption.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/painkiller-resurrection/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507705">Expand</a></span>
