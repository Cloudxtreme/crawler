It improves on all the weak spots from the first, which were few, and delivers a genuinely entertaining, witty and challenging adventure experience. I loved it! Bring on the sequel...and please another after that.</span>

This game is apparently 100% &quot;Made in Spain&quot; (though you would never know it from playing, besides some historical references in a couple of hilarious screens!) Being an adventure buff myself, I had already played Runaway: A Road Adventure, with some of the same characters, though I actually liked the characters in Runaway: The Dream of the Turtle even more, especially Lokelani, a hot Hawaiian bartender in a skimpy outfit who claims to have gone out with men from all over the planet! But getting to the main point, the game is purely and simply FUN, probably &apos;cuz the different places you travel to are wildly different, including tropical &amp; snowy places, cities, boats, ruins... And the graphics and artwork are breathtaking. The visual style is completely different from any other adventures, which makes the experience refreshing. I played almost straight through over a week, since I was dying to find out where the adventure would take me next. As for the puzzles in this point-and-click game, I would say they are moderate. Some in the beginning were a bit easier, but a couple had me stumped as I moved on to later chapters. As always, the characters give you many a clue and hint, and in The Dream of the Turtle, the characters have a lot to say! Which is good, because the dialogue and script are really funny and well-done. One of the aspects I most enjoyed was that the writing seemed very well-thought-out and was actually aimed at an audience with a thinking mind on its shoulders! This includes a uge number of references to books, movies, famous personages, and other games. And some really good humorous moments, especially one involving the invocation of a poultry god in which we hear numerous gutt-bustingly funny poems dedicated to some sort of chicken deity. More technically speaking, the music and sound effects are both excellent. You can tell that an enormous amount of effort was put into every detail in this sense, as with everything graphic, as well. Anyway, I think the game will be a total surprise for everyone who decides to jump in and play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/runaway-the-dream-of-the-turtle/user-reviews?user_review_id=396581">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> A cute, fun adventure game. The Graphics are wonderful, and it&apos;s nice to see hot babes in this genre. The characters seem to be cell shaded 3d, they look great. Many of the puzzles are entirely annoying however, like you&apos;ll know you have to do something, but it won&apos;t give you a positive unless you do something else first.</span>

Graphically good, but no option to change resolution or go windowed. The story is good and I managed to get halfway through without using a walkthrough. The puzzles aren&apos;t that complicated, but almost always, one has to speak to someone or look at something before something else can be picked up. Since Brian usually refuses to interact with these objects at first, one ends up trying most things with most other things over again, or going through dialog trees again to see if one option was missed. I can&apos;t decide if the game ends without resolution or is just paced wrongly. Its 10 hour gameplay suggests the latter; the conclusion and explanations are left to the sequel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/runaway-the-dream-of-the-turtle/user-reviews?user_review_id=4012790">Expand</a></span>
