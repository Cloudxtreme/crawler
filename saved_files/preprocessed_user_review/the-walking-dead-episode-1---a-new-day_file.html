Certain characters will die regardless of how you try to save them. This is disappointing as the game heralds &quot;adapting to your choices&quot; when in reality practically ALL of your choices are superficial and have no bearing on how the game actually plays out.
<br>
<br>Having watched seasons 1-4 of the walking dead by Myndflame on Youtube, I made a concerted effort to pick the OPPOSITE choices. Yet, in spite of this, my game has been practically identical save for a few superficial differences.
<br>
<br>Another major problem with the game is that MOST of it is cut scene. In the places that you are given control of your character, generally, you are stuck with ONE option to solve the puzzles or progress to the next scene. Often times you&apos;ll run into invisible walls, whether it be in the environment or in the choices the game will allow you to make. Too many times I was greeted with Lee telling me &quot;This is probably not a good idea right now...&quot;  So what? I thought this game was about making choices?
<br>
<br>Although I find the game, the world, and the story fascinating I am disenfranchised with this promise of &quot;choice&quot;. When you compare it to other great games like Fallout or Mass Effect the game falls short on its promise. The story doesn&apos;t really change. The results are almost identical, and what you do doesn&apos;t really matter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2703321">Expand</a></span>

It is not tailored to you like it claims, it simply puts a ridiculous situation in front of you and forces you to literally pick left or right. The movement of the characters is extremely limited and geared completely towards consoles. The fact that it shows you an XBOX controller in the menu even though you are on a PC tells me that they didn&apos;t give two sh*ts about PC gamers when they ported it. The puzzles are random and illogical. It takes more brute force than thought when it comes to solving them. All in all I wouldn&apos;t recommend this purchase. It&apos;s a crap game built around a great show and comic book. It&apos;s a forced story line, with absolutely no openness at all. I know movie/tv/book based games are known to be bad, but this one takes the cake on that badge. The only reason I give it a three is because of the name.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2313968">Expand</a></span>

<br>But the game is full of bugs, a lot of players are experiencing problems in playing the game and i&apos;m one of them.
<br>It deletes my saves every time and there&apos;s no solution to this bug. (One of the hundred unsolved bugs of this game)
<br>It isn&apos;t worth the price i paid!</span>

However, it is forgivable, as the slowness is due to the characters needing to be introduced, and there are some important choices you can make towards the end of the episode.</span>

I&apos;ve been a pretty big fan of The Walking Dead since the television series aired back in 2010. I distinctly remember having Walking Dead parties with college classmates on Sunday nights to tune in and watch the massacre. Since then I&apos;ve read the comics up until issue 90 and watch every single episode. Basically I felt obligated to get this game. My struggle was that I&apos;ve never liked point and click, and I still don&apos;t think I ever will. The only exception that generates my excitement for this game is The Walking Dead name is on it. If you&apos;re not a fan of the show or comics, or even point and clicks, you should probably stay away. I finished the episode in about two hours. Those achievements popped up pretty often it seemed like, so I assumed it was going to be fairly short - it is. The reason I&apos;m giving the game a 7/10 is because of it&apos;s technical obstacles like other reviewers have mentioned. Sometimes frames would jump, seem as if it was rendering a frame right then and there so obviously (on my pretty powerful rig).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2324821">Expand</a></span>

Well, they have been more than fulfilled, and I will be sure to buy the next four episodes of this game as soon as they come out. I will divide my review into five sections, although the average of the four will not be the final score.
<br>
<br>Audio: I personally feel that although the voice acting is very good, it should&apos;ve all been recorded with a better microphone. The background effects and sounds are extremely good, and I really felt immersed in the game as I was playing it, but the voices are crackly and not loud enough. 7/10
<br>
<br>Gameplay: This game is interesting because - although the game is a point and click game at heart - it also has first person and third person sequences, and a few QTE&apos;s. (quick time events) Although I do not feel as if this mix is detrimental to the game whatsoever, it is pretty surprising because the game switches between them instantly and without warning. 8/10
<br>
<br>Story: This really captivated me. you feel for every character in the game, and when something happens to them you genuinely feel worried. The story is extremely well written and well thought out. I won&apos;t go into detail for fear of giving out spoilers. 10/10
<br>
<br>Graphics: I always thought that if a game based on the walking dead were ever to come out, it would have ultra-realistic graphics with a gritty, dark style. Although the game does have quite a gritty art style, the graphics are certainly not ultra realistic. If anything, they&apos;re actually quite cartoony. I&apos;m not sure how, but it works. 9/10
<br>
<br>Overall: If you don&apos;t like point and click games STAY AWAY. This game is completely story orientated so don&apos;t expect to play another dead island. If you don&apos;t have patience, and don&apos;t like getting involved in stories, then do not buy this game. However, if you do, (and you should) not buying this game would be a terrible, terrible mistake. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2483968">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I experienced multiple issues with this game that just made it frustrating to play through at times.  Game saves would stop working properly after completing the first episode, and if I tried to continue from that saved file I would only be left with a black screen and no progress towards loading the game.
<br>
<br>The mouse also acts up a lot.  It seems that the further I got into the game the more stubborn the response is and I actually found myself rushing the last chapter just so I wouldn&apos;t have to deal with it anymore.
<br>
<br>In the end, I think the game warrants 1 play through at least.  For zombie lovers out there the story will keep you on the edge of your seats.  But as long as the same issues plague this game, replaying it will only prove to be more frustrating than entertaining.  Telltale Games hasn&apos;t really taken any action towards fixing these issues though so I won&apos;t be holding my breath.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2870312">Expand</a></span>

I love the fact that you have to make tough choices, who you want to save from death, to tell the truth or not. You get emotionally attached to most of the characters, and you would want to see this through. You can tell the game is developed for consoles, because of some graphical glitches, audio glitches and the controls. Don&apos;t fret! I could look past those tiny imperfections, because everything else is awesome! If you love zombies and an engaging story, you&apos;ll absolutely love this game. I can&apos;t wait for the next episodes. This game receives a 9/10 from me because of the story, comic-style graphics, music and characters. The game is very much worth its price too, that&apos;s good. It does not receive a 10/10 because of a few tiny bugs and some audio-glitches. Apart from that, I recommend it highly!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2315452">Expand</a></span>

When I first looked into this game, I thought it would be some shooter resident-evil wannabe, then I found out it was a graphic adventure with lots of action on it, which is really original and cool. But what I liked the most was the story, so epic and inmersive, really at the level of the TV series and more touchy. The flawless voice acting helps a lot.
<br>
<br>The other strong point in the game is the dialogue choice options. Everything you say almost always have some kind of impact in the story, from gaining influence over some pal of your group, to trigger a whole situation that may save your life or kill you. In fact, the difficulty of the game is not killing the zombies, but preventing your group to split or fall into hysteria.
<br>
<br>The only thing that could be better, are the puzzles. For a graphic adventure the puzzles are quite weak, but it kind of compensates with a great dose of action. All crowned with a great and moving ending.
<br>
<br>This game is a must have so try it. You won&apos;t be dissapointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2809688">Expand</a></span>

It lacks background information for someone who doesn&apos;t know this series. The plot is reasonably interesting, for the genre, and the dialogs are well acted and credible. My main complaint is that the actions are timed. This is so much like a movie that you tend to sit back and watch, occasionally noticing that a reply is expected. It&apos;s very frustrating to have a timer that forces you to answer within a short amount of time. The game either needs more interaction to keep the player involved enough that a need for an action doesn&apos;t come as a surprise or it needs to patiently wait for the user to put down his coffee and pick up the keyboard or controller. As it is, the balance isn&apos;t right. Also, at the time of this review, the game is disappointingly unoptimized. Running on a top end system that runs the most demanding AAA games with maximum quality graphics at 1080p, this game frequently stalls on a frame for a few seconds, making it feel as if it&apos;s loading an overlay from a floppy disk. That&apos;s seriously amateurish, especially given the extreme simplicity of this game, from a technical perspective. I would recommend it for fans of the series, but only when it drops to half its current price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2313859">Expand</a></span>

<br>As another Walking Dead property this might be okay, but as the game Telltale advertises it&apos;s a zero.  The main &quot;game&quot; aspect is all about your choices and the effect they have on the story and world at large.  The problem is that this notion of choice is a lie.  Even when you have a choice, which isn&apos;t that often as many outcomes are set in stone, the effects are superficial at best.  If Telltale can&apos;t really offer a game that is greatly affected by your in game choices they shouldn&apos;t advertise it as such.  Considering &quot;choice&quot; is the main or lone mechanic in what makes this a game it fails pretty miserably.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re interested in another Walking Dead story I hear you can just watch playthroughs on YouTube.  Trust me, with the lack of variation you won&apos;t miss anything this way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2861267">Expand</a></span>

It is an excellent simulation of the post apocalyptic zombie future which is gratifying in that it does not focus on the combat. The game focuses on story and characterization and does an excellent job with both. The timed dialogue choices mean that you don&apos;t choose strategically but with your gut.</span>

I&apos;m a huge Walking Dead fan, both comic and tv show, so was very skeptical when this game was announced with Tell-Tale as a developer.  I bought it anyway and was pleasantly surprised. The graphics are a wonderful homage to Charlie Adlard&apos;s work in the comics and the engine will run on the vast majority of pcs. I found myself caring about the characters and agonising over the decisions I made and how they would affect future episodes.  It&apos;s true you don&apos;t get full control or a free roaming world but what you do get is an interesting experience that many AAA games could learn a lot from. The story is the unique selling point of this game and it delivers, in episode 1 at least.<br><br>I would recommend this to anyone, Walking Dead fans or not. Now hurry up and release episodes 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2313926">Expand</a></span>

However, unlike some of the more ignorant members of the gaming community as a whole, I knew that TTG had discovered something special in the form of creating a flowing, horror-filled adventure experience within the confines of an extremely zombie-rich apocalyptic universe.  The story of Kirkman&apos;s comics have always been about the progression of the plot through the characters.  The game adaptation is no exception.  Right from the get-go, both the characters dialogue &amp; and the actions they carry out not only create a sense of an authentic emotional impact upon the more sensitive aspects of your mind, but they make you care about the characters as well.  Never in my life, in any horror franchise, including The Walking Dead, up to this point at least; have I ever appreciated a child who plays a large part in the story.  Generally speaking due to their obnoxious and helpless nature, as well as the fact that they only tend to bog the main characters down in place.  Clementine, the little eight year old girl you come across within the first half hour of the game, not only makes a dramatic appearance where she acts sensibly, as well as bravely.  But quite literally, she saves your life.  She&apos;s intelligent, witty, brave, cute, and most importantly, a damn fine companion.  You care about the well being of this girl.  Although simply a game, I found myself immersed and enthralled in a different rendition of the same post-apocalyptic world I discovered in the comics, as well as rediscovered in the TV show.  I instantly became protective of this little girl, not only because she was a an ultimately reasonable character in such repeatedly dire situations, but because she can keep her **** together when individuals forty years her senior cannot.  Suffice to say, the narrative is spot on.  You&apos;ll make decisions as to whom to which you will give food, ally yourself with, trust, or even which particular character will live or die.  These decisions then subsequently carry over to the soon-to-be-released follow up episodes set for launch throughout Summer.  The only gripes I have with this first episode of the game is the fact that just like recently released TTG titles, &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; suffers from some stuttering due to a slightly flawed graphics engine developed in-house by TTG.  This isn&apos;t really a complaint that can be isolated with &quot;TWD&quot; specifically.  As I said, it plagued previous TTG game too.  In comparison to those titles, the stuttering is near nonexistent.  It doesn&apos;t even effect game-play, and perhaps it&apos;ll be fixed in the future.  It only serves as an annoyance to distract players from brief cinematics. In reality, the only flaw I can see with the mechanics of the game itself is occasional discrepancies in the conversations of the characters between one another.  Occasionally you will receive a mixed reaction from a character, while this isn&apos;t unrealistic in any way, nor is it entirely unexpected, it makes it hard for you to know where you stand with each character unless you have the UI updating you about their current emotions.  In fact, it can be argued that this isn&apos;t a flaw at all, and only serves to up-the-anty in decision-making processes as well as making the characters so integral to the plot more dynamic.  Regardless, it still allows for the every-so-often awkward replies between the player and other characters that seem to be contradicting to either what the player was hoping to establish, or what the reaction the player was expecting.  A more common criticism I&apos;ve seen if that particular reviewers, such as those over at the gamespy website, believe that certain major decisions have no impact on the story.  While this statement in itself is contradictory seeing as how an important decision would have to have an impact on the story, these reviewers are also wrong to assume that only one episode into a five episode arc that these specific decisions have no impact.  Perhaps if they had even payed attention to the preview for the second episode after the conclusion of the first, they would know from the characters dialogue featured that certain characters have problems with the decisions that were made by the player previously, and have yet to say anything.  In the end, I recommend this game highly to anyone looking for an &quot;old school&quot; adventure game with items and exploration, fans of the comics (which the game&apos;s art style is inspired by), or perhaps even people who only watch the show.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2314062">Expand</a></span>

In addition to the Steam version, I will treat myself to the Xbox Live Arcade version as well so as to have two versions of the story side by side. I can&apos;t remember another game that caused me to want to do this.<br><br>As a huge fan of the comic and the television series, I find that this game succeeds in creating a new story with some new characters and some existing ones. It all feels right at home in its universe. The game is compelling and the characters are memorable. I just get the feeling that with this game, Telltale was like &quot;Ok, we&apos;re not **** around&quot;. It just keeps throwing the player into interesting and tense situations. Aside from all of the story and making choices talk, the art style is also very pleasing to the eye. Facial expressions are really nailed which add to the overall tone of the often visceral situations. When you sit down to play this game, get ready to have your fingers on the proverbial trigger as there are timers on making decisions. This helps in making it a somewhat realistic engine. This is how you might have to make decisions in real life. There&apos;s action. There&apos;s drama. There&apos;s gore, thrills, and chills. (And spills. I slipped on a huge puddle of blood) The Walking Dead: Episode 1 delivers on everything you would want in a Walking Dead adventure game while keeping the story front and center. Some games have forgettable stories or stories elements you might not even remember. This game sticks with you because the experience is so very personal. It feels fantastic to finally play an episodic adventure game that makes you care, second guess yourself, and ultimately react. The best part, was that by the end, I was truly entertained and ready for the next episode.<br><br>What more could I ask for?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2314882">Expand</a></span>

The action scenes seem to come out of nowhere, and sometimes you only realize it isn&apos;t a cut scene after it&apos;s too late. But even if you do realize it in time Lee doesn&apos;t seem to be in a hurry to not get eaten. Though even if you are bad at that kind of action sequence there aren&apos;t enough to really ruin your gaming experience.
<br>
<br>To sum up, the most advertised part of this game is that it&apos;s tailored to your decisions. But it&apos;s really not, there&apos;s a very strict order in which everything has to be done. And most importantly, usually whatever you decide you have to stay behind 100%, for the most part the game doesn&apos;t give you the option to regret any of your decisions. Which is kind of annoying when someone gets pissed off at you for a decision you made while on a timer.
<br>
<br>Overall, I give it a 3.5/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2767819">Expand</a></span>

<br>To sum it up shortly: I&apos;m not satisfied and here&apos;s why: First, this is not an adventure as advertised, it&apos;s an interactive movie/comic. The puzzles are scarce and ridiculously easy, most of the game consists of cutscenes and quick-time events. On the plus side, I think the dialogue system is good although a little hasty maybe.
<br>Second, the decisions you can make are very limited and most have close no effect on the path the story takes (contrary to what has been promised). Most of the time you will not only end up with exactly the same results in the end but all choices are of the &quot;A or B&quot; type. [spoilers] Example: When you have to chose if you want to save Shawn or Kenny&apos;s kid it will always turn out the same. The kid is save, Shawn is dead and Herschel is throwing you off his farm. You&apos;re not able to solve this situation as a normal person would do if somebody&apos;s stuck beneath a tractor: getting on the damn thing and drive it backwards.[/spoilers]
<br>Third, it is way too short for the amount of money you pay for it. 25$ for a 2 hour game (I hardly see any replay value) is daylight robbery. Maybe 40$ for all 5 episodes with all in all 10 hours of gameplay would&apos;ve been adequate.
<br>Forth, the controls are pretty bad. Although you have to use WASD to walk you can&apos;t look around as the view is always limited to a certain area. The good old fashioned &quot;click mouse to make player to there&quot; way would&apos;ve been a lot better.
<br>Fifth, the engine cause a lot of stutters during fast scene changes. This can be very annoying.
<br>I&apos;m giving it a 4 out of 10, mainly because I think the story/dialogues and the graphics are done quite well, but overall it&apos;s a disappointment and certainly not worth the money. Too bad...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2581482">Expand</a></span>

That&apos;s exactly what Walking Dead is like.  The game is a top-heavy scripted cartoon.  Especially bothersome, the game doesn&apos;t require much in the way of intelligence to even play nor is it real challenging (unless you consider random illogical puzzles challenging).  If you like games like Left 4 Dead, you&apos;re not gonna like this one very much......The controls of the game are totally confusing.  You will find yourself dying in this cartoon not because you don&apos;t know what to do but rather because you do not know how to do it with the controls!  You learn after a while, but it still upsetting that the controls are counter-intuitive.  Perhaps they should have included a small tutorial that would get a player familiar with the controls.
<br>
<br>Speaking of controls, moving around is equally junky.  When you move the character around (via 3rd person) you can not move them around just anyway you like.  The game severely limits movement and because of this, your perspective of the location is very limited.  Coming off a game like Left For Dead, where observing what is going on in all directions is extremely vital to survival, this will drive you absolutely crazy.
<br>
<br>I like a good story driven game as much as the next person, but that is not here.  I enjoyed Neil Manke&apos;s They Hunger much more.  It had a cool scripted story-line but wasn&apos;t restrictive in game play at all.
<br>
<br>But with the Scripted Nature of this game, you will spend more time watching scripted cut-scene dialogues than actually Doing Anything.  When you actually get to do something, it feels restrained- like a Choose Your Own Adventure Book.  You find out it doesn&apos;t matter in any case because the story is only going in one direction (unlike a choose your own adventure book)!
<br>
<br>I give the game props for a unique look. that&apos;s why it scored a 5,  The rest of this game is solid 3.
<br>I saw some reviews on here where people said, don&apos;t rate it low if you don&apos;t like this type of game....HUH?  That&apos;s like saying &quot;don&apos;t rate the game if you don&apos;t like the game.&quot;
<br>
<br>I got this game on sale, I&apos;d wait for it to be five bucks before you buy it if you want to try it.  It&apos;s seriously not worth more than that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2526860">Expand</a></span>

It IS an interactive story rather than a full-fledged action/puzzle game, but that&apos;s not the issue I have with it. I do wish it offered more of a branching story line, if story is where it&apos;s trying to shine -- most of the conversation decisions seem to be purely cosmetic.  (They&apos;re also stressful to make; there&apos;s usually barely enough time to read them all before the timer runs out.) But more importantly, the story it does lead you through is just so generic. It must have hit every single zombie apocalypse bingo square in the first half hour. That&apos;s what killed it for me. If there&apos;s no gameplay to speak of and no exploration of the game&apos;s world allowed, the story better be gripping. It wasn&apos;t; it never made me care. I&apos;ll grant that the characters were decently written for the most part, and I hope they will grow in complexity in future episodes.
<br>
<br>On top of the lackluster story, the gameplay aspects are terribly implemented. It might play better on console, but the PC controls are atrocious, character movement felt cumbersome and stunted, and the fixed camera/scenery drove me batty, since it frequently conceals walkable paths. The player is also artificially held back from progressing at multiple points. Some of the puzzles you&apos;re presented with have obvious solutions, but the game won&apos;t give you the tools to solve them until you&apos;ve passed some other check point. (The brick thing was particularly annoying, as was the pharmacy door.) Some other puzzles were also just insulting to the characters themselves. I won&apos;t go into detail, but Carly -- presumably at least passing familiar with technology, being a reporter, not to mention perfectly capable of firing a handgun -- couldn&apos;t figure out the issue with the radio? Twice? Really, now?
<br>
<br>As for the the visual style, I&apos;m not a fan, though I&apos;ll grant that&apos;s partly a matter of personal taste. The line work looked sloppy to me, the colours too muddy -- Clementine&apos;s face was a good example of this. What&apos;s not a matter of personal taste are the graphics glitches, particular the pixelated shadows all over the place. I did play this on an Mac via Steam, however, so it&apos;s possible it runs better on Windows.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2542177">Expand</a></span>

Game Survival is fully centered around quicktime events, where pushing the correct button quickly and multiple times is key.  This makes game-play centered more around fast reflexes instead of logical thinking and planning.  Unfortunately the player does not get to keep weapons in the game, nor choose which weapons they want to use against enemies.  The fighting sequences are fully scripted using a particular weapon (picked up just prior to battle) and seem intended for immediate use.  Due to the rather linear style of game-play, I cannot recommend this as a true RPG, more like a scripted movie with quick-time events thrown in.  A game that feels very similar to this one is Heavy Rain for the PS3.  Since the game is the first-part of a five-part episodic series, the game length of this episode is rather short.  I completed episode 1 in approximately 40 minutes.  Timely releases of subsequent episodes appears to be problematic for the publisher.  Episode 1 was released on April 24th, 2012.  When The Walking Dead game was being advertised prior to launch, Telltales Entertainment promised releases for new episodes &quot;every month&quot;, but since the launch of episode 1 they have inexplicably postponed releasing episode 2.  Now their official stance on releasing new episodes has been modified on their website as &quot;approximately every month&quot;.  As of this writing it is June 11th, and episode 2 has still not been released which means it has been  approximately two months since the last episode has been released.  Potential customers should therefor, expect delays if they wish to purchase the Season Pass option.  Overall, I feel the game is an average entry into what is essentially a CGI movie with scripted sequences and quicktime events.  Heavy Rain, by comparison, is more polished in practically every area to include graphics, sound, characters, and plot.  You are also dealing with untimely releases of subsequent episodes- even at the rate of 1 month per episode you are looking forward to 40 minutes of new game-play every month, which most people will agree is ridiculous.  At face value, I would usually score an average game like this one with an average score of 6; but the untimely releases of subsequent episodes further degrades the appeal of the series to an even lower-average-score of 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2464980">Expand</a></span>

Yeah nothing more exciting than clicking bubbles that make you do one action. Interactive movies are pointless, I would rather just watch a movie and not have the irritating task of pressing one button. Dialog choices never give the intended result it seems and are usually a black or white issue. Overall quality of the game is okay but the entire time I played this game I didn&apos;t feel like it&apos;s a game. If you want a zombie game go with something like Dead Island or Left 4 Dead because you&apos;re actually playing a game. 0/10 for not being a game but an interactive movie. I&apos;m upset I bought the game because I can go on the internet and find a flash game that gives more entertainment than this crap. Come to think about it, this game is exactly like an adventure game you would find on a flash game site and does not deserve to be a pay to play game especially since they release the entire game in a series of episodes instead of giving you the entire thing at once.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2532767">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s also a welcome departure from the usual adventure game mould, it&apos;s still point and click but it pulls this off in an unusual way, and I for one am fond of the control scheme Telltale adopted. And to top it all off it has some really crisp comic style graphics and this looks fantastic, I gave it a 9 however for some weak voice acting at times. Other than this minor gripe, well done Telltale!

Let me start by saying this: If you are going to buy this game just to mow down endless waves of zombies, DON&apos;T. This isn&apos;t Left 4 Dead, this is a game that is about the actual survival aspect of a zombie survival game. The game makes it clear that if you try to fight more than one zombie by yourself, you are going to die. If you want to survive in this game, you&apos;re going to have to be cunning, and think strategically.<br><br>The only complaint that I have with this game are the graphics. They aren&apos;t bad per se, but are low quality. This does mean that the game will run smoothly on any system, though. One more thing about the graphics though, is that they are very similar to those of The Sims 2. If you look at the facial expressions and animations, it&apos;s almost like they just made a third-person Sims: Zombie Survival game.<br><br>All in all, this game is AMAZING, and after the first 400 MB episode, is already worth the $25 I spent on it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2329528">Expand</a></span>

I tried it since i thought the zombie survival plot would fit this genre better than most other topics, i was amazed.  I have enjoyed it so much my view on the whole genre has changed. I highly recommend this game as a starting point to Adventure games, Specially if you are into other genres and you are interested in the Story side of those other games. Here you won&apos;t get to play a FPS, 3PS, RTS etc. (which before TLD i thought would beat adventure any day of the month) But it does come close to a really good RPG in the choice area (actually i wish many RPGs could really incorporate more things like this into their actual plots). It&apos;s true that the content from one decision to the other doesn&apos;t drastically change everything and many times plot devices are inserted to make things run leaving a bit of holes. But it&apos;s a zombie game! The whole idea is that Zombies are already plot devices in a fictional scenario. Still the story is compelling and full. So my recommendation is that if you want to shoot zombies, u have a lot of options and if you want everything to be just like it would be in real life... get one. This game is a great game and could re define the comic book experience imho. Just sit back, relax, stress, have fun and have emotions with choices that will make you wish to know what would happen if... and that is re playability. The only thing i wish they programed  is a fast forward or skip button that u could unlock after you first run, since it would just be nice to fast forward through some of the already given story. Well in a nutshell. it&apos;s a comic book, tv program, movie... where you interact... just give it a try! i did... and i am already buying more adventure games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2315453">Expand</a></span>

This isn&apos;t a game where you slice as many zombies as you can with a katana, this game makes clever use of minimal zombies to add a certain extent of fear, and the lack of zombies in certain parts show how dangerous it might be to cross one of them. I was sceptical about buying this at first, but playing this proved me very, very wrong. This is the saddest game I&apos;ve ever played (well, with the exception of Portal 2&apos;s ending) I hated making horrible decisions and I did feel really sad at certain parts. Negatives : The Walking Dead relies too much on cutscenes and background visuals could be refined (hoping they&apos;ll make the backgrounds more scenic in the coming episodes.)<br><br>The voice acting is superb.

When I heard that Tell Tale Games was making it I knew it would suck. I had hoped when they announced that there would be a video game adaptation, that they would finally give me the zombie game that gamer fans of the genre were looking for. I see Tell Tale&apos;s strategy of making games that mimic a &quot;Choose your own adventure&quot;, Cutscene styling as lazy game making. I had hoped for something like the DAY Z mod in ARMA 2. Why did I buy it??..simple, it was called &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;.    Now ofcourse I knew before purchasing it , this game was going to be boring to play, however i had hoped it would atleast have some type of immersion. NONE. Whenever anyone points this out about the game, either a Tell Tale employee or FanBoy states &quot;You dont think that smashing a zombie&apos;s brains in with a hammer is immersion&quot;? &quot;You dont think that choosing what happens is immersion enough&quot;?....My answer is NO, not the way the game is styled. All of your decisions are forced. Any action sequences were made so that a child could complete them. This game is more like pressing &quot;Q&quot; or &quot;E&quot; so that you can continue watching a crappy movie/comic book video. And &quot;Choices&quot; ...really....&quot;Choices&quot;...the &quot;S&quot; on the end of the word &quot;Choice&quot; implies more than ONE...and when it comes to this game they are not lying...in fact you get TWO. &quot;Save Carly or Nerd boy Doug&quot;, &quot;Save Hershel&apos;s Son or the idiot kid&quot;.(Which i hope that kid dies). And not even all the choices are logical.  Someone mentioned a brick small enough to fit through the gate at the pharmacy....or even the fact that you could use the Cane to grab it....not an option. It would not even let you pick the cane up. The one and only puzzling puzzle was the TV Remote. and that was just lame.    Aside from the games integrity, how about the critics....I call BS on the many positive reviews of this game, however i see this alot in gaming. Lets just put it this way...I have come to this site to read reviews on just about every game before buying...until now I have never reviewed a game until being disgusted by the lack truth when it comes to the reviews of this game. I realize that this is only my opinion. I own every zombie/game/mod so naturally, I bought this as well.    One more thing, where is episode two? I was told before buying that the game&apos;s episodes were to be released monthly. Maybe if they spent less time making you tube videos, patting themselves on the backs for the horrible game they have made, and more time making the game...there wouldnt be alot of angry customers out there. Usually the response to this statemeny by a TT agent or FanBoy is &quot;Do you want a crap episode now or a great one later&quot;? ..my response is I dont really care and TT doesnt either, they already got my money. I&apos;ll definitely save my money on the next set of episodes. Think Ill just watch someone playing those on You Tube. Which will get the story told to me for free.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2455681">Expand</a></span>

Then on to what the game has to offer, lacks in the forced story line and the character control. well that just doesn&apos;t cut it. The original story line can not be changed no matter what decision is made the game still contnues in the direction it was forced into, also any time there is a puzzle to be solved any idea of interacting to solve it with a locial decision never seem to be the key to get it to work.  The usage of items in the game that you would never think of using for a solution to puzzles is off the wall decision making.I hope the next episode is better then the first. I gave it a 4 because it did get less then 2 hrs of game play out of me and $20.00 out of my pocket.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2428282">Expand</a></span>

The point and click thing does get a little hairy when your in the heat of the moment but it was all good. Easy to get used to.

I think the complete series should be no more the $50, and that is still a little pricey for 10 hours of play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2425620">Expand</a></span>

For those of you who, if you didn&apos;t like something go straight to a zero, or even the people who go straight to a 10 for that matter.  Seriously think about it, a zero would indicate that in all your years of playing games / watching tv and movies / listening to music, etc,  whatever you are rating was the WORST thing you have ever seen or heard.  In the same breath, a 10 is the best thing you have ever seen, nearing perfection.  It&apos;s not rocket science people.<br><br>That short rant aside, the game was a very well done, albeit it short romp ( I know it&apos;s episodic ) into the Walking Dead universe, but the tone was very much intact.  I personally have read the whole series to date as well as watched the well done show, and the tone of the series feels very fitting in this medium.  I see people who would have liked to see a Resident Evil or Left 4 Dead style zombie game, but The Walking Dead isn&apos;t even centered on zombies as much as the character development of people in an apocalyptic environment.  It has some excellent zombie killing action, but the message of the series has always been that the zombies are not the real danger, it&apos;s your fellow survivors.<br><br>Putting the game into a story driven, conversation style with some key choices and light puzzle work allows the player to have a bit of control to what is essentially a choose you own adventure story. Some timed mechanics make you feel a bit of the character&apos;s urgency in key moments, and the promise of a branching story dependent on choices you made throughout is what you&apos;re signing up for.<br><br>If you want a zombie shoot em up, they&apos;ve been done, this is for the story, and does it well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2316119">Expand</a></span>

This is a story driven adventure that focuses more on the dynamics between characters and the moral dilemmas that they face than it is about running around bashing zombies repeatedly.  This is not to say that there isn&apos;t a healthy dose of zombie bashing, in fact there is a good amount of that, but it&apos;s not the main driver, which if you follow the TV show or novels, is the whole point.  It&apos;s about day by day survival, trust of those around you and the constant feeling that your days are numbered.<br><br>I really look forward to the future episodes and my only complaint with this first episode was the length which is why I didn&apos;t give it a 10.  I finished it up in less than an hour, which at $5 isn&apos;t a huge disappointment, but I feel that they could have given us a bit more.  My hope is that they continue delivering high quality content in the future and go beyond the five episodes that are already scheduled.<br><br>Final point: If you&apos;re a fan of the graphic novel series, I&apos;d be shocked if you didn&apos;t really enjoy this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2320346">Expand</a></span>

You are playing a character with a background, not you. By making it as open as possible, you run into issues not only in storyline, but also character development. Besides, WE ALL HAVE SOME KIND OF ZOMBIE SENSE! This world, they don&apos;t know about zombies. Onto the actual review. It is a decent game if you enjoy the TV show and comic book series. 5 bucks for an &quot;episode&quot; that takes about 2 hours to complete is not a bad deal. The game does a fairly decent job on following the story style that The Walking Dead creators intended. The idea is for you to play as morally correct as possible. That means you can&apos;t do a Mass Effect or Fable type play of going &quot;evil&quot; because that is not the point of the storyline. Would you be the &quot;evil&quot; person in a zombie apocalypse? The game mechanics are definitely the limiting factor in the game. It was designed for the Xbox, and they did a port to PC. It&apos;s a bummer they did that, but these types of games are by far more popular on consoles than PCs. The controls suffer on the PC, and from gameplay footage from the console does seem to be that reaction type is slower than PC, but that is a moot point in the grand scheme of the game. A good thing about the game is the replay value. There were points of the game where I wanted to do a &quot;quick save&quot; and switch my choice to see if I made a better decision, but with no feature like that in the game, it makes it a lot more fun and interesting.One cool aspect is after the episode, it gives you stats on what other players did in their campaigns and shows you how you fared with them. Lastly, as a piece advice to &quot;hardcore gamers&quot;: this game is not intended to be played like an arcade game that CoD has burned into your brains. Video games are art, and EA/Activision have turned into reusing the same vomit every year. This game has a very good artistic view, and it flows well into the game&apos;s universe. I gave it an 8/10 due to the console to PC port flaws.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2321009">Expand</a></span>

However, after reading the comments left by others on the site, I decided to give it a try. I admit, what I found was not what I was expecting at all... I found a game that shows you the other side of the zombie apocalypse: the dramatic side that showcases that every little decision you make, big or small, could have devastating consequences for anyone else. I found myself deeply engrossed in the story from the moment I started playing, and even though Episode 1 is only around two hours long, I felt myself being incredibly connected to each of these characters. If you&apos;re looking for a game where you survive by going &quot;Rambo&quot; (aka Resident Evil, Left 4 Dead etc.), then this is definitely not your game (even though you still will brutally kill some zombies in very unique ways). But if you&apos;re looking for a zombie game with a deep story, likable characters, and decisions that have the steepest of consequences and keep you on your toes, this is definitely worth checking out. I know there are many reviewers stating that your choices &quot;don&apos;t matter&quot;, but remember that this is still only the first of five episodes. Knowing that, I am excited to see where the choices that I made will lead me up through episode five.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2325468">Expand</a></span>

The show is good too, (but nothing near is awesome as the comics) ,  The game was good fun, though I feel it was kind of annoying to play.  The click and point mechanic gets tiresome very quickly and kind of takes me out of the moment.  If you go back and click on the same spot more than once, he just says the same thing over and over and you can&apos;t stop the dialog once it starts.  Definitely would have preferred a more open world, but I realize the developer wants a very scripted event to happen, which is fine I guess, just not what I would necessarily want with a video game.  The biggest problem for me with this game, was it was extremely laggy.  I don&apos;t see anyone else commenting about the lag so maybe it was just me, but with a game like this I would think it would be more optimized, it not like it is a game that will crush my system.  get rid of the lag, and I would give this game a higher score, probably a 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2325614">Expand</a></span>

As an example playing Skyrim I am way over 200 hours, and can say I got my value for my dollar. COD, I don&apos;t play multiplayer and finish the single compaign in 10 hours (not worth the price for me).  With Walking Dead Ep1. I finished the first episode in about 2 hours. If this is the same across all episodes then I would only get 10 hours... and I paid about $26 on Steam. Thus not worth the price for me. Not having read the comics the story line felt like it skipped or went through too fast. There were several scenes that felt disconnected or forced through the story. I did like the characters however and I believe the voice actors did a fine job. I look forward to the future episodes and hope the developers do more, I enjoyed the puzzles and choices presented.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2329191">Expand</a></span>

While I love the Adventure genre, I have yet to encounter any game by Telltale that I enjoyed.  Up to now I&apos;ve pretty much hated every game they&apos;ve done.  Well, they finally broke the mold and put out a heck of a fine game, and yet ironically it isn&apos;t in the genre they&apos;re known for.  Do NOT assume this is another Telltale cookie-cutter Adventure snorefest.  Puzzles are not their strong suit, but fortunately the gameplay in this title does not have much use for puzzles.  They&apos;re not meant to be brain teasers like in a classic Adventure game, rather in this game they are meant to either increase tension (find a quick way to distract the zombies over by the TV store) or create empathy with certain characters (administering a band aid to a youngster).<br><br>As far as the gameplay is concerned, it is basically identical to The Indigo Prophecy, but with much better graphics, story, acting, and execution.  If you were intrigued by the gameplay of Indigo Prophecy but hated the shoddy execution, then you really should check this game out because it succeeds where the other failed.<br><br>People expecting survival horror will be disappointed by the lack of spontaneous action.  People expecting Adventure will be disappointed by the lack of any real puzzles.<br><br>BUT, those people who expect to be drawn into a well-told, beautifully rendered interactive story will find this very entertaining.  Dialogue in this game is more than just methodically selecting every dialogue choice in the tree just to get all the content out of the game.  Most dialogue choices are timed which really adds to both the tension and the immersion: if you say something that offends somebody, you can&apos;t just make it all better by then choosing the other dialogue choice. This means it really matters what you say in most instances. AND it really adds to the replay value, which would otherwise be non-existent for a game with no action gameplay.  For me, the desire to find out what would have happened if I said something else was irresistible, yet there is no way to undo what you&apos;ve said until you play the game again.  This may sound annoying but trust me, you won&apos;t get bored listening to the dialogue because so much depends on you really meaning what you say.<br><br>I am totally unfamiliar with the comic which inspired this game.  I cannot say whether it does the comic justice, but it certainly made me curious to check it out and learn more.<br><br>So far the story is fairly generic for a zombie apocalypse retread: strangers brought together from dissimilar backgrounds learning to cooperate with each other to defeat a common, slow-moving, brain-eating undead enemy.  Nevertheless, I am totally hooked.  With only the first episode out so far, who knows which way the story could go, but if the beginning is any indication of the rest, it might not take the zombie apocalypse story into new original territory, but it nevertheless is a worthy addition to the genre.  And I&apos;m not one of those zombie-game fanboys; frankly I&apos;ve been getting a little sick of zombie-related stuff.  I really liked the original George Romero film but most stuff since then has just been so cheesy.  Regardless, I still loved this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2334475">Expand</a></span>

The developers didn&apos;t just develop a classic point and click adventure but something more modern. Dialogues are solid as is voice acting. It&apos;s sometimes frustrating to notice that some choices don&apos;t really matter but those that do are rewarding. I can&apos;t wait for the second episode</span>

Having read many of the comics, the episodic formula certainly fits the series. If you&apos;ve played any of telltales previous games and been put off the generic point and click functions, the good news is that they&apos;ve taken the initiative and delivered a new and compelling control scheme [best played with a controller]. The characters and voice over work are great and in this first episode there&apos;s a nice inclusion of a couple of key character from the comics. While the puzzles aren&apos;t particularly challenging, they work well to progress the story and help build empathy and distrust alike for the characters you meet. It&apos;s hard to review a game like this without giving away a plot point so it is quite brief; however if you enjoy zombies, story and characters then treat yourself to The Walking Dead. The series may run the risk of becoming to repetitive but only time will tell if the subsequent episodes can build of the momentum this one creates.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2408281">Expand</a></span>

If you enjoy a good story, get this game. This is an adventure game, but without all the pixel hunting. This should be used as the template for future adventure games. Timed dialogue forces your decisions based on instinct. If you&apos;re new to adventure games, I&apos;d recommend watching some gameplay videos first to make sure this is the genre for you.  There are plenty of videos online showing the first 10min of gameplay, so not much is spoiled.  The only annoyance is paying for the full price on Steam and waiting this long for the next installment.  Of course being angry that you can&apos;t play more kinda just speaks to how much I like the game.  Awesome game, get it now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2418880">Expand</a></span>

It was a little short, but the entire game was filled with content and it didn&apos;t feel like you were just going through the motions. Each scene had a point and it was fun too see how it turned out. Can&apos;t wait for the next episode!<br><br>-1 for shortness</span>

Fortunately I wasn&apos;t let down, as the story is top notch. The Walking Dead isn&apos;t an RPG, FPS or really any other modern, gaming related acronym. You don&apos;t &apos;fight&apos; zombies so much as you figure out ways to get around them and progress. I would describe it as an interactive, survival-themed story, with elements of item-scrounging and puzzle solving from earlier adventure games. You make choices throughout that can have outcomes further down the line. It&apos;s true that the choices that revolve around characters are simple A vs. B, but there are other things that pop up which add quite a bit of depth to conversations, like how open you want to be about your past. The episodic content, while probably not the best delivery method for a video game, leaves you wanting more. Each episode is about 2 hours long. Bottom line, if you like zombie games but are bored of the shooters flooding the market, give this one a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2514125">Expand</a></span>

The setting, the plot and the twists kept me going for hours and I just couldn&apos;t put it down. No game this year made me feel like that.
<br>
<br>Definitely worth every penny. In fact it&apos;s worth more that its price.</span>

I would have like a little bit more options in how to progress through the game but I understand it&apos;s limited based on the context, voice acting, and type of game it is. For example, if I wanted I would like the choice of not getting a guy&apos;s meds instead of essentially being forced to get them. Otherwise game is awesome. Episode 1 took me about 2-2.5 hours but that&apos;s fair seeing as how the game is less than $5. I hope future episodes are 20-30 minutes longer. But if the total thing with all 5 episodes is 10-12 hours then I say it&apos;s well worth the $25. Just compare it to crap single player like COD with a 5-6 hr campaign for $60.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2319103">Expand</a></span>

Some confusion over the game  is in its action beats. With it being an adventure game the pacing for action isn&apos;t as focused, which I find to put more pressure on survival rather than standing and fighting. Each walker encounter is terrifying and presents the option of death in any fight.<br><br>Familiar faces are found in locations around Georgia, and the episodic content makes for a brisk 60-90 minute story, much in the vein of watching an episode of the TV show. While I wasn&apos;t completely blown away by the first episode, I felt my stomach church as split second decisions needed to be made. Urgency dictates the amount of response time you have to make a decision, lest you stand by and say/do nothing. It&apos;s greatest flaw is grounded in the fact that the content is so short by episode, no detail can be discussed without majorly spoiling a chapter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2320584">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m not into zombie games; I get bored of the same old hack n&apos; slash action and the witty one-liners. But TellTale Games&apos; &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; is something else - it&apos;s not just the &apos;same old&apos; - its an episodic well-done masterpiece - action, adventure and even an element of puzzle. Presented in a comicy graphic style, the game opens with Lee, a convicted murderer, driving out of Atlanta on the way to prison. During this scene, you&apos;re introduced to the choices that shape the story (although, these ones don&apos;t have any effect on the rest of the story), prompting a different response which the character will remember. This is the case when choosing who should live and who should die, or sticking and siding with a certain character - if you are loyal, you will be rewarded. The thing for me that sets the game apart from others is the emotional value of the characters - by the end of the first episode, I had begun to develop a sense of care for Clementine and emotion for the entire ensemble. Then again, its not just the other characters - you begin to develop a bond with Lee, the main character, especially when you go and start a second game - you try to make him a tough, no-nonsense kind of guy, who doesn&apos;t care about anyone but himself - but you don&apos;t, because it doesn&apos;t feel right. I cannot critique the game&apos;s story or characters or game-play in any way - but I did experience a couple of problems with the game&apos;s performance - despite being perfectly matched to my laptop&apos;s specs. Sometimes the game&apos;s cutscenes lagged and paused, or sometimes the sound was repeated or out-of-sync - only small problems, but nevertheless problems that could be fixed with a simple patch.<br><br>Despite those defects, The Walking Dead is definitely a fantastic game that spins off from the zombie genre gamers have come to know and love. I personally can&apos;t wait for episode two (each episode is released monthly) and another couple of hours of gameplay. I&apos;d definitely recommend you to buy this (even though the season pass is about &#xC2;&#xA3;21 on Steam and even if you haven&apos;t followed the franchise), because this is an excellent game-changer from that zombie genre we&apos;re all too familiar with.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-walking-dead-episode-1---a-new-day/user-reviews?user_review_id=2335160">Expand</a></span>

However, my girlfriend and I found Walking Dead to be a great couples gaming experience. It&apos;s an adventure game that incorporates elements of film, but with enough quick decision making and branching plot aspects to keep you from feeling like you&apos;re just hitting continue. Simply put, if Walking Dead is an interactive movie, it is a really, really fun one. Pros: The storytelling is deeply engaging, truly top shelf for video games. The animation, voice acting, writing and story arc are all genuinely good and engaging. It doesn&apos;t feel like settling for a second-rate story just because it is a game (MMORPG anyone?) . The choices feel important, stilted maybe, but important nonetheless. Cons: The graphics were not stellar, they are very well used and the game looks and feels good, but the modeling itself seemed a little simplistic. Despite claiming to react to your play style and choices, I would describe Walking Dead as a game with a simple branching plot (at least thus far). However even if it is a &apos;con&apos; it is a huge step forward from the typical point and click adventure.<br><br>The first episode took around 3 hours to complete.

I love TV series about Walking Dead and  they are announced the game about it i was surprised cause their prev. games was not so cool. But quality and game style, relationships between the characters and interactivity make a great game about survival-emotional story of ppl against zombies</span>
