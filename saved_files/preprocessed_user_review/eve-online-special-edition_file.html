It provides everything I want in an MMO. 1.Hard learning curve, so that basically means the chances of meeting douche little ten year-olds is rare. 2.Instant gratification doesn&apos;t exist. no everyday noob can have a bad-ass capital ship ship given to them. type of ship reflects experience of the pilot well. 3.Loads of different career paths. You can be a multi-Millionaire industrialist, 0.0 sec pirate, Bounty hunter, miner, the list goes on. 4.Player driven economy. When i say player driven I aint kidding, NPCs don&apos;t take part of the trading system AT ALL. 5.PvP. If you like pvp this game is your holy grail. whether your a pirate or bounty hunter, theres no greater feeling than sitting in a low sec area waiting for an unlucky sucker to warp in and have their ass jammed and blown to kingdom-kom. 6. Lots of motivation. their are always bigger and better ships out there you&apos;re just dying to get. 7. Repetitiveness doesn&apos;t exist. Every enemy you face, whether it be player or NPC, will be outfitted differently to take you out. 8.Consequences. If your the kinda guy who wants to screw with people and keep killing them over and over expect them to get back at you in the future because they&apos;ll gather a fleet up, have an agent locate where you are, set an ambush for you, and kill your ass. It&apos;s that simple. Yes the game is not new user friendly, it takes a long time to get used to, and if you have the attention span of a gnat this is NOT the game for you. Once again don&apos;t expect instant gratification, it takes months to train in the stuff you want to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=747468">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;ll likely be taken in for at least a year if you are anything like me. But underneath it all EVE is actually a pretty poor vehicle covered in shiny paint. What you most likely won&apos;t realise for some time is the level of permanence individual events have. Make bad choices early on in your skill training and you&apos;ll be screwed for some time if not permanently. Want to pilot one of the best ships in the game? Setup your skill queue and you&apos;ll be up and running in about 365 days.... and a few thousand dollars of real money. Sure you can earn the money in game if you like. Hopefully you are also the sort of person that likes Farmville, or repetitive tasks like sorting 1000 kilograms of peanuts and into 5 different grades... if that sounds boring to you I encourage you to try EVE&apos;s ice mining and compare the difference. Everything EVE appears to be in the first six months gives way to what EVE actually is. Not a sandbox, not the messiah, and a fairly average space shooter, with some decent game economics. If you&apos;re the sort of person who might rupture a blood vessel should you lose a ship that took you about 90 days of game time to pay for in one 2 minute session where you lag out and DC, don&apos;t play this game. If you&apos;re the sort of person who thinks star wars x-wing/tie fighter when you think space combat do not play this game. If you&apos;re the sort of person who has any degree of trust in people you&apos;ve never met, well play the game, but prepare to be ripped off and blasted into shrapnel with great frequency. It&apos;s EVE the sandbox! and just below the surface it&apos;s full of turds.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1372280">Expand</a></span>

<br>This happens because every single skill in the game is limited by real world time spent in the skill... You can&apos;t simply hack more, or mine more , or spend a vacation doing stuff to increase statistics... If you want to fully experience all this game have to offer, you must pay and wait... for years, even, depending on what you are trying to achieve... This makes the game become old kind of quickly... And you feel kind of shut-off from many game features, for a long time (unless you resort to buying a character from other player)...
<br>This also means, that you don&apos;t have a rewarding experience exploring alternative character development... If you do a wrong decision, your character will be marked by that decision, and you will have to spend months trying to correct that... Or wait for another couple years to develop a better character... Another time, pay-to-wait.
<br>Yes, I agree, some people will find this a kind of a feature, and not an issue. That is why this game have good reviews as well... But I simply can&apos;t keep paying a game, and keep waiting, for years just to be able to experiment a game feature that was just there all the time...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4807840">Expand</a></span>

By that I mean people are constantly everywhere and the limits are too overwhelming.  Each zone has way too many people.  Admittedly the game is mathematically huge, but for PvP it is much too easy.  PvP is so overwhelming in the game it should be renamed to Grieve or GriEVE online.  The only thing you can expect to do in the personal goals department is build up your skills, which takes time, and there are smart ways to do it for good balance and have fun along the way unlike some of the misinformed negative reviews, and possibly your I.S.K. balance which newbs pronounce isk as if it is a word not an anagram for Inter-Stellar Kredits.  Aside from that is is the experience of people interactions, which if you don&apos;t join as a huge guild like I did into the Goonswarm alliance, you are likely going to be backstabbed and not have much fun.  In my opinion this game is much to oriented towards grieving players and it is supported too much.  That is the community you are likely joining if you play.  It is for some people and not for all.  Good luck in your decision.

I like winner-takes all competition. Back in the day I competed for the top ranking in the Warcraft PVP when it was so insane that you had to practically have no life to succeed. Therefore, I thought I&apos;d be the perfect guy for the EVE Online Universe. I was wrong. I appreciate EVE&apos;s freedom and brutal sandbox gameplay with a free market economy, but it&apos;s ruined by two things.
<br>
<br>First, the gameplay itself is awful. Did you enjoy figuring out how to beat that well-designed impossibly hard boss in another MMO? No such thing in EVE. If you can&apos;t find another player or group of players to have an epic battle with, you&apos;re just floating around in dead space with nothing to do. There is never any guarantee that there will be some reasonable challenge in the EVE universe for you to jump into. Since the game is driven by players only, there will be many nights where you log in and there&apos;s absolutely nothing. Some people would put me down as an instant-gratification type for saying this. I always want there to be good challenging content in a game which was put there by the developer. I don&apos;t know why EVE can&apos;t have the best of both worlds.
<br>
<br>The second issue is that the free market is sort of ruined by the fact that players can buy their way to the top with real world currency. This isn&apos;t necessarily a problem on its own, but when the game touts itself on its realistic economic principles, it sort of dampens the experience when an economic genius gets taken out by Captain Credit Card who never put any time or effort into earning his way.
<br>
<br>At the end of the day, they can add as much of this sort of content as they want with these numerous expansions, but until they make the combat interesting and give players more to do than float around in the huge scary emptiness of space, it&apos;s never going to be a game I&apos;ll want to play again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3218614">Expand</a></span>

<br>1: Trust no one.  What is your friend today can be your enemy tomorrow.
<br>2: if you like to be surrounded by a holes feel free to join.
<br>3: if your looking for all the good stuff, its always in low sec.  Never high sec.
<br>4: Expect to take up to a full 90 days to train out one specific skill set.  When you need at least 4 major skills.
<br>a) Mission running skills  because you have to do mission to get money just to start.  Join a corp, you get plenty of money if they give it to you but your skills are so low in the beginning, your just a flee to swat.  Trust me, your rookie ship will not put dent into anybody playing less then a month.
<br>b) ship skills  mainly battleships if you plan to makes money from mission running.
<br>c) industrial skills is a must when players are over charging for everything.  1 billion isk for 1 round of small ammo that is only worth 1.50 isk per round.  Scam #1
<br>d) mining skills if you are tired of paying the outrageous prices on the market.  Mine it and manufacture it.  Problem, all the high sec roid belts are usually wiped clean before you even have a chance to login to go mining.
<br>5. Getting skills takes way too long.  Some skills costing you upwards of 30 days for lvl 5, which is your entire one month subscription. Great skill but too long of a wait. Capital ships try 6 months.  Do you really want to wait 6 freaking months just to jump into a capital ship.  I don&apos;t.
<br>6. Older players like to hassle the newb and noobs all days just to mess your game up while learning.  If the older player loses a ship and get there standing smack down, its no true lost to them.  Frankly, I hope they keep it up so eve be put out of business one day. No new players  no new subscriptions  no new revenue   out of business.
<br>7, The ships itself is nice but they are too specific.  Transport ships, I want to drop 8 small guns with hvy armor tank and pvp mid slots.  But nooo.  Pirate players can&apos;t kill you.  I believe in China&apos;s law,  China does not tolerate Pirates in Chinese waters. BANG!!! (WITH A 50 CAL) good bye.
<br>8. I hope you like getting screwed in this game and I hope the pirate players get hacked and watch their real life money get wiped out and their entire account never existed.  That would be great.  See how funny it really is when pirates is on the receiving end of their BS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3441493">Expand</a></span>

Totally disgusted with WoW kind of games&quot;. After a bit of youtube watching I decided to try out this beautiful looking, breathtaking and very brain-promising space simulation ready to buy subscription.
<br>------
<br>After installation which also runs on MAC, I proceeded to character creation. &quot;Very detailed, very easy to use&quot; thought I with joy, taking care and time to perfection my in game myself. I can even get scarfs, even change lighting. What a beginning.
<br>------
<br>I read with interest information about the in game factions and carefully chose my bloodline. Ready.
<br>------
<br>&quot;I wish you see this. I am in a vast, huge futuristic station. It&apos;s far bigger anything you&apos;ve ever seen. Tutorial asks me to undock. Click. Now, I am actually flying in the space! I can zoom out and in totally, looking in every detail of my little ship. Or is it capsule? It&apos;s like an egg. Let me think why would it be shaped that way. Aerodynamics. Look at all these buttons around. I am sure all mean something and I am sure everything is there for a reason. Oh wait. I am flying.. ou, just straight towards a huge planet. It must be it&apos;s gravity pulling me down. Oh no, no.. how do I stop it? Oh... well.... I just flew trough planet.&quot;
<br>------
<br>My simulation expecations were shattered. My hopes for learning about science were shattered. My illusions for exploring and knowing the Universe were shattered.
<br>------
<br>Being let down, kept playing. My impression is going to improve. I learn a bits from tutorial. About ship equipment, wait, it reminds me a little bit of Wow gear or all other games, no, just coinsidance. About combat - you actually lock target and then press buttons and shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot. No, only coinsidance this game is about much more than that. It&apos;s not like the others. This game is made out of real players. Not any Npcs. Does it say agent? What does it do when I accept this mission? Oh. I have to fly somewhere, kill something and bring something back. No.. it&apos;s... did I use word coinsidance?
<br>------
<br>Ehm... I do like 25th tutorial missions. I kind of stopped reading it. Only clicking accept, then wrap to (it&apos;s flying around 5 light years in a second) then take or kill and then come back, then complete mission. No, surely NPC is not going to tell me how amazing I am whatsoever, or that I did something noone has done before.
<br>------
<br>Well.. it&apos;s like my 30hour of gameplay maybe and I... I feel like quitting. Or should I play another 1000 hours (people in Eve spent even 10.000 hours of pure gameplay) just to earn trillion or gear up or kill another player? Oh right, the original system such as this has its cost. You know, let me evaluate. In there, you have gun level 1. When you want gun level 2, you need money. To earn money you besically need to study a book. Wide one. When you get your gun level 2, you can kill player with gun level 1. Target him and ratatatatatatata shoot shoot shoot. And he actually detonates. I am not kidding.
<br>------
<br>Today, right decision was made. Low security part of the Universe, that was my brave destination. With warm and eager heart I set my autopilot and watched all these wallpapers on the screen that look like stars and planets. I might put one on my desktop. Finally arriving. Ratatatatatatatata bum. I am webbed I cannot escape. I scream out for my life for the pirates to let me be. They do not listen. They charge. After amazing and memorable 2seconds fight I explode. Still in my capsule. Bum bum bum, my capsule explodes and with last swearing I end up my final breath, my body falls upon indifferentness of the Universe. This is the end.
<br>------
<br>All of a sudden, i wake up in new, identical body. With all money, maybe even all skills having all ships I had in the dock. End of my story. Epic story. I heard EVE are submitting user stories? Will you help me to send them this one?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3966311">Expand</a></span>

I remember my time spent in EVE fondly, but starting a new character proved too unrewarding. While the game was a lot of fun being in 0.0 security space and not worrying about the in-game police, I realized that on this new character, I would have to wait several months to be able to reach the level I had previously attained. Even if I had billions of ISK to spend, I literally had to wait months while my character sat still in a space station, and the skillpoints clicked away while I was logged out, so that I could fly the ships that would actually do anything in 0.0 space. The game can be fun, but the skill system kills it for me now by serving as an insurmountable barrier to keep characters from having access to certain game mechanics. It would be different if I could actively do something to make the wait shorter, like levelling through combat or what have you, but skill training is the only way. It works out that through your early subscription months, you are paying a set fee to unlock skills very slowly, no matter how good you are, no matter how much money you have. The game is very fun once you truly have the freedom to do what you want, but getting there takes months of shelling out money for the subscription and waiting while a timer tells you when those skills are ready.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=740958">Expand</a></span>

The game looks nice, but game progress way to slow to keep me interested. to be honest after a couple of weeks I already got so bored with it that i stoped playing. I agree with the reviewer that mentions it not a real MMO. It is mostly npc misions and not much interaction with other players. The pont here is not if you can aford to pay it every month, the point is that it is not worth it. All those people here that rates it with 10 receive probably in-game bonusus for writing the 10 star reviews.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=738383">Expand</a></span>

<br>Dont beleave me  Just check the game forums, there is a plenty of discussion about it.
<br>The game is full of bugs, and to talk with the support, you need to open an &quot;petition&quot; and wait at least 15 days to get an generic awnser.
<br>You will need to install 50 Gb of game data and, every day install patchs of bug correction, patchs that will fix some bugs but will create new bugs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3239130">Expand</a></span>

You can only run so many before you fall asleep in your chair! Learning to fly the ship takes time....real time. Learning to PVP take lots of money and some one to teach you or LOTS of patience and LOTS of time. Even with all that time and training for PVP getting &quot;blob&apos;d&quot; will be the norm and all the training and biggest or fastest ship you will loose. I have been playing for 5 years and its a love hate relationship...I love to hate it! If you want to play for enjoyment....join a corp! This is not a game for  the &quot;Loan Ranger&quot;.

It is one of only a few monthly sub MMO&apos;s left on the market. It has an ever expanding playerbase that now exceeds 500,000 players. It is unforgiving and brutal and has a massive learning curve. It has a UI that would make a genius cry.
<br>
<br>There is no set way to play EVE. It rewards create thinking. It encourages ponzi schemes, AWOXing, market PvP, and scamming. The only time you are truly safe is when you are docked up in a station. Your spaceships are merely consumables. You will die and your spaceships will explode. Earn enough ingame money (ISK) and you can buy 30 day extensions to your account. Or join a player corporation, work your way up the ranks, and then steal all their money and ships.
<br>
<br>EVE Online is not a kids game and you will find few 10 year old kids with enough patience to continue playing EVE. There is no &quot;I win&quot; button. Having the biggest spaceship does not make you more powerful. It will make you an easy target for smaller, far more agile ships.
<br>
<br>There is no other MMO on the market like EVE. It stands alone as one of the deepest, most rewarding MMO&apos;s experiences released to date. Whole communities of EVE players generate daily content within and outside of the game. It is the ultimate sandbox.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=3247609">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are superb, the feeling of the vastness of space is well captured, ships, combat, equipment and technology is realistic, and your character development is quite diverse and well done. It&apos;s the other players you are forced to deal with that utterly ruin this game and make it unplayable.That is of course, unless you&apos;re a sadistic psychopath that actually likes harming people, if that&apos;s the case, this is the game for you.
<br>
<br>Take everything you know about ganking, griefing, trolling, scamming, sociopathy, fraud, and the darkness of the human heart and forget it, any time spent in EVE will teach you a horrific new level of sickness that you had never thought possible in your wildest nightmares. You WILL encounter class 1 **** EVERYWHERE in the game wether, they&apos;re cheating you out of your goods and money in the markets or waiting to shoot you in the back as your defenseless shuttle arrives at the next warp gate, be prepared to deal with people empowered by the anonymity of the internet and a company that actually encourages bad behavior in their players.
<br>
<br>The real life equivalent of this game would be stuck in a rush hour traffic jam surrounded by teenagers, all driving ridiculously loud, tricked out rice burners and blasting God awful music at physically harmful volume levels. All. The. Time.
<br>
<br>Again, a great game ruined by the human garbage that play it. And that&apos;s a shame.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4095522">Expand</a></span>

This is not a cookie-cutter MMO in any sense, in that it is constantly evolving and there is no one way to make money, or do anything else for that matter. With Apocrypha, money making is incredibly simple and anyone who gives the game more than a passing glance can see that. The game itself is not without it&apos;s flaws however, but that is not to say they are game-breaking.... Anyways, bottom line, Eve is a great experience if you are willing to invest time and patience into an MMO that requires learning, and not just grinding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=732143">Expand</a></span>

It doesn&apos;t tell you where to look it just says find it. I searched the whole star system. This game is a joke and really bad game play. I rate it a 1 because it does have nice graphics. I would tell people not to play this game!</span>

It is a pity, as I really like games like X.  The first thing that happened with this game was it shut down my computer due to overheating the cpu (no other games do this and the housing/fans are not dirty). This was resolved by turning due the graphics settings-- which I don&apos;t mind, but no other game I&apos;ve ever owned has to overheat the cpu to figure this out.  WTF?!?  Anyway, so then I get into the game.  Most of the controls are okay, but the text is irritatingly small until the resolution is turned down.  Trying to figure out where you are going in the tutorials is easy once you know what you are looking for, but the tutorials don&apos;t inform you of that kind of stuff.  The game is not particularly complex in most respects, but has such awful navigation that what could be straight-forward becomes a pain in the @ss-- hence the steep learning curve.  Steep learning curve is fine for the right reason, but this is the wrong reason.  Example: I was unable to complete the mining tutorial.  Something must have gone wrong, but how to resolve it is not clear.  The agent continued to demand I complete the mission.  I had the appropriate amount of material mined from the correct location, but it wouldn&apos;t let me complete the mission.  I moved the materials around, and even got 3x the amount required so I could have some in my items and my cargo hold.  Nothing worked.  Finally I looked up the tutorial online-- and everything appeared exactly the same (correct amount in hold), and the game accepted that guy&apos;s mission completion.  Again, wtf.  The problem is, if this was a singular incident, it would be okay, but the other missions had analogously stupid impediments.  Fail.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=2220480">Expand</a></span>

One you get your head down and really get into the game the universe is your oyster and anything is possible. One of my favourite things about EVE Online is the way a new player can still have a MASSIVE effect on a battle and no 2 ships you meet will be the same, even if they look the same you can guarantee that one will have fitted out their ship one way, and the next another. So, unlike WoW and WAR you don&apos;t have the repetition of &quot;Oh look it&apos;s another one of those, I know exactly what to do&quot; be that run or fight. In EVE Online little ship piloted by a 3 day old player can still severly annoy and disrupt an enemy vessel, holding on to them while backup arrives. Sure mining and mission running are boring, but they are the premium way to make a good buck in EVE Online, if you decide to go for the more fun option of &apos;ratting&apos; (basically npc farming) you could get an amazing drop that goes for 60million on the market, or something worthless, and it&apos;s hit and miss with PvP too, depending on how your opponents fit their ship, but the guarantee is you&apos;ll have fun doing it. Eve Online provides so many possibilities and so much character/ship customisation that you always have a chance in a battle and, with a lot of work you can make a lot of money. But be warned, nothing comes easy or without a price in EVE Online.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=745034">Expand</a></span>

But I have yet to run into the average annoying WoW esk player when playing eve.</span>

They&apos;ll scan you down in your rat plex and an interceptor will pin you to an asteroid while a sniper fleet riddles you with holes. And then they&apos;ll go home. This game is exactly as boring as the person who plays it. It will harden you up, and you will thank it for it later. I&apos;d have given it a ten, but honestly that bit with Z axis being &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; really irritates me, and 9.5 wasn&apos;t an option. And yes.

Unlike World of Warcraft, whose end-game focuses on grinding for gear that will be obsolete in a few months, progress in EVE actually matters from one patch to the next. The tradeoff is a steep learning curve and slower progress, but in my opinion it&apos;s worth it. Unlike PVP in other MMOs, battles come down to more than who has the better gear, or bigger ship. Most of the ships in the game are viable in PVP, which is nice, since it lets you fly pretty much whatever you want. Another great aspect of the game is the sheer volume of options. You can be a miner, an industrialist, a business executive, an entrepreneur, a pirate, a mercenary, and you can switch between them more or less at will. I suppose the biggest drawback to the game is the pace. You can only learn skills, which affect how well you use equipment, etc., at a set rate, which continues even when logged out. However, I find this makes the pace of the game much more relaxed than in other &quot;grind grind grind&quot; MMOs. Oh, another great incentive for progressing in the game is that, when you start making enough in-game money you can buy game time with the in-game currency. Or, if you want to be able to make a big purchase right away, you can sell game-time for in-game money in the game itself, which means you don&apos;t have to deal with shady gold farmers. Overall, I&apos;d say that EVE takes much more patience than other MMOs, and isn&apos;t for everyone, but is much more rewarding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=746358">Expand</a></span>

Just be warned Like RL if you get your stuff blown up You better have insured it. Granted that this game does have a steep learning curve and may be a little slow starting for some players, but if you stick with it and build a friend base your actions can effect the game community more then you think. I have been playing this game for 5 years and Im still learning new skills, Their is no &quot;lvl Cap&quot; like other MMO games. CCP tries to keep the farmers at bay and recently purged alot of Farming accounts to better the player experience. By best suggestion is if you are not a patient person not bother.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=741327">Expand</a></span>

One of the things that makes it so good is how well it mimics real life when it comes to player interaction, in EVE people don&apos;t have to be nice....they can be downright evil and EVE is a better game for it, annoy someone, blow their ship up (or heaven forbid pod them - muahahaha) or tell them their mother resembles something you stepped in and they might well harbour a desire to spread your atoms across a star system and in EVE there are very few places you can be totally safe.....you think you&apos;re untouchable in high security systems with the space filth keeping a careful eye out? think again! annoy someone enough and you might have a war declaration on your hands and if that happens you are safe.....nowhere! There&apos;s so much do in EVE it would take too long to type but worthy of mention is the real time skill learning, no more &apos;grinding&apos; as in most mmo&apos;s, having to shoot arrows at a rat for hours to get your archery skill up, in EVE you simply select a skill and it has a certain amount of time to learn whether you&apos;re logged in or not, this is great as you play because you want to have fun, not because you need to grind up a level and for those of us who have jobs, a partner, a family.....you can play eve a few hours a week and rest easy knowing that you&apos;re still getting more skilled all the time. Eve.....there is nothing else like it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=740710">Expand</a></span>

Money is simple to get, skills keep going whether your online or not and when you accomplish goals in the game you really had to work for it to achieve it. As you spend more time in the game and begin to become more skilled it starts to take quite a while to complete skills and therefore becomes even more rewarding. The &quot;learning curve&quot; people constantly whine about isn&apos;t hard at all the turorials are more than enough to get you started if people actually took the time to read them. Plus there are plenty of sites out there that are dedicated to Eve that are actually very helpful if your not quite sure where to begin with skills. Even though patience is key for many parts of the game theres never a moment where your just sitting there staring at your skills waiting for them to upgrade, your always doing something to keep you busy. Also all the exspansions are free and theres a system in the game that can potentially allow you to play for free if you make enough extra in game cash to purchase the time, honestly theres to many good things that out weigh anything you may not care for in the game.

Despite what some have said EVE is not a complex game to understand, it&apos;s mostly easy to grasp the ship to ship combat, electronic warfare, industry, mining or the many other areas aspects of the game, it&apos;s a very detailed and well thought out game environment.

With in its unreasonable space battles, no real control over your ship, and no way to counter measure real game pirates at early levels. EVE is for the unsophisticated PVP player or hacker that scams you for your in game money, allows you to be robbed by bogus contracts or for GM&apos;s to accuse players and strip them of there money. in addition allows real game pirates and war declarations to be held openly in neutral territories to prey on ships and warp out when there pathetic version of police arrive. Worst of all is the learning curve for this game. It takes about 6months to a year to actually learn this game and have enough skill to make this game enjoyable.
<br>Go ahead try the 14 day trial and see for your self, it will be 14day terribly spent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4281597">Expand</a></span>

There is almost no player to player interaction, and even then its for higher powered people. The trailer for the supposed &quot;Butterfly effect&quot; is non existent in reality, you barely interact with online players, unless you&apos;re talking about npcs of course, then thats a slightly different story. Also this game is one of the only games that actually rewards you for not playing, and you know why? ITS SO YOU DON&apos;T TAKE UP THEIR SERVER SPACE, your wasting you&apos;re money if you don&apos;t play the game and you bought it, and your wasting your time if you do play the game and you bought it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=741063">Expand</a></span>

Eve Online has spectacular looking graphics, with amazing looking planets, and metalic effects on the various spaceships and stations, but it is totally let down by the font size on the games User Interface when you play the game at high resolution on large screen size monitors. Coupled with this is the total indifference of the CCP dev team to this issue despite numerous complaints in the Eve Online forum. You can only enlarge the UI font to 12 points, which makes the lower case letters at 1920 x 1200 2mm high, and no more. If you have a 17 inch monitor you&apos;ll be fine at its default resolution of 1024 x 768, as the lower case letters are 3mm high, and the icons on the left of the screen ar a comfortable 10mm high, but if you have a now standard 24 inch monitor or larger at its default resolution of 1920 x 1200 or higher then your eyes will not be happy as you squint and try to read the tiny text on the UI when you are sat at a comfortable distance from the screen. The same effect is if you play at HD resolution or 1920 x 1080. Note: On 30 inch monitors at their default resolution of 2560 x 1600 it gets worse, as the lower case letters are now just 1 millimeter high, and the icons on the left of the UI are now a mere 5 millimeters high. You can have a comfortable text size that can be read at 1024 x 768, or you can play the game with HD graphics, but you cannot do both at the same time...yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=745932">Expand</a></span>

There are maybe 5-6 different mission types in the entire game, most of them being exactly the same. On top of that, it takes forever to get from one place to the next. There is very little to combat, literally lock on, orbit, and set your guns to auto-attack. Making ISK is a nightmare, either farm the horrible missions or worse do some mining. Mining is just like combat except the asteroids don&apos;t shoot back. The simplest and most efficient way to make ISK, and the way that most people I encountered in the game go about making it is to just buy it from the developer. Ya, that&apos;s right. So even if you spend months developing your skills, piling up ISK, and finally build a decent ship to PvP in, guess what? That guy that has been playing for years and buys ISK will swoop in and destroy MONTHS of your work in a few seconds.

It&apos;s super easy for a new player to get involved and be helpful even from day one! Love it. Also it doesn&apos;t take a lot of time to train since you train passively (ie you don&apos;t need to be logged in)</span>

If you lose your ship which is the only thing you can move around in the game you have to start a new character or buy in game gold form a site to get a new one. If your going to charge what blizzard does you might want to have the same level of content guess I have to wait for World of Starcraft for a space themed MMO that&apos;s half way decent.</span>

It is the most expansive and inclusive game I&apos;ve ever played. There is something for everybody. (except low IQ people who likes fast twitch games which require no brain power, if you like games like that go play sports...we all know how much fun those are.) For everyone else with brain cells, the game has everything you could want. If you want to destroy, be a pirate. IF yuo want create, be a industrialist. If you want to make money on what others have created, be a trader. The game truly is player controlled and the players honestly have a decent say on what comes in the next expansion. (which by the way are all free. unlike WoW...) While it is true the game takes a while to let you have the freedom to do all the things I&apos;ve mentioned, I believe learning the things it takes to do those things succesfully in the game is the most fun I&apos;ve ever had in a game. I wish I could go back to day one in the game in 2003 asking questions like &apos;can i ever fly a different ship&apos;. Learning the game is a good fun. But alas I can not give it a 10, because a steep learning curve is a drawback and it does take a while to get from one place to another. But after 6 years of playing I can say this is the greatest game I&apos;ve ever played. And I will play it till i die, or they say I can play it no more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=743180">Expand</a></span>

I love space operas, definitely. Vast space, the feeling of being a tiny spec in an endlessly large ocean. Industriously burrowing away at an asteroid for hours at a time while I read a book. Stacking up credits. Improving my lot one ore bit at a time.<br><br>EvE online appeals to all these sentiments. Space is compounded by achingly beautiful visuals and the well measured soundtrack bouncing through the halls of my ship.<br><br>Against other mmorpg&apos;s EvE stands well apart. There&apos;s no levelling arms race at play to motivate you, no endless level grinding to ruin your nights. Your motivation is primarily in how much of the universe you want to turn over. It&apos;s all under your own volition away from any peer pressure.<br><br>But EvE suffers in some development choices. Once you have created your character and jumped into the game you land ass first in a space ship in the middle of who-knows-where. &quot;What the hell is going on?&quot; and &quot;What am I doing here?&quot; are the first couple of questions to go through your head. You just automatically happen to be in a space ship from the off. Yes, this is exactly what I&apos;m playing this game for but there is no build up at all! It would have been simple to develop a story line over half an hour or so while the character finds his way to a ship and launches into space. All manner of back history could subtly and simply be woven into these first few minutes. Alas instead you are faced with a half hour tutorial that pretty much covers everything there is to do in the game, ever. I have thus far(this is my 5th odd return to the game) logged out twice during this particular stab at the tutorial and I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s all down to not having any emotional investment in my character or ship.<br><br>This build up would of course need a third person walk around section. Something that EvE lacks. All that time you spent creating your character and choosing nice clothes boil down to the thumbnail image attached to your ship. To create a physical presence and platform for the characters is absolutely necessary but likely to be part of a long development process.<br><br>Aside from that, I want to be able to land on planets. These beautiful orbs just hang in space enticing you towards them but on approach they are to be found totally void of function. You can&apos;t land, mine or colonise. What use is a space opera without a home world to counterpoint off? Aside from that and back to my first few points, EvE Online has captured the space odyssey feeling perfectly. It just has a few teething problems it needs to get out of the way before it&apos;s absolutely immersive. Perhaps by the time I return for the 8th time it will have these all sorted out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=1653632">Expand</a></span>

It has many ways to make money, such as resource gathering/processing, manufacturing ships/equipment, doing missions (solo and group), exploration, pirating/ransoming/extortion, and salvaging. It is very possible to do all the above with the same character. The game is a bit complicated for someone wanting to dive into it. The good news is that the complexity of it means less kids that are younger than 17, and those that are, are more mature than the average WoW hunter. Lastly, you don&apos;t lose things you can&apos;t just buy back when you die, unless you are careless. Skill points(sort of &apos;experience&apos;) accumulate whether you are logged in or not, and you don&apos;t lose them if you buy a good clone. Clones are not expensive. You might lose your battleship, but the mantra is &quot;don&apos;t fly what you can&apos;t afford to lose&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=731877">Expand</a></span>

Eve is to MMO&apos;s what No Holds Barred Poker is to gaming. It&apos;s a winner takes all game that is by it&apos;s very nature a difficult game to begin to master. Other MMO titles have audiences that expect to be returned quickly into combat even though they just died, giving them either a death penalty or making them run a marathon from a grave yard. Eve is unlike these titles containing the purest form of PvP experience, you die you loose your stuff; as in poker you do not bet unless you are sure the odds are good. With the Apocrypha update CCP have incorporated additional content that goes far beyond an expected, paid for boxed copy content update - WoW, Guild Wars, I look at you. In a FREE content update CCP have introduce 40% more real estate to the game in the form of Wormhole systems, where a new race (with new ships) have been introduced! Most importantly to new players the New Player Experience has been overhauled to something that now handholds new players through their character selection to their initial ventures out in the game world. New to Apocrypha are the Tech 3, modular ships (think killer lego space ships and you&apos;ll be somewhere close) that can only be created through Wormhole expeditions, which require groups of players to co-operate. For a flat $15 per month, with all content updates free (that&apos;s right, no additional pay to update content) you cannot go wrong, CCP amaze me with the depth of the game and the players amaze me with what they do in the open world gaming arena that is New Eden. Is Eve the perfect game? No, it has it&apos;s flaws such as the step initial learning curve, however if you like MMO your gaming to be of the serious no holds barred variety then this is a title you should try out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=732167">Expand</a></span>

This is not a game for little kids, or people without a modicum of patience. If you want a game that you can learn, and max out a character in a month or two, look to WoW, or any other cookie cutter MMORPG (LOTRO, etc) that displays zero thought or ingenuity in it&apos;s design. EVE is all about freedom. The company (CCP) actually endorses scamming other players as a legitimate money making occupation, something rare in MMORPG&apos;s. For those who state that the only reason to play this game is it&apos;s graphics, I would beg to differ, as EVE has been around since 2003, and only recently had its graphics engine completely overhauled to utilize DirectX 10. The engine before wasn&apos;t bad, but certainly didn&apos;t qualify as &quot;Eye Candy&quot;. The gameplay is certainly complex, but it&apos;s not unlearnable (if you make an effort). Skill training can be accomplished whether you&apos;re playing or not, which is nice if you won&apos;t be able to play for a while due to work or other life issues. Bottom line is this game is for those players who want something to that will challenge them for years, not weeks/months. I give it 9/10 simply because heck.. there&apos;s always room for improvement.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=735303">Expand</a></span>

All of the intricacies lead to a nearly overwhelming amount of frustration for new players, as they are unsurreptitiously dumped into an extremely hostile game environment and left to fend for themselves. There is, to it&apos;s credit, a rather rudementary introduction mission that walks each player through most of the basics of the game, and provides a decent starting ship. What most don&apos;t realize is exactly the level of hostility the game goes to. In EVE when your character is killed, you don&apos;t simply respawn. Quite the contrary as everything you had is permanently destroyed. Your ship and all its weapons, outfittings, and cargo are gone. To make matters even worse, if you don&apos;t have a good clone and your &apos;pod&apos; (IE your character) is detroyed in addition to your ship you can loose months or even years of skill training. A close example that many will be familiar with is if your 80th level character in WoW got killed in a raid and was dumped back at the starter grounds at first level with no equipment. This can happen. While the loss of skills are rare, the loss of ships are not. To combat these problems you must come up with low risk ways to make ISK, the games currency. The problem with that is that there are few ways to do it that doesn&apos;t take literally years to get access to or loads of time to accomplish. There are missions that you can do in Empire space that have a slow but steady payout. It would take approximatly 5-10 missions to get enough ISK to be able to buy a battleship and outfitt it. These missions can take 1-3 hours to complete. To compound the problem, it will take at least 3-6 months of training to be competent enough to complete these high payout missions without loosing your ships regularly. An often used alternative is mining. Which, really is perhaps the most boring thing available to do in any current MMO. You fly to an asteroid field, lock onto an asteroid, wait 3 minutes untill your cargo is full then fly back to a station, drop it off and repeat. Compounding the problems with mining is that you also have to refine it which takes skills and time to do right. Making matters worse, rarely is the best price for the minerals offered in the system in which you are mining, and you have to spend hours transporting it to get a good price. This leads to the most efficient way to get ISK. Which is simply to buy it. The buying of ISK is fully supported by the developers. You first by a time code for say one month of game time, then sell that time code to another player for ISK. While this is efficient, it can really up the cost required to get meaningful enjoyment out of EVE. Because sadly, it can be a very fun game, it just makes it way to hard to get the fun parts.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=731535">Expand</a></span>

You can choose to manufacture everything you need, or have others manufacture for you. You can join alliances, go into war, or go the carebear style and mine your way to the top! This game really is unique, and the best of all the MMO&apos;s I have played in like... forever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=733791">Expand</a></span>

Looking at the other comments I am not the average person who likes EVE. I am not big on corporations, gang activities or making new friends on-line - although I have enjoyed that side of EVE. I am a role-player, of the old-skool stay-in-character and get immersed in the world kind. The EVE sandbox and universe is flexible enough to make it possible for me to play EVE like a game, to be a character in a fictional world living a fictional life, having fun with the challenges and achievements provided by the EVE universe. It is a lot easier to be a roleplayer in EVE than in other MMORPGs I have played. Why? Because it is big enough and because you have the freedom to live your characters life without having to jump through mandated arbitrary hoops that would spoil the immersion Unfortunately, the RP side of the gime is let down by the fact that the majority of the players don&apos;t RP, so interacting with them in chat requires skill to maintain in-game enjoyment. This is a shame, no biggie though, there are RP corps in EVE, I have not found one that suited me, so I formed one myself. If I have a complaint about EVE it is that even though it is supposed to be a space game you have to make an effort to continually ignore the created environment, which is not very space like. It is more like underwater, the stars shimmer and twinkle and the sky is filled with in-your-face nebula and glowing things. Barely an inch of space is actually black. Also the interface is organized with a consistent up and down which really spoils things. This is a really big shame because the universe itself is true 3D, it seems that a simple toggle &quot;reduced nebula&quot; and &quot;free 3D camera mode&quot; would solve this issue completely. I am still playing EVE after 4 years and still enjoying it. I have nothing but respect for CCP for not straying from their goals in the design of EVE over the years. Keeping it sandbox and PVP and yet still making it more accessible to new players. I rate it 7. It has no competitors at the moment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=737282">Expand</a></span>

On the other hand, if you are an intelligent adult with patience who values the social side of MMOs highly you will not be dissapointed. Its is the marmite of MMOs. Many will not make it past the tutorial, but for those who persevere the rewards are huge. I have been playing for just under three years. I started with nothing, found some like minded people to fly with, learned to fight in an increasingly powerful set of ships and policed the pirates in a very dangerous area of low-security space to their near extinction. Soon we joined forces with similar groups of players and formed an alliance in order to conquer our own area of space. This grew to one of the largest groups of players ever seen in online gaming, with nearly 3000 members at its peak. We struggled with more established groups as part of an ongoing war between tens of thousands of players in deep space. No other game allows this kind of epic experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=737392">Expand</a></span>

Often there are jokes made by players that the game has a learning cliff, not a learning curve. I started out missioning and mining, and eventually just missioned primarily. The game can be highly entertaining, however for me, eventually the novelty wore off. Missioning became extremely repetitive as I was given the same missions over and over again. The game has no real direction as it is a true sandbox MMO. Outfitting your ship correctly is paramount as not doing so can result in the permanent loss of your ship. Theres a plethora of activities to participate in EvE such as mining, missioning, probing, and trading to name a few. However its common to see folks logging back on after being inactive for months or even years. I believe this is because once the novelty wears off the game becomes stale and boring. Id like to give it a better score as I did have some fun in EvE, but overall there was not enough there to keep me interested, despite EvE being a huge game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=738230">Expand</a></span>

Also missions, although they are slow, repetitive, and long, after about 20 you can buy a good ship! i would play this game more if it didn&apos;t cost 20 fricken dollars to play each months! that&apos;s really a major downfall of this game.</span>

I love the game&apos;s dynamics and completely emergent experience. The quality you will get out of this game is what you put into it. The first thing you should do is join a player corporation and find some people to play with. You need a headset/mic for this game because it is essential to communicate with your fellow players whether in the corp you are in or a fleet out flying around. I cannot believe the comment below from Hie H: &quot;There is almost no player to player interaction, and even then its for higher powered people.&quot; That is 100% on you, buddy. I have never interacted more with people online, or in any game really, as much as I do in Eve. Heck, even playing XBox Live I don&apos;t interact personally as much! The game is HARD. No doubt about that. But if you want a game that you should actually be proud to be good at, this is one of them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/eve-online-special-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=741617">Expand</a></span>
