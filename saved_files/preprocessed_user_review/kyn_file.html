<br>Graphics are cartoonish but they are fine, I did not find problems with fps.
<br>It has nice nordic-based storyline but I will never forgive them for not putting map of the city, I suck with coordination. Don&apos;t get me wrong, its not awesome game but its playable and I am having fun playing it, its worth a try.

<br>I did not like gameplay a lot, just not my thing, and it pisses me off coz camera is bound to the characters, I  would like it more if it had free camera as well as full pause not just timed slowdown. I like crafting system but I do not like character dev a lot, its fine, but could be done better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/kyn/user-reviews?user_review_id=5466879">Expand</a></span>
