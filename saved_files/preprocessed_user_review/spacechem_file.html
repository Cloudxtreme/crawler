But this one is the best puzzle game that I have ever played so far. The game is very challenging but yet very rewarding. The main concept of the game is to find solutions to generate certain chemical compounds from material compounds. For this purpose you have several operation commands. You combine these commands on the board to achieve the purpose, which is to generate certain chemical compounds. Once in a while you really need to be very innovative to find solutions. In some puzzles just finding out the solution to produce target compounds is not enough. In this case you need to find solutions to produce the compounds efficient and fast enough to achieve the goal. You really need to think about many perspectives of operations. Efficiency is one thing. Another important thing is stoichiometry. There are 12 challenges which demand you to find solutions under restrictive conditions. This is a very nice idea since it encourages you to find better solutions. It took me about 200 hrs to beat this game including the challenges. For me this is a good indication that this game is hard since It took me about 100 hrs to beat Puzzle Dimension, another challenging game, to score over 50000. The price is cheap ($9.99). You can get it either DRM free version from GOG.com or steam version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spacechem/user-reviews?user_review_id=2487861">Expand</a></span>

There are loads of puzzles to do so there&apos;s no shortage of content. However it&apos;s more a matter of how much you can stomach playing. All the puzzles require you to start from scratch without hints (after the tutorial maps) and get increasingly complex, with more gameplay components being added every few maps. I don&apos;t know if it gets added in a later level or not (I&apos;m about halfway through the third world now), but this game REALLY needs a hint system. The amount of complexity can be overwhelming and one mistimed reaction or misplaced pipe can lead to compounding failure and rage. Many times I have spent 30mins-1hr on a puzzle only to start over from scratch. I recommend this if you enjoy puzzle games, but prepared to visit youtube for solutions. A nice feature included is a built-in youtube recorder and uploader to show off your own solutions too so they are easy to find.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spacechem/user-reviews?user_review_id=2820503">Expand</a></span>

There is even a function to upload solutions to your youtube account.<br><br>The visuals are very basic, but there is a nice little sound track that does not necesarilly fit the theme but is enjoyable nonetheless. The biggest flaw I&apos;ve found so far is that there does not seem to be a button to reset an entire reactor&apos; at once. You need to manually click the undo-button until you reach the start position again. That is a bit of an oversight, but besides that, it is a very enjoyable game. 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spacechem/user-reviews?user_review_id=1491040">Expand</a></span>

Still play it today.  it&apos;s a fantastic puzzler with great mechanics and an addictive aspect of one-uping yourself and other engineers.  For the guy who &quot;looked at pictures&quot; and decided it sucked...  well, that&apos;s an obvious situation.  Worth it for full price, let alone included in a Humble Bundle.</span>

Any solution that works is valid; you are not held to contrived expectations.  However, the problems can be difficult on their own, given the tools you have available.  Steep learning curve, non-trivial puzzles, and a wonderful sense of accomplishment when you make it work.  The storyline is entertaining, and adds to the game.  My only complaint is the music.  While the soundtrack is excellent, it does not fit the mood of the game. Highly recommend this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spacechem/user-reviews?user_review_id=1615003">Expand</a></span>

There are no graphics to speak of, only a functional display of your &quot;program&quot; (the same level of clarity and, at the same time, lack of transparency as achieved by the roguelike games via the use of ASCII). There is no time limit, the only enemy is your brain... there is only the need to take two (or more) molecules and transmognify them into something else that is needed. While there are no &quot;correct&quot; answers, your alchemical Rube Goldberg machine will be compared to all the other solutions to a given level (the game even gives possibility of uploading solutions to youtube to boost your internet ego).<br>The learning curve is wonderfully crafted although the caveat is that it apparently does not end and will drive you, eventually, bonkers.<br>The core gameplay is brilliant and accompanied by truly fantastic music.<br>At higher levels it becomes devilishly difficult.<br>I love it.<br>Sidenote: Due to its open nature SpaceChem has quite an absurd replay value. Revisiting old designs to make them a few &apos;cycles&apos; faster or even spending time on youtube looking at crazy things that people have devised refuses to get old.

The mechanics are remarkably simple, allowing you to become familiar with the mechanics almost immediately. On the other hand, the difficulty ramps up deliciously fairly quickly after you get comfy with the mechanics. Unlike most other worthwhile puzzlers, solving each stage is an exercise in creation, and not just a glorified corridor with various dead ends along the way. This isn&apos;t a game where you simply poke and prod around the puzzle until you find the solution that the designer wanted you to find, you plan and create your solution yourself.<br><br>Play this game for a few minutes, and if you&apos;re the kind of person who loves a challenge, you&apos;ll be hooked.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spacechem/user-reviews?user_review_id=1689491">Expand</a></span>

The game introduces new concepts and increasing complexity smoothly enough to prevent being overwhelming, but quickly enough to maintain a solid challenge, rather than boring with many over-cautious repetitions of similar difficulty..  It&apos;s a fine balance that Zachtronics has hit very nicely.  Especially later in the game, the puzzles become positively mind-bending in the level of challenge, and the complexity that your solutions will inevitably incorporate.<br>The little, largely textual vignettes between missions is a nice bit of flavor, go a long way toward making the game feel more complete (than Zachtronics previous games, particularly).  They are well written and interesting, and are actually pretty effective at bringing you into the game world, which is pleasantly surprising for a game of this type.<br>The consistently added Science Net puzzles provide regular new challenges, often introducing new twists on the previously introduced puzzle elements, and the main game provides many, many hours challenging fun on it&apos;s own, so they plenty to hold interest for quite a while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spacechem/user-reviews?user_review_id=1777804">Expand</a></span>

Entering a DRM key with extremely tiny letters into a text field with no arrow key support (you can&apos;t go back and change a letter if you get one wrong, you have to delete everything and start over) is not a good way to start a fun game. Eventually I got it working, and I soon wished I hadn&apos;t. In a nutshell, this game is too simple in the action department, and too complex in the how-to-play department. I&apos;ll admit, I enjoy a good action game, but if a puzzler is done right, I can waste plenty of hours on it. This game, however, was just too boring. I didn&apos;t care who the hero was, I didn&apos;t care why he needed to move circles (molecules) around, the game just did not motivate me to move past the first few levels. Basically, if you like dragging and dropping shapes onto other shapes, you&apos;ll like this game. And if that&apos;s the case, there&apos;s a little game with differently shaped pegs that you have to put into similarly shaped holes that you might like too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spacechem/user-reviews?user_review_id=2083079">Expand</a></span>

Unlike many puzzle games, there are no pre-determined solutions, which I find appealing, but many others may find bewildering.  Also unlike many games, there is virtually no timing or reflex actions required, so you can take your time (and you&apos;ll need it) engineering clever solutions to the problems presented.<br><br>Graphics/story:  Nothing special, but they get the job done.  The storyline is depicted through periodic illustrations, and while it adds some subtext to the game, it&apos;s largely irrelevant to the actual gameplay.<br><br>Interface:  Very clean.  There isn&apos;t really anything on the screen that doesn&apos;t need to be there.  Much of the game revolves around placing symbols on a grid, which can be done via drag/drop or by holding hotkeys while clicking.  Every action you take has a satisfying click, and every level has infinite undoes/redoes (which remain even after quitting/restarting).<br><br>Music: This is a game in which you can spend hours staring in consternation at a grid full of symbols and little circles following a spaghetti-like tangle of lines in order to re-arrange atoms to form different molecules.  The soundtrack actually makes this activity feel heroic and exciting.  It is so successful, IMO, that I often found that an elusive solution would come to me only when the background music changed and I was inspired to consider a previously untried approach.<br><br>Re-playability: Most will never need to replay this game, because only about 2% are able to finish it.  And only 6 people (last I checked) have finished every one of the user submitted levels.  However, after solving a level, you&apos;re shown a graph which compares your solution (based on a few parameters) to all the other solutions that came before yours.  For some, just completing a level may be good enough, but many will see how they compare to others and be motivated to revisit and optimize their solutions.<br><br>SpaceChem certainly is not for everyone.  If you are easily frustrated, not interested in deliberative problem solving, or just not the sharpest knife in the drawer, avoid this game.  If you have ever enjoyed programming a computer, this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spacechem/user-reviews?user_review_id=2296465">Expand</a></span>

One issue with this game is that it doesn&apos;t teach or show you ways of helping you complete puzzles and that can make the game very unappealing if you are not into figuring out the basics on your own. I would have given this game a 10 if it just showed more basic ways of completing puzzles.</span>

Don&apos;t let the idea of chemistry fool you (since you don&apos;t need it), it could have been train tracks for all i care, it&apos;s the depth of creativity and ingenuity of your own mind what makes it so fun. If i may create a not so accurate comparison, i would recommend people that like minecraft because of the creation of redstone artifacts to try it out immediately, not because its similar or has the same elements.. but because it engages on that creativity that makes synapse juice flow... and some people really love that feeling! I promise you will eventually find that emotion if you stay past the first levels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spacechem/user-reviews?user_review_id=2315480">Expand</a></span>

With an interesting gameplay concept and solid puzzle difficulty this game satisfies. The tutorial doesn&apos;t prepare you very well for the game which can make the beginning levels frustrating but if you stick with it you will find game to highly enjoyable. The story is interesting if you choose to pay attention to it and the music is bearable as long as you don&apos;t play the game for too long at a time. I really enjoyed the fact the there are so many different solutions to each puzzle so you can do them the way you want to.

Sounds boring? It is not. In fact it is probably the best puzzle game I&apos;ve ever played. The game mechanics are absolutely flawless in my opinion, the puzzles can be solved in many different ways while they&apos;re still incredibly challenging at the same time. it is extremely satisfying to watch a clean reactor setup at work. Sometimes after I&apos;m done with a level I don&apos;t immediately use the fast forward function simply because it feels so good to just watch the waldos (containers you control that move atoms and molecules around) at work. I also think that this game would be worse with better graphics. Yes, now I said it. It is complicated enough as it is, flashy effects and colorful 3D objects moving around would be an annoying distraction and nothing else. If you like good puzzle games you just have to check it out. Now I understand why the creator of this game stopped working on Minecraft (which was his idea, he made Infiniminer) and worked on this game instead. Pure genius, this should have sold a few million times and not Minecraft. Highly recommended, don&apos;t get fooled by rather ugly screenshots or boring gameplay descriptions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spacechem/user-reviews?user_review_id=3198776">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The first time I got this game with the PCGamer/BundleStars giveaway (June 2014), I felt that this game was rubbish, the first time I looked at it. BUT this game proved me wrong, and I feel guilty for calling this game rubbish because it is not!
<br>
<br>BUT BE WARNED! Don&apos;t buy/get this game if you don&apos;t like Physics/Chemistry, or very challenging puzzles as the game does focus around atoms and the bonding of atoms and all the substances from the Periodic Table etc... so if you don&apos;t like those types of games that have science in it, don&apos;t buy this game. PLUS, the puzzles are quite challenging, each puzzle from where I am which is still in the tutorial stage (Surprisingly this game is really long) are quite challenging, the puzzle length (from my end) take around 15-20 minutes each, so they are quite challenging... So if you don&apos;t like challenging puzzles such as this game, don&apos;t buy it!
<br>
<br>The length... this game is REALLY long! REALLY REALLY long! Almost 44-55 hours to finish the game, as far as I know the first few planets are just some tutorial stages!!! Which comes to show how long this game and the dedication the people had in developing this game, which is great and shows in this game! Normally I don&apos;t play long games, but I am happy enough with this game, and I&apos;ll try and finish this game (maybe in 6 years time)
<br>
<br>Overall, this game is very different from your regular indie game, with Physics/Chemistry integration with its challenging puzzles and a nice and strange Sci-Fi story, this game is a TRUE indie gem, that should not be missed at all!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/spacechem/user-reviews?user_review_id=5338314">Expand</a></span>

<br>Can be frustrating to play, but only because it challenges the player.
<br>Very nice learning curve to start you off.
