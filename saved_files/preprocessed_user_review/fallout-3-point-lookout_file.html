Anyone who enjoyed Shivering Isle, will feel that this DLC is almost copy-and-paste version of Shivering Isle. The themes.. swampy green enviroment (rather than Wasteland feeling, this is Dementia.) Classic go-and-fetch quests, the tribal worshipping high-tech-comp. (this is where insane dremora god being worshipped by lot of insane folks.). There is no other energy weapons/power armor other than the microwave emitter. (which by the way is nothing but a copy of mesometron with different stats.) This is a good example of how a dev can recycle their previous content and sell it to the fan base. however, the main story was sorta fun. (but too short.) Explorable dungeons were above average. and thankfully the monsters/enemies were tough and added more challenge, which is why I give 7/10 instead of 5/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3-point-lookout/user-reviews?user_review_id=83427">Expand</a></span>

I only played Operation: Anchorage on the Xbox 360, so before people think that i&apos;m attempting to bring the rating up, I also have this for the pc, which is my preferred style of playing any game, period, just so as long as my pc can handle it. Anyhow, the missions themselves are wrestled uniquely, the main quest being somewhat indifferent from the environment, however, in a way throwing me back to the faction-based quests of Skyrim&apos;s civil war and so on. That particular quest confused me a bit, not by the narrative of the work, but of how a battle between two great minds were in the setting of redneck county and of the marshlands of Maryland. The experience is compelling nonetheless, seeing the beauty of the mechanics finally unfold, webbed with environments blooming with interaction and a sense of awe. The rednecks themselves are also interesting, but also quite disturbing too, having to fight the most downtrodden of the inbred, with a noticable hint of radiation trailing off their autonomy. Of all the DLC&apos;s I have played from FO3: Point Lookout, like New Vegas&apos; Mothership Zeta, will be one of the few that I will be willing to come back to play again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3-point-lookout/user-reviews?user_review_id=3715093">Expand</a></span>

But the main quest end, holy molly, I was promised to get some big reward, rite? And what was that reward? Mesmetron and few grenades? Are you kidding me? Mesmetron I can get at Paradise Falls for free, holy flip! So basically at the end of the main quest the reward is practically NOTHING! It was boring, I was happy like a little turtle when I leaved it and came back to DC, you know.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3-point-lookout/user-reviews?user_review_id=4488781">Expand</a></span>

Those that found the other DLC&apos;s too easy will be either  pleased or shocked (like myself) with the much higher scale in difficulty. Just like the other DLC&apos;s, the main campaign is short but there are side-quests and other ways to occupy yourself in Point Lookout. Characters are quirky and interesting, with a dangerous decision at the end of the campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/fallout-3-point-lookout/user-reviews?user_review_id=4982289">Expand</a></span>
