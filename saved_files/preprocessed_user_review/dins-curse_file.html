The combination of skill tree&apos;s to create unique classes is not new to the RPG/Action scene. It&apos;s quite the standard, Soldak entertainment understood this, their group could see what drives the hack n slash market. They&apos;ve put out two very enjoyable products in Din&apos;s Curse and Din&apos;s Curse Demon War. The gameplay is simplistic, it&apos;s not anything new. Animations are well done, given the built from scratch engine. The game will run on most systems, even older ones. Music is soft, it doesn&apos;t overshadow the worldly elements. The story is very simple and lacks any sort of development, but that&apos;s not a driving force and honestly shouldn&apos;t matter in this style of game. I&apos;m giving it a 7/10, I would recommend playing this one and the expansion. Check out Depth&apos;s of Peril too, solid games, by a intelligent gaming company.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dins-curse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1780302">Expand</a></span>

<br>In most games the monsters seem content to sit around in their caves, twiddling their thumbs (or other, more demonic, appendages) until some brave adventurer comes crashing in to ruin their day. In Din&apos;s Curse the dungeon FIGHTS BACK and if you&apos;re not careful the evil will come spilling out of the earth, murdering villagers and burning the town to the ground.

<br>Don&apos;t worry, if you fail, the god Din will give you another chance to prove yourself, in a brand new village, each time bringing a fresh new set of challenges and rewards.

For those familiar with diablo 2, this game&apos;s basics will come natural however, it is probably 5 times more intense in regards to what can happen and what you are up against. Every world is different and because of that, you will almost always be surprised. It&apos;s true that there really isnt much of a story, but i cant name an action/rpg that had a story. I would say that if you like a challenge, to give it a try as it will really test you. If you dont like fast paced games, then you probably shouldnt be reading this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dins-curse/user-reviews?user_review_id=1569295">Expand</a></span>

On the second city apparently I waited a few seconds too long, and by the time I got to the surface, almost everyone had died, including people I needed for quests. There is no restoring a previous game, so whatever spot I&apos;d got myself into was unrecoverable. I removed the game from my computer. There&apos;s nothing here that hasn&apos;t been done better and a long time ago.  Does it seem that there&apos;s an inverse correlation between License Key length and game quality?

There are similarities to other games as people have surely mentioned, but dins curse does its own thing with the randomly generated events (that often seem to come at the most inopportune moments) and thats about all it really has. I dont care that it is an indie game, it looks VERY bad (you do not score things based on indie/mainstream... its stupid to pretend indie is some excuse for a lack of quality) and has .. i dont even know that i would call it a bad plot since it is more just a series of objectives. &quot;Save the town&quot; is the plot? because it never evolves much beyond that.. Anyways, while the gameplay is &quot;ok&quot; i am more impressed that they managed to get it online so i can play with friends, seriously good job... unfortunately most of my friends got bored of it after 1 day, so yea i guess &quot;ok&quot; isnt good enough for some people. Overall if it didnt cost 30$ for a third rate game i would say &quot;yes! this is an 8!&quot; but game + pathetic expansion costing that much most people are going to feel ripped off, it just isnt really &quot;good&quot; in any areas, it is just mediocre. Side thought: if you have ANYTHING negative to say about a game at all it isnt a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dins-curse/user-reviews?user_review_id=2154314">Expand</a></span>
