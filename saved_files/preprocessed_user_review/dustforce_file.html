Do not be fooled, this game takes a serious amount of dedication, and I truly believe it is not for everyone.  However when you put the time in, prepare to be rewarded. The visuals are stunning, the animation and controls are flawless.  I found the game to be appealing to all the senses.  Its beautiful to look at and the music is unbelievably addictive.  At one point I actually didn&apos;t play the game and just listened to the tracks for a while.  The concept itself of dusting bears deserves credit.  Its so original and new, I don&apos;t think a game has ever been done like this before.  It gets compared to Super Meat Boy a lot, but I think this is on a totally different level.  SMB was frustratingly hard, where as Dustforce really guides you with subtle visual hints, not to mention an online review board where you can watch everyone&apos;s attempts.  This way you can easily see the best way to beat a level, but only if you want to.<br>The only thing I would have wanted different is how to unlock new levels.  I think there some game content I&apos;ll never unlock, because I don&apos;t have the pure dedication it requires to unlock everything.  It would be nice if there was a way to unlock everything so I can at least see them, like extra credit or something.<br>Overall, this is a wonderful game, polished to perfection, gorgeous and loads of fun.  I recommend this game to anyone, and for the price it just doesn&apos;t get much better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dustforce/user-reviews?user_review_id=2112645">Expand</a></span>

One&apos;s first thoughts are of Super Meat Boy with its narrow FOV and infinite, immediate resets that make it so achingly addictive. But upon some soul-searching reflection and more careful inspection of level pace and character movement, I feel this game is more accurately described as a deliciously modernized hybrid of N+ and Sonic from Genesis.

But I immediately felt like a broom wielding ninja. I can&apos;t abstain from this but I&apos;ll have to go head to head with Andromeda&apos;s review on this one, so here goes (be gentle my first review, that&apos;s how much I felt the need to defend this game):<br><br>- The controls are anything else, but &quot;not responsive&quot;. Everything you do seems in your hands to control.<br>- The game also includes time trials and style challenge which both rank for score on the leader boards.<br>- Replays can be saved and also if your confused, you can watch the highest rated player on the leader board&apos;s replay to see how he solves the level and try to mimic it, if the game is to hard on you.<br>- A map editor on the way, which will guarantee lots o content.<br>- King of the hill and Survival modes for local multiplayer. How awesome is that ?!<br><br>I came from work after a long stressful day at work, a fight with the girl friend and I can&apos;t remove myself from this game. I will immediately buy flowers tomorrow and I recommend this to any fan of this genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dustforce/user-reviews?user_review_id=2107408">Expand</a></span>

The game looks gorgeous and it plays so, the keyboard controls are better than the ones of SMB but as with it you are going to need a pad to get all the potential. The gameplay (and this is my opinion) is richer than SMB, here not only you have to reach the goal in the shortest time possible but also you have to clean all the &quot;dust&quot; from the level. Time is not important but the score is, you&apos;ll get double S if you clean all the level and you do not loose the combo. You&apos;ll loose the combo if you spend too much time between &quot;dust patches&quot; or if you are hit by the an enemy. At the end of the level you&apos;ll get the score and you&apos;re time and you&apos;ll be placed in the raking for that level. Note here one thing I loved and SMB did not have was the possibility of watching any replay from the ranking, so you can see what the best are doing and improve your score or time by doing so. When I said the gameplay is richer is because you do not only double jump, but dash and fight also you can walk over walls and roofs as long as there&apos;s dust to clean, this may require not only precision but different sets of movement for every challenge you encounter in a level. Talking about levels their design are really good and the difficulty is increasing. There are four different characters who perform slightly different one from the other (for example one is faster than the rest and can triple jump but it jumps less and it&apos;s reach with the weapon is shorter than the others) but you can complete all the levels I&apos;ve encountered so far (I may be near to half-completing the game) with all of them. The game runs really smooth with no drops at all and the style is colourful and clear. There&apos;s also a multiplayer but is local only, haven&apos;t tried it yet so I&apos;m not reviewing it. Also there as happened to SMB there will be a level editor soon. The controls are completely configurable and the only backside of the game is the complete lack of video options, there&apos;s no vsync, screensize or resolution options, so there&apos;s only 16:9 ratio and I think the vsync is active by default, about the resolution can&apos;t say much because my screen only gives 1280x720 (the game offers me this resolution) so I don&apos;t know if it gets better with a full hd monitor. But can&apos;t complain much for a game worth 15&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dustforce/user-reviews?user_review_id=2107456">Expand</a></span>

<br>First of all: I like the basic concept. I think the game mechanics are very well thought out. You have full control over the many ways to elegantly move around the character in the world. Sweeping, running up walls and ceilings, dashing, double jumping and hitting enemies  that&apos;s all great. <p></p>
<br>Probably the most important thing that kept me from continuing to play the game was the level design. The first levels are ok, but then it gets very difficult very quickly. And the levels are not difficult in a Super Meat Boy manner  they are just too long, not rewarding enough, and they just need too much skill that I was not able to acquire in the first levels. <p></p>
<br>Apart from that, music is really bad, and sound design is boring as well. In the intro video, there is no sound effects at all  seriously, guys! And the story  cleaning the world from dust  and the overall look are not appealing to me as well. And why is there no overview map for the levels?<p></p>
<br>I can imagine that people who get past the steep learning curve (or better call it learning step) really enjoy the great gameplay mechanics. I however did not, and so there is not much fun left for me..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dustforce/user-reviews?user_review_id=2942314">Expand</a></span>

Since I recently finished KOTOR (I know, I&apos;m a slow gamer), I got a Wiimote out, paired it with my computer, set the controls, and started playing.
<br>
<br>The mechanics of the game are very fun. I enjoy bouncing off the walls, running along the ceiling, and sweeping my way through the air. The visuals are pleasing and the music isn&apos;t annoying. Unfortunately, Hitbox messed up the stuff that makes me want to actually play it.
<br>
<br>The introductory video gives you the impression that four janitorial heroes with unique abilities will be battling the nefarious deeds of four filth-loving antagonists. Nothing of the sort. There is no story-based progression and the four characters differ only in their aesthetics. The only reason to play this game is for the challenge of completing everything. If you&apos;re into that sort of thing, great, but that&apos;s not for me.
<br>
<br>Now, I&apos;ve only sampled about five different levels, but so far, the level design does not make me crave more. For a game that stresses moving smoothly from one dust-covered surface to the next, the levels are decidedly blocky, angular, and sometimes non-linear. Classic Sonic the Hedgehog had better flow than these levels.
<br>
<br>I think I&apos;ve been spoiled by games like Braid, Cave Story, Limbo, Rochard, and even VVVVVV. I expect my platformers to have some story, by glob! Over all, I&apos;m disappointed in Dustforce.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dustforce/user-reviews?user_review_id=3245991">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is fun and fast paced. The music is some of the best you&apos;d hear in an indie title or in a title alone, the animation is staggering, and the re-playability is up there. Definitely one of the best indie titles of this year.</span>

And then when the difficulty went insane (like a mix of old NES Yo! Noid and modern times Super Meat Boy), man was I in ecstasy! This is probably the best indie I&apos;ve got in my Steam account (and I got about a hundred of them).</span>

How would I counter-argument that if not with &quot;it also gives back perfection&quot;? Who complains about the difficulty is right, but he also most likely hasn&apos;t played the game enough to build up the muscle-memory to actually enjoy it as it should be, or if not in the genre... well... while right, it&apos;s like buying something spice and complain that it is spicy. So perhaps a good thing for the game would be... write &quot;very hard and not for casual gamers&quot; on it? I can&apos;t see that happening and it probably never happened with any game ever except as a joke or as a very alternative approach. This game is awesome: it has theming, actual challenges with an integrated amazingly-working-fine-for-an-indie-game online scoreboards, gorgeous graphics both modern-fluid and retro, awesome calm music halfway between two of my favorite genres (ambient and chiptune) that will likely calm you down when getting frustrated for the levels (note, this effect wears out eventually! still great game though olololz), and  now also a good editor even though the last update made the Nexus a bit more boring and ugly than before, probably because the devs gave a shot to all those complaints about user-unfriendliness about the game. But hey, they left the original .exe of the game to play with the previous layout, what else could anyone ask for?! Yes. The game, if you want to play it fully, requires perfections. Get perfect then, dammit, or don&apos;t bother! If you are intelligent enough though you will probably appreciate even just part of it without ever finishing it.<br><br>A little, honest complain should be made though: the controls are also nearly perfect for what you are supposed to do in the levels, but for some reason switching directions feels a bit odd and goes wrong sometimes, but I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s intended or not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dustforce/user-reviews?user_review_id=2444075">Expand</a></span>

You play as one of four janitors with ninja-like skills, looking to rid the world of dirt and leaves. The difficulty lies not so much in finishing the levels, but in finishing with a perfect score of &quot;SS&quot; needed to unlock all of the next tier of levels. I really like the graphic style of this game, along with the fluid animations, which make pulling off a tough move all the more satisfying. The retro soundtrack is very well done. The online leader board gives you  reason to replay levels, even if you&apos;ve already completed them.  You can even view a replay of anybody on the leader board, which is a pretty awesome feature.   A lot of basic things such as the difference between the characters and the way the levels are scored aren&apos;t explained very well within the game. Unfortunately, I can&apos;t recommend this game to everybody, because the high difficulty level will frustrate many.  Most players will give up long before they reach the end.  If you&apos;re a hardcore platformer fan though, this game is a must buy, and even if you&apos;re not, there&apos;s still a lot of fun to be had here.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dustforce/user-reviews?user_review_id=2688843">Expand</a></span>

People compare this to super meat boy, but I think this is much better of a game. It seems much more polished, and has a much better flow. If you like platformers (ones such as N ninja and super meat boy) this game is a must. By the way, you don&apos;t need a controller/pad to play this game. Many people do, many people don&apos;t. I personally enjoy using the Logitech G13 to play this game, but that&apos;s not much different from a keyboard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dustforce/user-reviews?user_review_id=3346894">Expand</a></span>

Maybe the learning curve it&apos;s a little too steep, the game became very difficult quite fast. But the real problem with this game are the controls, if you expect perfection in a game then you must give me perfect controls, having the character not do what you wanted him to happens a little too frequently. That, and the lack of boss, in the intro you see monster that totally looks like bosses so I was a little disappointed to find out that they were only multiplayer characters. Despite that, the game it&apos;s very enjoyable, even the level selecting rooms are maps that require you a little of effort to find and reach the more difficult levels (but once you have &quot;unlocked&quot; every level you can conveniently access them through some books that enlist them), and the art too it&apos;s very nice, totally recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dustforce/user-reviews?user_review_id=3463754">Expand</a></span>

It has instant replays, a level editor, various single/multiplayer modes and more perfectly designed levels than anyone has time to complete. Also, there are no loading times. It is difficult, but it has a nice difficulty curve (fans of Super Meat Boy should have no problem with it) and completing a run with an double-S rank is VERY rewarding. I have never encountered a bug or any characteristic in Dustforce that could be considered a flaw. Buy this game, you won&apos;t regret it.
<br>
<br>NOTE: On release, the PS3 port of this game was flawed. If you have a PS3 and you want to play Dustforce, don&apos;t. The PC version is the definitive version.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dustforce/user-reviews?user_review_id=3952117">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is well made, polished to a gleam, and is challenging.  If you like to just press buttons and get to the end of a level and then go to the next one then this game may seem frustrating- as it really doesn&apos;t care if you finished a level. It cares HOW you finished a level.  You have to glide, fly, and sweep your way to the finish in style.  Completing a level is like executing a perfect dance routine.  One slip up and you&apos;ll find yourself restarting in an attempt to get that perfect score.
<br>
<br>The game is smooth, has great flow, and I couldn&apos;t finish it.  This game is great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dustforce/user-reviews?user_review_id=4756793">Expand</a></span>

They say never judge a book by it&apos;s cover. Well, never judge a video game by it&apos;s screenshots. For this game appeared to have it all, but managed to fall short. Let me start out by saying that I loved the art style though, along with the soundtrack. In fact, the soundtrack is probably the best part about &apos;Dustforce&apos; and is exactly what you want in a platformer. As for the controls, they are nowhere near as bad as some of the people on here make them out to be, and personally I found them to be quite good. The only thing that stinks is how they make you assign the controller buttons yourself, as opposed to just having them preset for you. I wouldn&apos;t even dream of using a keyboard to play this game.
<br>
<br>As you may already know, this game was made with speedrunning in mind. Speedrunning is something I enjoy watching, but not performing, and had I known that beforehand, I would have skipped this game entirely. I mean, who makes a game specifically tailored for speedruns? Getting to the end of a level as quickly as possible? Where&apos;s the fun in that? No, I like to take my time, look around, really take in my surroundings. And besides, isn&apos;t the whole fun in speedrunning, coming up with the fastest method on your own? It just doesn&apos;t make much sense if you ask me. Aside from that, there&apos;s pretty much nothing else to do in this game but run from door to door playing level after level for the best time. No bosses, no enemies, just jumping from one platform to another, climbing wall after wall, sweeping up that dirty dust.
<br>
<br>There just doesn&apos;t feel like much of a reason to continue playing &apos;Dustforce&apos; after an hour or two, unless you care about posting the highest scores for all to see. Which is basically where 99% of the incentive to continue playing comes from; the highest possible score. On the other hand, I can definitely see how people enjoy playing this game. Like I said, the soundtrack is great, the art style although simplistic, works quite well, and the controls are pretty good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dustforce/user-reviews?user_review_id=4920737">Expand</a></span>

But honestly, the only platformer I&apos;ve wanted to play in the past 10 years that wasn&apos;t a sonic game is Dustforce. I saw this game and was charmed by the eerie soundtrack, the clean and efficient visual style, the atmospheric feel to everything, it felt like a ride to watch and enjoy.
<br>
<br>And when I started playing it, I felt like my impressions were extremely right.
<br>
<br>Dustforce has great artistic qualities, watching a video of it on Youtube for 10 minutes should tell you that immediately.
<br>
<br>And it&apos;s also blessed with excellent controls in almost every way: movement feels fluid and precise, and the fact that slopes and gravity are huge factors for speed give it a great feel. It&apos;s a wonderful speedrunning game and it&apos;s a pleasant time both for casual play and challenge runs. Reaching SS rank in every level is usually pretty easy at first, but then bronze levels open, silver levels open, gold levels...and the difficulty unfolds slowly and nicely, it gets very challenging but remains fun. I&apos;m a pretty poor player, yet I enjoy challenging the speed and execution of every Dustforce level. Every mechanic works well and with mastery it all feels like a flow, like jumping, double jumping, reaching the wall and going up, brooming some dust to gain momentum, going up, jumping off, dashing in midair, brooming one, two, three enemies, reaching the wall, it all feels like good execution calls good execution to keep your speed going, and it&apos;s a feeling that I usually only get in Sonic games, and I find Dustforce to be a masterpiece at it.
<br>
<br>I do have one minor complaint, it&apos;s that the controls might be slightly unclear. I&apos;m over 10 hours in, and I still have to fully understand which direction I&apos;m supposed to hold to accelerate on a downward slope, right or down. Sometimes everything rolls just how I want and sometimes I just fall like a bird crap to my death, and I&apos;d really like to know why or how. The levels are usually short so replayability is extremely high, but on longer levels, failing consistently at one part and needing to redo an entire 2:30 mins level is very disappointing. I just assume that I&apos;m just a bad player, but still, I&apos;d like some precisions somewhere.
<br>
<br>Nonetheless if you&apos;re interested in an atmospheric, simple, precise, immersive, and ultimately very challenging, all-about-skill speed platformer, I strongly recommend Dustforce. And its OST on the side, too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dustforce/user-reviews?user_review_id=6939858">Expand</a></span>
