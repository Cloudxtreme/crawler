<br>It&apos;s a 2D horror game with some interesting story. I don&apos;t want to spoiler much, but basically you&apos;re in a forest where a plague spread and turning people into monsters, and you have to get out. The map is randomly generated, but you&apos;ll always find the same locations around. You have to survive the days and nights through all means to solve the mystery and to get out of the woods. There are a few &quot;quests&quot; you can do to get some equipments or just to progress in the story, but not many. I found the game pretty scary especially at nights since you just see nothing without a light source, but the lights would just give you away so you have to rely on your hearings. The game can be really hard if you&apos;re not careful and prepared for the nights. This game is already interesting in it&apos;s alpha release, and it&apos;ll be just better when it&apos;s finished.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darkwood/user-reviews?user_review_id=5213392">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is simple, yet very very intense. You might think you can&apos;t get scared because it&apos;s top down, or a graphical style which you can&apos;t get familiar with. HOWEVER, playing it with one life only, is super intense. If you like psychological horror, don&apos;t even think about it, just do yourself a favour and play it.
<br>
<br>And just in case any of the devs read this review: You guys are amazing and i look forward to see what else you are developing next!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darkwood/user-reviews?user_review_id=7494473">Expand</a></span>

You can barely see where you&apos;re going, making it easy to accidentally walk over poisoned mushrooms. And when that happens, you usually end up dying within the next 30 seconds or so. In other words, you start again.
<br>There&apos;s a map but it doesn&apos;t show where you are on it, and since the area is just trees and shrubbery everywhere that all look the same, it works out to being pretty useless except as a rough guide.
<br>Let&apos;s see... I think my hideout was twenty steps in that direction..? No that&apos;s not it. Just some dogs about to kill me. Oh hey I&apos;m dead. Yay. Start again.
<br>
<br>I suppose this is all another attempt to make the game &apos;scarier&apos;, but for me just added to the growing nuisance-list. Not to mention, when you die, you have to go back and fetch your stuff again from the place where you died.
<br>
<br>The developer&apos;s need to understand that making a game &apos;harder&apos; does not automatically make it more scarier or enjoyable. Especially when you increase the difficulty of tedious activities like running around the map trying to find your equipment. If I were involved in a fight that required timing and skills with the keys (melee by the way is out of the question for the main character), then sure that could be a bit more fun, but just making the player run around more often, trying not get killed by dogs or step on mushrooms in the process. Not so much.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m only up to Day 4 or something, so hey, maybe the game will take a surprise turn. Though I can&apos;t see that happening. Depending on how desensitised you are to the simple chills of generic survival-horror games, you may get a few jolts. But &apos;Amnesia: The Dark Descent&apos;, this is not.
<br>
<br>Bottomline: It&apos;s good for passing the time while you&apos;re waiting for your movie to finish downloading.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/darkwood/user-reviews?user_review_id=5043053">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Darkwood is a game that questions yourself why are you actually playing this. If you really look into some horror then it deserves it. Because the nights are really stressfull.I mean really..... what is a video game about? Because this game is not fun. The days are a collecting grindfest, but the nights....the nights are just pure stress man.</span>
