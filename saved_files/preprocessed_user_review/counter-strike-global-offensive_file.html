<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>1) Nice graphical tweaks to old and tired maps give the game a fresh feel.
<br>2) A nice jump in and play system which makes it easy to get a server without the hassle of having to find one.
<br>3) 2 new game modes off the bat, &quot;Arms Race&quot; is a simple gun game type scenario where as you kill, you get a new weapon, this is using a deathmatch system as well, so you will instantly respawn. &quot;Demolition&quot; changes this by setting out guns you unlock by killing enemies with your current weapon, and you can get bonus grenades by performing well in the round.  Both new games are fun, and I have spent most of my time in GO playing them!
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>1) Locked down netcode! - Anyone who has played CS of any type in the past will have tweaked the netcode to suit their specific connection/computer/taste.  Valve has locked the netcode down so much in GO that you cannot really fine tune your system. This is a big no no to me!
<br>2) Lack of maps - This may be something that will be addressed in the future through patches, but its the same old maps, and not many of them. You have Italy, Dust 1 &amp; 2, Aztec, Office, Nuke &amp; Train.  In standard game play scenarios you will get bored of these pretty quickly! That said, the new game play modes have added rehashed versions of old maps (i.e a short version of train), but to me it feels like there isn&apos;t enough content on launch to keep the audience entertained.
<br>3) Ever changing models - As an old player of source, I got used to the colours of CT = blue, Terror = red (or brown!). However, with CS:GO each map changes the models, which isn&apos;t so bad in itself, however on some maps the models are so close in colour, you cannot tell them apart from any reasonable distance, which leaves me hovering over a player to ascertain whether they are on my own side or not....very frustrating!!
<br>4) The cross-hair - I like the old cross-hair, however I tried to use it and it seemed useless, so I now have to use the abomination that is the &quot;new&quot; cross-hair.  You cannot change its colour (as far as I can tell) and it takes up so much room on the screen when your running around, its just annoying!  It does seem to recognize friendlies, so that&apos;s why I&apos;m using it.  Overall, very poor!
<br>5) Clunky movement, and shocking physics - CSS may not have been the best 1st person shooter ever, but it felt fluid and smooth, however you come across GO and it seems very clunky, the players all run like they have a stick up their backsides and the physics are 10 years old (cannot shoot barrels now apparently!!).
<br>
<br>That all said, the game is certainly entertaining. Better than CSS? No, but its certainly enjoyable, and with a few tweaks of the engine, some new content I&apos;m sure it will be here to stay.
<br>
<br>For the &#xA3;12 I spent, I don&apos;t regret it, but if you are happy in CSS now, I would see the need to rush over immediately.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2614399">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only reason this game receives a 9.5 and not a 10 from me (rounded up on the metacritic scale) is because they released it too early with too many little features that make CS so loveable omitted. (tagging, flashlight, silencer etc)
<br>
<br>After 300 hours of this (including beta), CS:GO has still not lost its charm on me. Weather I feel like playing GunGame, pubbing, some obscure mod, or playing competitively, this game always has something for you to do.
<br>
<br>This game offers a really awesome competitive matchmaking system. You will sometimes get matched with baddies, but other than that, its a really cool way to introduce people to the competitive side of CS. It generally works well and it is primarily what I play. It is also nice to not have to pay for ESEA if you want to play semi-competitively. Once you increase your rank a bit, you will often be matched with like-minded people who want to win and will carry out strategies and be generally vocal in-game.
<br>
<br>Mind the hate this game receives from 1.6 and Source players who can&apos;t fathom moving onto a new game. They have some sort of hard-on for disliking CS:GO without any legitimate reasoning to back it up. It&apos;s a great game and I would highly recommend it for both casual and competitive players.

Then we always have to remake and this happens all the time. CS1.6 is still better than GO atm, but GO is definitely a step up from Source. Valve has a long way to go if they want to make it a classic because this game still feels like a beta.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2578860">Expand</a></span>

Hopefully with this release there will be a larger community than there already is for Counter-Strike. I&apos;m not sure if it is similar to 1.6 as I have never played it. Anyways, great game and it&apos;s only $15.</span>

                                        <span>I love this game! never played CS games before but CS-GO is the game i was waiting for. For 10$ i can only recommend it. Great positive is. You dont need high end machine to play it. Even old ati 3850 with 256mb of memory can handle this game on full hd with decent framerate.</span>

Global Offensive brings a range of new features that makes the game easier for those who want to learn how to play, the new &apos;Weapons Course&apos; mode will help newbies get the hang of the very basics of the game while new modes such as &apos;Arms Race&apos; and &apos;Demolition&apos; is targeted towards the more casual player. For anyone who is yet to play, this game is not your generic shooter and practice is a must! One of the huge disappointments to CSS and 1.6 is the fact that you had to use an external website to have a competitive match, this is not the case with GO as Valve has implemented a new 5v5 competitive mode which allows more experienced players to enjoy the Counter Strike series as they know it. Graphically the game has taken a huge overhaul and now looks better than ever with new lighting effects, an intuitive new buy menu and a hud that is more efficiant than any of the previous games. However in comparison to other modern shooters, the graphics are not perfect but who has ever played CS for its graphics?
<br>
<br>The movement speed is different to previous games and will take a little bit of time to get used to as well as the new hitboxes which I used to disagree with but after many patches in the beta, Valve have constantly tweaked the game to what the community want to see. Your old favorite weapons are still there including the AK, M4A4 (don&apos;t worry its pretty much the M4A1) and the AWP as well as new weapons such as the Nova, Tec-9 and Molotov/ Incidinary grenade all feel at home and take little time to get used to. As usual, the map design is incredible and it is a pleasure to see your old favourites re-designed to suit the game. Barely any important locations have changed but Valve are still able to give them all a new fresh feel. The new maps that are featured in Arms Race and Demolition are not my scene but suit the style of game mode that they are for. During the beta there were invisible walls above the maps which prevented players from using the old nade spots however I believe that Valve has now patched this.
<br>
<br>The game servers are solid and over the 100+ hours that I have already played, I have disconnected very little and to be fair it was probably my fault not theirs. The only critisism I have is that I have seen no evidence of servers matching your skill level with others, this creates a problem when professionals with plenty of hours of play are joined with a team of beginers who think it is a great idea to join a &apos;Competitive&apos; game. This causes a lot of rage quiters and when you end up playing a full game, you will notice your team emptying for a few rounds before others join. Valve has left the game highly moddable for the community to create their own servers and game modes if they so please and I look forward to seeing what modders can do with the game. Zombies is already confirmed as a mod for the game. Overall the game is awesome and I know that I will play 1000+ hours for the next few years. It is definately still a Counter Strike game and anyone that is a little sceptical is either a 1.6 player who refuses to change the way they play or you need to give it a little more time. And for $15 how can anyone go wrong?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2574970">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The weapon changes I don&apos;t think where needed, but it&apos;s ok. And makes for a new set of things to figure out and test. Lots of the old players don&apos;t like change it&apos;s as simple as that, instead of seeing it as a challenge.
<br>
<br>The graphics COULD be better, but again its $15 and they targets multiple platforms and markets, they want the game to play for everyone and thats what it does, everyone in CS world wants huge amounts of FPS, so they get it with a bit less detail here and there. The main thing lacking I would say is tessellation or parallax mapping. Apart from that it&apos;s a much nicer looking game over CSS.
<br>
<br>$15! its a steal for such fun multiplayer action, now with more game modes added in and maps.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2574470">Expand</a></span>

Finally, a game kills hours, the FPS simplest but most entertaining I&apos;ve ever seen, at a very affordable price.

En mi opinion el mejor motor grafico de todos, a pesar de tener sus a&#xF1;os, si fisica es la mejor.  Graficos: No es un Cod pero un gamer no aprecia su juego por este punto.  Sonido: exelente pues gracias al Source engine 2012  Innovaci&#xF3;n: Como trato de seguir la misma linea que los anteriores, no trae muchas cosas nuevas, hasta ahora, algunas armas y mapas. Pero esto con las futuras actualizaciones ya se ver&#xE1;!

If you don&apos;t like Counter-Strike, GET OUT. The three negative reviews expected something other than Counter-Strike. I could never get into Counter-Strike because of how you are either a total noob at the bottom of the scoreboards or a pro who can kill the entire team in 5 seconds. And it takes hundreds of hours of boredom to get good. In CSGO, that all changes. I&apos;m actually having fun. The graphics are the best Valve has done, the UI is very clean, and the new voice acting is actually pretty good.  The recoil and hit detection changed, and now instead of dying as soon as I see an enemy I actually use cover, throw grenades, and more. It&apos;s a much more active game.  The new maps are the best ever made in Counter-Strike. They are very vertical, which encourages flanking, tactics, risk vs reward, and more. The Arsenal Demolition mode is possibly the best idea ever for a game. The inexperienced have a chance of fighting back against pros, because AK47s and P90s deals more damage than a P2000. The pros feel a sense of accomplishment and play just to see how far they can go. I don&apos;t care much for the gungame (A CS original, CoD stole it), but it&apos;s rather well done. The new weapons and balancing really make the 12 year old game feel brand new. I didn&apos;t care much for the casual mode, as it is only very small changes. And, IT&apos;S $15. IT&apos;S 1/4 OF THE PRICE OF A NEW CALL OF DUTY GAME, AND IT OFFERS SOMETHING THEY DON&apos;T HAVE (GOOD CORE GAMEPLAY). If you want Counter-Strike, don&apos;t hesitate to buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2574540">Expand</a></span>

Sure some backend stuff may have changed but to me as a player, it feels the same. This leaves the game in an awkward sort of limbo between old and new with fancy graphics that, if anything, make the outdated gameplay stand out more than ever. This may be hard to picture, so I will liken it to this: imagine your dad rocking up to your birthday party, dressed like all your friends. The cover can only last so long which is, in this case, until the moment after you buy the game and play your first match.
<br>
<br>If you really love CS, but for some reason cannot play CS:S without improved graphics, get this. If you are new to the series, don&apos;t buy it or you will just end up feeling lost, hurt and confused like that first girl at the party to approach your dad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2574249">Expand</a></span>

Casual games are usually filled with 2 or 3 players who are insanely good and the rest are just canon fodder.  No real way to compete with the best players.  Lacks any kind of single player element or even objective goals.  Sure there are hostages to rescue and bombs to plant but no one ever does that.  Also spawn camping in Arms Race is too easy and the regular modes are one death and game over per round.  Pretty boring.  Waste of 15 bucks IMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2578473">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are worse because they added way too much bloom and fog and all that crap that makes you see less and you cant turn it off. The game is cheaper then CS: Source because it is worse then CS: Source. If you already have source you are basically throwing 15$/10</span>

The art style is a mix of Counterstrike Source and maybe TF2, not sure but it strikes me odd and doesn&apos;t look good at all. Also, adding bloom to everything does not equate to better graphics. Simply replacing textures in Counterstrike Source with high-res ones will make an older game look better than this one.
<br>
<br>Onto gameplay, very bad. Hit detection is bad, gun balance is not there, hitboxes seem to not work often enough. The radial buy menu is horrid for quick navigation and a total time waster. I played on low-ping servers but have to say this game took the lessons learned from Counterstrike Source then threw them away and done enough things different for only the sake of change. The maps are proof of this, they are either the same but with bloom added to hurt your eyes or they are worse with little changes meant to spice things up but actually tone things down.
<br>
<br>Many people who never played CS 1.6 or CS:S before will probably find this game alright at $15, I find it a waste of $15. Put the money to something better, catch BF3 on sale at $30 and you will get much much more. This game is shaping up to be a failure and echoes of the beta show a team that only patches the game for sake of keeping up appearances.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2600416">Expand</a></span>

The lack of tagging/flinching makes newbie/casual players unable to out smart a professional gamer with perfect aim. This results in a game where aim &gt; placement, position, and strategy.
<br>
<br>The competitive side. The game sound is impossible to pinpoint exact player location. The lack of tagging and flinching. The money reward is messed up. $900 per p90/shotgun kill. Only receiving $50 for awp kills.
<br>
<br>Overall a lot of the community was ignored on the forum. They pushed a game out that wasn&apos;t complete. A huge disappointment for a 1.6 player. The game is still definitely an improvement over source.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2574268">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s no point in having the body, because they&apos;ve made it so that body shots are basically like a gentle tickle.  Giving an advantage for headshots is to be expected -- but the gap shouldn&apos;t be this big.  3)  Hit reg.  It&apos;s terrible.  Obvious hits will do zero damage at times.  I&apos;ll probably keep playing for a bit, but I don&apos;t see long term viability here.  The things I listed above are just way too annoying for me to enjoy this for too long.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2574480">Expand</a></span>

I have played shooters for decades now among which also were CS 1.6 and CSS, so I have a big basis for comparison.
<br>CS:GO isn&apos;t perfect at all. It has one of the worst matchmaking systems I have ever seen with a skill discrepancy that is absolutely stupid some times. I myself got Master Guardian Elite after 10 ranked games or so (and many many people calling me a smurf even though I am not even good) and even there, people play absolutely horrible sometimes and somtimes they carry your sorry ass. The skill range goes from people who seriously don&apos;t know that planting a bomb on a secured spot is a good thing to people that ace 2-4 times in a game.  I literally had dudes my rank scoring 2 kills the entire game while the first one had almost 40. Its almost never a close game but a stomp in one direction. CS:GO even 3 years after release still has a lot of major bugs like your mouse dissapearing, your game just turning black, not responding, kicking you out of queue for no reason, hovering 15 meters in the air after spawn, I had them all. But ok that just happens, I can live with that. What I can&apos;t accept though is the incredibly weak anticheat and the fact that CS:GO basically offers almost nothing new. Its just CS, again. And what they added, they haven&apos;t even come up with themselves sometimes. Gungame and deathmatch were mods  in CS before they were implemented officially as a &quot;feature&quot;, and even then they didn&apos;t really add anything like sensible spawnpoints, as in every other shooter there is.
<br>The gameplay is as static as ever so if you are a person who likes movement based games where you have to aim while going fast, flying through the air, then this is not for you. The majority of the game consists of camping and watching one spot for what feels an eternity until finally you either rotate or someone sticks their head out.
<br>The competitive aspect of it is still fun, especially if you play with friends, but that doesn&apos;t excuse it from being a mediocre package and that most of the &quot;features&quot; added are things that should be there in the first place. I expect more from the richest gaming company in the world, that only releases 1 game every 3-4 for years.
<br>The community in CS:GO is the worst community I have ever witnessed. It amazes me. I played CSS where people liked to be generally toxic too but CS:GO tops it up a notch. Every single ranked game that you will not stomp (and even then) there will be one guy flaming the entire team, leaving or trolling or saying racist remarks (like **** Russians&quot; , &quot;Germans are always like blabla&quot;). But I won&apos;t take this into account for the rating as every popular game that is competitive attracts aggressive teenage douchebags. I am just warning whoever might wanna play this game what he is up to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=5468061">Expand</a></span>

Despite appearing as a nice visual update, the game actually has very unsound gameplay mechanics that don&apos;t do justice to the CS name. However much I periodically enjoy the strategy elements, the occasionally well-made maps, the new and useful additions like a sawed off shotgun, molotov  decoy grenades etc. I am always brought back to the fundamentally flawed gameplay that, for concision, just doesn&apos;t feel right. The original CS was a fun game that you could relax to while playing-- whereas GO is a fundamentally quicker game, the players accelerate faster and the gunplay is faster, requiring an almost spastic degree of reflex to remain in the game. Headshots are more prevalent than in the original and can be quite random; you will often get headshot by players who are simply spraying their gun at you rather than carefully aiming.
<br>
<br>On the plus side, it&apos;s quite possible to see the game as having a bright future, but thus far the developers have shown themselves to be alarmingly complacent about the game&apos;s core inadequacies</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=3160239">Expand</a></span>

You will meet people in the game that are mean, and some that are really nice. As for the Competitive Ban, if you lose connection from the internet or you just have a bad computer, there should be a system that can tell weather or not you are leaving the game intentionally. There also needs to be a better Anti-Cheat system, because I will occasionally play with a hacker. I do like the system for banning the Hackers, &quot;Overwatch&quot; because it gives the people who are moderately good and better a chance to help the community by submitting the forum that they are or are not hacking. I am also not the best player out there. In conclusion I would say that CS: GO is worth $15, but some thing can be improved</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=4920641">Expand</a></span>

Had to buy a 2nd Copy since i got banned for no Reason by Overwatch. But the Game only gets it&apos;s Players because of the fcking Crates and Skins. And the fgt eSport People. Kinda sad.</span>

I don&apos;t even know where to start with the amount of problems that exist in it. The hit detection is an absolute joke which for decent competitive players is totally unacceptable. The skill curve in comparison to past counter strikes is far lower. I constantly see people running sideways, backwards and forwards while shooting and hitting heads whereas people that sit still and shoot in bursts or tap with their rifles hit 1/3 of their shots. As if that wasn&apos;t bad enough but no there&apos;s more.. The game is filled with cheaters that plague even the highest ranks of the game. Valve seems happy to allow the game to continually go on sale so that more scumbags can buy new accounts and almost get the game for free because of how ridiculously cheap it already is anyway. People seem to just be allowed to stack accounts to cheat on and get away with it for months at a time before valve actually bans them. They seem to have introduced this overwatch system which quite frankly is totally useless because it gives the people on overwatch almost ZERO responsibility in the end outcome as to whether a person gets banned or not. The guns are totally flawed as well. More often than not I see succesful eco rounds because of how easy it is to wreck someone at mid-close range with a pistol vs rifle. I cannot emphasize enough, please do not buy this game. It quite literally is the biggest disgrace of any fps let alone steam game to have ever been released. I&apos;ve played several hundred hours of it and just about every concept of the game I am disappointed with.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=5042651">Expand</a></span>

New buying menu isn&apos;t very comfortable. Gameplay hasn&apos;t changed since CS 1.6, what is a downside. Because if i want to play CS 1.6 with better graphics, i better play CS 1.6, and won&apos;t lost my 15 bux for the remake. if you guys think, it&apos;s an excellent  successor to CS: S, you&apos;re wrong, because sequel must has something new. CS: GO, unfortunately hasn&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2616121">Expand</a></span>

Competitive mode is so nice... if u abandon 4 matches in less than a week, you get banned for 1 week. Best Counter Strike ever for only $15.

<br>I had to change my score from 10 to 1... All because of the developers... When you concentrate on making money, and can&apos;t invest enough in fighting cheaters, it just makes it pointless for people to waste so much time on the product.... Why I have to pay monthly at site like faceit, to have a better quality server and better quality cheat-protection? This is not a mmorpg... But the devs don&apos;t care, VAC is **** many sites offer hacks to be bought that can&apos;t be caught by VAC....
<br>So thank you valve, for letting down one of your greatest games!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2872678">Expand</a></span>

<br>One of the first FPS&apos;s to capture a great competitive edge brought to millions of people is back, 12 years later in Counter Strike Global Offensive. The game sadly is almost a 15$ texture pack. But there are new features. There is a new grenade, and, that&apos;s about it i think. This game somehow broke the record for least accomplished in a game in gaming history. This brings less to the table then the new CoD games.
<br>
<br>But there are many positives, which outweigh the negatives a ton. The new game reunites all my friends and lets me find games with people that aren&apos;t 100% CS pros. It is more casual, but it isn&apos;t too casual, you will still get your ass whopped if you are new to the franchise. It is one of the best looking valve games ever also. If you look at it like a 15$ reskin then this game could be crowned as one of the worst games released this year. But if you look at it as a Community get together with some good gameplay and graphics, then you will enjoy this game for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2574312">Expand</a></span>

If you are comparing this game to Call of Duty, i suggest you leave because the games are nothing alike. Counter Strike Global Offensive is a new and improved version of the classic competitive FPS, and valve knows its only a facelift which is why they only charge 14.99 for it. Which is not what i can say for Call of Duty, the 3-4 games with a different campaign, yet they charge 59.99? If you are a old CS player, having the original, 1.6 and source, then get this game, if you are a first timer to CS, give it a try. Its a blend of how competitive FPS should be like and the nostalgic feeling of an original game from the past. Oh guess what, the updates are free. And there are going to be alot of maps and modes coming out not to mention mods from the community.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2723568">Expand</a></span>

Mainly because the game is very slow paced and favors 2 tactics: mobbing and camping down a thin avenue of approach.  This combined with bullet spray mechanic when moving makes aggression a weak and stupid tactic.  I don&apos;t like playing this style game, but gave it a chance when valve released cs:s.  Again, the same, but bullet spray and poor hit detection seemed amplified and I gave it up fairly quickly.  Now we have CS:GO.  To begin, the game is gorgeous and has more infrastructure to it than any CS before.  It DOES have matchmaking which is annoying, but there is also the option to play dedicated so who cares?  The bullet spray is either tighter or the netcode better, I dunno which.  Overall it&apos;s still the same gameplay.  The purchase interface is wanky, but most players will bind the relevant options and never use it anyway.  If you love CS of any flavor, there is no reason you won&apos;t like this one.  On the other hand, if you think CS gameplay is stale and want to see it mixed up so that aggression and and precision are rewarded rather than penalized, look elsewhere.  This is classic CS with a beautiful engine on top.  I think the game is a 4 gameplay wise, but I give it a 7 as most people reading this are probably CS players, and I think it&apos;s an accurate representation of what a CS player would award this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2576037">Expand</a></span>

CS is arguably one of the best skill-based games in the history of videogames and changing the formula would only hurt it. Thanks for the gfx update, Valve!

Valve and Hidden Path have been very busy listening to the professionals&apos; feedback whom would like to move on and learn the mistakes that were in the previous games, and using that to improve upon Global Offensive. Besides that, the gameplay is still very challenging for being so balanced, I love some of the new balance that they&apos;ve added to the game so far (like the different money-reward system for killing with different guns), but if you don&apos;t think about it too much, it is also pretty fun to play because there is casual mode and weapon course for the new folks. Valve and Hidden Path will still be making tons of upcoming updates to this game and this game continues to have a GREATER community just like we&apos;ve had in 1.6 and Source.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2574786">Expand</a></span>

<br>Gameplay: Familiar but never old, I thought it was worth bringing back the oldies. This game in itself does require more skill to actually use  weapons (which some players often complain about for iconic weapons) but I like how they made an attempt to refresh everything and then provide some new default modes and the ability for community game modes as well.
<br>Replay-ability: Much like the predecessors, it provides a good length of fun team based game play and a competitive challenge in comparison to FPS shooters like Call of Duty (which is prey, spray, run around, heal, killstreak reward, kill without skill, repeat). In Counter Strike, you HAVE to put effort in killing even a single player, not too much, but a good amount for the average player and more to take down the more experienced players. This is also worth it&apos;s money because would you rather pay about $50 for a game that really doesn&apos;t make any true attempt to add anything or $15 for a game that may be small, but is even considerably replayable? This game may not be a huge step up from its preceding titles, but it certainly expands on them, even by a little bit. It uses an old engine but the engine is fairly adaptive and used differently for other games.
<br>Other personal opinions: It&apos;s sad to see that some people give some negative reviews of this game. If we compare both CS:S and CS:GO, you&apos;d more likely stick with GO than S because CS:S was a complete rehash of CS:1.6 with the simplification of using the weapons in game. You can spray players with little effort. In CS:GO it attempts to go back to its routes in order to make the game more competitive and not as simple as CS:S, recoil is higher and requires more control, but still slightly more tolerable than CS:1.6.
<br>Overall: I believe people should appreciate this game in the least. It tries to bring back good memories of how I used to play Counter Strike in my younger days. Maps are too small, but think about it, that&apos;s the principle of Counter Strike games, CQC and medium range engagements. Players would be better off using weapons up close but aren&apos;t limited to longer ranges when they&apos;ve mastered even the weakest of weapons. It is also more realistic that Call of Duty as hipfiring is inexplicably terrible if you just spray all rounds. In Call of Duty, whatever is in your crosshair will be hit and killed if they don&apos;t shoot back while in CS, you&apos;re going to miss after the first few shots unless you control your aim and fire. Give the game a try, and if you still don&apos;t love or like it, at least appreciate it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2826987">Expand</a></span>

The arms race gamemode is more fun than gungame from CS:S imho. The recoils are different and there are some new things like molotovs, which just spice up the game a little bit. In terms of graphics, this is pretty much as far as the source engine will go. Also don&apos;t listen to people complaining about hit registration. They&apos;re just used to the broken hit reg of CS 1.6. This is FIXED and you actually hit people when you&apos;re supposed to.

The good things are that the game looks great, feels great, and the weapons feel like they have a purpose. There feels to be a little more variety to this game than source, I felt that source ended up an ak/m4 war with the occasionally awp/scout. I feel like all of the guns are priced to the point that each gun has a purpose (besides maybe the pistols, why blow 400$ on a tiny upgrade in pistol when you could have grenades of all sorts). Besides the zues failing to show a purpose, it all feels right. The matchmaking works really well, and the serverbrowser is classic, they know to keep that the same. The cons arent enough to shy this game away from great but they are there. As with all counterstrike games, stratagy such as positioning and purchasing is almost always far less important than aim. Thats why there is a learning curve, most of the game is based on your ability to get that headshot. Dont get me wrong, this isnt the worst thing, because its much worse when its like CoD and all you have to do is use the same loadout.  At least it takes skill, but your fun time can get ruined by one guy having godlike aim, but I digress, it can happen in every game. Other Cons include, which I guess this one is more for console versions, the maps. Theres only about 10 for classic gamemodes (but servers are already up with user made maps) and 4 for the new gamemode Demolition, with only 2 for gungame. The classic maps are good, the demolition maps are actually really good, and the gungame maps just dont feel right. The main con here is the underwhelming amount. That brings me to another pro (i know, outta place), Demolition. This gamemode has only one thing I dont like about it: its really simple. All it is gungame with stratagy. But it works, it feels different and skillful in its own respect, such as awarding really good rounds with grenades and flashbangs. This is not to mention that the maps they made for it are pretty good for the one-bombsite purpose they were aiming for. TLDR: Good game, GREAT game for the measly $15 price tag, if you have the choice, PC is the way to go to get the most out of it, but console players will still enjoy the experience presented. 1.6 fans will be dissapointed because of thier hardcore attitude, but casual and pro source players will probably respect the game, and remember, source and 1.6 will still be there. PS, a ton of gamemodes (like surf and jail) are already working on GO, the transfer was apparently pretty smooth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2598017">Expand</a></span>

My first impression was about a 6.5/10 but after giving it some time to sink in, playing it for a few hours, I&apos;ve evolved to an easy 9. You can count on Valve introducing a customization store for guns/skins as well, which will only improve the gaming experience. CS:GO = Wife Aggro.</span>

Some people are just spoiled like that, as other companies rape series like EA with CnC 4.
<br>I like the graphics, the sounds, and the gameplay all it needs now is a good modding community like Source had (only reason i liked to play Source) and can customize bot matches w/o having to go into the console then it would be a blast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2588435">Expand</a></span>

Hitboxes are smaller, models slightly bigger.  New guns and new nades.  Molotovs/Incid are naw great CC&apos;s and can change/hinder the flow of a rush.  Smokes are extremely effective.  This is a new counter-strike so play it as such</span>

<br>Fit for both Casual and Competitive player, as well as costing a shocking $15, it&apos;s a must buy for any fps fan.</span>

<br>
<br>As I said; It&apos;s only kids downgrading this game. Be open to changes, is all I have to say. CS have been out there for 12 years and nothing have really changed. It was basically the same game from beta to 1.6 which sponsors don&apos;t like. Why CS 1.6 are dying is because of less and less sponsors actually give something to the scene, and why? Well because of the game being OLD and UGLY and so 2000.
<br>
<br>Grow some f&apos;ing balls and start playing CS:GO.

Gameplay hasn&apos;t changed much at all (and it shouldn&apos;t), the steep learning curve is still there, and seems more like 1.6 than source.  The buy menu is much better, more convenient, and doesn&apos;t close down when you buy an individual item causing you to reopen it again and again.  The weapons have been rebalanced so the over used ak, m4, awp and desert eagle isn&apos;t the only thing you see now, but they still haven&apos;t lost their power.  New items such as the molotov **** for stopping a rush and decoy grenades for fooling your enemies are nice new features.  The small cons of the game are my opinion of course:  the silencer for the m4 is gone, only can carry 1 flashbang instead of 2, and total lack of maps.  Yes these are my only cons with the games.  When I first bought the game, it wasn&apos;t very polished, but now it has very few glitches and bugs.  Since it is Valve, we get free maps and content, meaning the silencer might come back whenever it wants to and new maps will pop up with time.  If you are a veteran or noob to Counter Strike, Global Offensive DOES NOT disappoint.  Great job Valve.  Now...about that episode 3? :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2773262">Expand</a></span>

<br>The thing is, this game only costs 15 dollars and it&apos;s some really high quality entertainment for that small amount of money, and we all know Valve is gonna drop a ton of updates on us, so whats with the disappointment? Now if this was 30 or 60 dollars, i&apos;d bash this game to oblivion even with updates, because charging that much for a game and the putting updates up later is stupid, especially since updates might be halted or cancelled, but Valve gave us a good game, for a good price, the updates from this point are just bonuses from this point, I think ti&apos;s under-appreciated, people were expecting the biggest thing ever, well, they only asked for 15 dollars, could it considered to be a cop-out of Valve to just not live up to those expectations? I&apos;m not sure, but right now, all that matters is that i&apos;m having a blast on GO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/counter-strike-global-offensive/user-reviews?user_review_id=2618106">Expand</a></span>
