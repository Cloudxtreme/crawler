It brings back fond memories of Lemmings from my childhood. Sometimes seeing the demise of your little goolings is as much fun as leading them to the goal. If I had three thumbs, it would get three thumbs up.</span>

The gameplay also deserves points for its originality. The basic concept of WOG is that there are these tiny goo balls squirming around in every level, and these goo balls can be picked up by the player using the mouse cursor and then dropped near other goo balls to create structures. The objective of most levels is to build a structure (or series of structures) that allows a certain number of goo balls to reach an exit pipe. The more goo balls that reach the exit, the better your score. So the challenge of the game is twofold: 1) Figuring what sort of structure you&apos;ll need to build to accomplish the level objective, as it is rarely a straight course, 2) Conquering the laws of physics by building a goo structure that not only accomplishes your goal, but is also structurally sound and unlikely to be destroyed by environmental dangers. The game does a fantastic job of creating fresh scenarios, either by introducing new environmental dangers or by introducing new goo balls with new unique abilities. The game&apos;s originality is incredibly refreshing and its character will charm you to no end.<br>THE CONS: Interacting with the goo balls in the game is not always very user friendly, and in some situations it becomes just plain infuriating. In most levels, the goo balls start on a small, pre-built structure. As you build, the goo balls whimsically travel around the tresses of the structure you&apos;re putting together. As the game goes on and the challenges become more difficult, this actually starts to become frustrating for a number of different reasons. For example, if there are multiple types of goo balls in a particular stage (let&apos;s say regular black goo and balloon goo), you might be trying to pick up a particular kind of goo ball to accomplish a particular task. However, the one goo ball you&apos;re trying to pick up is buried beneath 60 other goo balls that you don&apos;t want. You can&apos;t just move all the unwanted goo balls aside and dig down to the goo ball you want, because all the goo balls are running around like disobedient children. The whistle the game gives you to &quot;call&quot; goo balls is no help, since it seems to only make the goo balls do what they are already doing (i.e., running around chaotically), only faster. The chaotic dog pile of goo balls also proves frustrating in time-sensitive situations, since you&apos;ll try to quickly grab a single goo ball from the writing mass of them, but instead you&apos;ll accidentally yank out a goo ball that&apos;s already been placed, causing your entire structure to collapse. The developers have kindly introduced tiny flies you can click on to flashback to an earlier point in the level, in case you make any huge blunders; however, these flies also prove frustrating since 1) the restore points they choose seem almost random, ranging anywhere from two seconds ago (letting you watch your structure fall in instant replay) to three minutes ago (causing you to rebuild a significant chunk of your structure), and 2) it is too easy to click one of these flies by accident when you don&apos;t mean to, effectively deleting GOOD progress you&apos;ve made. In short, all of the problems and frustrations of world of goo boil down to one essential problem: there is too much crap on the screen at one time. It all piles on top of each other, and it can make your life hell. VERDICT: Definitely buy the game for its originality and charm, but be prepared for some unnecessary frustration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=1713401">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Good: Artstyle, cutscenes and music are phenomenal; sharp humor and smart twists
<br>
<br>The Bad: Controls and physics doesn&apos;t match the game&apos;s difficulty
<br>
<br>Raised upon a little physics proof-of-concept (called Tower of Goo, still available for download in the old 2D Boy&apos;s site) World of Goo was a major agent of the indie takeover 7 years ago. Much like many of its contemporaries it gets half the job astoundily well done--the artsy one--but doesn&apos;t quite nail the core gameplay content that smartly.
<br>
<br>On the bright side there&apos;s plenty to be proud of: presentation overall is plain superb--both music and graphics are a testimony of a very cohesive art direction--and everything sums up nicely to serve the plot--or at least the philosophic dialogue it proposes if we can&apos;t agree it has a proper plot.
<br>
<br>On the other hand the developers couldn&apos;t help restricting the player&apos;s resources as if it was a classic hardcore game. Physics here are way too loose to ask the player the precision and swiftness the levels so constantly demand, goo balls are often too limited in number and as they grow in variety it gets tougher to pick the right one from the crowd, and checkpoints (despite the smart &quot;undo&quot; concept) work poorly. (Using OCDs for triggering Achievements sits on top of that as well.)
<br>
<br>The game sometimes try to make up for those frustration moments by offering alternate paths in the maps but they&apos;re often useless since it eventually forces you to get back to the avoided levels before allowing you to progress anyway.
<br>
<br>World of Goo weights in the &quot;games as art&quot; debate but does so by improving the usual external assets related to that instead of improving interactivity--the main feature that makes the medium unique for exploring new forms of art.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=5246800">Expand</a></span>

Where most bridge builders are designed to mimic reality, this one opts for a funny premise of trying to free goos who are stuck in pipes and such. It adds levels with obstacles and different building parts to overcome them (no different than bridge builders in that respect). Ultimately however, it is a very short and simple game with practically no replay value. I honestly had more fun with some free bridge builders on my phone especially ones that required you support trucks that have to cross. This one does have its own unique charm given the premise but that is just not enough to overcome the boredom factor for me. That said, most normal folks might find it more fun that I did and given how cheap it is now, its probably worth trying for most folks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=6832056">Expand</a></span>

First few levels of world 1 are ok, and then you reach that &quot;Tower of goo&quot; level. I tried it 1000 times, watching &quot;tutorials&quot; on youtube and it&apos;s impossible. Well, possible it is, the problem is it&apos;s based on luck. You create a base structure which stands steady, and then you have to go as fast as possible to reach the top. As you can guess there is no precision, nor strategy involved. You have to get lucky that at some time you&apos;ll reach the top without the tower to collapse. So basically it&apos;s a &quot;do the same thing a gazillion times and one of it you&apos;ll get lucky&quot; strategy. Needless to say that after 5 times the music and sound effects get really, REALLY annoying and only add to the rage to the point you have to mute it.<br>This makes me think that the whole rest of the game and it&apos;s &quot;difficulty&quot; in the end resides on this luck which will drive you crazy and make you rage to the point you want to punch little babies.<br>You&apos;ve been warned!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=1445459">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a physics puzzler where you build goo based structures in order to save a collection of goo balls.
<br>
<br>The problem lies in the concept&apos;s execution. The OCD challenges are what give replay value to the game but are frustrating to an incredible degree. Some of the challenges require you to finish the level within a certain amount of time but don&apos;t offer you a timer during the game. You have to wait until you finish the level to see your completion time. This means that you have to go back to the world map and then reselect the level again in order to retry.
<br>
<br>A similar frustration is that you can&apos;t retry the level after the base number of goo balls have been collected. Some of the OCD challenges require you to collect and absurd amount of goo balls compared to the amount required to complete the level on its own. In one example, the level required me to collect 8 goo balls to continue to the next area. The OCD challenge required me to collect 36 goo balls. Again, this challenge is fine but the game does you no favors. You can&apos;t (easily) retry the level after you collect the first 8 goo balls. In order to even get the menu to pop up after collecting 8 goo balls and noticing I was going to fall short, I had to click, and then read, one of the in-game signs. There is no &quot;retry&quot; button after you complete a level so if you follow through and just finish you have to go back to the world map and then reselect the level you just finished. It would also be nice here to have something that tracked the goo balls that hadn&apos;t been used. This would save a lot of time as you would know exactly how many balls were left and how many more you could use before you had to start the level all over again.
<br>
<br>The game offers an &quot;undo&quot; feature in these little time-warp bugs that generate every once in a while. Clicking on the bug steps back in time to the point where the bug was spawned. The main problem here is that it can be a pain to click on the bugs as they fly around the level, sometimes they end up right on top of my goo structure. Additionally, the bugs don&apos;t always go back to where they should, at least it seemed that way. It was common to rewind time and see my tower spasm wildly into the walls and spinning blades.
<br>
<br>Moving the goo around is also pretty frustrating. Hovering over a goo ball stops it&apos;s movement even if it&apos;s in front of different type of goo ball. There were many times where I either destroyed my structure or missed critical timing because I couldn&apos;t select the goo ball I wanted. When you pick up the goo balls, you have to maneuver them around the objects in the world, which is generally fine, but at times is incredibly frustrating. At one point I had about 15 balls fall off of my structure and I had to drag them each individually up to the structure in order to finish the level.
<br>
<br>World of Goo also has a gameplay mode that lets you build an infinitely tall tower of goo. This would be cool if you got anything for building a taller and taller structure but all it seems to do is allow you to compete with other people. The goo you collect from the &quot;story&quot; part of the game gets sent to the Corporation of Goo where you build the infinite tower. It would be nice if building a taller and taller tower unlocked something or other because otherwise there&apos;s no motivation to even use this part of the game.
<br>
<br>The art is really nice, and one of the reasons I didn&apos;t mark this as low as I had initially thought. One small problem with the art art is that, at times, it&apos;s difficult to distinguish between the level&apos;s background and things like spinning gears that will destroy your goo structure and the goo balls themselves. It&apos;s also tough to distinguish between level boundaries and walls that you can use to prop up your structure. If the tower collapses and hits a wall, part of it is destroyed.
<br>
<br>The music is good as well but there&apos;s no option to turn it off. The game lacks customization options in general and the full-screen key combination isn&apos;t even explained, I had to look it up online. To mute the music and play with my own I had to download a custom DLL that let me control the volume of the sound effects and the music - controls that should have been in the game by default. Changing the resolution required editing a config file, which is more than ridiculous for a fairly casual game like WoG.
<br>
<br>All in all, this game frustrated the hell out of me. Not because the concept was frustrating, or even the gameplay, the UI and overall system built around the gameplay is what turned me off. There are features missing that are expected in modern puzzle games and features missing that are expected in modern games in general. The fact that this is an indie title is no excuse for a lack of a sound/volume menu, or the lack of a timer when challenges require you to finish a level within a time limit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=1450272">Expand</a></span>

The story? What story!? It&apos;s like someone with altzimers trying to recite To Be or Not to Be from memory. Seriously, there is no plot other than a stupid side-story about goo balls, a pipe, and some weird things (I can&apos;t call them people) drawn by a preschooler that talk by squeaking. If you buy this game, know that your money could be better spent on Trine or Braid; even a lifetime supply of gumballs would be better than this idiotic indie.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=86027">Expand</a></span>

It is so well polished that you feel like you are playing a $50 game. This game is for the ages, telling the grand kids about time for the smart gamer wasn&apos;t over in 2008. All of the puzzles are difficult without being impossible. OCD challenges will make you have to bend the in-game physics to your will like a god to complete them, but when you do it, you&apos;ll jump with celebration. Story is funny and cute and emotionally grabbing. Graphics are perfect and fit along the story like a glove. Music is incredible. 
<br>For an added challenge, buy it for the Wii.

The game has great comical graphics (you don&apos;t need ultra-crysis realism to have good graphics, it just has to look good). It has funny little sounds for the goos. It is comical down to the core. The only time you will wouldn&apos;t like it is if you try the OCD.</span>

I bought it on Wii for the high rating about 2 years ago, and I re-purchased it on Steam sale just now. I beat it then, and I intend to beat it again (albeit Wii controller is much harder than mouse controls, aka if you are considering computer purchase, you have no reason not to buy.) This game is so good, thought-wise (physics), good music, good SFX, good concept, challenging (but not without retries), innovative, and fun. I will say it is rather bland and dark, but it is extremely rewarding in its gameplay.
<br>
<br>However I cannot give it above a 7-8 because it doesn&apos;t take more time than that to complete the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=3888949">Expand</a></span>

The story, while quite simple, works well to draw you in to the world, but never upstages the experience. The story even takes a few moments to explore some deeper issues such as beauty and ethics, if that sort of thing appeals to you. But if all you want is a simple physics puzzler, this game will also deliver. The gameplay channels some classic puzzle games, particularly lemmings, but modernized with a simple physics engine. The game while short is probably exactly as long as it needs to be  while there are plenty of types of gooballs and game possibilities, any more playtime would have probably worn out the game&apos;s freshness.
<br>To split hairs, there are a few things this game could do bettter. A common complaint, and well warranted, is that when there are heaps of gooballs swarming in one area, it&apos;s sometimes hard to pick the one you need. Also, while the music is beautiful, the game could stand to have a few more tracks. Another minor criticism is that some of the animations in the cutscenes are a bit poor.
<br>Finally  and this is purely subjective  I very quickly got sick of building huge towers and bridges. When I&apos;ve already worked out the solution to a level, I feel very frustrated if I then also have to spend 5 minutes meticulously building a structure just to make a minor error and have the whole thing collapse and force me to start again. (In my opinion, the challenge in puzzle games should be more about working out the solution than mastering the technique to pull it off)
<br>But I hate to end this on a bad note, so I will say that this is a unique, beautiful  at times artistic  game that should really be in everybody&apos;s game library.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2968223">Expand</a></span>

The design, music and sound effects are absolutely charming, but I had a few doubts for the gameplay. It&apos;s great to be given such a wide variety of goo balls, with all special abilities, but I just wish I was given more opportunities to actually use them! All levels are pretty unique, which is great, but sometimes I wish that there were more levels that were roughly the same, becoming more complex over time and asking you to use your goo balls skillfuly. There aren&apos;t a lot of hints too in the games, and you&apos;ll need to experiment from time to time in order to progress. Again, initially it isn&apos;t a bad thing but sometimes you&apos;d wish there were more help around. Example, at some point you have to take the eyes out of a creature in order to use them as balloons for your goo balls, yet there wasn&apos;t the slightest clue (or else I must be worryingly blind) that suggested you to do so, I just found it out of clicking fustration. The general idea and design of the game makes it worthwhile, but it isn&apos;t a game that will stick in my mind as one of the greatest I&apos;ve ever played. It&apos;s greatest flaw is that it&apos;s virtues are also vices.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=742689">Expand</a></span>

For the $5 I bought it through Steam (discount on Black Friday) it has been worth at least double that! The puzzles are fun, although some ARE indeed frustrating (especially not being able to make things strait, or make cross bracing with any regularity). The Sign Painters signs and the mild social commentary are cute and well made and brough a smile to my face. i sincerely hope they make additional lvels, or make a user content section to allow special puzzles that let you solve them on your time in your way. only downside is that once you have achieved the goal, you can not replay or use the flashback thingers to make it get more extra goo-balls. I have had several times where I have lost dozens because I over reached the end and saw them plummet, only to barely meet the goal and not be able to restart.... I say this is NOT worth $20, but $15 would be the fair price I would call on this. Any lower for this, and you do NOT get it, do not call yourself a puzzle player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=741369">Expand</a></span>

Fallout 3, Deadspace, Fable II, Mirrors Edge, Crysis and Prince Of Persia have been amazing experiences in their own way (well, maybe not Fable II) but they just can&apos;t match World Of Goo for its pick-up-and-play simplicity and joyously creative execution. It maybe even tops the wonderful Braid... And I&apos;ve only just completed the first chapter! I&apos;ve had a huge smile on my face nearly the whole time when building my wobbly towers and bridges. Aside from the fiendishly fun gameplay, the engaging art, animation and interface are excellent, and the music is the absolutely brilliant icing on the cake. And I can&apos;t believe I got it for just a few quid on Steam.

This game strike a remarkable middle-ground I&apos;d not thought possible. Whilst being comparitively short, the story is truely wonderful - something you wouldn&apos;t expect from a small puzzle game. To this end it is extremely dark, and the end will probably leave you with a couple of questions. Even though this game by no means has infinite replayability, when faced with a choice of similar games, this is probably the one I for one would play through again. After perhaps an hour or two, you may tire of it and it&apos;s probably best to walk away for a bit, make a sandwich, and try to avoid the Tetris Effect - but soon you&apos;ll want to be right back in there.

OK... Here&apos;s World of Goo. It&apos;s a physics-based puzzle game where you construct goos so that they can made it into the end point which is the pipe. That&apos;s pretty much the whole explanation. There are various goo types as you play. There are the baloon goos (or maybe they are actual baloons), there are the removeable goos, trasparent goos, and soo many more. Even with the simple gameplay, you still need your brain right here though not fully. Maybe because you mindlessly construct goos. But this game actually requires strategy and prediction in the later levels. The overall gameplay is very fun, though it can get hard sometimes. Surprisingly this game has a very interesting personality on itself. The game is just making fun of things and not taking it too seriously. Yeah, it&apos;s maybe a little mindless, but it&apos;s still fun to play. So far, the only problem i got on this game is that it spoils how many chapters are on this game. Though, this game still can hook you up with like 30-40 hours. OVERALL: This is an awesome game. I have a fun times playing with it as a casual gamer. Puzzle game fans should definitely check it out. It&apos;s pretty cheap right now so why don&apos;t you buy it!. Oh, and it works really well on any netbook so you can bring it anywhere.

Absolutely worth playing. Original review: This is a cool physics based game. To Radio - Re the Tower of Goo Level - Don&apos;t just build straight up - come back down to the bottom to solidify your base so that it doesn&apos;t rock back and forth so much and fall. If it&apos;s shaking too much adding spokes at the bottom to stabilize helps alot. Think Pyramid instead of Obelisk (sp?). Pay attention to the balance and build away from the lean. Don&apos;t worry about building fast at first until you formulate a stable strategy. I&apos;ve only played a few hours so far, but the one level &quot;in between&quot; where you&apos;re building a bridge without sagging too low or floating too high - I did find the gui to get in the way because timing does matter quite a bit there - I&apos;d often try to grab a balloon to try to stop the bridge from falling too low, or a blob to stop it from floating too high - and grab the wrong thing. Frustrating, but they do give the back a move option that sometimes might help (not always though due to timing)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=2694304">Expand</a></span>

<br>Pros: Online leaderboards and achievements
<br>
<br>Cons: No multiplayer, unlike the Wii.
<br>
<br>Still, great indie title. 8/10</span>

Lovable art styles  fun and challenging puzzles with a great soundtrack as well. There are also &apos;challenge modes&apos;  on each levels called OCDs, these are challenging and a worthy challenge. I would get this game on the pc rather than on the iPhone though. Either way, two thumbs up.</span>

Other than that the design of the game was stellar. The difficulty was neither too hard to become very frustrating, neither too easy to become boring, the perfect balance ,it&apos;s rare to find such perfection in difficulty balance in puzzle games, bravo.</span>

<br>
<br>However, under its simple premise as a 2D puzzle-platformer, it also harbours a fantastic mix of an up-beat and atmospheric soundtrack, and great landscapes.
<br>
<br>The story is minimal, but it is relayed to you from the witty and notorious Sign Painter, who always has something to say, either about gameplay hints, or about philosophical musings of the goo-balls themselves.
<br>
<br>These goo-balls are guided by your mouse, as you pick them up and place them strategically to form beam-like structures, to be able to reach your goal (a suction pipe in a difficult to reach place, most often). You&apos;ll come across goo-balls that behave differently, in changing environments.
<br>
<br>It will test your resolution towards the later areas of the game, and there are the harder challenges in each level for the completionists out there.

<br>I completed the game multiple times, and then went for the OCD challanges. I can&apos;t seem to get tired of this game! I&apos;d love to see some expansion or continuation for it at some point.</span>

(2) Original gameplay idea, though I prefer the approach taken by &quot;Bridge Constructor&quot; for the iPad, which has similar gameplay probably inspired by this. (3) Great value: I purchased this for the price of a coffee.
<br>
<br>CONS: (1) I found success often comes down to trial-and-error, which is inevitably less satisfying. (2) Needing to build quickly before the whole structure collapses can be more frustrating than fun -- success often felt highly dependent on chance/good luck in those cases. (3) The controls can be frustratingly unreliable -- and especially frustrating when time is of the essence and you end up repeatedly selecting the wrong type of &quot;goo ball&quot; to use.
<br>
<br>CONCLUSION: Despite its high production values &amp; originality, I can only recommend this to those who are willing to overlook the aforementioned gameplay flaws: you need to be OK with mindlessly hacking away at a problem over and over until something sticks. I need to feel that success or failure in a game is entirely dependent on my own skill level.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-goo/user-reviews?user_review_id=5296551">Expand</a></span>

And when I beat the game, once I reset the game it was still the same fun as it was each time I played it again. And it being on steam just makes me filled with nostalgia. World of goo permanently has a place in my heart, and in my soul.</span>
