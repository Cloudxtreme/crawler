Single player on this game wasn&apos;t exactly challenging but that doesn&apos;t mean it wasn&apos;t fun either. Creeping along as a marine not knowing when something is going to sneak up behind you, it was quite intense. And as the alien you felt a need to sneak and crawl and the satisfactory feeling when you pounce on your prey. And fellas, the predator tops it all.. It just doesn&apos;t get old pulling heads off. Along with the awesome weapons you have to choose from. I found single player short, yet very enjoyable and satisfying. Multi-player was also fun as well, much more challenging than single player of course. Timing your blocks and strikes.. Making quick sprints for cover, the game just doesn&apos;t get old. I think they did a very good job of making this game, the graphics are beautiful along with all the effects. I give this game a 9 out of 10 because I would have liked the single player to have been longer, and the lack of dedicated servers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=745882">Expand</a></span>

I basically was waiting for this and excited for this because I played AVP2 regularly and I loved the whole franchise, first of all I want to say that if you&apos;re coming from AVP2 you will most certainly not encounter a similar type of game. The strong points of this game are basically solid graphics, decent AI, and the 3 races. There really isn&apos;t a whole lot to praise with this game in terms of gameplay, but I will say that this game was reliable, I pre-ordered for PC and got the game a few days after release (backed up shipment or something stupid), and immediately there we no problems with the game, I never experienced any crashing, glitching, sound distortion or cutting out, nothing like that. Rebellion was smart enough to patch in a dedicated servers feature as well fairly soon after release. But that&apos;s about where the good points end. The singleplayer, it&apos;s a decent experience to be honest, but the story is easily forgettable, plus the addition of the collectible objects which really add nothing to the game beyond steam achievements, or a little bit of storyline from the marine recordings(which are annoying to try and listen to because they don&apos;t autoplay), are basically there to waste time. Too be honest, the greatest single player feature in the game is the survival game, where you are a marine fighting waves of aliens that get tougher the more you kill, at least that is the best feature in my eyes, I&apos;ve spent more time in that than I do in multiplayer pvp matches. But even still, it is hindered by the lack of survival maps (only 2 without DLC) and like I said, there&apos;s only a survivor mode for marines, there&apos;s no other added single player feature to play aliens or predators. The multiplayer, basically what I was waiting for, turned out to be pretty disappointing, marines are honestly the most fun to play, for the simple reason that you can&apos;t run around executing people, predators and aliens can simply run around pressing E to execute people, sure you can play without doing that, but it&apos;s basically crippling yourself if you refuse to execute people because it&apos;s just a one button press. The upside? Executing people is satisfying to watch, the gore is so ruthlessly violent that it&apos;s almost hilarious to disembowel a marine. But it&apos;s lack of variety and intrigue in gameplay can be ENTIRELY contributed to the root problem of the whole game, and that root problem is console porting. This game is so clearly made for consoles when you play it, yes it works fine for PC and has no problems, but the gameplay feels so limited, and it just FEELS like a console game, it feels like it is being restricted by a controller when you play the PC version. The lack of weapon variety, the lack of universal crouching and jumping, it&apos;s all a product of a game that was designed for consoles. This game is certainly not AVP2, but I will make a comparison, in AVP2 the predators and marines had so many weapons that it would be impossible to play on a console because you often need to switch between weapons instantly, and having to cycle through them using a controller would just be frustrating, never mind the ammo types and alternate firing methods. This is a game clearly influenced by the desire to have it available for console systems, and as such is a pretty mediocre PC game, albeit with dedicated servers, which is becoming rare these days. I&apos;m giving this game a 5 because of its console value, it really is an alright console game in my opinion, but it&apos;s a very obvious one, I would certainly advise anyone not to pick this up for the PC especially if you&apos;re a PC gamer. Summary: The lack of weapon variety, boring multiplayer meta game, and generally bland gameplay lead this to be an alright console game and not much more, the graphics are quite pleasing and the dedicated servers are nice, but it doesn&apos;t matter when the gameplay just doesn&apos;t hold your attention. I played multiplayer for literally 1 maybe 2 days before I got bored of it basically entirely, there must be a serious lack of players in the game by now, if you&apos;re an AVP fan you&apos;ll probably marginally enjoy it like I did, but if you&apos;re a dedicated PC gamer, you&apos;d be better off going for a different game, or better yet, just getting AVP2, even the single player is worth it in that game. At any rate, I regret paying full price for this, it&apos;s essentially just eye candy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=1666254">Expand</a></span>

They only bad thing I find in this game was the lag on multiplayer but I never play multiplayer on any game so it doesn&apos;t bug me. If I&apos;d love multiplayer I&apos;d put an 8. But as I love singleplayer more I just have to give a 10.</span>

Many people complain graphics and lighting was off, but you can&apos;t argue with that because your computer sucked (Owned.) The gaming for marine was exactly what I expected, if you played hard or nightmare of course. Through every corner even when there was no blinking motion detector, I was always scared. The headhuggers always had me worried no matter what situation, and some aliens seemed to find you when you needed it the least. Acid blood was the best part, because even though it P****d you off, you still loved the enjoyable effect knowing you had to run like a chicken if they got to close to shoot. The flamethrower wasn&apos;t overpowered to the extreme like the first AVP, and the effect to make walls of flames were also brilliant, even though not much used. Going back to the Predator campaign, the story all the way through was great. Stealth hunting, mines, explosive cannons, a spear to own faces, and dont forget the most favorite (and unfortunently abused) disk of doom! As you progress through the predators story, you also realize you have to use better tactics or your going to die quite quickly. Everything was mostly needed or you could in fact be compromised quite easily. Not to mention the great amount of blood and guts introduced by pulling a marines head through his chest and looking in there eyes. Now for the Alien campaign, you couldn&apos;t feel more like a lethal weapon then what was given. Being sneaky, finding advantage points, and harvesting your prey, was all I needed. Every time I would harvest a civilian, or tear a victim to shreds, I felt the utmost satisfaction in knowing I completed the part I needed, not mentioning how I also felt so bad knowing I just shoved my tail through a marines rectum up through his throat and out his mouth. The story lines were a bit confusion though inbetween, but you realize it near the end. Overall I give this game a 9 out of 10, simply because they didn&apos;t include stranded from AVP 2000! P.s. - To all members of the AVP community and the people reading this - THe little bugs and glitches will be patched over time, and all them unfair advantages you call, weren&apos;t so unfair when you were doing them to others. Without the range on Aliens tail, the marines would eat Aliens instead. Without the preds health and abilitys, he would be a slow running alien, and without the marines motion sensor and gun, he would be a harvesting snack food.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=745933">Expand</a></span>

Single player doesn&apos;t take very long to complete and doensn&apos;t have an innovative story but is good at introducing you to all the gameplay concepts. Multiplayer is really where this game shines. The 6 modes are very well constructed and play to the various combat techniques of the three species. The only problem with multiplayer, now that dedicated servers have been released, is that there are only 6 maps right now. But this is about to be changed as Rebellion is releasing a map pack soon and a mod kit has been promised. Great game from a talanted developer, here&apos;s hoping for a sequal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746482">Expand</a></span>

That is, if you don&apos;t mind the console features - but you get quickly used to them. The animations, models and maps are all very reminiscent of the movies. Multiplayer is generally a wonderful experience even on non-dedicated servers. The shifting pyramid map from the AvP movie is original. AvP 2010 is an intense and remarkably creepy experience for multiplayer. I wasn&apos;t frightened by the multiplayer atmosphere with the lack of dark industrial maps; but, because there are so many ways to lose alien and predator players, I found myself being scared more than a few times after me getting adjusted to the animations and map layouts. If you are not turned off by console features and Aliens, this will probably be the go-to shooter by the end of the year and if you enjoyed AvP 2000 and AvP 2 then, with the exception of the short single player experience and storyline, you will enjoy this one better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=745763">Expand</a></span>

I have just been mucking around on multiplayer and surivior modes are they are great. Muitlplayer is such a change from Call of Duty clones with the Alien and Predator in the game also being very balanced in the species. The predator has less weapons than it did in the previous games forcing them to use there wrist blades more often with the great meele combat you can knock players on the ground, block attacks its not just alien claw spam like in the first two games. The Alien is very fun to play jumping from wall to wall waiting for a good time to attack. The alien can sense player through walls if they are close which is good because the alien can feel underpowered at times only having meele attacks. The marine is exciting to play as, most of the maps are quite dark and you have only a flashlight and motiontracker you never know when you are going to be attacked from. The trophey kills in the multiplayer is a cool idea because that would be what a alien or predator would have done if they were behind someone. it takes a few seconds to do the kill which leaves you wide open to attack so you have to make sure there is no one about before doing it or someone could kill you and the player you are killing. Another thing i love is that they have put in the survivor mode in which is like the skirmish from the first one but its not as crazy with waves of Aliens that get harder and smarter climbing on the walks and than attacking you and than running away and sneaking up on you again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=745863">Expand</a></span>

I had played the demo and found that most of my skepticism was washed away as the multiplayer just blew my mind. I promptly purchased the game, going against the mediocre ratings. The single player is more or less there to learn how to play. Like in Chromehounds, the single player offered little or no story (That anyone would care about) and was more or less training mode. The multi-player was the big part of this game for me. It&apos;s a whole new experience in the FPS realm. It&apos;s fun and addicting once you get the hang of each race. The lag isn&apos;t as bad as everyone says it is, and many people are constantly under rating this game because they compare it to titles of a completely different genre like cod 4. Most of the games top producers have been putting out these days are mediocre at best. L4D2 was terrible in my opinion, but I played the first one and loved it. Yet it received critical acclaim and is considered a great title. AvP comes along and gets bashed from people who don&apos;t think that it&apos;s &apos;scary&apos;. It&apos;s as though people just think AvP and think of something terrible (Probably due to all of their flops). People just aren&apos;t looking in the right direction for this game. It&apos;s a shame that AvP will be buried at the bargain bin not even a few months from now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746831">Expand</a></span>

People complaining about the environment or crashing simply do not have the technology that this game was intended for. I do recommend getting it if you loved AvP2. I also recommend getting it if you have a directx 11 card. I give it a 9 just because of the lack of multiplayer players online. Usually only 3-5 as of March 2010. If you are going to buy it, I would say wait until it goes on sale on Steam for $20. The game is worth at least that much, but not the $50. I Purchased it for $33 and find it a good investment. Overall, it looks like the multiplayer will eventually die out like The Ship did. But, the singleplayer and Directx 11 features put it in the new graphic genre quite well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=747071">Expand</a></span>

The alien&apos;s versitility, the Predetors stealth tatics and abilities, and despite the fact that the Marine has been seen in other games and is really nothing new, the enviroment in which you play him is so atmospheric, and these Aliens will pop out of nowhere. I do admit, the AI is a bit stupid, but who cares? That&apos;s what makes it so much fun to swoop down and tear out his spine, only for a marine to &quot;investigate&quot; and have a similar fate. The single player campaign is short, but it is fantastic. The marine sees firsthand a beautiful ruin of a science facilty, realisticly made. The alien has a lot of versitility, and speed, giving you the option to be the &quot;heard but not seen&quot; threat. And the predetor has some of the best stealth abilites, and the maps are created so that he can use them to the fullest extent. Multiplayer has some pretty standard modes, but adds diffuculty to the game, and forcing you to change your tatics. Overall, this game is great, allowing you to control some of the best characters I&apos;ve ever played in a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=745741">Expand</a></span>

While the graphics aren&apos;t the greatest, the single player is merely mediocre, the game has a wonderful multiplayer experience. Seven different game modes allows endless fun and allows you to enjoy the experience without feeling like it&apos;s getting repetitive. These game modes are Infestation, Predator Hunt, Death Match, Team Death Match, Mixed Death Match, Domination, Survival Mode Infestation is a new take to the classic zombie mode. Instead of facing off with one shambling zombie that slowly overwhelms your team as more and more players drop there&apos;s one fast moving and lethal alien. 17 marine players face off against a Xenomorph and if that Xenomorph scores a kill, more players join it&apos;s rank. What makes this, in my opinion, interesting than most games &quot;Zombie&quot; modes is that the Xenomorphs are extremely fast, aggressive, and can pop out of anywhere. This makes the fight for survival and to be the last man standing increasingly more difficult as more of your friends join their rank. Predator Hunt is another interesting take on the classic known as Juggernaut. If a marine scores a kill on the Predator he becomes the next Predator. What makes it different is that the Predator can cloak, has highly advanced weapons, and a good well placed mind can take out most of the marine team. Even more, he has a plasma shoulder canon that can score multiple kills at one, the classic combi stick that many players simply don&apos;t see coming and much more. Death Match, not much to say about this, it&apos;s easily in my opinion the weakest mode in the game. It allows you to pick one of the three species and go head to head in a free for all against one another. It&apos;s fun but I find it gets boring after all. It&apos;s also very anti-thematic compared to the other modes. Team Death Match on the other hand is very fun and here is where it differs from other fps games! You don&apos;t play with one team but THREE. It&apos;s humans/Aliens/Predators in an all out fight to out score the other team via kills. Six humans against Six Aliens against Six Predators for a total of 18 players. With the difference between the species fighting styles you never know what to expect. This definitely ranks up there as one of the top game modes. Mixed Team Death Match is the classic Team Death Match. Two sides fighting it out but the difference here is that each Team can be any species you want. I dislike this mode buuut I find that it&apos;s better than regular Death Match. It can be really fun if you have friends who refuse to play the same species as yourself in the other team death match and this way you can all get together with your preferred species and have fun. Domination is the same as other games. Try to hold several points to outscore the other team. Other people might be thrilled with this addition but I feel it could have been done without. It&apos;s not my cup of tea and there&apos;s not much to say about it. Finally there&apos;s survival mode. You and three friends group up to fight wave after wave of Xenomorphs. Each wave forcing you to be more frantic and desperate than the last as you try to stay alive and make it through. So why didn&apos;t I give the game a 10/10? There&apos;s one massive flaw to this otherwise fun game but we already knew about it before it released, right? The single player is short. I mean, really short. 5 hours average for each campaign but can be completed in a total of 8 hours if you&apos;re a skilled gamer. The level designs are very linear and within an hour of playing there&apos;s not much surprises left in store. The old school addition of bosses are fun but you&apos;ll be done with this in a few hours. If you&apos;re in it for the single player experience? The game is worth a rent. If you love Multiplayer? This is one of THE must have FPS games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=745718">Expand</a></span>

All the campaigns felt very atmospheric, and had very memorable moments throughtout, defintly worth playing. Multiplayer - One of the best multiplayer releases for sheer fun factor alone. Infestation and survior modes are both very very fun with friends. Currently no dedicated server support, but its on its way. The controls are good, and i have personally have no problems with them. The graphics are also good, if not AAA standard. They are hwoever, shored up by a brilliantly atmospheric lighting system. If you want a great, varied fps that has a unique singleplayer and multiplater experiance then get this game, but dont expect it to be the same gameplay as Call of Duty, it isnt. It surpasses the previous games in the series, and i can recommend it to anyone, especially fans of the series.

If you&apos;ve seen any of the movies you will probably enjoy the game a bit more. The environments are very nicely made, the stealth kill animations are very gory, just the way I like it. I played the demo, but it&apos;s nothing compared to the full game. I haven&apos;t played multiplayer yet, but it can&apos;t be bad knowing that they put a lot of effort in the multiplayer, when the singleplayer is already a gift from the gods. I&apos;ve read a lot of reviews about this game, but some of them are just ridiculous. I mean, just look at the users ratings and compare them to the metascore... Sure the game isn&apos;t perfect, but who or what is?

The graphics are impressive considering how well the games performs. It has been little under a week after the games was released (in the UK) and there has already been 1 patch released, while a second patch is due to be released on Monday 1st of March. Despite many complains of the lack of dedicated servers many people have already managed to play the multiplayer easily, many reaching up to level 40 and above, obviously DLC support is going to be introduced later in the game, so that makes it work keeping an eye on. The controls are fluid, especially as the alien, transitioning from wall to ceiling and back to the floor again couldn&apos;t be easier, balancing is near perfect, each species has their own specialty, making the MP environment extremely tense, never knowing what could be around the next corner. The combat system is innovative, making skill as a fighter count, spamming any old attack button will end up leaving you being slaughtered constantly, fast reactions and orientation are all important in this game. Lighting is fantastic, single player makes great use of it, from being able to make intense, frantic moments to being able to instill caution into the player as a shadow of an alien is cast on a wall as it is gnawing on a corpse of a fallen comrade around the next corner. Complaints with lack of innovation are absurd, yes they are rehashing some of the gameplay atmosphere from previous AVP games but that&apos;s simply because they were innovative then, and they&apos;re still innovative today. There is still much to be said about this game, but all in all I think this is easily the best representation of the Alien vs Predator universe in a video game that has graced the space on my hard drive, and that&apos;s why I think it deserves a 9/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746021">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are decent, also gameplay, but the AI is a let down. im a big fan of Avp so i LOVE IT. game Rocks!!!!!!</span>

This version was only developed to get as much money from as many wallets as possible before the ratings destroyed it&apos;s reputation. I finished all three short missions in one day and will NOT be playing it again. After the first mission I chose (Marine), I had to force myself to play the Alien and Predator missions. $9.95 would be a good price for this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746584">Expand</a></span>

The story is nothing special but you&apos;re not here to watch a movie, you&apos;re here to play a game! This game does some things no other game does but most won&apos;t care about that. The campaigns are relatively predictable but that&apos;s not a bad thing: nobody&apos;s ever given a Mario game a bad review because you rescue the princess. Ironically, as a marine you kinda to that. The predator is restoring honor &amp; the alien is following the queen&apos;s orders. A few of the neat things in the game I haven&apos;t seen anywhere else: you&apos;ve got legs! your &quot;body&quot; actually impacts the world (try being against the wall as an alien &amp; turning around), you can get knocked down (again, you see your body). Seems they went pretty far in making it so you interact with things in the game in more then a &quot;shoot &amp; push button&quot; way. Only complaints I have (which I can overlook): predator is to weak compared to previous games, the marines have less firepower vs previous games (which would seem to compensate the weaker predator), aliens are stronger vs previous games (but won&apos;t swarm you in the dozens), marine/predator SP AI could be better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746661">Expand</a></span>

Many people do not like it, because its a game you have to learn to play. The real gamefun is revealed when you master the controls perfectly. A lot of players become frustrated very fast, when they are killed by someone who knows how to play. So the complaining starts about imbalance etc. But i can say, there is no imbalance at all. For me it feels like every class is &quot;overpowered&quot;... so its equal! :D I can win the matches no matter which class I&apos;m playing. Depending on the classes the gameplay feels totally different. Know your strength and know your weakness, then you might succeed. Singleplayer: Of course singleplayer is short if you start it on &quot;normal&quot; (like most ppl do)... the Singleplayer is meant to be played on nightmare (or at least hard), because then it shows all of its potential. You have to act like the aliens or Predators in the movie. Rambo-Rush wont work. I like the atmosphere, but it should be more scary though. Multiplayer for sure the best about AvP. It is a lot of fun and offers many different Gamemodes. As long as you have skill you will not be bored playin em. Otherwise it could be frustrating to play predator hunt. Anyway, it has not enough maps (yet). Could be more! The dedicated servers are still in beta (17.03.10) so you have often lags and other problems. But at least it has dedicated servers, not like other modern games. The menu and server browser needs improvement as well. Anyway all this does not spoil the fun the gameplay offers... Graphics are awesome and the game runs totally smooth for me... I was a great fan of the AvP2, and now its AvP2010 which is my favorite! PS: the &quot;crouch&quot; argumentation is so dull... are you also complaining if new games do not have bullet-time? cause its a feature that many shooters have, why not others as well!? Crouch is not needed for this fast shooter with many melee elements. Though i have to admit it would be sometimes nice to have it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746697">Expand</a></span>

I wasn&apos;t expecting anything great from Rebellion but I was shocked to see that they actually did this right. The rock-paper-scissors style melee feels right (most of the time) and the classes extremely balanced. I&apos;ve seen myself spend hours upon hours in a single server (they have a dedicated server browser now!). The single player is great. Predator feels strong, alien fragile and fast, and marine terrifying. Over 6 hours in each campaign. That&apos;s 18+ hours. Some reviewers are expecting a call of duty type game with every shooter out... this is not that. It&apos;s much more to master and get a hold of. I only scrutinize it on the fact that the ranks mean nothing due to skins doing absolutely nothing... they could have taken some ideas from AVP2 in that area. REMEMBER: It has a dedicated server list now under player match. It&apos;s excellent. 9.5/10 Right on Rebellion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=747273">Expand</a></span>

A semi original plot thats a tad short lived is made up for the multiplayer. A high amount of playability comes with this game, theres no way you can call AvP a &quot;standard FPS&quot; as most of the combat will be done in melee, the only true ranger being humans. The graphics throughout are impressive, especially the shadows and lighting, a high amount of attention was put into this game to make it look as dark and as grim as it should be. Learning to use your enviroment is what makes the gameplay as solid as it is, aliens hide in the shadows then bring the fight right out, preadators hide in plain sight and strike without notice and humans cautiously wait out the storm trying to survive. I highly recomend this game to players who enjoyed the original AvP, or who like games such as doom and such. With all that being said, if you dont enjoy the maddness of hunting being hunted or just trying to survive, you can always just chase your tail with the Xenomorph.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=745837">Expand</a></span>

The game is gold, and it kills me to see these critics slander something they don&apos;t love. But good thing I don&apos;t care for critics that much. Anyone else that has followed the Alien/Predator franchise(s) like I have, and loves everything they respectfully have brought to the table, will absolutely adore this game. And people that have no clue what a Predator or a Alien is, will certainly go to H*ll, but will also get a ton of enjoyment out of this game. The single player campaign is short yes, but all 3 campaigns (1 for each of the 3 species, Alien/Marine/Predator) will take up a good portion of your days. Beating the game on Nightmare, which is no easy task to complete and deffinently not possible in just 1 day, makes those short campaigns a LOT longer. The Marine campaign gives you the eerie Doom 3 feeling when walking through dark places with Aliens rushing you from all over. The Alien campaign really justifies being called the Alien campaign. The Predator campaign makes you feel that every blaster shot is taking down one of Arnold&apos;s comrades. The multi-player REALLY is where the game is at, hands down. And for people that might say otherwise because of an imbalance between races, should try to learn how to play their species better. Also people that don&apos;t care for Death Match(which I honestly didn&apos;t until now) might speak differently after playing a couple hours of spear-chucking/gun-blazing/tail-spiking at peoples heads. Death Match is your standard mode with the twist of 3 species. Marines can&apos;t hold their guns to the ground forever because death most often comes from above. However Mixed Species and Species Death Match modes are different than what you would think them to be. For it often drives everyone (especially marines) to huddle together to stay alive, which makes you feel like your playing Left 4 Dead... except with Aliens. Domination is your standard hold 3 points for as long as you can while holding enough skill to combat 3 different species trying to take those points from you and your team. I keep saying 3 different species because it takes skill to change your playstyle when facing off with any of the 3, plus uncommon differences from players. And for the icing on top of the cake, the reason why a majority of people bought this game, is for these 3 modes... Infestation: Everyone spawns as Colonial Marines, feeling pretty macho as a group at first then getting your group dwindled down to a couple marines changes your opinion on that first feeling. Hunter: Like above everyone starts as marines, but one person is selected as a Predator instead of a Alien. Also the key difference between this and Infestation(besides the obvious) is that when people die they aren&apos;t turned into Predators, like in Infestation you would turn into an Alien to aid your persecutor, you would respawn and get the chance to kill that Predator. Also the person selected as Predator is random and every person that kills the Predator, gets the chance to be him. Survivor: 4 Colonial Marines try to fend off the unlimited horde of Aliens that are sent in waves, but don&apos;t think you got time to heal, reload and gather supplies before the next wave is already on top of you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=745923">Expand</a></span>

Still waiting on dedicated servers, with news that a closed beta of the dedicated server software will be coming on March 1st. No auto team balancing, no vote kick options, poor matchmaking system, lacking polish. Game does have an interesting melee system and when it works the games can be quite fun if you are a fan of the AvP universe. But many of the missing features will frustrate many users. A decent game that may improve with patching, but currently does not live up to it&apos;s potential.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746025">Expand</a></span>

The action sounds are nice, but the voice acting is terrible (and annoying - &apos;Tequila&apos; is yet another stereotype). Also, The constant noise of the scanner which picks up noises is irritating. In saying that though, the Aliens and Predators sound effects are brutal and sound spot on. I think the introduction of the predator Campaign was not well-thought out. *SPOILER* They&apos;d hardly put a &apos;Young blood&apos; in some ancient pit with hordes of Aliens coming at it. They should have started with trap making and scouting first. That&apos;s not a big issue though. It&apos;s hard to &apos;score&apos; games, because a score doesn&apos;t directly show how good of a game is. 90% is considered good, but it really should be considered a masterpiece given that score. Overall the graphics are nice, sound is good in some areas, and it plays fairly well (excluding the fact that the Marine can&apos;t jump over a small railing). I think 6 is a decent score. Worth buying at about $60 Australian (as opposed to the normal $90 RR price.

However, during the alien section I had to stop playing multiple times due to almost wanting to throw up. Transitioning on walls was not a smooth process. Many times even when it told me I could it didn&apos;t work out that well. Then end boss battle was a little weak as well. Just run away shoot, run away, shoot. Repeat ten times, and you beat it.  It was a game that I had to force myself to play all the way through.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=1724373">Expand</a></span>

While with this new release of AvP, there is a very clear distinction of what is not here between the two games: Levels. If you knew what you was doing and knew how to do it precisely on the hardest difficulty, you could beat the new installment of AvP in so little time on the Alien campaign. What I really wished to see in the new installement was to go through the Alien life-cycle because that was so much fun to do. Locate the isolated host and then burst through his chest followed by having to sneak by the USCMC to feed in order to molt into your adult stage. That is what I missed in the new installment but it is minor in comparison to the levels that were missing that could&apos;ve been included. Instead though, we get top grade graphics which visually impress me and gameplay that is very easy learn and tactics that must be utilized that are somewhat similar to Metal Gear Solid  series, from MGS3 and up on consoles. I&apos;ve only lightly brushed into multiplayer and I&apos;ve found being the Aliens in multiplayer games not as bad as I&apos;ve read it. Certainly there are not a lot of dark maps that are geared to give Aliens the advantage but you can at least destroy light sources that make it harder for enemy players to spot you which from what I read is what many of the players forget that the Aliens can do. The ability to &quot;sneak&quot; up behind an enemy, USCMC and Predator alike, and kill them with a stealth kill is empowering to the player performing the stealth kill and said player can quickly get away for another stealth kill provided the slayed player&apos;s buddy(ies) are not pay attention to what is happening. There should&apos;ve been a &quot;save your friend&quot; mechanic in the multiplayer. What I mean by this is that if you noticed your friend about to be stealth/trophy killed you should be able to shoot the alien/predator down before the kill your friend to save your his life. Dedicated servers should also be set up to lower ping similar to what Valve does with their servers. Despite the flaws, I rate this game a 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=1767658">Expand</a></span>

This is further enhanced with the great sound effects that pay the movie franchises homage.<br><br>The additional campaign options of alien and predator set this game aside from most.  Something they first achieved with the original two games (AvP and AvP2).  The story lines are not as strong.  However, learning the different characters and styles keeps you interested.  The predator is most effective following a methodological attack and stealth approach and it is best to make use of the focus jump to take advantage, sneak around or get the out of a swarm of aliens or marine bullets.  On the other hand, the alien takes a bit to get used to.  The ability to crawl over walls and ceilings is fantastic but also tests your sense of direction and &apos;which way is up&apos;.  The aiming reticule works well to assist - use it.  Not as fast as AvP but still fun to sneak up and claw a marine.  Don&apos;t forget to search out and use the shadows.<br><br>This game has received several bad reviews.  I say WHY?  I agree - not being able to crouch is annoying.  But why pick on a game for re-using maps when the story line overlaps.  Most re-used maps are used in a different way and set an appropriate time line in relation to the other campaigns.  I have also never experienced any bugs (apart from the aliens) - although I only recently got into it and allowed steam to keep it up to date (I may have missed them).  In addition - I haven&apos;t checked out the multi-player yet - so no relative judgement.  GREAT USE OF DIRECT X 11 - worth upgrading your graphics card - not too expensive to pick up a DX 11 card that would run this game now.<br><br>Overall - I enjoyed it.  A great break from war shooters with great atmosphere and graphics.  I look forward to the potential sequel and would love the idea of an expansion - using the same engine just extending the campaigns.<br><br>I had trouble deciding on a 9 or 10 rating.  A little more work on the alien story line with some additional guidance on objectives would solve the occasional &apos;how the hell do you get there&apos; frustration (not really a problem for the marine or predator - but then they don&apos;t crawl over walls or ceilings and duck through mazes of vents).  Really worth a 9.5 for me :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=1432194">Expand</a></span>

The fact that you can brutally kill every oponent with some incredibly sick ways is great. But its not all mindless gore and ripping heads apart, oh no, you stil have to build a strategi, for example on the Alien campaign you got to smash out lights so you can be unseed, and on predator you can lure enemies away from their party and take them out one by one. Overall this game has nice graphics either on DX9 or DX11, it does not really mater, the achievements are also nice to get and the singleplayer offers a great experience no other game has.
<br>Now to the Multiplayer! I have to say that the multiplayer is just not worth it, the aliens are very hard to control, and everyone is just looking to brutally kill everyone and another disadvantage this game has is that you are STUCK while you finish your oponnent that means you are vulnerable for every attack for about 3-4 seconds so watch out how and when you kill your enemy. You can also choose from 3 various races (Human, Alien, Predator) and various skins for every race just to enhance gameplay.  Multiplayer is not great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=1446501">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are just amazing and game-play is great. I think this was one of the greatest games ever created for AVP. The only sad part was that there we&apos;re not many servers. I suggest this game!</span>

This does not mean I don&apos;t recognise its flaws though,  the 3 campaigns all share the same  5 maps/locations so expect to see the same things over and over which feels a bit cheap. The Marines AI is abysmal in the Aliens and Predator campaigns, the only things I had to be careful about were the androids in the later levels the combat (melee at least) is just Rock Paper Scissors and doesn&apos;t feel very satisfying. The storyline is rather bland (the standard AVP storyline). As for the multiplayer, I did enjoy infestion and predator hunt but the other modes seemed like too much of a cluster****. If you see this game on sale for under &#xC2;&#xA3;10 consider picking it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=1534500">Expand</a></span>

Single-player is very short - all three campaigns (Marine, Alien, Predator) took me 9.5 hours to finish on Normal difficulty.  Kind of barren if you consider that you play about 3 hours with each character.  Yes, there are quite some bugs plaguing the game, and the inability to adjust the FOV value immediately grants this game a (-1) from me 9a pretty lazy port, as others have pointed out).  The failure of the limited FOV is in its inability to provide the dramatic effect to the player - so many times i heard a moan and scream and could not figure out where it came from; only on second passing, from a previously saved checkpoint, would i find out that the screaming came from a very well animated marine, whose rib-cage was ripped apart by a newborn alien!  Well, such an effect is pretty hard to spot, when your Field of View is about 60 degrees - like walking and looking through a box.  For the most part, the quality of sound in this game is very high - however, the quality of performance of the dialogues and the actual effects are not that good at all.  Voice acting is not top notch, the radar clicking got on my nerves after the first two minutes of the game (not the beeping of the approaching alien, mind you - but the obnoxious clicking sound of the radar, which cannot be muted), and the in-game remarks of the marines are pretty much limited to two sentences.  I must say however, that the atmosphere is pretty well depicted, and for the most part i enjoyed going through the game.  Although so much could have been done better, so much....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=5244827">Expand</a></span>

<br>The xenomorph side was less enjoyable for me.  Probably more for play-style than for any other reason, but part of receiving directives like that from the queen didn&apos;t work for me.  I wouldn&apos;t have any idea how to represent such a communication but what I got didn&apos;t feel right to me.
<br>
<br>The predator campaign was probably my least favorite.  At no point did I really feel like the stealthy huntsman I wanted to be, but rather just a deviation toward sneaking from the standard first person gameplay.  Well...  No, that&apos;s not true...  There&apos;s some stealthy fun to be had and you can hide from the human foes easily enough.  I guess what really rubbed me wrong in this one was the advent of the super-alien at the end.  I know there&apos;s precedent for it in the setting, but I put on my grumpy old man pants and sigh when they insist on throwing something like that at me.  Particularly with the glaring gestation time inconsistencies.

<br>Oh well, game was average.  Worth it if you&apos;re paying five smackeroos.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=5542533">Expand</a></span>

It has dedicated servers and setting up a game of your own works fine. A lot of people have mics and it has an easy oneclick mute function for those annoying people. Species Team Deathmatch, Predator Hunt and Infestation are extremely fun. The three different species handle very differently from one another. It might seem unbalanced at first, but when you start understanding how to play as the different species you can win with any of them. As an Alien you can get incredible speed and jump from wall to wall with ease once you&apos;ve mastered it(it&apos;s a bit disorienting in the beginning) Thanks to this you can surprise flank your enemies and outmanouver them. Great sense of freedom and power when you get good at it.<br><br>Marines are slow but powerful and together they can be quite hard to kill with their firepower and ability to block lighter attacks. The iconic motion tracker is spooky as usual and not always reliable. They are scary to play as and do well when together in a group.<br><br>Predators are arguably the most dangerous species but they can&apos;t take that much damage. Stealth, strength and awesome weaponry and gadgets from the movies that are differently hard to master makes this the most versatile species to play as.<br><br><br>I highly recommend this game if you are into multiplayer :) The single player is good practice and it has interesting story elements that add to the universe of AVP but the characters are flat, boring and it&apos;s over very quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=2112398">Expand</a></span>

After the disappointing AvP films and having never tried one of the games I decided to let my prejudices down and give the latest iteration a go. First thing&apos;s first, this game is not worth anything more than &#xA3;5. The reason as to why I think this is that there are three campaigns on offer: Marine, Alien and Predator. Whilst all 3 are fun (im using that word loosely) only one of them campaigns was worth my time in terms of challenge and length. That particular one is the Marine campaign, a good solid FPS from start to finish with a 2-3 hour length. The the Alien one is more of a stealth kind of approach, however the alien itself is too fast and light to control making precise actions difficult and is only an hour long. The Predator is stealthy again but gives you the choice to take stealth or action in the form of melee combat, however this character has too much going on such as all the various commands for weapons, actions and movement making it easy to just get in over your head and only boasting an hour long campaign again.
<br>Had the Marine one been longer by another 2 or 3 hours or had the other 2 campaigns been substantial enough it would have scored higher but only for the reason that the Marine campaign was half decent you may as well give this game a go.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=2704909">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I wasn&apos;t immediately hooked, to be honest. I found the combat system to be clunky and difficult, though once the first level was cleared things got better (this applies to all three campaigns). Some of the gameplay and tense moments actually reminded me a lot of Condemned 2: Bloodshot. You play as either the Predator, Colonial Marines, or an Alien in three individual stories that all tie together, each with their own set of pros and cons.
<br>
<br>The story follows on from those utterly awful AvP movies, but connects it with the Alien and Predator franchise in a more cohesive way than those cinematic travesties managed. But the video game franchise of this particular crossover has been stuck as a First Person actioner since 1999 and with this next-gen incarnation I think that Sega and Rebellion should have tried a new approach.
<br>
<br>Despite the flaws, it&apos;s an enjoyable game that&apos;s very easy to play, if not finish, with plenty of trophies available.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=3822145">Expand</a></span>

I could list 100 things wrong with it, but for the sake of not reminding myself how badly developed this game was, I&apos;ll stick with just a few pet hates. 1. Marine get&apos;s a magic pistol with unlimited bullets, even though he has a melee ability.<br>2. Marines weapons magically disappear at the end of a level to be replaced by defaults. 3. Incredibly cliche and uninspired story stuck on a heavily linear and scripted single player, e.g don&apos;t bother trying to save your marine buddies, most are meant to die by design.  Alien attacks conveniently dry up once you finish some random objective as the game waits for you to move to the next section.  4. Incredibly repetitive npc marine chatter.   &quot;Don&apos;t relax just yet marines&quot; heard constantly on each campaign.<br>5. Sometimes ingame triggers fail to activate, leaving you having to kill yourself to return to an earlier checkpoint, e.g sometimes when hacking something as a marine, it&apos;ll never actually finish hacking. 6. Pressing e to do a killing move seems cool at first, and provides initial entertainment,  becomes incredibly boring once you&apos;ve seen it dozens of times and will go out your way to just beat enemy npc&apos;s to death to avoid seeing the same drawn out animation again.  7. Awful menu system with rubbish options.  8. Buggy sound system. 9. Poor amount of multiplayer maps. 10.  Npc&apos;s are pretty dumb and easy to exploit the weaknesses in the A.I to easily kill anything on any difficulty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=1968641">Expand</a></span>

What happened to sitting, crawling or crouching? This game is probably the most lazy excuse I have seen in a LONG time for a game. If Rebellion wants a real developer leader to help with gaming ideas, get a hold of me. There are some other games out there that are free and have better game mechanics then this one. A true disappointment, wow I&apos;m a pred, alien, or human, nothing special to it. Old games Like Doom had more substance to them then this one. Honestly, unless they do some major patches to fix and update game, I&apos;d suggest taking the 60$ you pay and buy some other game with same quality, take the other 55$ and buy someone you love a dinner out.

This is what happens when SEGA a producer of console games gets a hold of a PC franchise. Lets build a game for the console then map out the same controls onto a keyboard and mouse because we dont want to take the extra time (money) required to make it work better on a PC. If you bought a really nice rig and dont wish to cheapen it by playing a console like game on a computer then dont buy this game. Not enough weapon selection, marine movement is restricted to say the least, you cant even crouch. It feels like I am walking through quicksand and the jump is hilarious, or those sparks I see everytime my feet land? No wonder I cant jump, I have steel boots on lol!! No class weapons are you kidding me? You mean in multi I have to compete with 17 other players for a smartgun and grenades that respawn every 5min? Huge bullet lag, I squeeze the trigger and a half second later a bullet strikes the wall not but 1 ft ahead of me. No wheel up and down for weapon, again its for console with the pc as an after thought this also probably explains why crouch doesnt exist. Not enough buttons on the controller, forget computers have a keyboard. Wow you mean I cant even toggle wall walk off/on for aliens I guess that too would also require another button that a keyboard has but a 360/PS3 doesnt. The pred weapons are boring to say the least they all do the same thing nothing really unique about them, the trophy kills get boring quick and who wants a one hit button spam fest in multi anyway. The melee system is a joke, you auto hit people when in range of melee because rebellion thought it looked better (more realistic) than if you just have a hit box ahead of you and that you hit anything in that area you swing aim at. SEGA needs to leave the more complicated games alone and stick to sonic the freakin hedgehog. Rebellion sold out and this third bomb will cost them their reputation I hope they stick with console games because Rebellions PC venture will more than likely be a dead venture for a long time. Sega capitlized off of a pc franchise, ruined it with this pile of dung but made a ton of money on preorders due to the game being cheaply made and of course taking advantage of us PC people who were waiting 9 years for the next installment of a once untarnished franchise. Even the maps are really basic, whatever happened to being able to hide someplace away from aliens and preds?This game cant even hold a candle to AVP2. If you liked AVP2 then you will hate AVP. It is missing all the things that make a FPS a classic, but hey the graphics are neat who cares about play control right... right?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746441">Expand</a></span>

I think the fact that steam activation is required got my goat from the start. You have to have steam running and it took ages to install. Only during the never ending installation did I notice the disclamer on the back of the cover, about size 2 font, that it required steam. After Half-Life 2 I vowed never to purchase another steam game. Well years later I have been stupid enough to relent. I was looking forward to the game cos I enjoyed the AvP and AvP2 so much. The mulitplayer mode in 2 was particularly fun. This new version has not only taken a step back but turned around and run as fast as it can in the opposite direction. The overall impression that the game leaves me with is of lazy console design. The maps are poor, small and have a clunky feel. The menus are a nightmare to use. The multiplayer matchup is unseable. As for the gameplay? Lucy that I&apos;ve only played as the alien, as it was most fun in the earlier games, Its just plain broken and poor; the switch to wall walking works badly, dropping from wall walking throws you off in a stupid direction every time...C&apos;mon a simple drop and orient you upwards would have sufficed...no crouch? who thought that up?...the vents are stupid and unnecessary...th AI is the worst I&apos;ve seen in 10 years...I&apos;m starting to get bored of writing anymore about it its that bad. On the plus side it has taught me to read a game cover before I buy it as I will not give another steam game the chance to steal hours of my life for an installation and advert infested spy software to monitor my gaming. It deserves about 2, maybe 1 but gets 0 to bring its score down to something that might warn gamers off a poor title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746429">Expand</a></span>

I am really surprised that Rebellion would put their name on this game----it could ruin them. Read all the ratings folks and then decide if you should waste money on it.. What Rebellion obviously counted on was getting as many pre-orders as possible before the release, so that when the game was finally available they had their money before the ratings appeared. It&apos;s a dark and dismal game which lacks many FPS functions (such as crouch). There is absolutely nothing new about this game and it even lacks a workable multi-player experience. It&apos;s atually not as advanced as the FIRST AVP game! It is so very obvious that this game was created as fast as possible with as little creative talent as possible to save on paying high wages. Just create a lousy game and sell it using the success of the first Aliens vs Predator as the marketing tool. The AVP series is now officially DEAD. What a shame and I was really looking forward to this game. I finished all three missions in one 8 hour sitting and uninstalled this piece of junk game. Spend your money on a GOOD game---not this farce.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746586">Expand</a></span>

The solo player is not that great  because it feels vso short. The graphics look great but to bad rebellion did not put that much effort into the rest of the game. The short list of weapons for the predator and marine were very disappointing compared to the list of the first game. I don&apos;t understand why they had to change the alien controls from the first avp i thought those worked perfect. The most of the maps are two open and remind me of the second avp game, i wonder why they were more closely related to movies like the first game did. The multilayer is laggy and at times its impossible to find a server. The ups side all though few is trophy kills or being trophy killed, the feeling that any minute something is going to come up behind you and stab you in the back is a great feeling reminds me of the movies. Holding out with your friends against waves of aliens is a fun mode. There was so much more that could have been added but it feels it was just put together to quickly. I am a fan of movies which is why I somewhat enjoy this game. Hopefully one day a developer will release a real avp game again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=1386229">Expand</a></span>

One of the predators trademark positions is being cloaked and minimialized in an elevated positon. The first two AVP games had crouching, why go a step back? Why leave out options and leave plenty of buttons unused? Second of all, I can&apos;t even make it through a campaign because this is so unstable. It&apos;s worthless trying to do it regardless of technical issues because the campaigns are just so boring and have nothing to grab you. Multiplayer is crap due to it&apos;s lackluster layout and I don&apos;t like the avp game community anymore because they continue you support this juvenile attempt at entertainment.

Yes, I&apos;m aware 360 players are having a blast along with 3 or 4 very vocal apologists who bought it on Steam. But the rest of us feel ripped off. Unlike some others however, I don&apos;t mind the DX9 Unreal 3 graphics. I think they&apos;re just fine. And the Marine&apos;s SP mission is an entertaining diversion.

The single player is boring and redundant, and the multiplayer, which should have been the strongest point of the game is untested, broken, and never very much fun. Rebellion should be embarrassed to release this kind of crap under their name, but I don&apos;t think they care; they released something barely playable, and screwed at least some people out of their money. I was fairly excited over the release of this game and was extremely disappointed. What was to be a promising game was killed by an over advertising budget and an unenthusiastic dev team. There is NOTHING you can get in this game that you can&apos;t get from better-done free mods for Half-life 2. I wasted my money; don&apos;t waste yours.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=745791">Expand</a></span>

Without dedicated servers your at the mercy of all the morons out there as well. The attack seems to home in on the target even if its too far away for a melee hit. Also the weapons/ classes are not balanced due to the predators arsenal vs the humans one hit and dead life pool. Teh guns are spread way too far out and have huge respawn timers unlike the predators gear.

Looks is all this game has done well tho, probably (as someone said) using the AVP films as their main inspiration source. im a huge fan of the aliens and predator series and if you are a fan also who just hasnt bought this game yet...DONT! its just not worth it! i did not experience the overly dark screen problems some other gamers have had but i think i might darken my screen more to get some element of fear out of playing a marine! its just not scary! they have ruined it by having the aliens move so slow and giving them too much health, these aliens are morbidly obese im guessing!! less health more speed please! the combat in the avp 2 game was a total adrenaline rush! So very many awful choices have been made in this games creation! no crouching!? seriously!? predators can only use a powerfull jump by &quot;focusing&quot; to find glowing jump way points!...why restrict the players movement so much!? a marine holding his arms up will not stop a lunging aliens teeth and claws!! his arms would quickly be removed! so who thought that would be a good idea!? The marine campaign was supposed to be the best i heard but was very quickly ruined for me by the bad combat and lack of fear! also why does it take 3 head shoots to kill an alien on normal!? in the aliens film their head burst like ripened water melons on one or two shots!. i guess they had to do that as they had to give their extremely unfit, needs to go to the gym style aliens need some sort of advantage! predator campaign impressed me with the first little combat trial thing at the start, along with the hulking feel they gave to being a predator!predators and aliens stopping each others attacks i can understand but the marines should be very weak in that area! the enemy marine ai was obviously awful right from the start! also they broke the predator by giving him virtually no energy storage and no way to restore it without draining some marine tech, also gave him med kits......AVP2 had it better. and why has the amazing multi vision predator mask just turned in to thermal goggles?! where are the other visions?! AVP had 4 i was expecting more from this installment! I haven&apos;t even started the alien campaign as ive heard its the worst and may spare myself the dissapointment and just uninstall it. add to the awful game play choices the many errors and bugs many people have had, and it becomes questionable why they released this game in the state its in. So overall, i was expecting much more from this installment! It is a horrendous disappointment to realize i have waited so long for a new AVP game and this is what im presented with, combined with the thought that this sequel means there is no chance of a good version being released any time soon and i may have to wait another decade for something to beat AVP2, unless a mod that fixes the game is released.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746205">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay itself seems very dated and the controls are very clumbsy at times, verging on terrible. You will be even more unhappy if you were hoping to have a decent solo-player gaming experience, the campaigns are short and detatched from each other and overall game play is poor, due to the non existent AI. The multiplayer is where the game has its redeeming features, although the slow servers and relativly poor controls pull this element of the game down as well. I look forward to when some dedicated servers come into play. A game that had such potential does not pull it off. If it didn&apos;t have the AvP franchise attached to it, people would be investing in better FPSs, for whihc there are plenty out there</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746022">Expand</a></span>

I got the game for the title but was only able to finish it for my new sli setup. The marine camp. was just fine for the most part but the alien one was ruined by lack of challenge and poor finishing moves. The predator has been given a sever downgrade and i am really bummed out. (i hope you like fighting with claws cuz thats all you get) Aside from some clumbsy and quickly expendable &quot;special&quot; weapons you get claws and a catcall. 2 thumbs down After attempting the multiplayer and getting a feel for how the game is being treated i found myself putting this game on the shelf.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746781">Expand</a></span>

Strafing to avoid fire or enemies doesn&apos;t feel as immersive as the stellar graphics and recycled story try hard to lend you. Overall the game was fair, but lacking in content. I beat the game at a slow pace in 12 hours. Considering the price-tag, there are other games that can provide more than quadruple the amount of game time per dollar invested. Especially considering all the maps/levels are basically used 3 times. The &quot;replays&quot; with the other species don&apos;t really draw you in after you have played your first; save for the ability to try out new toys and finishing moves. I have played far worse but far better. The game didn&apos;t really provide me the experience it&apos;s predecessor(s) did 10 years ago. The multi-player is little less intriguing than the games recycled plot. It almost seems the publishing studio put out the game with the recent buzz for the series in response to the movies. The series enthusiasts will enjoy slaying and surviving at any capacity, but the hungry gamer will be left feeling lacking after completing all 3 campaigns.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746849">Expand</a></span>

If Rebellion considers it a finished game, I&apos;d give it a 0 instead of a 5. Everything it does, aside from graphics, seems to be totally incomplete and still in concept phase. Predators and marines have a horrid weapon selection, No one can crouch. Alien controls are sloppy and unrefined, totally unlike the first AvP 2000 alien. The sound effects are aweful, the smartgun sounds like a BB gun and the pred vision modes are a heartbeat instead of the traditional sounds.. (heartbeat wtf?) Im not sure weather its incompetence or just unethical purely money decision based game making but this game is lacking completely. Aside from a few very promising aesthetic touches -like aliens comming out of the walls just like in the movies - the overall Level design is wantonly short, simple, not scary, asinine and uninvolved. The voice acting is also mundane and aweful. Not only that, but the levels are recycled throughout the campaigns and you literally play thru them backwards from species to species. The menu has no music like the original games and multiplayer is just an aweful die constantly to extremely speedy insta kill spammer alien nightmare. What is really bad too, is the fact that they recycled some parts of their levels and just put them out as a &quot;map pack&quot; that costs 7 dollars. Its like who do these criminals think they are? they&apos;re just milking all the sheep for what theyre worth with a terrible, underdeveloped, talent lacking game, and its such a calamity!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746891">Expand</a></span>

Gave this game a 0 to help the overall review for the game be more realistic, pretty sure the only people giving this game a high review are getting paid to do so. This game was supposed to be a multi player game and you can see that in the single player, however there are no dedicated servers, so if you&apos;re lucky enough to even find a game then you&apos;ll have to deal with the horrible ping and constant drops. If you are dead set on playing this game in multi player make sure you have some friends that are willing to get this as well. Even then however the multi player is uninspired and pretty boring. One of the more irritating aspects of the game is the focus on melee combat and cinematic kills, once you figure out the melee mechanics it&apos;s not as annoying, but having to stand around for a few seconds to either stealth kill or trophy kill someone will irritate the shit out of you if you missed someone, who can literally stand next to you and shoot you until the animation is done, of course you&apos;ll be dead well before that, granted they are pretty cool, but get old after you&apos;ve seen them all. Going to wrap this up even though I could go on with some other flaws. If you like the aliens and predator genre buy AVP2, you&apos;ll get a better game and save alot of money. If you want a good multiplayer game, get Left 4 Dead 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=747035">Expand</a></span>

I will hope for a new AvP, but this is a waste of money for most gamers and even die hard AvP fans will find themselves hard pressed to enjoy this game. Need a better story line, or maybe just work on it for longer time period before slapping it together. Work on the character balancing, at very least remember that aliens are very dangerous but also very fragile (more speed, less health as someone else here mentions), Better AI it is suppose to be hard to be an Alien or a Predator, not just a Marine. All in all I was expecting something and Rebellion did not deliver.

Here is what is positive: + Graphics + Ambience + Singleplayer + Multiple game modes And here is what is negative: - Alien controls. The camera keeps moving around like crazy as soon as you move f.e. from wall to ceiling or run over a little rock. Causes nausea. - Matchmaking system. More later. - Slight balance issues (imho. for example the Predator&apos;s disc is way overpowered as it uses no energy and is a one-shot kill). - The map Pyramid. Dear God is it annoying. It&apos;s basically full of people who got lost running around wildly, Aliens get nausea because of the camera issue, Predators can just spam the Disc in the narrow tunnels and Marines just hope to hit whatever comes straight at them. - Scoring in Infestation. Why do only Aliens score in a game mode which humans win by staying alive??? The Matchmaking system. What is wrong with it? Well, first of all, when playing ranked, you select f.e. you want to play a Deathmatch. After hours of searching it finally finds a game you join. After more waiting, the game starts. When it ends, the game mode switches from Deathmatch to something else like Infestation. Which is just stupid. As well, there are fixed class limits, so you might be forced to play some class you don&apos;t like. Over and over again. Oh and you can&apos;t join ingame, so when you play a team deathmatch and your mates leave, well bad luck, you are alone and noone can join into the empty slots. As well, the game relies on players hosting, but allows people with the worst possible lines to host a 18 people game - who doesn&apos;t like 1000ms pings? Dedicated Servers are currently being beta-tested though, but not for ranked games.... Summary: This game has/had potential, I hope they patch it, otherwise it is a waste of money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aliens-vs-predator/user-reviews?user_review_id=746352">Expand</a></span>

Singleplayer is horrible (words cant describe how bad it is), Lag is awful, multiplayer matchmaking is worse than awful, the visuals are mediocre at best, the hit detection (perhaps due to the crippling lag) is awful, VOIP is so filled with static it&apos;s impossible to understand, there is no crouch button (what game doesn&apos;t let you crouch?), no flares for humans (even though there was supposed to be). You just die randomly, you spawn, you immediately die, rinse and repeat. The maps are the worst maps since the first avp. This is nothing more than a horribly flawed console port that should never seen the light of day. These shysters just want to dupe unsuspecting rubes into coughing up cash just because the name of the game has alien and predator in it. I say we take off and nuke the site from orbit.
