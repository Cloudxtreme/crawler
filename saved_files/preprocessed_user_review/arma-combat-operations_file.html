Most people buy this game just because of the many mods and one famous mod is DayZ  that is A-mazing. There&apos;s a few bugs here and there but the patches are great and fix a lot of them. If you want some action then you must try this game!</span>

The point is to make player know - how it is to be a soldier on battlefield, commander in tank, or pilot in a plane. Game has very interesting storyline, the oportunity to download addons is great. Of course some things have remained from Operation Flashpoint, but this also gives the feeling that it is really the sequel to previous OFP.

Personally, I&apos;m glad that games like this are still made and that BI doesn&apos;t &apos;dumb it down&apos; for the lowest common denominator like the R6 and GR franchises have chosen to do. Realistic sims are in short supply these days. You will probably either love this game or hate it. If you liked OFP I don&apos;t see how you could not like this sim. The replay factor is infinite as there are already tons of user made mods out for it already and multiplayer is unique (horay coop!).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-combat-operations/user-reviews?user_review_id=396097">Expand</a></span>

The ACE mod is a fan required mod for this game, after that.. its only a matter of finding the right server to play in, hooah!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-combat-operations/user-reviews?user_review_id=424574">Expand</a></span>

I guess they are trying to go for reality and all but the game is just too hard, too slow, and leaves you with a WHAT look on your face.

If they wanted it to be a multiplayer experience why try to pass the broken AI in this game as something other than a broken PoS? My squad mates creep me out the models are so weird looking. This game really could be good if the AI was more evolved than space invaders. Who cares how advanced or hardcore the crap is when your squadmates walk around like imbeciles bumping into walls and shouting enemy spotted but they are looking up in the sky. BAD AI. BAD. Won&apos;t get burned again with this **** game **** Arma 2 **** Bohemia **** ARMA **** Flashpoint **** **** games with **** AI.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-combat-operations/user-reviews?user_review_id=1599468">Expand</a></span>

With the most detailed island ever, its masive. The only problem, if your computer cost less than &#xA3;2000, then dont try and run it past medium. It&apos;s that good!</span>

It&apos;s almost more simulation than game, and yet the game elements work together to give a whole that is greater than its parts. Do you want a wargame with maps 400sq. kilometers in size? It literally takes almost two hours to run from one end of the main island to the other. Harrier jets, many helicopters, tanks, HMMVs, even civilian cars and trucks and motorcycles are available and handle realistically. Infantry combat in this game is a different affair than the Hollywood style combat of Battlefield 2. It&apos;s common for firefights to take place at ranges greater than 500 meters. The a.i. is very realitic and good, if you can see them they will likeliy be able to see you, and probably already have. They plan flanking maneuvers regularly and surprise often. Knowing that it only takes one well placed bullet to end your game makes this a very intense experience. I can&apos;t remember the last time my heart beat this hard and my palms sweat this much while playing a &quot;game&quot;.
<br>
<br>One of the other comments made by Tango was &quot;Nowhere near as satisfying as the Call of Duty series&quot;. I beg to differ. If you &quot;can&quot; survive the missions the infitely more satisfying than a run and gun shooter that is CoD, in which there is no challenge.
<br>
<br>If your idea of a fun game is one where you don&apos;t need to worry about dieing because you can just reload from a few seconds ago, there&apos;s really no challenge, and there&apos;s hardly any realism to speak of, stay far away from this game.
<br>
<br>This is the only 1st person shooter game that supports the TrackIR device so you can actually aim in one direction while looking in another, for an almost virtual reality type experience. Here&apos;s a video of this in action:

<br>And here&apos;s a great trailer video for the game:

It&apos;s extremely bothersome to command 18 troops to board different vechicles and sometimes it&apos;s even more troublesome to get them to move properly in formation. Trucks move too slowly and HMMWVs move too quickly. I also remember times where a particular soldier refused to stay in the truck, jumping out and going on foot every time I told all of them to move. It also dosen&apos;t help that the learning curve is so steep - 70% or so of mainstream gamers will likely give up even before they finish their first mission. The extreme difficulty sometimes add to the fun. It&apos;s extremely satisfying to (finally) successfully down a man at 200 meters with an M4. But you can&apos;t blame Bohemia Interactive studios for that - they do not have support by big name publishers such as EA or the newly-formed Activision Blizzard. Right out the box, at version 1.0, the game is a nightmare. I can&apos;t remember how many times the game simply crashed to the desktop because I tried to swim across a small lake. Watching how your computer computer struggles to drive a truck out of a tight corridor - causing you many deaths - is no less than frustrating. Thankfully, the game is being kept alive in a similar way to how Blizzard&apos;s Warcraft III is kept alive - through community-made content. You could always find some great mods or someone online to play with - and the best thing is, due to the inherent &quot;inaccessibilty&quot; to the game, you will find very few, if any, whiny prepuberscent players to spoil your experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-combat-operations/user-reviews?user_review_id=418028">Expand</a></span>

That is, it tries to be realistic instead of just saying it on the box. It&apos;s harsh and unforgiving, and I guarantee that you will die numerous sudden and unexpected deaths even after you get to grips with it. War is hell, after all.</span>

Personally, I prefer games that don&apos;t seem to be telling me that war is great fun, and in which small pieces of metal coming at me at supersonic speeds seem to do little more than irritate me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-combat-operations/user-reviews?user_review_id=395975">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a simulation, not an arcade game (I like the more arcade-like BF series too). In ArmA there are all times of day simulated. The sun will set, or rise, rain and thunderstorms pass, etc. The night battles scenes can be quite spectacular - like a real battle! The night vision goggles are really cool. The graphics can be bland or quite amazing, depending on what you are looking at (just like real life). For example if you are on a hill overlooking a village, you can see the whole village (amazing sight) and far beyond. The detail level of the map is very good. Details like playgrounds with sandboxes, well done electrical substations and apartment buildings that have many rooms to shoot from are well done. It seems to be one gigantic map where many different battle configurations can be had in many villages. The game has a lot of promise. It is being patched to address the pressing issues. It&apos;s a huge game and if you assume after ten minutes the game isn&apos;t your cup of tea, but you like FPS games, you didn&apos;t give it long enough. There&apos;s a lot to discover in this game! It&apos;s deep and rewarding! B.I. is working to improve it apparently. The game is highly modifiable. For example there is a free mod to play the game online in RTS mode like Company of Heroes, except of course that you play a soldier. You can command at least 32 AI players in this mod too. Each base you capture in this RTS mode gathers resources (like CoH), etc. ArmA has the potential to become a real classic. After playing many FPS games (including the BF series) it&apos;s very nice to have a huge battlefield area like in ArmA. Cons: The learning curve for ArmA is quite steep for beginners and interface is often non-intuitive. The game doesn&apos;t hold your hand. Be patient. The game can behave in ways that you didn&apos;t intend but as you learn the interface that goes away. As of mid-May 2007, it does need some improvements (patches) to be a great game. There are significant issues (bugs, etc) with ArmA C.O. but no show-stopper bugs. On my nVidia 7600GT the computer AI soldiers can see me long before I see them, so I die before I have a real chance to kill them. So I play online against real people (I avoid coop mode servers obviously) to have a better chance. There are definite &apos;base camping&apos; issues online, much like the BF series. However your &apos;home base&apos; area can not be camped, which is good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-combat-operations/user-reviews?user_review_id=397898">Expand</a></span>

This was probably a tradeoff in favor of low CPU overhead, which is forgivable. AI can be enhanced with mods. Patches address the single-player mission glitches. The mods for this game are amazing. Some terrific effects mods, tons of new weapons and vehicles, and so on. Like Operation Flashpoint, the mod community is huge. The multiplayer is a lot of fun. I&apos;ve been playing this more than any of my other games for at least two months. I went back to single player recently and even that seemed much easier than it did initially, so there is a learning curve. You do need a level of patience since this is not a run-and-gun game. Overall, it&apos;s a 9 (-1 for minor glitches).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/arma-combat-operations/user-reviews?user_review_id=412917">Expand</a></span>
