2. Weapon choices/balance.</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">There is so much potential here that I hope is realized in future updates. Paradox has released a game that has little content, and some day-1 DLC that costs more than the game. Not a good start.
<br>
<br>1. Level size. Much too small, especially given this is a naval strategy game. Give us some open water to work with and it would improve the game immensely!
<br>
<br>2. Weapon choices/balance. Because of claustrophobic levels and minimum firing distances, the weapons designed for longer range combat are crippled. Artillery is entirely useless. Rockets are OP, as you can load up a ship with them and carpet bomb enemies with impunity. I hope they fix the weapons so that filling ships with rockets and/or the smallest cannons is no longer the only real option.
<br>
<br>3. A.I. It&apos;s pretty bad. They frequently run themselves ashore and die. Their railgun accuracy is horrible except at point blank range, which works out because they LOVE to come flying out of the fog and crash into you, causing as much or more damage to themselves as they do to your ship. Sure it&apos;s funny and all, but it makes no sense as a naval tactic, and it further invalidates long range weapons.
<br>
<br>4. Hulls. There are barely any, unless of course you pay $10 for two DLC&apos;s to unlock some that should have come with the game. The points system is pretty cool, but we need more choices!
<br>
<br>5. Content. The campaign was short and pretty boring, even during co-op with friends. The challenges are basically tower defense levels. Altogether it&apos;s 5-8 hours depending on skill and how much lag you experience (if playing co-op). I&apos;m sure Paradox has plans to release additional campaigns/challenges, but I suspect it will be more overpriced DLC. It would be great if there was a way to set up your own levels against A.I., but there isn&apos;t. There&apos;s little incentive to replay anything, and online matchmaking is pretty barren, even so soon after release.
<br>
<br>There is a good foundation here that I really hope they expand on. Sadly, right now the game just isn&apos;t much fun. Balance is not good, content is lacking, interface and graphics are nothing special.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leviathan-warships/user-reviews?user_review_id=3147312">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are good, with the big naval guns having a lot of weight to them. There isn&apos;t all that much single player content, and what there is really needs to be played coop anyway. Hopefully more will be added over time, but as it is I&apos;d say it&apos;s currently worth the money.</span>

<br>This puts Paradox right up there with EA in terms of shady practices.  Not something I ever expected from them, hence I bought it without waiting for a review.  My mistake.  Won&apos;t happen again, Paradox.  For that matter, you won&apos;t ever get my money again without an apology for this product.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leviathan-warships/user-reviews?user_review_id=3144635">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Everything is controlled via click-and-drag with no right click shortcut menus, there are no hotkeys (besides space for commit) to speak of, the tutorial has you commit 2 turns before even allowing you to move and I have a sneaking suspicion that server side load makes committing moves even in the single-player tutorials incredulously slow (up to a minute in length) to the point of tearing my hair out.
<br>
<br>Playing offline is a lot more responsive and I managed to have some fun in single player campaign but offline mode is naturally quite limited and since you don&apos;t log in it doesn&apos;t save the progress you make to your warships account.
<br>
<br>As a PC game, I expected better of this. Shame on you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/leviathan-warships/user-reviews?user_review_id=3137820">Expand</a></span>
