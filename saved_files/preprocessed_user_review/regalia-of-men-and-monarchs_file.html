<br>
<br>Regalia represents one of my favourite genres - the tactical RPGs. Maybe that is why I had very high hopes for this title. Unfortunately, the game didn&apos;t quite come through.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+ it is very pretty and voice acting is quite decent
<br>+ the castle-building and relationship-developing parts are fun
<br>+ there&apos;s some charm to the characters and their dialogues, there&apos;s some comedy, some witty remarks, it reminds me a little of Disgaea, which is great, but...
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- ...the story is so tedious I felt no drive whatsoever to find out what happens next. The premise is uninteresting and so is the development of the story. Frankly, the story seemed like just an excuse for grinding out gold, EXP and items. Unfortunately, that&apos;s the style of a low-level jRPGs.
<br>- combat pacing is dreadful. Everything is so slow. And I don&apos;t mean the movement of the characters (which you can change with one click), but the pacing overall. Each battle takes around 10-15 minutes to complete, and believe me - it&apos;s 5-10 minutes too long. Our heroes and their adversaries exchange never-ending blows, which makes combat a drag. This is important as fighting will take around 50% of game time.
<br>- the tactical side isn&apos;t particularly interesting either. Our heroes powers don&apos;t really give us a lot to go on, and very often it&apos;s just about which party can outlast the other (literally, healing - or rather armoring up - seems almost too important). There is very little room for improvisation.
<br>
<br>All in all Regalia is an ok game, but not much more. If you&apos;re a die hard fan of tactical RPGs, and you&apos;re looking for a pearl in the likes of Final Fantasy Tactics or Jeanne D&apos;Arc from PSP, you might be disappointed. If you&apos;re just looking for any tactical game with a lighter side to it, you might just hit the paydirt.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/regalia-of-men-and-monarchs/user-reviews?user_review_id=7323403">Expand</a></span>
