The single player campaign is very intense and really refelcts the Warhammer: 40, 000 lore. The RPG elements of it make u attached to ur units and the pursuit of better wargear really has u coming back for more. The option to be evil and become corrupt or noble and stay true to the Space Marines, also adds to the replayability of the SP campaign. The SP campaign has also ditched some of the tedious missions from the original, it has some really unique missions that are the best i&apos;ve seen since Warcraft 3!!(none of that uninspired &quot;destroy enemy base to win the mission&quot; type stuff, really unique mission designs). l Multiplayer has been imrpoved w/ the addition of Chaos faction, which in itself is a badass and exciting faction to play. All users recieve the new units that come with CR for all the other factions, and the addition of new unis for last stand and free for all MP mode makes this a must have game. Relic is renowned for continuing to support its games after releasing it, unlike other developers, and DoW2 and Company of Heroes are testaments to that fact! Graphics are absolutely gorgeous and u dont need a power house of a computer to enjoy them, its without a doubt the best looking RTS on the market. Sound is exciting and heart thumping &amp; add to the atmosphere. W/ all that said, this is without a doubt the best expansion i&apos;ve played in ages. If u loved DoW2 this is a must buy, if u love RTS games this is a must buy, and if didnt care for the original it&apos;ll definitly suck u in w/ all the additions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii---chaos-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=746672">Expand</a></span>

Dawn of War II had almost everything I like in video games: strategy, good pacing, character choice, and involving characters. The story in DOW II was good, and Chaos Rising doesn&apos;t disappoint in that regard. The new chaos race is a blast to play as and the upgrades to the other races are very welcome. In the single player, 10 more levels and the corruption system add depth and more choices. So while the campaign is pretty freaking short, it&apos;s easily replayable. I guess the shortness of the campaign could be the only weakness in this package, but come on people, it&apos;s an expansion pack! A company with a more renowned name might have released something like this as a sequel. Accept it for what it is: an expansion pack. For half the price of a regular game, I say this is a good deal. If you liked Dawn of War II, you will love Chaos Rising.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii---chaos-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=747012">Expand</a></span>

Anybody who complains that the 8 - 10 hour campaign is too short (especially for $30!) are just spoiled and can&apos;t appreciate how packed and carefully crafted the whole experience feels. Especially if people generally agree that a 4 - 6 hour campaign for Modern Warfare 2 is worth $70.</span>

However, ever negative element of that game is gone now - singleplayer is more creative, free additions to multiplayer, a new race, and its more balanced than ever. I highly reccomend this game if your computer can run it.</span>

I can&apos;t see how anyone could review the SP and come away with a positive rating, because it just doesn&apos;t deserve it. There are a couple of action packed missions towards the very end, but where the first campaign relied heavily on tactical strategy and abilities, the chaos campaign relies on drag selecting all your units and flinging them into battle. There&apos;s a bit more subtlety, but without the space to flank or cover to hide behind, the experience is mind numbing. Take into account that dow2 players without the expansion received all the new maps and new units for the other four factions free, and there isnt much motivation to buy this game. If you have $30 around and want to play chaos (its an incredibly fun faction) then go ahead and get it, but for everyone else, I&apos;d recommend waiting till they sell the expansion and the original together in a 30$ deal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii---chaos-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=747059">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m also incredibly sore over the fact that no matter what you do, you are playing Codex Blood Ravens online. I DEMAND to know where my chaplain is. I can lay the same complaints against the other races; where is my brood-lord, where are the other eldar exarchs.... Obviously theres some legal reasons for this one, becuase lawyers are nice like that, but I really wish Slaanesh was there too. Overall, these complaints would give it a score of 8/10. So why am I being vitriolic with a 4/10? Campaign is awful. The story is miserable and the missions between beginning and end incredibly short. Even after having listend to everyone on the missions, I often found myself running around without a clue of what i was doing. And then theres my problem with the voice acting, which was bad in the last one, but in chaos rising its just plain awful. The onyl redeeming feature on the campaign is the corruption factor. I found the librarian incredibly useless. I had and still have no motivation for using him. bah, im done whining.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii---chaos-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=746632">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game has such poor pathing, poor controls, poor AI and even worse game mechanics
<br>
<br>Poor cover system - It takes 2-3 tries to get the positioning you need on the cover, very frustrating
<br>
<br>Gimmicky missions like the final mission, includes preserving the blood raven army, however, the AI does not know how to revive the tanks, or to restore squads.
<br>
<br>Ativus as a ranged DPS, is pathed in such a way that he keeps taking a step forward when in range
<br>
<br>Targeting is bad too, with the inaccurate target, clicking on the enemy for an atk, sometimes does not trigger the skill or atk, but instead they move towards the enemy.
<br>
<br>Destroying enemy production buildings, doesn&apos;t do anything, as the enemy continue to summon units, wasting time for you to march in to destroy them.
<br>
<br>Really cannot recommend this game, unless you enjoy Warhammer 40k story line and lore</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii---chaos-rising/user-reviews?user_review_id=5355839">Expand</a></span>

Main story is interesting and really well directed, we got more subplots and backstories about some characters. The loot is WAY more satisfying, something for the RPG fans but also for strategists who were disappointed by the low level of difficulty of DoW II.</span>
