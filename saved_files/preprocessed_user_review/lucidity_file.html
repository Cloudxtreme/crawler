Only after I wasted $10 on the game did I realize that the game itself is frustrating and boring. The point of the game is to put puzzle pieces before Sofi&apos;s path to keep her safe from falling to her death or various monsters. This quickly became difficult, which is normally not a problem for me until I realize that I have to go all the way back from the beginning of the map to start over. I believe this game was simply attempting to ride on the success of Braid as an Indie game but failed horribly. Please do not waste your money on this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lucidity/user-reviews?user_review_id=742087">Expand</a></span>
