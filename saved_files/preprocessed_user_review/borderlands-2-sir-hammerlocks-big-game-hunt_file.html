I&apos;m hoping that the fourth DLC would be substantially better, and possibly even cover the Hyperion space station obstructing the moon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2-sir-hammerlocks-big-game-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=2900444">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s fairly short, the characters and humor aren&apos;t as good as past entries. Still it&apos;s fun while it lasts. That being said, some things you should know. As others have stated previously, this DLC is difficult. I&apos;d say be at level 35 at least before heading in. I can see some people rage quitting after being killed by a witch doctor for the umpteenth time. On the positive side to that I found I used the rocket launcher and shotgun a TON more than any other previous entry which was kinda &quot;new&quot; for me. Also used &quot;slag&quot; weaponry/grenades ALOT more. Another irksome thing was having completed a side quest having to go through waves of re-spawned enemies in an already cleared area just to complete it! It didn&apos;t bother me alot but others may find it unacceptable.
<br>
<br>Aergus itself is a tad barren with not a ton of different areas//buildings to check out, but again not that big a deal for me.
<br>
<br>Loot drops are pretty consistent with other entries.
<br>
<br>NOTE!
<br>I played this in TVH mode starting at level 38, so the &quot;normal&quot; mode may differ a bit but probably not much.
<br>
<br>All in all a decent DLC worth a go, but I feel is better suited to more hardcore players. Casual fans may pass and shouldn&apos;t feel like they missed much.
<br>
<br>Did I mention to have a rocket launcher and grenades fully stocked at all times?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2-sir-hammerlocks-big-game-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=2904649">Expand</a></span>

Add in one Witch Doctor, and be prepared for second winds and respawns. However, roll in with a higher level toon (I took in a lvl 50 Berzerker with legendary weapons) and had no problems whatsoever. Cakewalk even. So balance right off the bat is screwey. I would rather go through this DLC with my mid level Mechromancer to work towards getting that toon to lvl 50. But it seems infuriating to the point of not being worth it. For the little time I&apos;ve spent with the rest of the DLC, Hammerlock is an OK character, but isn&apos;t as well suited as a main focus for DLC as he just isn&apos;t quite as engaging or funny. All in all, this season pass seems like a great big letdown. I played through Captain Scarlette (which I liked, good balance and such but no new gear worth getting). I played through Torgue, but I didn&apos;t care much for it. Torgue tokens were a good idea, but the weapons were lackluster. This seems like the weakest DLC of the three. They seem to keep getting worse. I&apos;m almost afraid to see what&apos;s coming out as the 4th DLC from the season pass. If Gearbox has better content up their sleeves, they are taking their sweet time. Hopefully we get one reaaaallly solid last DLC for the 4th DLC in the season pass. Otherwise, I&apos;m going to have a hard time spending extra money on more DLC outside of this season pass as it&apos;s slowly been leaving a sour taste in my mouth with each new release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2-sir-hammerlocks-big-game-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=2947191">Expand</a></span>

The other expansion packs have been quite interesting but it seems that this and the new +11 level ultra pack2 just plain suck. If you&apos;re buying this on Steam with the season pass I guess it&apos;s worth it, but I recommend playing this pack with low expectations. The pirate expansion, the arena battles, and other packs are far better made. thumbs down!</span>

                                        <span>Fairly short main story, some side quests to keep you busy. I went in with a level 50 character and end game gear and i didnt have much of a problem so i cant talk a lot about the difficulty though i can see how some enemies can be fairly annoying for lower level characters. Dissapointing overall I expected a lot more from this DLC, it had a lot of potential!</span>

It would seem that this is an enemy meant for no other purpose than to be annoying as all hell. Burn it down to 75% health.... heals its self to full. Burn it down to 50% health.... It heals its self most of the way to full then turns into an invincible tornado that is almost a 1 shot kill, heals its self and then summons a bunch of enemies. Then on top of this it has as much health as some of the mini bosses (if not more), is pretty much immune to melee, is totally immune to head shots, and is able to heal not only its self but every other enemy on the damn map every 10 seconds (it summons most of these and upgrades them to badasses too).  Not even 30 minutes in and I have rage quit and have no intention of returning to this DLC.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2-sir-hammerlocks-big-game-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=3038318">Expand</a></span>

I traveled in &quot;normal&quot; mode to Aegrus with a Mechromancer level 33 (Anarchy build), a level 30 Impaler shield and level 30 purple weapons. My first fight with the witch doctor at the catch-a-boat location was so frustrating (although I had about 100 anarchy stacks), that I rage-quited the game. Why? You can&apos;t headshot a witch doctor. He is partially immune against melee attacks. He heals the mob, even far away from him. He has a nearly one-shot kill ability. He has all sort of elemental attacks. He is a bullet sponge. I don&apos;t know, why Gearbox thinks, every DLC has to be harder and more frustrating. It seems, that this DLC is for hardcore players only. But there are normal players out there. I like Borderlands 2, therefore 4 points. The DLC is not worth a point at all. Sit down Gearbox and think about it. I think, it&apos;s time to quit playing Borderlands 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2-sir-hammerlocks-big-game-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=2894852">Expand</a></span>

They ruined whole game first with months of waiting for level cap. There was no point to play for people who had characters on level 50. And after that  &quot;Sir Hammerlock DLC&quot;. That is probably dullest and pointless DLC in gaming history. Further, it seems to me that they are targeting new content specially for coop play which produce pretty stupid gameplay for us which do not play in parties!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2-sir-hammerlocks-big-game-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=3238536">Expand</a></span>

It does get a little bit boring and the main quest doesnt feel grandiose enough - something that u would expect from Sir Hammerlock. Nonetheless - a must for any BL Fan :)</span>

And yes, there are only 3 chapters in this DLC. I believe in the Pirate&apos;s Booty DLC, there were 13. And in the Mr. Torque DLC, I believe it was around the same. Good, story, but WAY too short. 3 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/borderlands-2-sir-hammerlocks-big-game-hunt/user-reviews?user_review_id=3092125">Expand</a></span>

I love Sir Hammerlock as a character, but his DLC&apos;s gameplay is full of grindy collection sidequests and annoying level design. There are some interesting new enemies, as well as the returning Drifters from the Secret Armory add-on of the first game. I personally enjoy the idea of having airboats- but they constantly get stuck on level architecture worse then the base game&apos;s cars do and are just a pain overall to use.
