It needs a big title to help push it along to give it more appeal to others. Evochron Mercenary has great replay value as well.

<br>It took lots of reading and learning and many slow hours of going from gate to gates just to get a map of the place. Mercenary is a lot faster to get things moving. Mercenary might seem like the same slow start at first but it is only the beginning few hours that are hard.
<br>The learning curve may seem a little steep at first but when you start to get the hang of things the fun just keeps on building. This game doesn&apos;t have the same level of depth as the likes of X3 but it has the fun that I never found in any other space game since Elite back on the Amiga.
<br>
<br>Yes the amount of different missions can seem small and they can get repetitive but there a many different ways or techniques to complete missions so even the same missions over again can be very entertaining.
<br>Mercenary has a lot to offer but a lot of the really nice  things don&apos;t always become apparent until after a good few hours of play.
<br>Combat that seems impossible at first becomes gradually easier as you learn different ways to fight and fly.
<br>There is so much to find, so much to explore, even after weeks I am still learning new things. Having a good multi player universe gives this game a lot of extra life. Player dogfights and battles can be amazingly good fun and the community online is one of the friendliest I have ever seen.
<br>
<br>The graphics are not the best by today&apos;s standards but they have nice  artistic feel to them and frame rates are smooth even on my low/mid spec system.
<br>There are lots of user mods available to improve the look and being easy to mod it has even inspired me to make some small PIT/HUD  mods.
<br>Basically, to me it is an old school type space game sim with newer-ish  graphics and a decent multi-play component.
<br>It all adds up to loads of fun and many hours of play time that make the price worth ever cent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evochron-mercenary/user-reviews?user_review_id=2143460">Expand</a></span>

I think that some of the negative reviews are completely dishonest, which is expected whenever a solid indie title outstrips popular mainstream games. There is indeed a steep learning curve as the tutorial covers the basics and you find yourself dumped into the vast emptiness of space with no idea of what to do next, however the community more than makes up for any shortcomings in that area. A few questions on the forums and most players are up and running in no time at all.<br><br>This game is aimed more toward simulation enthusiasts than it is regular gamers. Mainstream gamers tend to struggle with sandbox games having become accustomed to other types of games. While Mercenary does feature a quest, the player is forced to decide their own path in a game that has no ending and no levels. This can easily lead to frustration and boredom.<br><br>This game lacks massive multiplayer capability with players being capped at 35 per server. Some have compared it to EVE, however this community lacks the obnoxious persons ( likely due to small numbers) and the combat requires player skill rather than buying the biggest ship and clicking on the enemy but this game also lacks an in depth crafting scheme which EVE possesses. Still, they are different games with different target audiences.<br><br>I think players should appreciate that this game was created by a single person, not a small development team and yet this person still actively supports and updates the game and provides timely technical support for his customers. Good luck getting that from EA. I have read reviews speaking of crashes and game breaking bugs, none of which I have ever experienced. It is possible that the initial release on Steam was broken.<br><br>While Evochron Mercenary is a demanding game, there is a lot to enjoy about it. It is a vast, ever evolving universe, ripe for exploration and exploit. The nearly seamless transition between single and multiplayer is a unique and welcome feature.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evochron-mercenary/user-reviews?user_review_id=2346210">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&#x2019;ve played many space-sims (EVE, X-series, etc) but this one has held my attention the longest. Also, the game is made by one guy  I mean how cool is that. At $25, it&apos;s pretty much a steal, especially for the hours of enjoyment you&apos;ll get out of it. Just download the demo first to see if it&apos;s the kind of game you&apos;d like to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evochron-mercenary/user-reviews?user_review_id=3168645">Expand</a></span>

<br>You will like this game if you like X3, Freelancer, Freespace, Dwarf Fortress, scouring forums for lore and tips, and are not afraid of frustation (it&apos;s no Dark Souls though), camping, nerding out and role-playing with friends and/or complete strangers, trekking.
<br>
<br>If using almost every key in the keyboard for controlling various parts of your ship sounds like too much, go away, this is not for you.
<br>If you are not prepared to actually read the damn manual, then this is not for you.
<br>If you expect waypoints to tell you where to go and what to do, go away.
<br>If you need a game to have a storyline to play along, I&apos;m sorry (and this is something I do regret of this game).
<br>
<br>This is very similar to X3, although immensely more immersing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evochron-mercenary/user-reviews?user_review_id=2619181">Expand</a></span>

You can trade, fight, explore, upgrade your ship etc. You can dock at space stations and even descend to cities on planets which is great. Graphics and textures are not AAA quality but they are more than adequate. Since purchasing the game the dev has continued to improve the game and release free updates so all in all two big thumbs up.</span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s clear the developer really gets the genre and a lot of love has gone into the game. If you loved freelancer you&apos;ll probably love this game.
<br>
<br>That said, there are a couple of legitimate issues such as the second quest mission; the race. It is pretty difficult for a second mission and the opponent&apos;s shields seem to push you out the way a lot. You&apos;ll probably have to take a few goes at it to get it completed. My advice is to save at the station BEFORE you accept the mission so you can at least start back with fuel etc.
<br>
<br>The graphics look pretty nice to me, but as a programmer and game engine author, I can appreciate the beauty in the code that perhaps regular gamers are not so forgiving on. $25 is absolutely NOTHING for this game  the dev isn&apos;t gonna be a millionaire from it and if you care about supporting creative talent and good gameplay, this is definitely worth buying. If you&apos;re looking for a triple-A HD graphics bonanza that doesn&apos;t care about the playability or control system at all, buy X3 instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evochron-mercenary/user-reviews?user_review_id=3171154">Expand</a></span>

Do you like a challenge?  Do you like to learn?  Or are you looking for &quot;instant gratification&quot;?  If you your answer is yes to the first two questions and no to the third, then continue reading.  Overall, EM is cross between games such as Freelancer, EVE, and Privateer with even a bit of Wing Commander thrown in for good measure.  Sure it is open sandbox space simulation trading game with combat, but it has continued to grow as the years have rolled by.  It still garnishes updates and support even though the series has been running for over 11 years.  Yes, that is right folks, it has been around for over a decade.  So why have you not heard of this series?  Simply because the game was developed by one person in indie development, and it has never had the big budget of a AAA title.  However, there is another reason.  Difficulty.  There is no doubt that you do need to spend some time to adjust and learn the controls, just like if you were learning to fly a plane or play an acoustic guitar.  If you are committed to taking the time to learn, the rewards are immense, as you will appreciate the vastness of the Evochron Universe, and enjoy finding all sorts of unusual surprises in the deep, deep space.  I give an extra kudo to planet landing as many have said this is the only game I can remember in the past 20 years to actually pull this off seamlessly.  The really only unfortunate part of this simulation is you really do have to have an imagination, as there really are no true &quot;goals&quot; which can lead to boredom.  Mastering the aspect of zero gravity combat and inertial flight is quite a challenge but certainly not impossible.  Use with a joystick and throttle is highly recommended, although mouse implementation for movement is well executed.  The bottom line here is FPS players need not apply, as this is more of a &quot;simulator&quot; than a Wing Commander shooter.  The best option for a space combat-trading-exploration simulator other than X series until Star Citizen is eventually released.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evochron-mercenary/user-reviews?user_review_id=3466379">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The control of your ship never seems quite right, and you find yourself constantly &quot;sliding&quot; everywhere. I have no problem playing space games with inertial dampeners off, but something about this just feels wrong - it takes forever to make course changes if you have any kind of speed.
<br>
<br>The developer is absolutely brilliant though. I visited their forums to ask some questions and instantly got a reply from the developer, who implemented a new mechanic to the game based on my questions and feedback. I was stunned at how welcoming and kind the community is for this game. That alone is worth its weight in gold.
<br>
<br>A good game, that could be a great game.

While it may not have the depth of control like X3, it certainly is a bit easier to learn and play... which made it more fun for me. The multiplayer component is what truly helps this game earn a 9, and not just an 8. The available internet servers allow for friends to jump in together using their saved profile from the single player game, so you don&apos;t have to worry about managing multiple players. If you prefer to host your own server, you can go ahead and throw one up for your friends to connect using Direct IP. While most might recommend EVE for multiplayer, I&apos;m there to have fun... not worry about how another player&apos;s actions might affect me. Combat is fast and very active on the user&apos;s part, mining is simple and easy to do to earn some good cash, and the economy of the different star systems is affected by what happens in the world. Overall I find this to be a great game that sits just right when games like X3 appear overly much..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evochron-mercenary/user-reviews?user_review_id=1529493">Expand</a></span>

The graphics have a very dated look, but it doesnt detract too much from the game&apos;s fun. Alas, not long after you have mastered the game&apos;s steep learning curve, you realize you have already experienced all the game&apos;s content. For any readers familiar with it, X3 is harder to learn, but will keep you coming back for much longer than Evochron will. In Evochron, once you&apos;ve been to one planet, one carrier, and one station, and flown most all the ships, you will already being to feel like you&apos;ve seen it all. The game advertises how diverse its missions are, but each mission type is so straightfoward it very rapidly feels more like a series of errands, rather than missions. There is almost nothing to make you feel attached to any location or planet or faction. However, the newtonian space battles, as well as the always-fun element of getting to upgrade to shinier, faster, bigger ships, keep this game fun for a notable length of time. I would recommend nabbing this one for $10-$15 depending on the size of your wallet, $20-$25 if you love space combat sims.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evochron-mercenary/user-reviews?user_review_id=2112449">Expand</a></span>

If you play, go to the online servers, because then you can talk to people, and most people want to play with you and just get the whole community involved because its deep dark lonely space. Its worth a try in my opinion, not exactly my flavour.</span>

The game delivers pretty much what it states. I found the flight physics pretty refreshing from the typical &apos;point and shoot&apos; simulators. Also, the seamless flow from system to system of from space to planet surface was a pretty neat change from most games of the genre. The graphics are pretty blah, even though I have all the settings on their highest. That alone doesn&apos;t bother me, but I have found some of the screenshots and trailer vids to be misleading. My largest and greatest complaint is the amount of bugs and crashes I experienced. Most would counter with, &quot;what do you expect with a privately developed indie game,&quot; blah blah. Unless a game is free, I expect it to at least work. The problem is that a lot of the bugs you may not even realize you&apos;re experiencing. A lot of the rendered objects and menu options flip out on me, and unless you know there supposed to be there, you don&apos;t miss them. I also experience frequent crashes, which is extrememly uncharacteristic for my system. This game gets an A+ for imagination and creativity, but a D- on execution. If you don&apos;t mind donating $20 to support the indie industry, this game is for you. Otherwise, go take your grandma out for a burger.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evochron-mercenary/user-reviews?user_review_id=2112889">Expand</a></span>

I find that as a Combat Pilot starting form the carrier, the contracts offered are usually much too difficult and only server to make your blood pressure rise from death after death.  The Developers of this title are not cognisant enough of the difficulty level to use the beginner contracts as tools for the player to have fun whilst learning the game.  Instead, they opt to make the experience as miserable and frustrating as possible while simultaneously failing to actually teach you how to play.

Same game engine it appears to be, only I couldn&apos;t find any FPS in the game, not that I was looking very hard.  Too busy trying to figure out how to get from point A to be B safely.  The in game radio chatter is a total nuissance.  I got the great impression that the makers of this game were trying to compete with X3 Terran Conflict, but failed miserably.  The missions are few, and pay very little, and the learning curve for this game is pretty high, so I wouldn&apos;t expect to jump right into it anytime soon.  I&apos;m alright with the game engine, I would rather have ok graphics with a game that does a bit of everything than a souped up game with all the bugs.  But my personal opinion of this game, is it could have gone so much farther, if the developer would have been me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/evochron-mercenary/user-reviews?user_review_id=2111140">Expand</a></span>

Reloading takes literally 5 minutes on my alienware PC.  WTF?  The price tag on this game is a huge rip off. It&apos;s not worth more than 5 bucks at the most.</span>

Piloting the ship is relatively straightforward once you figured out the key combinations and the space travel physic is quite accurate (In space that is, not when landing on a planet)  but, beyond this, I have nothing good to say about this game. The game play choices are clear, either boring or nearly impossible to achieve. Too many programming shortcuts were taken in the making of this game. Safe for the player&apos;s information, nothing is saved. The same fighting mission stated number of foes will change every time after restoring a saved game. Regardless, you can never trust the information provided. The estimated number of enemy ships as nothing to do with the actual number of foes you&apos;ll be faced with. The difficulty has nothing to do with your abilities. It&apos;s always based on inaccurate information, better equipped enemy ships and large number of foes with seemingly endless supplies of missiles while yours will be expended within the first few shots. You can even get killed while docked at a station, just trying to trade or get a mission. Don&apos;t expect to be able to do the same though as you will never find your target in the same position. As far as upgrading your ship, you better be very, very, very patient. You will need about half a million credits to equip a barely acceptable fighter ship. With the ship you have to start and the type of missions you can hope to do in the beginning, you&apos;ll barely get 15,000 credits for each successful mission once you have paid for spent fuel and equipment. So just do the math... it&apos;s a long time on cleaning arrays (tantamount to washing windows), mining asteroids (Even there, you can not choose what you&apos;re mining so you&apos;ll waste even more time dumping what you did not want in the first place) and racing through ever winding ring type tracks. Fighting missions pay more but, as explained before, the odds are stacked against you and your slow poorly equipped ship. With luck though, you may end up fighting against three ships only and win the prize but, likely, other foes will materialize and blow you to pieces unless your lucky enough to make it to a jump gate and get out in a not too unfriendly solar system. The problem is that as soon as you accept to take a mission for one faction then the others will become your enemy until you accept long enough work for one of the others and then the first one will turn against you. Need I continue? The only thing I appreciated about this game was that it was easy to un-install...

It takes a while to do anything, it feels like. The game was buggy as well  I had issues saving. Any money you spend on this game is a donation more than a payment for a decent product.</span>

But if, like me, you&apos;ve been waiting and dreaming for a near-perfect, sandbox space sim, then Evochron Mercenary should satisfy you! With no loading screens and a completely open universe, you can literally sweep through some planetary rings and harvest water, dock at the nearby station and sell it -- and then fly down to the planet, harvest some materials while you go, switch over to your Terrain Walker (like a &apos;mech) and walk over the surface of the planet to collect a cargo crate from an ancient, wrecked spaceship, then dock at one of the planet&apos;s cities to trade and refuel. You can do all this with no loading screens or stop to the gameplay. Very impressive for a game made by 1 man!
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not perfect -- the planets, although generated nicely, lack detail (no forests, for example). The combat is hard at first (although this isn&apos;t a bad thing). But really, the game is a lot of fun. I believe you can even get a demo which restricts you to the first star system, so you can try the game out before you buy it! Fantastic. It&apos;s available on Steam, as well as direct from the programmer (Starwraith 3D Games I think).
<br>
<br>I have already had 20 hours of fun in the last 4 days just having new experiences - fighting to land on a stormy planet with rain, wind and lightning; drifting (with newtonian physics) through an asteroid field which is inside a haunting purple nebula; skimming over the upper layers of a gas giant; dog fighting pirates; making the first of many millions of credits; and enjoying the scenery of the different systems as I explore, seek out trade routes and upgrade my ship -- this game has a lot more gameplay than you would think.

<br>If you check the game&apos;s site, you&apos;ll will find a huge list of features. The funny thing is that those features are INDEED there and INDEED work. Yes some are &quot;average&quot;, but still a basis to improve.

<br>
<br>Mais il a de l&apos;espoir, c&apos;est quand m&#xEA;me son deuxi&#xE8;me jeu : avant Evochron Mercenary, il a fait Evochron. Un nom pr&#xE9;monitoire dont il eut l&apos;inspiration assis sur le tr&#xF4;ne. Il fait tout lui-m&#xEA;me, vraiment tout, y compris la voix du tutorial, enti&#xE8;rement en apn&#xE9;e. Bien s&#xFB;r, il a hypoth&#xE9;qu&#xE9; la maison pour &#xE9;diter Evotron Mercenary mais on n&apos;a rien sans rien : il faut vivre son r&#xEA;ve.
<br>
<br>Et puis la presse a &#xE9;t&#xE9; assez souvent indulgente : diantre ! 70 sur Metacritic tout de m&#xEA;me. Ce n&apos;est pas pour rien qu&apos;il est invit&#xE9; tous les mercredis soir chez le gros Gabe. Il nous fait tant rire. Personne n&apos;a jou&#xE9; plus d&apos;un quart d&apos;heure &#xE0; son jeu mais l&apos;&#xE9;couter en parler pendant des heures, &#xE7;a n&apos;a pas de prix. Il est si gentil et si aimable, les clochards du quartier se sont cotis&#xE9;s pour Evotron War of the Etrons, son prochain projet.
