It is a solid adventure game with some small issues like camera getting stuck for some reason and your character getting invisible but thats about it. Puzzles are fairly easy and the game gives you points which you use to find hotspots and get hints, story is good and the ending was completely unexpected and quite a surprise (at least for me).</span>
