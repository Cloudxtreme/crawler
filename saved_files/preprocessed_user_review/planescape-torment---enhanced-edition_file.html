Must be GREAT to feel yourself competent/talented enough to actually add ANYTHING of worth to a game like PS:T! Wish I was capable of deluding myself to such extremes. At least Avellone, who have to put food on the table since he is freelance, did all the heavy lifting so he didn&apos;t allow any fan fiction tier degeneracy to mar the narrative of this timeless gem. But looking at that UI that Beamdog programmed with their feet I can tell that they have not lost thei magic touch from Siege of Dragonspear.
<br>
<br>So this &quot;Enhanced Edition&quot; amount to a shameless cash grab to finance the next big project that the masterminds at Beamdog will gratify us in their effort to eradicate the toxic patriarchy. Offered at double the price of the original masterpiece, this low effort is a worthless addition from a parasite company.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment---enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7217840">Expand</a></span>

<br>Quote from Joewashere:
<br>
<br>To make matters worse, they&apos;ve also removed the original edition of the game from the store and effectively doubled its price by bundling it together with the twice as expensive &quot;Enhanced Edition&quot;.
<br>The end result? Customers now have to pay 30&#x20AC; for what used to cost 10&#x20AC;, a prime example of despicably unethical price gouging.</span>

<br>
<br>This release is a mod. A very basic mod, and there are better available for free .  The main disadvantage of this mod is the price, and the fact, that the original game was removed from the market.  Before this release one could have bought the game, use of the High resolution mods and few fixes (it will take you less then 30 minutes to deal with them) and enjoy the game as it was made.
<br>Now, you still get pretty much the same game with few changes:
<br>You get the zoom (the only good feature), tab to highlight interactable objects (questionable), autoloot (very bad idea for the game like Torment), and how to play pop-ups (useless for a game like Torment).
<br>
<br>Nothing else was changed, nothing else is Enhanced.  You&apos;d expect a better UI (but there were better fan made UIs for this game), you&apos;d expect better models (all you needed, is to rerender them in higher definition). But alas, you don&apos;t get it. There&apos;s nothing that defends the new price tag, and it is very clear, why the original game was removed from the stores - nothing justifies buying a new game, when you can get the old one, and follow few instructions to install mods online.
<br>So Original Planescape Torment - 10/10
<br>Beamdog&apos;s mod - 0/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment---enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7228809">Expand</a></span>

It doesn&apos;t offer anything new aside from some conveniency for the lazy casuals, which are not the audience intended for this game to begin with. It is especially grating with the GOG release considering that the Soundtrack of &quot;Planescape: Torment&quot; has been available for all owners of the game, ever since GOG relaunched seven years ago... up until now.
<br>Beamdog, the new publishers of &quot;Planescape: Torment&quot;, have chosen to sell the Soundtrack for a price that used to cover both the Soundtrack and *the game itself*.
<br>To make matters worse, they&apos;ve also removed the original edition of the game from the store and effectively doubled its price by bundling it together with the twice as expensive &quot;Enhanced Edition&quot;.
<br>The end result? Customers now have to pay 30&#x20AC; for what used to cost 10&#x20AC;, a prime example of despicably unethical price gouging.
<br>Sad since Planescape Torment is a timeless classic whose name will be now associated to a shady company who aims to milk established RPG franchises by adding mods and ugly UI targeting the android market while forgetting about its main audience.
<br>There was a real opportunity for Beamdog here to finally do something right by hiring Mr. Avellone to add the original cut content and develop some areas he clearly stated would like to expand on in several interviews, But God forbid, that would have cost Beamdog some money and this EE would not be the easy cash grab presented to us now.
<br>&quot;What can change the nature of a man?&quot; After this, I&apos;ve come to believe that the true answer is dialogue option number 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment---enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7226998">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>However, word of warning to those who have not played this classic rpg - their is waaaay less combat than in Baldur&apos;s Gate and Icewind Dale and waaaaaay more dialogue than Baldur&apos;s Gate and Icewind Dale.  Since this is an old school rpg from the 90&apos;s, most of the dialogue is in text boxes with very little voice acting (small portions of the dialogue are voice-acted, but the majority is just text).
<br>
<br>The game tells a very intriguing tale and has a great setting and amazing characters, but be prepared for LOTS of reading and NOT a lot of combat.

<br>First, for those who already played it, it&apos;s the same game you remember, but hassle free. It just works out of the box, and after playing with the the Enhanced Edition UI, you&apos;ll never go back to the old one. Not only is that annoying radial menu gone, but you have many quality of life improvements (such as the quickloot feature, unmemorized spells scroll being highlighted in green, etc.), more detailed breakdowns of stats, gorgeous font rendering (which is a must for a text-heavy game like this). For anyone worried about Beamdog &quot;tempering with perfection&quot;, every change has been run by the original lead designer Chris Avelonne, who took the opportunity to review which bugs (from Quinn&apos;s fixpack) were actually bugs, and which were not. Chris considers this the best PST version, and the canon one after he&apos;s done an editing pass to resolve plot inconsistencies, typos, and other outstanding bugs that always annoyed him. If anything, his word should matter over that of haters.
<br>
<br>But even if you like dealing with mods, this one has a lot of feature you&apos;ll love. The enhanced engine means that the game is MUCH MUCH more moddable, with several new opcodes, and cleaner implementations of existing stuff. Old mods like Unfinished Business are being updated for it, and new ones will be made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment---enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7252746">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This is the best opportunity for people who&apos;ve never experienced the game to finally play it, period. If you&apos;ve never experienced this game, get it. It&apos;s by far the easiest of the Infinity Engine games to get into. Very little knowledge of the D&amp;D system is required to play; it&apos;s still so simple to understand that it&apos;s truly timeless. I&apos;ve not only got the PC versions but am completely happy with the iPad version as well.

I bought GoG version since my original 4CD edition wasn&apos;t working. I had to spend a lot of time to do some research on mods and some more to install and set them up. Even with mods, my experience was far from perfect, with my desktop flashing through the game, game crashing after alt-tabbing, action menu being very small etc.

<br>Thank goodness Beamdog decided to do EE. I didn&apos;t even know how much more enjoyable the game can be with some tweaks.
<br>
<br>Is the amount of work Beamdog had to put into making EE enough to justify 20 EUR price tag? Probably not. Is tweaked edition of Planescape Torment worth 20 EUR? HELL YEAH.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/planescape-torment---enhanced-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=7234162">Expand</a></span>
