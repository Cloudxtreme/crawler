Formations settings for crafts have been changed, there is no difficulty setting for a game that is almost impossible without a population cap, GUI is frustrating where craft are not properly identified when selecting smaller craft groups from the larger selected groups of craft. On a plus side, the game has gorgeous graphics and has an excellent storyline.

<br>
<br>Just be prepared to play the levels over and over again. The difficulty is no joke, you are always overpowered. Just (utmost importance) manage your build queues and rally points properly, know what ships are good against other ships, and remember to use resource collectors to keep your Capital Ships alive (much more important that collecting resources, later on), and you&apos;ll get through it eventually.
<br>
<br>A masterpiece just below the level of HW1 in terms of innovation, and well ahead of it as far as graphics. Challenging, but fun even despite it&apos;s balancing flaws.  8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1748730">Expand</a></span>

It was everything that I could have hoped from a homeworld game, besides a few little things. I didn&apos;t enjoy the fact that you were auto-matically hyperspaced out at the end of each mission. The auto-RU mining at the end was a great touch, but I much rather would have had the auto RU, but allow me then to survey the area to make sure that I do infact have everything, and begin production of my fleet. You&apos;ll find that at the end of just about every battle, save the first few that you&apos;ll need to almost totally rebuild your fleet. Plus, you&apos;ll find that attackers will appear out of nowhere. Beyond that the graphics over-haul was great. The detail of all the ships and the environments is incredible. The missions are well thought out and the story line is excellent. The new GUI was very intuitive, and allows you to see the battle taking place while showing your que&apos;s. Excellent game, and if you are a fan of space combat, it&apos;s the best game on the market for space battles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=371671">Expand</a></span>

I wish more sequels could be this much better than the original! The only down side I found is the fourth mission was a bit tricky, its kind of like they put one of the last missions in at the start! But its not as hard as the first HW game.

One should think humans didn&apos;t have these abilities, the way you rant on about the interface. It works fine and is the most logical interface of the three games. Gees.. About the game: As with the others sound and grafics are just awsome. As simple as that. The gameplay is the same, although the formation bit is just useless, compared to Homeworld. Swarm combat is what winnes the battles for you and it gets a bit repetitive, but still leaves you with a good feeling of power. The storyline isn&apos;t as deep and compelling as in Homeworld, but it still is fare better then 95% of all other games made today. It just goes to show just how brilliant Homeworld is. The story is wrapped up nice and clean and even leaves room for a Homeworld 2 sequal (Age of S&apos;Jet). All in all it is well worth the time and it is a true Homeworld game. The Homeworld Trilogy is still the best Sci-fi story I have played.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=397567">Expand</a></span>

Yeah, single player is really hard, but I live for the multiplayer anyway.

If you didn&apos;t complete the mini-mission&apos;s which could have been as easy as repairing an engine within a certain amount of time to a full fledged mission on a planet to set up forward bases or to collect resources.Adding better gaming attributes would allow the gamer or what could be called a Pilot or Navigator in the space based genre of video gaming to switch between the styles of play. One style would be the same as if you were playing Homeworld in the first person build and shoot category. But while you are waiting for the enemy to arrive in which you would gloriously destroy them something goes wrong on one of the ships. You race to the ship to find out that enemy saboteurs have take over a command and control ship with vital intelligence reports located in the computer system. Now you must clean out the attackers before they can either escape with the vital information or the ship is destroyed thus causing your over all mission success to deteriorate as well as possibly losing. As your ship approaches the disabled and captive CnC ship the game play goes from ship shooter to a first person shooter style setting. Now you have to set your teams weapons up to get them ready for the mission ahead. Seven routes to the main control deck housing the CNC ships main computer and the intel reports and five routes to the engines where the enemy is placing charges to blow the ship if they are caught now directs your skills as operating two to five teams of soldiers. The operation of each team would be a Ghost Recon style set-up where you program each solider to preform a certain function within the group. Once the mission has been completed you would reboard your ship and return to the Mothership continuing your build-up of ships and technology. Other aspects that could be incorporated into a new version of Homeworld would be that you could engage in missions to secure enemy technology that would benefit your fleet operations against them. During a recon attack several recon battleships of the enemy are destroyed leaving their hulks behind. One of the scout ships passes close by to them. The mission trigger is swtiched on and gives you the oppurtunity to search the destroyed ships for anything of value. Once again the player is taken from the build and shoot style back into the first person aspect of the game where they investigate the wrecks for technology or information that could increase the players side advantage over the other. But be careful taking too long might keep you locked into the first person shooter portion of the game as the enemy drops out of warp near your fleet. As you watch they methodically tear it too pieces before your eyes....if you had only.......you think to yourself as the oxygen slowly drains from your tanks, the rest of your crew slumped against the bulkhead...the enemy leaving hours before...you are the last of your kind...if you had only.....

<br>I did enjoy Homeworld however and would very much so like a new version to be released into the mainframe of the gaming world.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1473915">Expand</a></span>

They weren&apos;t anything special, I was far more involved in FPSs. So then, being a Trekkie... I go and buy Star Trek Armada. Ultimately a fun game, one of the better Star Trek games ever made, but pretty much a disappointment if you expected it to be more then Starcraft with starships. Then Homeworld 2 came out (I missed the boat on HW1), and what a revelation. Completely 3D environment, with no basebuilding, intelligent fleet formations and fighters all swarming around on their own. It was simply incredible. All from a completely new studio, out of the blue.<br><br>And the environments they created... were completely breathtaking. Every Relic game has had that unique Relic art direction that utilizes quality concept art to bring the game to life. It&apos;s completely unrealistic, but space never looked more beautiful then in HW2. FreeSpace games come close, but staring at some of the backgrounds as your battle-weary ships sail past... it&apos;s majestic, breathtaking, elegant, operatic, awe inspiring... like looking at a brilliant sunset in autumn. The grandeur of the cosmos was perfectly captured.<br><br>I dunno... it was the first, and still stands as the greatest 3D space RTS ever, as few of those as there are.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1762610">Expand</a></span>

Dedicating countless hours just experimenting with every concievable tactic and use of the different ships in HW and HWC was a satisfying ordeal that helped one to appreciate the varying strenghts (and weaknesses) of each ship. I empathize with the intentions of the development team behind HW2 however this game is a frustratingly bittersweet experience at best. Graphically stunning with elegant backdrops; attractively designed ships; smooth animation physics; intense sound effects; as well as beautifuly rendered lighting/ particle effects are just some of the many possitive attributes HW2 uses to immerse the player into the complex and cinematic battles like no other RTS. Where then, did it all go wrong you ask? It fell apart in four critical areas. The story driven (vice gameplay...or atleast a mix of the two) mission designs, the absurdly imbalanced enemy A.I., the low survivability of capital ships, and unresponsive strike group tactics. Like so many have stated before, HW2 doesn&apos;t let the player &quot;play&quot;. It instead puts them on a train and shuttles them through each mission giving them no opportunity to (1) regroup and rebuild an the end of a challenging mission; (2) admire and absorb the beauty of the game and ship designs with some down time. The enemy AI is frustrating, not because it&apos;s actually good but because as it merely overwhelms the player with countless waves of unrelenting attacks. From the beginning of the game you&apos;re always reacting to a preemptive attack ever on the defensive. A typical game play experience goes like this: You&apos;re purposely placed at a tactical disadvantage as per story narration and you narrowly fend of an attack and flee to rebuild your fleet. In the mission where you&apos;re supposed to rebuild, you get...you guessed it, surprise attacked by ungodly numbers of enemies which you of course, defeat but at great cost to the fleet you were supposed to rebuild. The game auto-harvests the resources in the sector and shuttles you off to the next mission with said fleet still decimated. In the next mission the theme is for you to finally launch an attack of your own for what they did to you in the first mission. Alas, you cannot, because you&apos;re using the period of time when they don&apos;t know you&apos;re there to rebuild your fleet from the last encounter. Well too bad! because the theme of the last mission was &quot;rebuild fleet&quot;, this one is &quot;let&apos;s make them pay&quot;...you don&apos;t have all day to stall before an enemy scout patrol discovers you and you loose the element of surprise. Oops! I spoke too soon you&apos;ve been discovered and, you guessed it, waves upon waves of enemies are heading your way and they don&apos;t really care that you&apos;ve only managed to rebuild 50% of your fleet. Another scenario is: Through sheer strategy, perseverance and the infinite RU cheat, you&apos;re 3/4ths of the way through the game and you&apos;ve finally researched/discovered the biggest and baddest ships in the galaxy. Your fleet is large and impressive and you can&apos;t wait to see it in action. Fear not, because exactly one mission after acquiring the baddest ships in the quasar you&apos;ll be out numbered and outmatched 6 to 1. The heaviest ships will have an average life expectancy of 45 seconds and smaller warships will last all but 10 seconds tops when the fighting starts. Oh yeah, even with 3 carriers and 1 mothership on &quot;pump-em-out-as-you-loose-em&quot; mode you can&apos;t replace them fast enough. This brings us to the survivability of the capital ships. In HW1 a force of 40 strike crafts vs. a frigate is an ordeal that equals a 2 to 4 minite struggle before the frigate succumbs. You get the impression that the frigate is a ship, with shiplike armor and a crew of around 150 (like the manual indicates). A vessel carrying that much people should struggle for a while before being destroyed. In HW2 the ships are fancy and make you want to get attached to the survival of each one as you imagine the crew onboard. But as 4 squadrons of strike fighters (not even bombers) can make short work of an expensive frigate in HW2, you start to question the worth of each ship. Combining ships in a strike group is a partial solution at best. When a strike group enters combat, each ship attempts to attack what its good at attacking. Unfortunately, the different subclasses of ships always break ranks in every engagement. Imagine your frustration when you have a tightly grouped and protected formation on a collision course with an enemy battle group. You give the command for all units to force-attack the biggest enemy threat...which they all do. Problem is, 7 flak frigates caravan out from the formation one behind the other while they fire away. On the left, 5 torpedo frigates do the same. The ion canon frigates follow suit while the destroyer (the slowest one in the group) hangs way behind. After your strike package disperses, you then loose positive control as they&apos;re strewn across the battle space. Because each unit has specific strenghts and weaknesses, the enemy AI then exploits this lack of protection and you get to watch as your expensive warships get wasted one after the other. It seems someone at Relic forgot what it was like to have all ships attack a singular target from the wall formation of HW1...or the envelopement effects of the sphere formation in said game. No. We&apos;re left with a strike group that looks mean en-route but turns into an &quot;every-man-for-himself&quot; frenzy when the fighting starts. Also, an area of note on the story driven mission design I forgot to mention...After you&apos;ve prepared for an impending enemy onslaught by placing your ships in a strike group, the story cutscene interjects with one more alert (usually of yet even more enemies coming from the rear as well) and automatically places all your ships back to parade formation. So now that you&apos;re royally unprepared your strategy is a mess as you attempt to reselect your units that are..you guessed it, already zigging and zagging all over the place fighting the enemy as individuals. The reason I said I could empathize with the developers is because while this game was being made, various interviews with them had expressed this installment&apos;s emphasis on strategy. Back then, they maintained that HW1 &amp; HWC had loopholes that players exploited to make the game easier. In one respect I guess they&apos;re right. By the time I got to the last mission of HW1 I had close to 400 ships (Turanic Raider, Khadeshi, Taiidan). Heck, I even tried to capture the junk yard-dog ship. I&apos;ve used over 30 salvage corvettes and 3 cloak gens in a sphere formation far above or below every major battle keeping them infinately invisible as an option while the battle raged on. HWC offered so many unique and specialized crafts that I couldn&apos;t help but exploit them. Therein lies what I believe is true strategy and replayability. I say this because...not once did I have to resort to outside cheating (manipulating of RUs, etc) just to survive. Simply put, the capture ploy is a strategy in and of itself for it is also a design feature of the game. It is not always easy, nor is it always successful. It requires dedication of time and concentration. Often times a 30 minute mission can turn into a 4 hr mission depending on how prepared one wants to be in the end. Simply design a game, make it challenging yet fair and above all else, let the player determine what methods he/she would like to use to reach the finish based on the tools you&apos;ve given him/her. Replaying HW2 in order to go back and try something new will always lead back to &quot;that one thing that works&quot; and nothing else. When it comes to HW2, why should I have to maneuver my forces to delicately destroy all but 1 enemy craft just to keep from triggering a silly narration that would pit me against insurmountable odds before I&apos;m ready? You see dear developers, that which i&apos;ve just mentioned can either be seen as a loophole or a strategy for survival. Ultimately, the exploitation of loopholes and weaknesses is the goal of every strategist. Despite this fact, trying to force players to use strategy by using imbalance and rushing them will often effect more tactics to undermine the game&apos;s design itself vice the enemies within. Criticize this post if you like. Truth is i&apos;m just a casual gamer who liked the HW games so much that I spent alot of time playing them. And so, 3/4ths of the way through HW2 when I saw how little value was placed on anything less than a battlecruiser or the dreadnought, I felt that the developers relegated all previous technologies to utter uslessness well before the game was over and just decided to uninstall and forget about HW2. But I couldn&apos;t...because of those overwhelmingly possitive qualities I mentioned earlier. So i keep it im my collection for the day a patch comes out that can correct these issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=743021">Expand</a></span>

If the game was still 50 bucks, I would still say GET IT.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=423428">Expand</a></span>

Now, this tactic may appeal to some, but not to me. Next to that, the AI launches continous strikes against your fleet, don&apos;t bother using carriers for anything but production and supply, you&apos;ll have your fighters in the field all the time. Graphics, are a lot better, and I also think they improved the interface. I&apos;m always tempted to try again, but after 20 minutes get bored rebuilding my fleet over and over again. There is no cheat available that would make it any less difficult, unlimited RU&apos;s only prolongue your suffering. Example, in mission 4 (thats where I gave up), you at some point get a dozen frigates, 1 missile frigate, and 2 dozen corvettes move against your forces, I had the max. allowed units for all types, balanced well (fighters/corvettes/frigates), but still had my entire force obliviated. Had to rebuild, in the faint hope this was all, guess what! The entire enemy force, as described above, reappeared the moment I had my force rebuilt. Tedious, or what? I bet I could be sitting here, killing thousands of enemies and get very old and still have continous attacks. What&apos;s the strategy behind that? Make me hate life? </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=378159">Expand</a></span>

There should be a way to reduce the difficulty, or at least the feature to pause the game while giving orders to the squadrons, and then resume.. </span>

I was eager to play it, so i got it from a friends who bought it the day it was in stores. The Intro was ok..the quality level was expected. But the story is a little bit lame. Than i saw the graphics..not much change there..little bit polishing, but the models are still blocky and the new ships looked very &quot;random&quot; in comparison to the streamlined and effective HW1 designs. Music was good, sound was ok. BUT...here comes the big flaw: The game is too fast, to hectic and very difficult. Not because the AI is good..it is not, or the tactics which are used against you..no..just because the enemy is throwing wave after wave of ships against you. No time to breath no time to harvest ressources in a silent minute. The is HW1 stripped of every feeling, stripped of every tactic and stripped of every fun. I loved HW1 and Cataclysm...there where time for battle and time for slow ressource-harvesting. Not in this game...it reminds me of Z. A RTS of some age...you had no minute to breath, a pause meant end of mission. HW2 is a big disappointment.

Auto harvest and hyperjump makes no sense given the games difficulty (you can&apos;t catch your breath between missions). I loved HW1 and played the SP mission several times but HW2 leaves you more frustrated than satisfied. I read elsewhere a description of the game as a frantic &quot;Wack-a Mole&quot; style game&apos; and that&apos;s about the best way to sum this game up. There is just not the feel like HW1 BTW the manual is terrible and I think Sierra is banking on a lot of people buying the Strat.

I MEAN COME ON. - Adaptive AI... didn&apos;t really bug me that much, but i&apos;d rather not have an adaptive AI so I can pwnz0rz its ass later on instead of it having 2 to the X more ships than I have. - Uh what else let&apos;s see the complete lack of video/sound configuration options available in HW1 and HWC?

The tech advancements, and different tactics, formations, escorting of ships, first person view, story line , Multi player game play, just to mention a few of its many game features made it a joy play. Add to that the spin off title Cataclysm also a fun and engrossing Game with some helpful changes and enhancements. Now comes Homeworld 2: This game has some improved graphics which at first glance might not be seen that Much. However when you look at the Mothership and Strike Craft up close you can see that some one spent a great deal of time on the textures, in some cases the depth is astounding. the Mouse control is much more intuitive and for the most part easy to use. I have had trouble at times trying to get free from a Ship only to enter the movement mode, but over all a very nice Control System. I do find myself holding the Shift key down from time to time to make depth changes in my movement, But that still works so no big problems there. The Resouce gathering has been enhanced where by at the end of each Mission all resouces are gathered up for you...Allmost all...the the Collectors can now gather pieces of broken Ships, but at the end of a mission if you have not gathered these up they will be left behind. That would not be a problem Except for the fact that at the end of each mission you are instantly Hyperspaced to the next mission. Some of these pieces i&apos;m speaking of have an RU value of over 2000 so its not a good idea to leave um behind. My major Gripes...................... The Game has a Storyline, but many of the Battles are so intense that its hard to even remember what the Story is about. and the cut scenes within the game tend to flusterate the player rather than inhance the Story line. That is to say the attacks are so rapid and intense that any distraction from your Fleet control is a major henderance, and quite often unwanted. Gone is the Ship naming that I grew use to in Homeworld, and this makes figuring out which Carrier or Destroyer or Cruiser you are having to build something with or ordering around a little less easy. Not that the single player game would give You time to name them. ........The capture System is all but useless the Ship for this Marine Frigate is treated as priority one for the Enemy. The only real use I found for these was as a diversionary action. You can send one of these around back and let the Enemy see it and they will run over anything else to get at it leaving most anything else un Guarded. A large percentage of the time even if you do get them to dock with the Ship you wish to control. they leave after the capture bar has been completed, and the Ship still belongs to the Enemy. .....If You do Capture a Ship that builds something, The Building part of the Ship is un-usable. So there is no point in Capturing a Carrier, or ShipYard. ..For me a causual game player the missions Are a bit to agravating and tough. I don&apos;t play online, unless its with a friend..so mostly the story line was what i wanted when I bought the game. If it had difficulty settings I could have played through, and then turned them up. I would have gotten my story line had some fun, and then at my leasure improved my Skill. by the time I got to Mission 5 I had forgoten what the Game was even about. and to tell You the truth even after replaying back to that level a couple of more times I still can&apos;t remember the story line. I keep coming back to this Forum Hoping that they have Patched it and placed a difficulty setting in the patch. Why?? Because i loved HW1 and Cataclysm...and really wanted to like this one. instant jump at the end of a mission.. I mean really what Starship or even Navel Admiral would just come out of a Battle and not take inventory of his Fleet, re asign Units and in general re group, and in this case regroup by asigned numbers literally....... Before jumping into another Battle. Its just not a strategically sound thing to do. and instead of adding real ness to the game it adds absurdity to it. ................. Every one needs to remember that quality control for many Game&apos;s is done by having People stay on top of the forums, and put down or slander anyone who does not agree that there game is the best........... .....I have no doubt that they will come behind this with the usual ...&quot;well I like the tough battles, it let me prove how God like I am, but I guess there are poor players out there that can&apos;t beat games.&quot; .., ..&quot; Aw who wants to name ships anyway I did not have any problems&quot;.. ,.. &quot; I had no problems keeping up with the storyline....I knew Luke Skywalker was Darth Vaders son&quot;..,.. &quot; What story!!! Kill, Maim,Destory, Hurt, Win,.....I can edit the RU and ship values&quot;..,.. and so on and so on. ......</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=371004">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The vanilla HW2 I would give an 8 in comparison to the original Homeworld.
<br>
<br>However, the incredible mod, Homeworld:Complex bumps my rating to a 10.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s an incredible RTS and still the standard.</span>
