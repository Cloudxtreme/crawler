After reading about &quot;The Raven&quot;, I expected a suspenseful, fun adventure with an interesting story, but unfortunately it turned out to be quite the opposite.
<br>I could not play more than one hour at a time, I literally almost fell asleep after a while.
<br>
<br>Most of the time I just skipped the dialogues, because I found them to be extremely long and somehow unnatural, and the synchronisation was really bad as well. Although, after changing the language to German (which is my first language) it improved a little.
<br>Basically, the dialogues were what bothered me most, because I did not like the main character at all based on what he said and the way he talked, so they kind of ruined the whole experience for me.
<br>The other characters seemed fake and stereotypical as well, sadly.
<br>
<br>Moving around was unnerving, mostly because the character walked extremely slowly. I had difficulties getting from one part of a room to another,  because he often stopped moving right at the edge of the screen.
<br>
<br>The story itself was boring and predictable, and one part of the first chapter bothered me quite a lot. I neither saw nor talked to the Baroness, and therefore did not know she was on board the train (I seemed to have overlooked her cabin door),  it was obviously optional to complete the &quot;quest&quot; to find her purse. Yet, when I got to the part on the cruise ship and talked to people, I felt like I had missed something important.
<br>
<br>The graphics could definitely be better, but the music was nice  it was actually the best part of the game.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, &quot;The Raven&quot; was definitely not for me. What a disappointment!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-raven-legacy-of-a-master-thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3819069">Expand</a></span>

<br>- The soundtrack fits the mood and is of high quality.

<br>
<br>The Bad:
<br>- One major plot hole, that left me with the feeling of being lied to by the game. Absolutely absurd. But I don&apos;t want to spoil anyone with details.
<br>- Crude animations, that force you to wait until they are finished. Sometimes you have to wait for 10 seconds, until a character has left the screen, after walking up all the damn stairs. It&apos;s also looking very awful and I&apos;ve got the feeling, that it gets much worse towards the end of the game. I guess the developers didn&apos;t test and integrate those animations at all. A nerve-wrecking nightmare!
<br>- Most of the puzzles are either totally obvious don&apos;t make any sense at all. Both ways they are not a lot of fun. (But some puzzles are nice and challenging, though they are the minority.)
<br>- The game was bug infested after publishing, up to the point, that you couldn&apos;t finish the first chapter. After some patches it became better, but you need to save a lot, to deal with frequent crashes.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>The setting and story could have made a really good game, but in the end I was more disappointed than satisfied by the game&apos;s flaws.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-raven-legacy-of-a-master-thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3637729">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s quite interesting how the same story is told by three different characters in three chapters, giving the answers to most of the questions.
<br>
<br>From technical point of view the game isn&apos;t that good. Characters are jerky, don&apos;t want to move to the places we want them to, or even disappear in thin air breaking the gameplay and forcing Alt+F4.
<br>
<br>Still, it&apos;s fun game. The story is quite decent with a final twist.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-raven-legacy-of-a-master-thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3977329">Expand</a></span>

Most of the characters are bland, the story is boring and becomes unbearble in the 2nd episode, the 2 puzzles in the game are made for the brain dead, character movement is extremely aggravating at times. This was bad buy, that I regret deeply. And this is coming from a fan of adventure games.</span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Good, logical, clean puzzles, nothing surreal. In consequence it is rather easy (even for me...   Sometimes if feels rather like an interactive movie (you decide it&apos;s a pro or con  I have nothing against it).
<br>Good characters, OK graphics.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>IT IS SLOOOOWWW...
<br>There must be a better way to set the controls for an adventure game: I click, character goes to the spot and in most of the time I can&apos;t do anything else. Walking through the screen takes time, so it would be better if I could &quot;look around&quot; with the cursor... And also: the character has to go to a specific spot to begin a certain movement, the he makes some footsteps on the same spot to get in the position for the next animation... It&apos;s a drag, it&apos;s so cumbersome. Double click not always working for location change (steps, opening doors) and the characters can&apos;t run.
<br>Bugs  characters disappear/reappear, or Adil walks through Mrs. Westmacott in Kairo Museum and the hotspot is on the wrong place... And there are quite a few bugs like that. The space button not showing sometimes the hotspots on their real locations. (Was this game tested?)
<br>I played the German version and the voices are sometimes off, or I have to wait for a few seconds for the next line of text. Not the characters are boring (as other reviewers stated), but the way they are presented, the pauses between every line. Sometimes the devs relied on mimics, but it&apos;s just not working. The ingame movies&apos; pre-rendered facial emotions are mostly OK, but the real-time characters&apos; emotions are pathetic (e.g. Miss Miller&apos;s teeth are independent from the rest of her face... ).
<br>If you miss a speech you can&apos;t listen to it again, only if you load back a saved game...
<br>Around 20% percent of this game is waiting  for voices, loading, walking, animations, etc...
<br>Still I liked the game, not a revolutionary title, but one to spend a few hours with. Let&apos;s hope there will be a TBOUT3 on the level of the 1st one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-raven-legacy-of-a-master-thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3906949">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The main character is a boring 65 year old Swiss guy; there is a murdering German Nazi Physician; a French Interpol-Agent with a drug addiction; and a &quot;heroic&quot; arab thief, that loves his white girl with her father-daughter-problems; and the Raven, an extremely aggressive but boring English dude. Put that all in a blender and you get the worst adventure story ever, with terrible writing, terrible voice acting, numerous plotholes, terribly easy puzzles and clunky and annoying movement.
<br>
<br>I have played numerous Adventure games, but this one probably takes the cake as probably the worst one ever. Don&apos;t read the fake reviews that the developers have written here. Don&apos;t buy this game, you will regret it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-raven-legacy-of-a-master-thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3506951">Expand</a></span>

Like revisiting your favorite childhood movie, whose details have long faded over time, there is a beautiful familiarity when starting out on a quest that is both excitingly new and quite nostalgic. KING Art&#x2019;s latest take on the classic genre, The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief, excels in both respects by carefully taking heed of its predecessors, while adding a distinctive character of its own.
<br>
<br>As with any point &amp; click adventure, the plot is paramount, and The Raven has no shortcomings in this section. After a wonderful opening cinematic introduces the sly burglar amid a daring heist in a London Museum, the action moves to the Orient Express as it hurtles across 1960&#x2019;s Europe. Bound for Venice, where a cruise ships awaits to take passengers to Cairo, the carriages are filled with interesting characters, all unique and intriguing in their own way.
<br>
<br>Players take control of one particular voyager, a Jakob Anton Zellner, a Swiss constable, advanced in years but still quite full of spirit and yearning for adventure. Jakob however is tasked with assisting Legrand, a famous French Inspector, in his transportation of the Eye of the Sphinx to an exhibition in Cairo. The stakes are fairly high as this precious jewel is all that remains of a pair (the fate of the other depicted in the intro movie), and there are fears that the newly-returned Raven may strike again to complete the set. The latter half of the game takes place aboard the S.S. Lydia as it sets sail for the Cairo exhibition.
<br>
<br>Much of the plot is revealed through conversations with other passengers and there are plenty of additional details that really flesh out the narrative. A rich and quite intricate world is painted through the dialogue and the more you converse with NPC&#x2019;s, the more you learn about their backstories and your own. Jakob is a wonderful character, well-formed and extremely likable, eager to prove his worth at his old age both to the younger Inspector Legrand and, more importantly, to himself. There is a deep sadness to the man too, just beneath the surface, as he begins to realize that this is perhaps his last hurrah. The cast is relatively small in this first of three planned chapters, but allows much more attention to be paid to their development within in the story and the exploration of their motivations.
<br>
<br>Other adventure games have been fairly criticized in the past for ludicrous combinations of items that have no basis in reality, but no criticism is needed here. KING Art have chose to make problem-solving practical and plausible, even down to the way certain inventory items are handled. Larger objects such as axes, that require both hands of the character, are set down when not needed and removed from the inventory, not stored in an invisible, bottomless backpack. It&#x2019;s a nice little touch that is in keeping with the overall logical direction of the game. The search for clues is periodically broken up by unique mini-games that provide a welcome break from rummaging through locations, such as bending a bobby pin correctly to pick a lock, or a game of shuffleboard to win a useful quest item. But at no point does the game become monotonous or boring, nor does it become frustratingly hard. It carries itself thanks to a steady tempo in both story and game play.
<br>
<br>The Raven is just about everything you could want from a point &amp; click adventure, however the problem is that not many people want a point &amp; click adventure. The game excels in nearly all aspects of the genre and adds a few fresh ideas but, in the end, it may struggle to succeed due to the aversion some people have to a game of this type. But with its simple UI, logical puzzles, fantastic plot and beautiful setting, it&#x2019;s an excellent place to start for those who have never dabbled in an adventure game. This first chapter in The Raven saga is a class act from start to finish, and I simply cannot wait for the next installment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-raven-legacy-of-a-master-thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3322412">Expand</a></span>

The Gamespot review really makes me angry, and you should ignore it because the reviewer obviously doesn&apos;t appreciate adventure games. In The Raven, the settings, artwork, voice acting, soundtrack, and production quality are all amazing. The gameplay is very good as well. Most of the puzzles are intuitive, and make sense, without being overly easy. You can tell that a lot of thought and care went into the design of this game. There are plenty of twists and turns in this first episode alone, and while in the beginning you MAY begin to think the game  is boring and slow, I promise you that it picks up very soon and becomes exciting. It&apos;s not just about a thief- a lot of other stuff happens, and the plot really thickens and builds on itself. If you like mysteries AT ALL, you owe it to yourself to play this. Give it a chance and *minor spoilers*  after you open the locked door and find the purse, things really get interesting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-raven-legacy-of-a-master-thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3332974">Expand</a></span>

Excellent story line that also allows for a few stray puzzles and tasks to keep the player thinking. The end of the first chapter leaves you craving for more, and a mind full of theories as to the truth behind the mystery at hand. The game is still very new, so a few hiccups are to be expected. Although nothing major happened to me during gameplay, I noticed that some of the graphics for interactive objects failed to render, leaving a solid black silhouette of the object. I suspect this will be resolved fairly quickly, at least with the next chapter. All-in-all a great game for anyone!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-raven-legacy-of-a-master-thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3419874">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s not fun at all.  The only good thing I can say about this game is the decent graphics and a likable main character.  It takes too long for the characters to react, for example, when I want to walk from point A to point B, I have to wait for the character to turn around, pause, then start walking to get to point B, and it is SLOW.  Also, the dialogue is redundant and ENDLESS.  Not fun at ALL.  Unless you want to be VERY fustrated, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-raven-legacy-of-a-master-thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3720792">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief is a three-part game, the first chapter of which has come out.  It revolves around the lives of a motley group of passengers aboard a train bound for Venice who are peripherally involved in the exploits of a copycat thief who successfully purloins one of two stunningly valuable gemstones.  The second gemstone is aboard the train.
<br>
<br>You play as a constable who at first attempts to guard the gemstone but becomes embroiled in a murder investigation that may or may not be related.  Only you can unearth the clues to get to the bottom of this mystery.
<br>
<br>Without question, the story, characters, and setting are what make this title.  It sits on the border between game and interactive movie, so don&apos;t expect a lot in the way of puzzle solving.
<br>
<br>Pros include a great musical score, believable and well-performed voice acting, a nice and simple interface, and well utilized tools such as the diary and inventory.
<br>
<br>Cons include a few bugs that were patched out this morning  I tested them to make sure.  Also, the dialog sometimes wonders from the animation in a way that is highly noticeable.
<br>
<br>If you are into whodunit mysteries, this game is a must.  I adored it.  It has a few graphics problems, but the game is solid.  I played the first chapter in six hours; subsequent chapters come out in August and September.  Just be sure to save occasionally just in case I didn&apos;t find all the bugs.

Basic and easy to grasp controls with a decent story in 3 parts, 1st part takes around 3-4 hours to complete so for a &#xA3;20 release for all 3 parts not a bad deal. The puzzles are essentially straight forward, some easier some harder than others but not to the extent that you need to constantly alt-tab out to a walkthrough. I can&apos;t give this game a 10 as that would be silly as it is not a AAA release that takes you to the next level of invention, complexity or graphics but what it does do it does very nicely and is a great example of a point and click game  lovers of George Stobart in the Broken Sword games this will certainly appeal to you  its the closest comparison i can make for would be purchasers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-raven-legacy-of-a-master-thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=3321056">Expand</a></span>

This kind of thing should not be allowed to happen.  I know this is happening to other people and why the game is on sale when it does this is beyond me.  This game is not good enough to justify this kind of frustration and is a waste of your time.

Beautifully crafted locations really add to the immersion of this well told narrative.  I like how you an delve into the back story of each character.  And the final ending - not even Agatha has provided such a twist.  The puzzles are casual - and as this is a story based game - this is a good thing.  There is just enough interaction to keep you involved without it becoming tedious. Minus 1 for some slight performance issues.  Highly recommended for interactive story fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-raven-legacy-of-a-master-thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=5390344">Expand</a></span>

In this case, it&apos;s more of a return to a past in which the mysteries were mysteries and puzzles really served their purpose, rather than being just absurd tasks in order to complicate and prolong the play time in the the worst possible way , the boring way. Note that I&apos;m usually against nostalgia in video games, particularly in the RPG/ adventure genre.
<br>The Raven&apos;s action is swift, the dialogues are interesting, the story is not completely linear, despite being framed in enclosed spaces, there are some (not many) choices with repercussions on the development of the narrative, and those who enjoy a good murder mystery, can not remain indifferent to this very well executed homage. Above all, the combination of objects, something that usually annoys me deeply in adventure point-and-click, there is in this game, with a defined and cohesive purpose. So I recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-raven-legacy-of-a-master-thief/user-reviews?user_review_id=4140918">Expand</a></span>
