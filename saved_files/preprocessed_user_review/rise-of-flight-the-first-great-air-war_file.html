But in the years since, it has turned into the current standard for how to do a combat flight sim. It has the best SP play around, putting even IL2:BoS (based off it) to shame. MP is also solid, though it&apos;s started to thin out a little. Flight, damage and sound modeling are all top notch and even though the game is 5 years old, it still has solid graphics that will bring anything but a high end machine to its knees if you crank up the detail. With more than 30 flyable planes, there is plenty of variety too. Development has taken a back seat in the rush to get IL2:BoS out, but allegedly they have more stuff planned now that BoS is released.
<br>
<br>If military or early aviation is your thing, I can&apos;t recommend this game enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-flight-the-first-great-air-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=4617703">Expand</a></span>

Superb feeling of flight and the best WWI plane models available at the time of this writing.  The map of the Western Front is beautiful and highly accurate based on the work of a user (Fifi) who created an overlay for it based on a 1918 map.  Fifi found the location of villages, rivers and wooded areas in Rise of Flight to be accurate within 1 km over the entirely of France when compared to the original map.
<br>
<br>The game and the first two planes are free, so no reason not to try this game.  You can then purchase any or all of the additional 50+ planes you are interested in, including scouts, 2-seaters, the Gotha and Handley Page bombers, and early float planes and a flying boat (the Felixstowe).  Activities not only include dogfighting, but also bombing missions over England (with the purchase of the Channel Map) attacking shipping and submarines, and attacking ground units...its all there in Rise of Flight.
<br>
<br>A superb game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-flight-the-first-great-air-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=4869241">Expand</a></span>

In May 2011 the developer released the 1.019 superpatch that added a dynamic campaign to the game and the game has been extremely stable on my machine. This at no extra cost to the customers who already paid.<br>The game plays fine with just a simple Logitech Extreme joystick without TrackIR. It supports padlock, snap view and all other normal features. Their business model of having to buy additional playable planes allows the developer to continuously add features to the game instead of creating a new version or new game. Best of all, as a user.. you don&apos;t HAVE to buy those planes. The AI will fly them whether you pay for them or not. A free demo is now available that has all features enabled, including the full campaign. The only limit is that only two types of planes are available to the player.<br>Pros: The graphics are gorgeous. The planes are a joy to fly and the damage model is impressive. Land a bit rough and see you plane topple over, bend struts and tear cloth. The new campaign really added a lot of atmosphere to the game.<br>Cons: AI can be clumsy and needs work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-flight-the-first-great-air-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=1669018">Expand</a></span>

The flight model is very good, with each airplane having its own unique personality - none feels generic.  Overall, Rise of Flight recreates the sense of flight better than any sim I&apos;ve ever played.  Just flying the planes is great fun.  With a new campaign mode scheduled for the next (free!) update, Rise of Flight is a worthy successor to Red Baron.   NOTE: The DRM system has changed substantially since the early reviews.  Apart from logging on to install the game, download updates, or change your in-game profile (the nationality of your pilot), the game can be played entirely offline.   I go weeks without ever logging on to the server; there&apos;s absolutely no need to for day-to-day single-player play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-flight-the-first-great-air-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=1597351">Expand</a></span>

Grreat physics per aircraft, exactly the reason why seperate a/c need to be bought. These are NO simple conversions of settings+model+skin. Each plane has to be learned to fly and has its own characteristics. Cons: Sloppy multiplayer implementation. Unable to join already running servers as a player, you get to be spectator until the round ends. Navigation is hard without navigation-icons on, so finding opponents can take time, lengtening the mission and the time you are spectating. All players have to report ready in the lobby to let the round start. Anyone not doing that (gone to the bathroom) will hold everyone up. The host can not kick the player, only a democratic ban can (majority vote). Documentation is poor: no details on which difficultysetting does what, no details on cockpits of different planes, no tutorial for missioneditor whatsoever. Side note: Heavy DRM. Game can only be played when connected to the internet to allow realtime validation with Neoqb. Game is IMO much less playable when NOT having a TrackIR system. I would give this a 9 if the multiplay would be much more opened up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-flight-the-first-great-air-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=83707">Expand</a></span>

Seriously, speaking as a RL pilot with a couple of decades of professional flying behind me (military and civilian), RoF is pretty much the only PC flight sim I&apos;ve played that feels like a plane.  And yes, all you Il-2 fans, I&apos;ve played that.  The modeling of the aircraft is exquisite, and a WW1 aviation junkie like myself thrills to see the various start sequences animated correctly.  Everything but manually priming the cylinders on the SE-5a!  The damage model seems pretty spot on-- there&apos;s no arcade style instakills (unless you nail the pilot or tank, just like old MvR said to).  Expect to miss a lot, grind your teeth at jamming guns, and wish the damn plane would stop bobbing around in turbulence so much.
<br>Most of the complaints some of the other posters made have been addressed--  MP is much better now, TrackIR is plug and play, and 777 seems to get pricing--  the ICE pack is really the way to go, with more than enough planes to make you happy.  That said, ultimately this game is really only about dogfighting right now.  There&apos;s a promised campaign mode coming, two seaters and all that, but if you&apos;re expecting Over Flanders Fields, you&apos;ll be disappointed.  Then again, if you want a realistic flight model, you&apos;ll be disappointed in OFF.  In a perfect world, there would be a game that had the best aspects of both--  and maybe RoF will have that in a year or so.  But right now, it&apos;s just the best damn flight sim out there.  And that&apos;s something.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-flight-the-first-great-air-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=1443054">Expand</a></span>

Forget all the negative reviews about what it is lacking, how expensive it is to add content, etc. This game is nothing like the original 2009 release, and it is fairly valued. 777 Studios has done an amazing job of improving and adding content to this game throughout the years. For the player, adding content is not necessary, and it definitely will not make you any better. If you have several flyable aircraft, you can consume endless hours in SP or on-line in MP without issues. If you are interested in getting everything out of the game possible, then yes, you could spend a lot. That is the difference between a simulation and a game  especially, considering the &quot;niche&quot; aspect of a WWI flight sim. I have more than a few planes in my hanger that I haven&apos;t even had time to fully enjoy, as it can take quite a while to really LEARN each aircraft, as they all have their own distinct differences. Having said that, I have no regrets about any of those purchases, because I know that I will enjoy each one of those planes (campaigns, weapon mods, etc.) some day.
<br>
<br>Note: even if you are an experienced WWII flight-simmer, be prepared for frustration and humility. Flying these crates is extremely hard to do at first, but the learning is curve is constant and very rewarding. You have to stick with it. If you survive the initial learning phase, I promise  you will be hooked!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-flight-the-first-great-air-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3490876">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It has absolutely beautiful graphics and flight models are decent. I also has an engaging career mode, and multiple maps available  including the English Channel to fly submarine-hunting missions in your flying boats and seaplanes.
<br>
<br>Bombing missions, artillery direction, reconnaissance, dogfighting  it&apos;s all there. A huge range of aircraft are now available to buy, from single seaters, through two-seaters to multi-engined bombers and seaplanes. Even if you don&apos;t own them, they they will appear in your game in AI pilot&apos;s hands.
<br>
<br>Yes, if you try to fly this game with the keyboard, you&apos;re in for a disappointing experience (as per any flight sim!), but a basic joystick will do you fine initially  you really don&apos;t need a terribly expensive stick, rudders or TrackIR setup, though they obviously help, if you&apos;re really into your flying.
<br>
<br>To the earlier reviews saying it&apos;s a terrible funding model to have to buy additional aircraft  I disagree  you don&apos;t need to buy them at all, unless you want to personally fly them. In fact, if you really want to master a type, you need to put significant effort and flying hours into them anyway, to learn all of their little quirks  this is not arcade flying, where you can just drag the stick around the  without stalling, spinning or losing your wings!  So just get yourself a couple of aircraft to start with, and master them, before spending what amounts to a couple of beers to get another, and then learn that..
<br>
<br>So it&apos;s a great game, but is it perfect? Well, no... I&apos;d personally love to see more ground activity (it&apos;s not non-existant, it&apos;s just not &apos;teeming&apos;!), but I do have loads of confidence in the developers, having owned this sim for getting on for three years now, and I&apos;ve seen them achieve fantastic things and really listen to their community.
<br>
<br>So it&apos;s a 9, for now, but I have confidence it will become a 10 in the future...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-flight-the-first-great-air-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3486182">Expand</a></span>

<br>here is &quot;Simulator&quot;  It is not an arcade game, so don&apos;t even for a second think that you
<br>will get anything out of this masterpiece without a joystick.
<br>
<br>While I do find the graphics in Rise of Flight to be absolutely stunning for a flight-simulator
<br>it is the flight model and physics of the simulator that makes me love it. A single tear in
<br>somewhere on the plane will change the characteristics of the plane...
<br>
<br>If you like simulators this is a must have... Even though I prefer the WWII planes, I enjoy
<br>just flying around in the beautiful world that 777 studios has created.
<br>
<br>Preferably you should have the full setup with:
<br>- Joystick (Force feedback recommended)
<br>- Track IR (Natural Point, Freetrack, Face Noir, etc)
<br>- Rudderpedals (Not essential but will help a lot)
<br>
<br>Background:
<br>I have controlled a Piper single prop for real a few times and I am a long
<br>time simulator fan flying great simulations as:
<br>- IL2 Sturmovik 1946 (Stunning simulation for its time, that holds even today)
<br>- Microsoft Flight Simulator (Great for IFR but flight model isn&apos;t great)
<br>- DCS Black Shark &amp; A10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-flight-the-first-great-air-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=3494627">Expand</a></span>

<br>I am the owner of a full size Fokker Dr1 Triplane that I have been flight testing for the past three months. Look up &quot;vongrube&quot; on YouTube and you can watch my flight videos.
<br>The ROF Dr1 flight model is horrible! Watch my videos. You don&apos;t see the nose pitching up and down, or the plane skittering all over the sky. If my plane acted that way on the first test flight, I would probably not have survived the experience. Granted...my plane IS touchy, and unstable...just like the original. But no where close to what ROF depicts! In 35 years as a fixed wing and helicopter pilot I have NEVER flown any aircraft that flies the way ROF depicts their triplane!
<br>I wish these game designers would actually sit down with REAL pilots of these classic planes and interview them intensly. Then, allow them to fly the simulator and listen to their input. If you really want to know how a plane flies, talk to an actual pilot OF that plane. Stop taking second, third, and fourth hand stories from magazines and books, and then try to interpret the meanings. There are plenty of pilots who fly actual and replica warbirds out there (including myself) who would be more than willing to help out with an accurate flight model simulation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-flight-the-first-great-air-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2581424">Expand</a></span>

During the very often sales you can acquire the aircraft very cheaply and enjoy them by yourself or with friends. This is my favorite CFS so far and I look forward to what else these developers can do!</span>

You get such a huge sense of achievement when you complete a mission and then land and switch off your engine. The flight characteristics feel very realistic and the graphics are stunning.</span>

The standard of excellence maintained by this simulator are the result of an ever expanding work in progress from the development team which continues to make this simulator the most effective tool for user emersion into historical war aviation. Most of the negative criticisms leveled at this simulator have been rendered obsolete by free updates expanding the sophistication of this simulator and its total range and scope. I purchased this flight simulator in 2010 and today it provides a completely different and far superior experience then when I first acquired it. Even the most fiscally conscious of Sim Pilots can enjoy the basic package which contains everything needed to enjoy this historical flight sim and can be downloaded, completely for free, from the Rise of Flight web sight. Further customizations of your WW1 experience have been made available for purchase and include weapons modifications, additional aircraft and more however, these modifications are not necessary as you are free to add only the customizations that best fit your personal tastes and budget. The Rise of Flight community is second to none and the online experience contains servers for pilots of every level of experience. As a special note to beginners who are considering getting started with this amazing simulator there is a training campaign which originally attracted me to this Sim however, I am pleased to report that instructional videos posted on line are excellent and feature individual aircraft familiarization, basic flight instruction and advanced maneuvering and strategy which can be utilized right away and over time as your skills evolve. (Special thanks to IRFC Requiem who created these videos and posted them on You Tube making it easy for beginners to get started)  so why not get flying right now? I hope to see you in the simulated sky&apos;s of the first world war, good luck and Godspeed.

<br>
<br>After a Day of hard work, I take off in a plane just to roam over France and England and have some chivalry with folks around the world. The flight model is superb (I am in love with the Nieuport 11), the graphics are stunning and the on-line community is super. You should give it a try. They have a free play version to check it out.</span>

<br>Hours of fun with the base free game and it&apos;s great that you can just add the planes you want for very cheap.  Great community as well.  Highly recommend!</span>

<br>
<br>The aircraft feel incredibly wobbly and unstable. This may be realistic but it is way over the top as your wings move around way too much - several meters in seconds.  It feels like a paper plane instead of realistic. I understand that these planes were unstable, but surely not this much. It is impossible for any aircraft to move this much up-down in level flight.
<br>
<br>Then, when you get hit, your vision will be obscured by oil. Apparently in 1915 people could not blink. There is no other explanation, because there is no windshield.

<br>I read the journal of the PC Gamer pilot and thought this game sounded like fun. I was horribly wrong.
<br>
<br>The flight model is terrible, you have the owner of one of these planes in the review section telling you it is wrong because he owns the real thing and has compared the two. If real planes were this un-flyable no one would have survived their first flight in all likelihood.
<br>
<br>The plane simply CANNOT be controlled by keyboard.
<br>
<br>On top of that, you have maybe 2 planes at your disposal.. despite this being labelled a &apos;free&apos; game you have to pay for it in reality. The website flat out lies to you in some regards.
<br>
<br>I can appreciate what the dev team are trying to do, but they&apos;re doing it in the most inaccessible way possible. What could have been a userbase of 30,000+ is now likely a userbase of 3000.
<br>
<br>Greed essentially got in the way of this game being good. That and the flight model being crap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-flight-the-first-great-air-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=2934856">Expand</a></span>

The problems: bad implementation of all gameplay modes especially multiplayer, extremely long load times (on a 3.2ghz quad core with WD Raptors and a 260 GTX), ridiculous DRM implementation/authentication and, get this, over 7 dollars per addon aircraft if you want to buy the DLC (all of which should have been included with release). To buy all the content for this game (and it&apos;s only been out a few months) will cost you over 100 dollars, and you&apos;ll only get a few &quot;extra&quot; planes. They didn&apos;t include much in this game to start with, it&apos;s not polished, it&apos;s crippled by technical problems, lack of content, documentation, long load times, and vicious DRM, and worst of all it is a huge middle finger from a greedy startup that values money over their own potential fanbase, which won&apos;t materialize. I am a die-hard simmer going back to the olden days of CGA and Microprose, and I&apos;ve played IL2 nearly every day for 8 years now, so I am the target audience for this game. However, I will not buy it until these issues are fixed. I played the full trial for about 20 hours, but I see tons of potential, but I won&apos;t drop some cash until these glaring problems are sorted out. Pity. We&apos;ve all been awaiting a top quality next-gen WWI flight sim. Guess we&apos;ll keep waiting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rise-of-flight-the-first-great-air-war/user-reviews?user_review_id=742539">Expand</a></span>
