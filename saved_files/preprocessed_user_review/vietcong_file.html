Weapons are unique respectively . the story is rich as good war movie out there, but not overly-dramatic like those ordinal WW2 shooters. Various locations drawn/built in fine detail. Perfect shooting balance between realistic shooter and arcade action. Truly a masterpiece.</span>

This tried hard but was let out of the door too early -- and it&apos;s NOT as good as Delta Force: Blackhawk Down, a much more polished game.</span>

Look, this game is stupid. The gameplay is horrible, design is atrocious and AI is idiotic. Allied Assault is wayyy better, this however, is a waste of time.</span>

Before and after the time period this game was released, we saw dramatic changes in the way games were designed, giving over to the commercial need for mass appeal, and doing away with the more savage past of gaming, demanding more skill, patience and strategic thinking from its players.
<br>
<br>Modern games, like the Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises, showed that it was commercially in the FPS genre&apos;s best interest to add in things like radars, enemy names appearing over their heads, and larger health bars to make deaths less likely to occur. Vietcong will give you none of these things. Because soldiers in Vietnam didn&apos;t have them either.
<br>
<br>Instead, players had to be smart. They had immersive environments, brush that could hide snipers, dead trees to use for cover as impromptu machine gun nests, and high mountains that could hide lethal snipers capable of killing you with a single well-placed shot. This game, simply put, was too terrifying for most people to enjoy.
<br>
<br>A few of us could handle it. We had the ability to thrive in an environment where superior wits, strategy, and reflexes meant *everything* in your ability to win the day. So with that I explain it thusly: If you think Vietcong is anything besides one of the FPS genre&apos;s most important titles, it&apos;s because you were terrible at it. That&apos;s not the games fault, so you can keep your 5.0-7.5 ratings. That is only a reflection of your own skill level here.
<br>
<br>Lets look at what the game offered, relative to its time, and its lasting impact. Vietcong was innovative for its day, offering things like weapon &apos;kick&apos; that previously was only displayed in games like Doom or Duke Nukem as a visual effect. In Vietcong, unlike just about any game before it, the player now had to keep their controls from going haywire when firing automatic weapons.
<br>
<br>Additionally, the game had as previously stated, placed a significant emphasis on terrain and its use. Players trying to &apos;run and gun&apos; would most likely be instantly cut down by those willing to be a bit more cautious in their movements. This detail, perhaps above all others, may be why so many people were unwilling to give this game a real chance.
<br>
<br>Binoculars, maps, and real survival skills: You were given the first two, the second part was up to you to learn. The game was based in a simpler time for soldiers, and those limitations became one of the most exciting components of the game, especially if you are a fan of history. By learning how soldiers of the day fought, you realized the challenges the real men faced, if only in the smallest of ways. Other games have been based on this era, but none of them captured the fear and intensity so brutally. Learning to use binoculars to see your path ahead, and clear it of snipers, was an exciting challenge, and not knowing where you were, except by piecing it together using your map and your surroundings as a guide, made things even more tricky. Again, this game is meant to be an experience of man against nature, and in this way, it is a masterpiece.
<br>
<br>Lastly, the game&apos;s legacy. Sadly, as incredible as the game was, its sequel utterly failed to capture what was amazing about the original. Perhaps sensing a need to update to keep pace with recent and far different releases like Unreal Tournament, Vietcong 2 found itself quickly dropped into obscurity. That failure ultimately caused the company who designed this game to go under, denying future audiences a chance at seeing a new release worthy of the name.
<br>
<br>However, as long as I live (and game) I will continue to measure *all* FPS games against the standard of Vietcong. With so many modern games focused on appeasing low skill players (to maintain higher income levels), I will continue to find them inevitably more disappointing than games which demanded more of their players. If you ever have an opportunity to get a group of players together, I highly recommend taking the time not just to play the story of Vietcong (which was chock full of great characters, and big scares!) but to master the nuance of the fighting styles required to survive in it.
<br>
<br>After learning this game, no other shooter will ever feel like a challenge again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vietcong/user-reviews?user_review_id=7519643">Expand</a></span>
