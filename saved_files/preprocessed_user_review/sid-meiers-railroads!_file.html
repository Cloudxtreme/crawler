I started to love this one too, but then I noticed after I was doing well and had a lot of track on the map, bugs would start emerging: Track would disappear; Water would suddenly be in the middle of the map where land was before...then...crash! After it crashed, Windows would do some really funny stuff too until I rebooted. What a huge pain the butt to have to reboot everytime I felt like playing Railroads...and most of the time I could not even make it through a game without it crashing.It really sucked when I played multiplayer becuase rarely did any of us make it through a game without someone crashing. On the other hand, my brother&apos;s copy runs just great. I am guessing that they only tested this game on a very small set of hardware and decided that everyone who doesn&apos;t use that set of hardware is just SOL. From what I see here, that means more people than not get the shaft. So here&apos;s a big thumbs down to the development team and most of all the management team that proably pushed the developers in directions they did not want to go, all in the name of maximizing profit. Gotta keep those shareholders happy you know. Morons. I guess told them that game sales will start declining when people get fed up with their substandard software.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-railroads!/user-reviews?user_review_id=406510">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s too easy, too shallow, not much of anything besides putting down railroads (and I guess you can argue that that&apos;s the whole point, but I would&apos;ve liked to have something besides that, something deeper, something more like transport giant or locomotion). This is basicly a children game.
<br>In a very short time you will learn how to win any game very fast. Then you will learn to do it with any given spawn point. And then you will quickly find out how to beat 3 AI on hardest difficulty. It took me one evening to complete almost full game.
<br>And that&apos;s with the constant crashes and freezes. Yes, it doesn&apos;t work good on any system and I was forced to save every couple minute or so, so I won&apos;t lose my progress.
<br>It could&apos;ve been so much more, but in the end, it&apos;s pretty easy and shallow game for one evening.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-railroads!/user-reviews?user_review_id=3643020">Expand</a></span>

Haven&apos;t had any bugs or performance issues, but the game just doesn&apos;t feel done.  Several things in the manual that comes boxed with the game just don&apos;t exist in the actual game.  The game is quite simple, not nearly as complex as Railroad Tycoon 3, which may or may not be a bad thing.</span>

The game runs well enough for me and is entertaining although it has a fairly simple economic model and somewhat cartoony feel to it.

The biggest challenge is to figure out how to deal with laying double/triple track so your trains don&apos;t block each other. This is made difficult by the 3/4 view - it&apos;s very hard to lay track precisely. Other than that the economy is pretty simple with only a few types of goods. Since a 150 year campaign takes only 3 hours to complete at regular speed it&apos;s simply not worth it to reconfigure your opponents&apos;s to work with your network once you&apos;ve bought them out - I just couldn&apos;t be bothered to worry about efficiencies for a game that would be over before I could even enjoy the fruit of my labor. Also frustrating there is no way to figure out what trains serve a city, so when you do purchase your opponent you either have to click on every bloody train to figure out what it does and rejig it (computer is very sucky in terms of route mgmt!) Again, not worth the trouble since the game will be over before you know it. Other than that UI looks good and very simple (perhaps too much for this gamer), maps are a little too small for my taste - 4 player game quickly become a nightmarish spaghetti of tracks trying to serve the same small cities. Conclusion: I like simplicity, but this makes it feel like a msn game. Maybe my girlfriend will find it interesting for an hour or two. If you want a game to immerse yourself in, take a pass. Version played is an electronic download - any patches coming?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-railroads!/user-reviews?user_review_id=392556">Expand</a></span>

No, you don&apos;t need to like FS10 or IL2 to see this game as the real turkey it is. Another interesting argument of the few people who liked it is about the great multiplayer capabilities: FORGET IT. I played with my wife. It crashed 4 times in an hour. It&apos;s boring, becaue you have not many things to do besides looking for the trains to go around collecting huge piles of cash!

I really was hoping for something close to the gameplay of the original Railroad Tycoon with updated graphics. Why can&apos;t the developers understand that accurately and precisely laying track and placing signals is immensely satisfying in a railroad game? And why are there no top-down overview 2D maps of your railroad empire? Or at least a few more levels of zooming out. The game is so claustrophobic and crowded. The maps are just so small- your trains never seem like they are going cross-country. Overall it feels like a &quot;kiddie&quot; game. I could go on here... Firaxis owes us a refund.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-railroads!/user-reviews?user_review_id=392678">Expand</a></span>

No deep at all, a lot of bugs, no fun, I&apos;m very dissapointed, I expected something closer to RT3 which was very good, save your money buy something else!</span>

The supply/demand and cargo changing between cities has been very much simplified and is a lot easier to use. The railway layout has been simplified a lot as well, so that it automagically lays the track for you and you don&apos;t have to worry as much about minor/small gradients in the track. The downside to this new system is that it seems kind of buggy and is hard to get it the way you want it. You also have to worry more about switching between double tracks and signals and such. It does the switching automatically, but with the new layout system again, it&apos;s hard to get it to work right. It appears to be somewhat unstable, my roomate crashed multiple times in the first 30 minutes, but has been fine for the past hour or so. I just crashed for the first time when trying to delete a complicated piece of track (trying to get it just right...) So far overall I think it&apos;s definitely worth a purchase, and I hope more Shackers will pick it up. If they can get it more stable, and hopefully work on the auto track layout, I think it&apos;d be incredibly engrossing. Oh, and more maps would be nice as well. There&apos;s no US south east map! Worrrd. Look forward to a patch, but until then I will enjoy it. Later impressions: Played a couple more hours and it didn&apos;t crash, but the automatic track making was very frustrating as the trains did not work very well, or atleast the trains would stop where there was available track to use up ahead. It also runs pretty shitty once cities got larger. I JUST built this system last week, an OCed C2D with a 7900gto and it slowed down quite a bit. Also, NO ONE was playing multiplayer. No one even in the lobbies. At most, 2 people. So yeah, great game, worth picking up, but hopefuly they will patch this with some graphics optimizations and fixes for the track laying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-railroads!/user-reviews?user_review_id=392441">Expand</a></span>

If you are like me, and think games like MS Flight Simulator IL2 and Harpoon! are too detailed to be called &quot;games&quot;, then you might very well like this one. Let&apos;s be honest gang...Sid isn&apos;t known for hard-core simulations...Pirates can&apos;t be called a true simulation of the Age of Sail any more than the Civ games aret detailed historical simulations. Sid has always made games that were on the simpler side...but fun. There are some bugs, which unfortunately is pretty much the rule rather than the exception these days.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-railroads!/user-reviews?user_review_id=392506">Expand</a></span>

I haven&apos;t run into the crashing problems that others have (i&apos;m not saying they don&apos;t happen, I just haven&apos;t seen it). If you are looking for an all-around solid game, with traditional Sid Meier&apos;s strategy, Railroads gets the job done. As for multi-player, I think this is where the game really shines. While single player is a bit on the easy-to-win side, multi-player is a serious challenge, and is a seriously fast moving game where if you don&apos;t pay attention, your apt to get most of your cargo stolen.

                                        <span>I have thoroughly enjoyed this Railroad game by Sid, thanks Sid ^_^
<br>But there is only One problem i have, and that is every time i hold down the mouse button and drag long out for a long railroad it crashes.  This is definitely a windows 7 memory problem with the game.
<br>Apart from that I give it a 9 out of 10 ^_^
<br>it truly reminded me of Locomotion back in the day.</span>

<br>I haven&apos;t played RRT2 and 3 yet (maybe will do so if Railroads proves to be not sophisticated enough.)
<br>
<br>I only played one scenario so far: the german (1835-1980) with 3 computer opponents and beginner difficulty (&quot;investor&quot;/&quot;medium&quot;) - and it&apos;s far too easy: I retired 1917 after completing all tasks and buying all stocks /defeating all 3 opponents - why should I continue until 1980?
<br>Retiring 1917 earned me best possible ranking - I think ranking should be &quot;normalised&quot; like in Civ IV (where I&apos;m usually sticking with &quot;prince&quot;-difficulty), so that difficulty is taken into account (I&apos;m not sure if this is the case here - but you shouldn&apos;t get best ranking in easiest setting - even if you finish very early). Will continue playing now in harder settings.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-railroads!/user-reviews?user_review_id=73134">Expand</a></span>

<br>I read many complaints about crashes and technical problems, but I rarely encountered any by now (15-16 hours of gameplay). The game did crash once for me, but it seems to have been an isolated incident. Generally - the game plays just fine (Windows 7 64bit).
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t have much to say about the graphics and music, which I suppose has a lot to do with this game being 7 years old by the time this review is being written. Obviously, I can&apos;t expect it to look and sound like games released during the last couple of years, so this is not a issue for me.
<br>
<br>As for the gameplay - I really love the general idea of building a railroad network, connecting cities and industrial sites. The game does offer a fairly deep, balanced and complex gameplay, but I must admit, that as a Civilization series veteran, I was expecting more. In every scenario I play, I usually end up with quite a network and a lot of money, so I start working on the scenario goals, but I can&apos;t escape the feeling that something is missing. I&apos;m not sure if the problem is a lack of challenge, or maybe the scope of each of the scenarios is too small, or maybe something else that I&apos;m missing.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, I love this game, I wish I had discovered it before, but what I&apos;d really love - is an improved sequel. I doubt Firaxis games are even thinking about it, but maybe someone else will step up to the challenge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sid-meiers-railroads!/user-reviews?user_review_id=3963677">Expand</a></span>
