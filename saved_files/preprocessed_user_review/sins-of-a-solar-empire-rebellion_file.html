Aside from that, the game is generally fun to play. Once I bought it, I was completely bemused towards how to play it, making the game slightly dull and depressing at first. However, after gaining experience and understanding how the game works, it was fantastic. Ships of great variety and the picturesque background makes the game consistently attractive in graphics and design. The combat fighting may be slightly dull at times, but with massive battalions of larger ships and things, it will be fun to play.
<br>
<br>The only downside I have, would be the duration to complete the game. It would literally take me a few days just to complete a match with 13 or more planets. It may be my inexperience, but I believe many people would feel the same way sometimes. But I really can&apos;t complain about duration if the fun is consistently being kept at a high level.
<br>
<br>It would be hard for me to sit down patiently and play a game that could last more than 8 hours, but that&apos;s just me. Hence the game deserves my 8. I was also amazed at the community mods, making the game far more interesting as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=3196556">Expand</a></span>

<br>2: Maps are few and small, which takes away the idea of exploring (on the largest map you can find your enemy as fast as you would in C&amp;C in 1vs1 on a small map). Large maps would just make the game even worse due to the stale units.
<br>
<br>These factors alone take away any sort of strategy other than countering with the right unit, which is very easy to do and incredibly unsatisfying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=4270458">Expand</a></span>

Back on 2010 I found the first version of Sins of a solar empire in a target for 10 bucks. I bought the game thinking it would be just another one of those crappy made strategy games out there. Happily I was wrong, and this is by far my favorite game of all time. Starting and practicing on the first, to eventually buying trinity and then to rebellion Ive found that Rebellion is by far the best in the series and in my opinion the best strategy game Ive ever played. The abilities and power the gamer gets in this game is amazing and extremely addicting. Th game is very intensive too. Its taken me 4 years to get moderately good tactics and skill with SOASE. Rebellions great however I really hope they add even more capital ships and maybe even factions along the way. High praises to Stardock and Ironclad!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=4170202">Expand</a></span>

<br>While reading the negative reviews i came to realize that they mostly cover the following:
<br>-the &quot;expansion&quot; hasn&apos;t got enough new content (with which I highly disagree, besides, it&apos;s a standalone title)
<br>-Master of orion and Gal Civ are better (to people who say this: real-time strategies are obviously not your thing, no matter how much content they pack)
<br>
<br>The game is as good as flawless when you look at it at a standalone viewpoint.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=2559225">Expand</a></span>

However, the problems with the game are so prolific that after a couple of play-throughs it really does become unplayable.
<br>
<br>The engine is from &quot;yesterday&quot; - no multicore support.
<br>
<br>Heaps of gameplay bugs - as a for instance, one ship has an ability called &quot;Armistice&quot; which stops all fighting for 1 minute.. unfortunately the AI can get stuck with multiple akkan&apos;s constantly &quot;casting&quot; this ability over and over so that you cannot ever fight that fleet, thereby never winning the game.
<br>
<br>The AI is kind of underfed in terms of ability to play and overfed in &quot;cheat&quot; modes.
<br>
<br>The interface doesn&apos;t easily allow you to select units like fighters (they can move awfully fast and selecting all fighters and all bombers is a nightmare).
<br>
<br>The game eventually on larger maps - as you will want to play after a few goes at the game, crashes - a lot.
<br>
<br>A half finished product on an old engine - its&apos; only saving grace being an awesome game and concept.
<br>
<br>Seems a lot like a typical &quot;moneygrab&quot; from a gaming company, where they release a small product almost the same as the original for a quick grab at players money for little new content (certainly no new engine) and in this case have released it far too early with heaps of bugs and gameplay issues.

<br>It gets a 5 from me..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=2507125">Expand</a></span>

Yes, there are some additions, but they are merely a handful of additions to the same old game. Do not buy this game, especially if you already have the original SOASE. The differences are so minimal that you won&apos;t be able to tell the two apart when you boot them up.
<br>
<br>Stardock is intentionally not showing any gameplay trailers. They have these new rendered trailers which are obviously not from this game, I think maybe they had to buy the technology to make those videos since their game engine is incapable. Don&apos;t think you&apos;ll be seeing anything like what&apos;s in the trailers. In order to justify a $40 price tag, a studio would have to create new content, update their game engine, improve their audio, etc. etc. etc, none of which was done.
<br>
<br>This is SOASE with expansions, like a GOTY edition, except  that it&apos;s been several years since this game was originally released. Several. Years. Same game. Same old game. A couple new units, a couple new tech, but most of the units (90%) are copied and pasted from SOASE.
<br>
<br>So I&apos;m really curious as to why people like this game. I played the original flavor, and maybe thought it wasn&apos;t a waste of $30, but I didn&apos;t play it much since it was very rough around the edges, and I was more accustomed to games like Company of Heroes and Civilization which were polished, fun, and well produced. But this SOASE expansion for $40 is like paying for shoes that don&apos;t fit and cannot be returned. &apos;Rebellion&apos; is a waste of money, a useless game, a joke, a trick to steal your hard earned money in exchange for an old game with a new name which was mediocre to begin with.
<br>
<br>What I&apos;m trying to say is: DO NOT buy this $10 expansion for $40. This is an expansion to an existing game being sold as a stand-alone game. There is no option to buy it as an expansion, even though 90% of the game is from the original SOASE. If you like being ropped off, then go for it. I haven&apos;t had buyer&apos;s remorse this badly in a long time. Total ripoff.

If you never bought the original game and its expansions, then Rebellion is probably the best way to go. For the rest of us however I cannot see the value here. This is one of those games that you will probably reconsider when Steam has it on sale for $20 bux. Until then, unless you are really jonesing for a fix, avoid this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=2479337">Expand</a></span>

Getting that out of the way, what they did add is new toys that are pretty fun to play with. Doing things like eating planets for resources, building a ship that&apos;s just a giant gun, and attacking people by flying Starbases at them are pretty awesome. They&apos;re also pretty imbalanced. So all in all this is kind of a mixed bag. If you liked Sins before and you&apos;re okay with balance issues being present in this version (hopefully to be patched later), then you&apos;ll enjoy Rebellion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=2469790">Expand</a></span>

I wish this series would pull through on their &quot;epic galaxy battles&quot;, however, they do not exist in any version in the series thus far. Large and huge maps experience performance decay over time as the AI expands and the last few hours of a game turn into a slide show. You could search support for dev talk relating to the end game lag. Those threads tend to fall off the first page and go into the archive.
<br>
<br>Random counters:
<br>Limiting the number of AI players only reduces end game lag in the sense that 1 AI player is unable to capture territory as fast as 1 good player. What you end up is a set games where the AI and player are equal in skill, but unplayable and another set where the player rolls the AI.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=2707219">Expand</a></span>

The trailers led me to believe there was some in depth storyline, but it&apos;s just a series of boring skirmishes that last too long. It looks nice visually (not up to todays standards) but you will spend 98% of the time zoomed so far out that you never see any ships or fighting, just tiny icons. A waste of money (thanks for the no refund policy Steam). I advise you not to waste your money. Go play Space Empires, a shareware game from Windows 95/98, while not impressive visually, it is actually enjoyable to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=2482593">Expand</a></span>

The problem is, Stardock released Rebellion as a PURELY stand-alone game for $40 that is 90%+ the same as the original SOASE and it&apos;s expansions. They could have easily made this another expansion like the others but they made it a $40 stand-alone as a PURE CASH GRAB. They should have at least allowed existing SOASE owners to tack it on as a normal expansion for half the price instead of paying a full $40 for a game that is more than 90% the same as what I have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=3860355">Expand</a></span>

And on that note, a word of warning: don&apos;t be fooled by the &quot;expansion&quot; label, for Rebellion is a bigger and better game than the three previous games in the series combined. With each of the original three unique civilizations (Vasari, Advent, TEC) divided into two rebelling factions, Rebellion provides more opportunities to hone and practice your tactical genius by using over a dozen different approaches and strategies with any of the six factions. Whether you want to become the greatest civilization through trade and diplomacy, cultural expansion, utter annihilation, mass colonization, concrete fortification or any other variety of tactics, this game promises you replay value by providing a degree of action, strategy and customization no other game offers. Days of playing time will accumulate as you choose a faction, earn resources, construct buildings, upgrade planets, research technology, build ships, colonize planets, forge alliances, conquer enemies and do whatever else it takes to dominate the star(s). Even those not privy to the RTS genre will find something to enjoy in this sci-fi deluxe--such as leveling up capital ships and the newly-added mighty titan, micromanaging a galactic economy or controlling dozens of ships in real-time combat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=2467648">Expand</a></span>

<br>Honestly i think that there is a misunderstanding, they wanna serve us real time as something modern and better then before, but sadly it means that the game must be very streamlined and limited to allow the player to manage all in real time.
<br>Also i have to tell that those 3D maps zoom in / zoom out /rotate all the time are nearly useless, 3 levels with a fixed air view were more then needed to play this game perfectly.
<br>I give a 5 cause the game overall isnt bad, just im a bit sad to see this game seems the &quot;Cod generation&quot; version of good tactical space games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=2555681">Expand</a></span>

<br>With that said, I am very critical of new games and I love this one. I am a big fan of the Home World series and have been looking for something like it for years. I have never played any of the previous releases so I can&apos;t make any comment on whats different with Rebellion. The artwork is very good and the game-play is excellent. I love the old-time slow paced RTS feel. My first round in single player lasted until daylight (I lost). As soon as Friday night gets here, I&apos;ll wait for the wife and kids to go to bed and I;lll sneak back down stairs for another all-nighter.

I bought Trinity when it came out (not on steam but impulse) and loved it. the only thing that sucks is that they didn&apos;t release it as DLC but standalone, thats just confusing and forces compatibility problems. in my opinion its just a way of moneymaking and the price of $40 ($30 when you already own a sins game and buy through stardock website) is way to much for someone who ownes trinity already. for players who never played or owned sins before its just perfect and the price is even cheap. nevertheless the game is just great and i hope that it will attract a bigger fanbase since it was released through steam as well. whoever complains about feeling ripped off because they thought its a complete new game should learn to read before spending money. i mean you really have to have the money sitting to lose when you buy something without even getting some informations about it beforehand. and who buys it knowing what he gets and still is not happy because it is &apos;just&apos; an expansion should be angry about him/herself... and even then it should be possible to get a refund. at least it was never a problem for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=2472358">Expand</a></span>

There are trade-offs between military and civilian techs. Decent tutorials. Good graphics. Interesting combat. Complaints about the price of the game are now dated as this IS the game in its complete or fully-updated form. My only personal qualm is that the gameplay tends towards RTS, and is designed for multiplayer play, which can be anxiety-inducing. I prefer the pause-and play format that gives one ample time to think, or even sleep on a move rather than forever force attention and decision making. Strategy games shouldn&apos;t be rushed. Rome was NOT built in a day.

<br>THE GROT REVIEW CRITERIA: After a long time writing reviews like an anus, think its time to set a few bad habits straight: Stop insulting designers. Show some respect for the design process and getting games in circulation. Hence (1) No Red scores. (2) Game scores as follows: Bad Game 5/10. Poor Game 6/10. Mediocre Game: 7/10. Good Game 8/10. Great game 9/10. Stella Game 10/10. To get 10/10 it must be a game that can be (theoretically) play-able for 1000+ hours. Not only great but near endless fun. Games may be bad or poor but making them should earn respect. Thus even the worst POS will still be a 5/10. 0/10 no longer exists in my vocabulary. Yellow is the new red.

There&apos;s too much going on in the empire to command the ships manually, and I usually just leave it to AI (which does it well). Also, in StarCraft, you have hard rock-paper-scissors like stealth and ground/air units, so you have to provide counters or lose regardless of amount of units. In this game everything can be soft-countered by everything, so you just need a huge fleet and you&apos;ll steamroll anything. You need, however, to create a successful economy to build that fleet. Overall, there&apos;s a decent depth to the game, and I suppose it&apos;s fun in multiplayer (if you are prepared to play for 5-6 hours). I definitely recommend to try it if you like Master of Orion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=3016339">Expand</a></span>

Though I had not played any of the previous incarnations of Sins, Rebellion a natural fit, and offered an amazing degree of depth and PC user-friendly options and extras, including the unparalleled boon of being able to save multi-player games for later continuance. Though there is no story-driven campaign to speak of, skirmish play is great fun and moreso, co-op comp stomp with friends. With support for up to ten players in a game and map sizes varying from a single star system to a vast galactic expanse, a single match can offer many vigorous hours of gameplay. Each of the playable factions has a staggering array of mighty warships and combat abilities, but military conquest is but one path to victory. You can dominate through technological or economic superiority, or even seek the diplomatic path and achieve victory without firing a shot. A small handful of updates and DLCs add even more depth and variety to the events of a match.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6507912">Expand</a></span>

The Vasari Loyalists for instance can blow up planets for resources leaving very little behind to be captured meaning you can just steamroll across the galaxy tearing up planets as you go rather than trying to hold vast territories. Loyalist Advent have culture so powerful it can literally exterminate an enemy empire if used early on in the game. However, all of my saves on huge maps so far have ended up corrupted and the game still lacks multi-core support, so big space battles slow down the game.Overall, I really like where they&apos;re taking the direction of the additions, but I kinda feel like I got a half-finished game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=2520308">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>when that is said i like a good long lasting game and rebellion simply nailed it, there are so many ways of playing this game with several different factions.
<br>i&apos;ll not say that they have added tonnes of material but there&apos;s plenty toys to play with.

Another thing would be to note this is a game that isn&apos;t about micro and situational strategy but more about macro and resource income pretty much like starcraft with all that much more macro and research. Which makes the game incredibly frustrating when you get absurdly large amount of planets each with its own base building area and limited amount of slots. When it comes down to it this game is really only good for LAN parties that or very long and boring skirmish matches against a one trick pony Ai.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=3445729">Expand</a></span>

As a huge fan of the original Sins, I was expecting this game to leave it in its tracks. Especially when I saw the price tag. For the amount of money they&apos;re asking, I was hoping there would be a bit more content. The new UI is very nice and additional ships add a nice new layer of depth. However, it felt like that was it. Sure the graphics were polished a bit and a couple other changes were made but the expansion felt like it was a bit shallow. You won&apos;t tell much of a difference between Trinity and Rebellion until a few hours into the game. But at that point, the gloves are off and Rebellion shows what its got. The division of each of the 3 factions works nicely and adds more variety to the games. The titans are real game-changers and so much fun. If you were a fan of Trinity and have the money to fork out for the expansion, do it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=2816288">Expand</a></span>

I would have liked to have seen some 3D graphic and GUI enhancements, but hey, the extra content is enough to make this game well worth it, and I&apos;ve already spent hours engrossed in the new features, especially when you get the new Forbidden Worlds DLC. Recommending this to anyone looking for an upgrade to the original Sins.</span>

Rebellion when found at a good price is an excellent expansion stand alone.  The addition of Fractions change how enemies and players develop.  The only drawbacks are the length of games and sever issues.  Highly recommended anyone who plays RTS games give this a try.</span>

<br>
<br>At first I thought, this is like Eve, only feels emptier, less visually striking. I struck up a game, after searching for the &apos;campaign&apos; button from which to launch the story that would carry me through events leading... well, wherever. But there is no campaign. This is not a problem. You see, what &apos;Sins&apos; does is strip away all the surplus and really get to grips with what makes a fantastic strategy game.
<br>
<br>It was during my second playing of the game that something happened: I couldn&apos;t stop playing. It&apos;s like peeling an onion, only to cry a little more as another layer appears. It supplies something sadly lacking in many of the games I&apos;ve played recently, depth. The controls/menus/UI are all deceptively simple, this just makes the game easy to play. Complexity comes from the myriad strategies possible from the many different options and tactics that can be employed as the game develops. Each game, I might add, feels unique. With a huge list of maps, options that can be tweaked on and off, and the ability to produce your own maps.

<br>I&apos;m only on my fifth game, yet each time I&apos;ve started up a new game I&apos;ve become even deeper immersed. It&apos;s great because you can save whenever you like, so you can play little by little or a lot at a time, it&apos;s up to you. And when you feel confident (I&apos;m not there yet) it can be played with a live opponent/s! Huge potential for employing the diplomatic elements of the game.

<br>I bought it for under &#xA3;10 on steam, well worth the money. I expect it will go on to provide me a huge amount of satisfaction way beyond when other, more visual games have long fallen by the wayside. It probably won&apos;t be for those who prefer fast games which give you a rush, games with graphics that demand only the best, most beefy computer or who enjoy a more story based experience. If you have patience, like quiet, unassuming complexity, enjoy working out how best to manage the long term development of an expanding intergalactic empire, then you&apos;ll most likely love it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=3426411">Expand</a></span>

<br>You have a working recipe and you add a few more carefully balanced ingredients. Fine by me.
<br>Much better than forgetting your success story and trying to feed your fan base with cr*p (X3 vs X:R comes to mind).
<br>SoaSE:R is one of the best games of its genre. You should own it.</span>

                                        <span>I think this is one of the best Real Time Strategy games out there. It is fast paced, or pausable if you are in single player or in a coop game so you can give commands to your units at whatever rate you want. Although the graphics are only slightly different than the original, the gameplay is more fun with the inclusion of Titans.</span>

This game has a pretty impressive polish and can even run on medium graphics on a modern TK-42 model, and let me tell you how much &quot;fun&quot; this can get with the scale of the game. This is not a good game for RTS amateurs who never heard of 4X RTS games or people who generally like to see fast paced action on screen.
<br>
<br>The game is not as in dept as some of its former competitors, and I admit that the space battles are nothing but a fancy light show where the ships have a stationary combat formation with only one objective of draining both shields and health bars. Nothing special about this franchise as I have a sort of favoritism towards the engines capabilities and super effective use of computer resources. Let&apos;s say this is the game to go with if you don&apos;t have any dedicated gamers PC. Its sound, never crashed on me before like the trashy triple A games (which generally means nothing to me at this point).
<br>
<br>The art style for space pirates is the perfect classic imagine with green torches and &quot;Screw shields, we got the best armor in the universe&quot; Attitude that can be annoying harassment early game if you don&apos;t have credits to spare in the bounty system. To this day I was disappointment there was no pirate faction added as the ships designs looked better then the boring tech architecture.
<br>
<br>Then you got the micro expansions (This may be the hell spawn where the very first DLC&apos;s on earth spawned) all rolled into the package with only titans and a slap to the face to people who already invested in those micro expansions. Needless to say it does not apply as much anymore as most of you already read the first reviews.
<br>
<br>From the amount of hours I spent into it, and that I am still impressed with what this game has to offer for a price, I say go get it if you like slower paced galactic space combat 4X strategy games.  I don&apos;t have any regrets getting this for myself and everybody else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=4940043">Expand</a></span>

Sadly no campaign, problems with performance when there&apos;s many ships, and not a perfect AI. Still have spent hundreds of hours in it. May it have a continuation.</span>

Although $40 is a steep price, the game is worth its weight in gold if you enjoy 4X and grand strategy games that are dynamic and offer endless hours of entertainment. The DLC adds some flare and more strategic options to the mix. I have played every Sins of a Solar Empire since the first one was released back in 2008 and I assure you this is by far the best installment in the series.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>Enormous space battles &#x2013; Upwards of 3000+ ships within one gravity well can be quite the site to behold, especially in cinematic mode
<br>Online multiplayer &#x2013; You must make an account, which doesn&apos;t take long and then you can play with your friends vs. AI or against other players
<br>Custom map designer &#x2013; Allows you to make absolutely massive maps, even to the scale of an entire galaxy and it is an essential tool to help you acquire achievements
<br>Grand strategy - Diplomacy, Trade, Pirates, Fleets, Research and much more
<br>Multiple races each with their own unique tech trees, specialties and titans
<br>Mod friendly &#x2013; There are mods that allow you completely overhaul the game, such as Star Wars, Star Trek and Mass Effect themed mods and smaller more particular mods that allow you to change a tech tree or add a wider variety of planets + I recommend using Mod DB
<br>Game speed management in single-player, which gives you the freedom to play at your desired pace
<br>Cinematic button to help you sit back and enjoy grand battles
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>Multiplayer games can be quite sluggish and take very long periods of time to finish so be sure to save between play sessions
<br>Limitations of the engine and poor connections from time-to-time can sometimes make it difficult to enjoy online gameplay
<br>No campaign or rich backstory - The lore is quite interesting, but they never expanded upon it, which could have made the game ever better
<br>Dated graphics &#x2013; I imagine there is a mod to fix this issue if you don&apos;t enjoy the current graphical quality
<br>Not a large player base for online multiplayer so I highly recommend playing with a friend
<br>
<br>Note: Give this game a solid chance, even if it seems overwhelming at first.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire-rebellion/user-reviews?user_review_id=6977538">Expand</a></span>
