One of the biggest challenges in galciv2 was to balance production, economy, research and approval. Well in galciv3 economy is stupid easy to maintain. Its trivial to maintain positive income even with no economic improvements on planets. Further, production seems to the king of all resources in this game as you can convert production to other types resources (like money or research as you could in Galciv2) but you can increase production much more easily than the other two and you can set up production based planets almost 3-4 times as fast. Since there are so many ways to amplify production, you can easily have a planet with 2x-3x as much production than any other possible resource with their bonus buildings. As a result, my main production center almost always acts as my best research planets (same for money but I never need money in this game)... very disappointing when you consider how much longer it takes to build research planets, one would think there should be a reward for it but nope, you are better off making all production and converting to research.
<br>
<br>My only other gripe is the AI. It seems to me that the AI cheats in higher difficulties rather than playing by the rules. I am not sure if Galciv2 was that way but I dont like that because it cheapens a win and a loss does not really feel like a loss since I know the AI is cheating.
<br>
<br>Overall a good game despite the above gripes. Much of the old game is in Galciv3 but I really did not think that any of the new additions made the game any better. I think Galciv2 is a better game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5251685">Expand</a></span>

<br>There is also the issue with the AI cheating to keep up with the player.  Stardock claims there is no atrifical bonuses being handed out as many poorly designed 4X games rely on (usually a categorical production bonus as the player gets more powerful).  Instead Stardock allows the AI to trade tech for free between themselves, as they did back in Gal Civ 2.  Which is why when tech brokering was turned off in #2 the AI was such a cakewalk.  Any player would jump at the chance to get free tech, especially since some of those give gloabal bonuses (e.g. +1 Speed to all ships).  So not only do they get bonuses, but they are far more excessive than mere production (they get those too).  This is to cover-up the continuing lack of actual intelligence in their system.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5318865">Expand</a></span>

Another backdraw is the list of planets which is a joke compared to GalCiv2. But these shortcomings make it very unpleasant to play longer or with bigger maps, which contradicts the games claim that now even bigger maps are (at least technically) available, because they are practically not playable with the game mechanics at hand.
<br>If you haven&apos;t played GalCiv games at all so far, then i urgently recommend to get GalCiv2 Ultimate and forget about GalCiv3. Probably they are improving GalCiv3 over time, but so far i haven&apos;t seen any signs of that happening.
<br>I played mine for just 2 sessions and never again. Too tedious. Waste of money.

<br>
<br>The game interface as far as managing planets and whatnot is fine, it all makes sense, easy to deal with, but again, the sense of overseeing a huge chunk of the galaxy is totally not there at all.  Battles are tedious, building up fleets is a snoozefest (not to mention moving them painful inch by painful inch).
<br>
<br>Just didn&apos;t fill that warm spot in my heart like I remember MOO and others did. If you had told me this was created 10 years ago, I wouldn&apos;t have doubted it.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played basically one game, (over approx 12 hours of actual play) and as every goes by, the &quot;one more turn&quot; feeling turns into &quot;What other game should I play.&quot; much quicker each time.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll give it one more session perhaps but it&apos;s def on my &quot;uninstall&quot; short list as is another game from same company</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5387828">Expand</a></span>

Although I am not much of a civilization strategic type of gamer, I have played other games like Civilization Revolution, Tropico, and Age Of Empires and I found those to be more interesting then Gciv3. I did appreciate the high end graphics and I taught the mechanics were just fine. I also felt that the enemies were either too easy to defeat or to hard to oppose.

<br>The game at its current state makes me think that the game is rushed and under a poor budget.
<br>
<br>A campaign with only 3 scenarios? Are you kidding me? It is the shortest campaign in any game I have ever played. On top of that,  the campaign is dull and boring, adding little to the original story.
<br>
<br>The game is very unstable, many if not most players encountered blue-screen-of-death or crash-to-desktop issues from time to time.
<br>
<br>The game is very imbalanced. I can own everyone with a single carrier fleet on the hardest difficulty or keep producing the most overpowered ship 100 times the strength of my enemie&apos;s flagship every turn with my ridiculous manufacturing power; I could make a radar ship that reveals the whole map for me. I could make some &quot;teleport&quot; transport ship that is capable of bring 3 billions of my soldiers from one side of the universe to another,  taking my rival&apos;s colony all in a single turn!
<br>
<br>Serisouly, I feel the game developers had spent little time on balancing the game because they don&apos;t even have enough time to fix the stability issue.
<br>
<br>In conclusion, the game is rushed and not polished at all. I suggest anyone who haven&apos;t already bought the game to wait until they  fix the game or wait for a -75% price cut on Steam before buying it or just buy GalCiv 2 now because it is 100 times better than its successor.
<br>
<br>I would leave the game at a rating of 6 until they fix the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5271338">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The Neutral
<br>&gt;Fewer things to do make the game less of a micromanagement hassle.  But also takes away some of the fun.
<br>&gt;Graphics are improved but largely due to resolution. Only the ship editor will WOW you
<br>&gt;Economy sliders have been replaced by an Economy wheel, which provides more control however the overall effect of finances or money on an empire is substantially diluted.
<br>
<br>The Bad
<br>&gt;Fleet AI is dumber than a box of rocks. They make piecemeal attacks, they don&apos;t have to scout to find planets or other races, they just know they are there.
<br>&gt;Empire AI is downright bad, they build but they build in non-nonsensical ways which limit the threat they will post to players even on the highest difficulty.
<br>&gt;Lots of cool stuff from Gal Civ 2 Expansions, GONE.
<br>&gt;Diplomatic design is really bad, limiting you to things the AI can do but you cant, once you trade with them you have a lockout which prevents you from doing anything with the other AIs except declare war, even with allies for up to 20 turns. Oh yeah and they pester the hell out of you for money and send you short messages which are annoying and repetitive. In short the AI = Half baked.
<br>&gt;Largest Maps even on recommended systems lag between turns, stutter, and don&apos;t run the game well. How many gigs of ram do you need to run those? Even systems with 8GB,16GB, of RAM are being reported as struggling.
<br>&gt;No Manual. Tutorial crashes sometimes.
<br>&gt;Lacking polish.
<br>&gt;Space combat while looking better, if you can get the camera to follow the ships, is completely hands off, so it is boring.
<br>&gt;Franchise has seen better days unfortunately.
<br>&gt;Gal Civ 3 vs Gal Civ 2, Feels much less polished, with much less to do, the stuff there is to do is repetitive and boring, not as satisfying. or complex as Gal Civ 2.
<br>&gt;Some penalties are way out of balance which ruin the game.
<br>&gt;AI plays essentially the same irregardless of which race.
<br>&gt;While the game ships with a custom race creator, and supports up toe 128 opponents which was trumpeted as a major features, creating a custom race is an involved process that takes a significant amount of time. (No random auto-custom race creator, exists only 8 are supplied with the game)
<br>
<br>Overall it feels like the game was simply rushed to ship and will get extensive patching. Where have we heard that before? If Gal Civ 3 follows the same development as Gal Civ 2 gamers will probably see loads of additional development leading up to another rushed out expansion which will be patched liberally as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5297559">Expand</a></span>

I cant bother to check it myself. there is nothing that gives any reason to play this game. everything is predetermined, linear and every choice you make does not matter.
<br>you can build star bases for various purposes. the only reason to build them will be gain of &quot;strategic&quot; resources (which are so useless) and influence space.
<br>you can build and design various ships which do not really differ one from the other. make fleets of this ships to gain strength. and you can use various 3D parts to assemble custom designed models for the ships. also design custom functional parts for the ships.
<br>you can colonize planets which extends you empire power. if you don&apos;t do it you will lose the game one way or another.
<br>you can manage distribution of empire resources over 3 axis (wealth, production, research) and production is further divided on 2 axis for ship and planet infrastructure.
<br>research tree is linear with 4 categories. some stages of the tree allow for a choice, 1 of 3, other 2 are lost.
<br>there is a 3 way ideology system that gives various bonuses. progresses really slow. you can progress in all 3 ideologies. a choice is made at every planet colonization.
<br>like I said above everything is pretty linear. you can have a bit different gameplay if you choose a different(or custom) race. but not much different really.
<br>well there are a few more gameplay elements but I say this again every one of this element is not making you think about it, take a hard decision or turn a different path.
<br>
<br>graphics. there are a few nice things about graphics, but they are not really in the game. you have to take a looking glass to see them(metaphor). but when you see them they are nice. through most of the game I was looking at symbolized 2D space map standing still in space. then there are more 2D images with more 2D images. some parts of the game are in 3D but like I said you really need to look for them to see them.
<br>
<br>sound. similar to the graphics sound is virtually non existent apart form the bad music which I turned off right away. sound effects in game are really basic and non appealing where they are present.
<br>
<br>artificial intelligence, if it can be called like that, seem to be ok. it seem capable to follow a simple linear game as galciv3.
<br>
<br>now to the technical part... game as of version 1.3 is full of bugs. my PC (Q9400, GTX480, 4GB RAM, Win8.1x64, HDD). game have only a few basic options to tweak it. on the default (which is custom?!) game stutters constantly, uses 10+GB page file, all my video RAM(1500MB), RAM is used almost all. CPU/GPU are not maxed out but high. Task switching takes about a minute(not entirely game fault, OS contributes). loading the game takes a lot of time. all that resource to look at a few 2D pixels. loading savegame takes even more time. although saving takes about a second, one thing done right!. primary problem is memory utilization. there is an enabled by default option in game that collects data. feels like the game is still in an early development phase.
<br>
<br>this is a third installment of the game which does not bring anything new. even dumbs down some parts.
<br>and the price is too high for this whole lot of nothing. my opinion... do not waste you time with this game. reading all of my review is more than enough. if you still think to give it a chance try before you buy. and if you like the game for some odd reason, have fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5325394">Expand</a></span>

<br>3. Economics are very simple and easly to maintain, which is a good thing, since the lacking statistical informations you get are making it hard rather the fun to make informed decitions.
<br>4. Research is rather dull. New technologies mostly offer numeric improvements and add nothing to the way you play the game. Detailed descriptions of things you research are mostly abscent and images of new things to build as well.
<br>5. What might be seen as an upside is the ship editor where you can design your own ships. However it was buggy in my game, discarding the beautiful design I made. And also most of the design is purely cosmetical and even though the ships look nice in close view, they really move very ungracefull during automated space combat.
<br>6. Planets, even though generated, all seem to look the same and require zero consideration in terms of indiviual build strategies. Also, they are filled up with buildings rather quickly, so that you can not place things you newly research, what further nullifies the effects of research.
<br>
<br>Because it at least has a campain, which is seldom for this kind of game and because it is an overall nice try, I&apos;m giving out generous 3 points.However, I do not get how this game ever ended up over 70 on metacritic.
<br>
<br>Better alternatives include: StarDrive 2, Endless Space and still sins of a solar empire. I&apos;d even recommend Distant Worlds and Planetary Annihilation over this. Or, if you haven&apos;t played it back in the days: Star Wars Empire at War.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5357327">Expand</a></span>

<br>The colony management, which is combination of tiles and adjacency bonuses, with population and happiness values is very well done. Also tech tree is exceptionally well made, of all the 4x games i ever played this one does it best. There is no tactical combat.

Sadly I don&apos;t find myself raising the score from its original 5 very much. There seems to be a great platform here to make an amazing game.... but that&apos;s all it is at the moment, a platform. Don&apos;t get me wrong there is plenty of attractive details.... but compared to Gal Civ II with expansions it feels like a downgrade other than graphically.... even graphically the only real obvious improvement is improved resolution on everything. AI, while improved quite a bit from Gal Civ II is still pretty dumb. Ship builder is great but with an occasional bug or two. Research is pretty cool, actually.... however on default research speed you&apos;ll get to the end of the tech tree before the end of a game on larger maps. Speaking of larger maps... the 3 largest map sizes are disabled unless you have enough ram... so if you only have 4GB of ram you won&apos;t be able to play those galaxy sizes. Diplomacy is okay.... however the AI begs and asks for money or threatens you on a constant basis. It gets quite annoying and makes diplomacy feel cheap and without diversity. Customization is pretty awesome in this game on almost every level.... however the celebrated race creator is actually a little too short and simple for my taste.... especially considering you are supposed to be able to customize the race&apos;s AI behavior but you don&apos;t really get that many choices to mix and match with. Honestly I find the fact that some of the reviewers found this feature &quot;too confusing and complicated&quot; quite laughable. The graphics are okay. Sound quality is decent. Auto-Explore/Survey AI is terrible.
<br>
<br>Ok ok so overall I feel that this game gets less and less fun after about turn 200 (default game speed). Too many things occur too frequently which ruin the immersion and it&apos;s almost like every feature in the game starts off with &quot;wow this is great&quot; and ends with &quot;oh, that&apos;s it?&quot;
<br>
<br>I give this game a 6 out of 10. Great potential, but it has a long way to go. But as a fan of the series and genre I am really rooting for this one to get to where it needs to be! I hope some day I can redo this review and raise the score :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5263307">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>My only major problem with the game is the Campaign. Seriously though, what campaign? I clicked campaign and saw three parts. I thought those three parts were the three sections of the story hyped in the trailer and such. Nope. 3 Small, easy scenarios that I&apos;ve already beaten on the second hardest difficulty with no problem.
<br>
<br>But GalCiv 3 one-ups it&apos;s predecessor in one key department: It has Multiplayer. And with the massive customizability of the games you play, you can really choose and pick how you want to play with your friends, more than virtually any other RTS, let alone games in general.
<br>
<br>Overall: this game could be a real gem, but it&apos;s not there yet. I can see it in the future getting a 9/10 rating from me, but it just doesn&apos;t quite cut it yet. If you don&apos;t have anyone else to play the multiplayer with, I would have to recommend Galactic Civilizations 2 for the time being, it&apos;s just a more polished, fleshed out game, even if it doesn&apos;t look as flashy.

I am a dedicated fan of strategy/space games (civilization, sins of a solar empire, Europa IV, etc.) , and I feel this game plain awful. This is the developer of beautiful , I just cannot believe it.
<br>
<br>--I can barely zoom in/out cos it takes 5~25(honestly) seconds when it switches between icons/real 3D models. It really can drive a man crazy. My computer runs well with all other similar games (homeland, SoaSE, civilization).
<br>--Have anyone notice the map scroll speed feels awkward? it moves much faster when zoomed in, and slow like hell when zoomed out. I never saw any other game use such design. Very inconvenient and it makes the game amateur.
<br>-The battle scenes not so good, ships rotate and turn slowly and strangely, audio and video out of sync many times(beams without sound and sound without missiles). It&apos;s like a awful children TV play of the 60s.
<br>--A custom faction is fun. But to be honest, not much for a gamer to design.
<br>--Customize your our ships? Man that&apos;s unique and awesome! But hey, don&apos;t forget you can barely zoom in to see your beautiful customized battleship. And hey, the battle scenes look dumb. Such a great feature wasted. Could be the only great part of the game.
<br>--AI, easy AI is rich but almost never build ships. Hard AI cheats but still dumb.
<br>--No strategies needed. no balance of economy, diplomacy, technology and military. It&apos;s like a ugly copycat of civilization. but still, they are there and you have to click on them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5284361">Expand</a></span>

<br>When I say epic scale the largest map size labelled &#x201C;insane&#x201D; has 500,000 map hexes and you can play against up to 100 AI opponents.
<br>
<br>They have taken Galactic Civilization 2 and enhanced all aspects of it, the ship designer that allows you to design your own ships by scaling, rotating and clipping together premade parts is awesome fun. You also add practical things like weapons, defences, drives, and special equipment.
<br>
<br>The game has 7 premade factions all of which have some of their own unique abilities, technologies and planetary improvements out of the box and allows you to create further custom ones.
<br>
<br>It also includes a campaign that follows on from the GC1 &amp; GC2 story lines though I have to confess I prefer to play in sandbox mode.
<br>
<br>The game still has a few bugs and rough edges here and there but StarDock have a well-deserved reputation for patching their games with not only fixes but features and improvements for years after release aside from already planned DLC and expansions so you can&#x2019;t really loose with this game.
<br>
<br>Unlike its predecessor this game also supports multiplayer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5245659">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>That being said... This is a really good game. It isn&apos;t light-years different visually or structurally than the previous game, but why fix what wasn&apos;t broken? The graphics got more polishing, the game-play expanded upon, the ship designer was drastically improved, and the AI was made a LOT better.
<br>
<br>The game can also handle a lot more. It&apos;s programmed in 64Bit. This means they won&apos;t have limitations like they had with the previous 32 bit game. The music is better, you can zoom all the way in and see your ships the way you designed them on the map, in their own fleets. The sounds are better.
<br>
<br>Galactic Civilizations 2 was amazing in my books, and this game is a worthy successor. I am not giving it a 10 because I don&apos;t yet know what kind of expansions they will have and what content it will bring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5250733">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First thing to notice is how hardware hungry that game is ... and continously becomes more hungry over time as the game session draws longer. Visually it is a step upwards with much greater visual detail and diversity (at the aforementioned price of draining the hardware and occasionally freezing for short to medium periods of time)
<br>
<br>Is it better than Gal Civ II? - yes... but it is not a quantum leap forward.
<br>
<br>- Planetary management is still not really a great challenge
<br>- Diplomacy and AI is a significant improvement (but i reckon that this is very subjective and also depends on the game session and situation that the AI can act in)
<br>- Ship design ... well... i don t like it. Shape and add ons again have no meaning but being purely cosmetical - all in all... i prefer Sword of the Stars in terms of customization
<br>- grand strategy is good - but has been well done in Gal Civ II already
<br>
<br>I was not able to conduct more testing because the game simply failed after some time - failed meaning.... zooming out and in caused seconds long freezes, turns took loooooong - and the game simply became a HUGE resource hog up to a point where playing it was no fun anymore.
<br>
<br>better optimized and expanded - this game has huge potential - its just no real fun in its current state ( on a mid end computer that is )</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5273901">Expand</a></span>

This game is not only excellent as it stands, but has an extremely attractive upgrade path mapped out, not just for the next few weeks or months, but for years, partly as a consequence of the decision to code it as a 64-bit exclusive.  Its predecessor, Galciv 2, was a very successful game, but GC3 is a big improvement in almost every way, in appearance, in game play, in customize ability, and in numerous new features that add to the strategy mix.   For a couple example, the separation of shipyards into a separate unit and the use of adjacency bonus to make colony building more interesting.  I am a 4x gamer who started out, and very happily so, with Civilization 1 and have been active in the genre since.  As such, I find GC3 to be not only a great addition to 4x gaming out of the gate, but a game that promises to increase enormously in quality and quantity over the next many months
<br>
<br>I must also add that as a relatively tiny company compared to the big software houses out there, Stardock has a stellar record of being responsive to the community without compromising their vision.

<br>
<br>As a 4x game in space hands down this is the best. Stardock is the master of this genre no one else even comes close. I also watch their streams and they have &quot;road map&quot; of what they want to do and update with this game for years to come. My only criticism is I wish it was delayed to get more content and some bug fixes finished before launch. But if you want the only and the best 4x game in space out there this is it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5291496">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes, the ship editor has been expanded, but snap points are a little flaky and it can be frustrating to use.

<br>
<br>The cinematic of battle mode make me have a &quot;Nerd-gasm&quot; every.single.time. Its fabulous and it has come a long way from its initial stages.
<br>
<br>The strategy itself is direct and time consuming. Something more 4x games need today. To wake up in the morning with your coffee and slug away on your immense universe. Struggling to keep your economy going in the midst of a global depression.
<br>
<br>The AI are SMART and **** Ive died multiple times from there cunning attacks and alliances against little old me. For anyone saying the AI is not well done. Take a step back and please, Please go look at other AI dependent games. You will see the beauty of Gal Civ 3.
<br>
<br>All in all? I love this game. I would recommend it to ANY of my friends. 4x fans or not.
<br>
<br>This is the strategy game of the year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5247223">Expand</a></span>

Of course there are some technical issues still, unfortunately I don&apos;t expect the games of today to come out as 100% finished product. But these are minor things like loading saved game for 1-2 mins on high end rig.

<br>GC3 vanilla is coming with unique race tech tree&apos;s, custom races, exotic planets, animated ship components and map sizes that are six times bigger than GC2&apos;s biggest - the only notable things left out are Terror stars and espionage. When you think that Stardock has announced intentions to push at least two expansion&apos;s - possibly three - as well as various DLC packages just think about where this game might go!

You buy one of their desktop tarting suites and the license only lasts a year and then you have to buy it all over again...pretty crap service if you ask me. What can I say about Galactic Civilizations 3? Well, maybe, just a very slim outside chance, you might probably maybe prefer playing Serious Sam 3...head over to Steam and treat yourself!</span>

There is no experience gain for the ships, no governors or ship captains either. There is no rpg element in game. you feel forced to choose only 1 ideology during game due to increasing benefits, so mini RPG choices given to you is usually automatic one of 1,2,or 3 choice all the time without looking at what it is.  No control in war other than rock-paper-scissor dynamic.

<br>Another pros:
<br>+ good oprimization game works fine on i5 + intel hd4600 (it crushes sometimes but this is not that big issue just set autosave every2 turns)
<br>+great space climate
<br>Cons:
<br>-Game still needs polish eg: science officer looks similar in most races
<br>-Sometimes crushes
<br>-Only 8 major factions
<br>-you need at least 8GB ram  (especially when you use intel HD grapphics),</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5252816">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game plays best on a rig at least 2 years old or younger and 6+ gigs of ram. I have not had any crashes or stuttering since release and many of my friends report the same. Make sure you have a 64 bit OS.
<br>The ai is great and only continues to get better. Stardock has an excellent reputation for updating their games and they have done so with Gal Civ III. Simply put the Ai in this game is perhaps the best Ai ever released in a 4x game (to date).  It will threaten you, it will attack you, it will use diplomacy to get you to fight its wars. Fun stuff!
<br>The view of the ships and the galaxy are stunning. Graphically at first you recognize Gal Civ II then while playing you realize ...&quot;This is a beautiful game&quot;

I found GC2 to be deep, but the interface was sort of clumsy and the maps weren&apos;t as big as I would have liked.  This is, after all, outer space!  But GC3 scraps the old interface in favor of one that is far more streamlined and easy to figure out.  It didn&apos;t take me long to jump right into the game and get going with confidence that I knew what I was doing.
<br>
<br>But just because the game is more straight forward doesn&apos;t mean that it has lost a lot of depth.  Sure, some things may be missing, but I wouldn&apos;t know what they were because I gave up playing GC2 because of it&apos;s complexity.  GC3 doesn&apos;t suffer from that problem and it&apos;s really a joy to play!
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t say I understand the research process completely, that will take some studying, but the trees are deep.
<br>
<br>Also, ship customization and race customization are both there in full force!  But you aren&apos;t forced to do any of that if you don&apos;t want to.
<br>
<br>Overall, I think they did a great job on this game, and after a few hours a playing, I can&apos;t put the thing down!   That&apos;s always a sign of a solid 4x game.  Enjoy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5307876">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Highlights:
<br>* Customization - ships, races, planets - the level of customization drew me more into the stories I was creating in sandbox mode. Decent mod support will really help this shine once the community gets going. The
<br>* Good support  - There&apos;s already been a couple of patches fixing some basic problems.
<br>* Performance - I know this has varied for a handful of people, but on a moderate rig and quite large maps, I don&apos;t get stutter, and the AI turns process incredibly quickly. None of the late-game lag waiting for the computer that you get with Civ/AoW/EL.
<br>
<br>It loses a point for a few (fixable) things:
<br>* The battle viewer is a bit janky. One patch fixed the camera issues, but the movement of the ships (mostly spinning in a narrow area) is strange.
<br>* Some missing systems like espionage as compared to GalCiv2, or most other 4x games. I&apos;ve heard a rumor this will be added in a patch/expansion/DLC, but it remains to be seen what that&apos;ll cost, and if there&apos;s enough content to justify it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5293767">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve had some good times with the game but mostly it&apos;s been either a game that was so trivial to beat the AI (early patches), or maddening ones (patch 2.0).....all while playing normal difficulty. I&apos;m glad the devs are constantly improving and evolving the game but I think it has a critical flaw in that it has simply too broad of a surface area on ways to play it, which can easily run the casual gamer into the ground...repeatedly. Ultimately it comes down to a &quot;secret sauce&quot; formula, as seen on countless fan sites, where you are going to lose unless you get a certain minimum amount of objectives done in the first 20 to 100 turns or else you&apos;re destined to lose.  In other words, the whole game is made in the first series of turns....and the rest is simply a process of going through the motions.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve played Civ1 through 5, GalCiv2, Elemental, FE, etc.....and damn do I REALLY want to love galciv3 but it&apos;s just too screwy of a game that seems to be angling more for hardcore players. I think the game needs to be focused a bit more starting with the overwhelming state of the research tree.  Yep, i&apos;m sure that&apos;s controversial but it&apos;s WAY too broad.  As a player I get sick of clicking through 4 trees (sorry but it needs to be 3) and having 12+ different choices that only (for the most part) very incrementally change the game.  Research alone forces a player to micromanage, when that&apos;s a turn off for a LOT of people.
<br>
<br>I could talk forever and give example after example but it&apos;s just not worth my time.  GalCiv4 will need to start from scratch if it wants to win me and others back.  By and large it was too similar to GC2 to start with....but made worse by minutia and formulaic measures in order to win.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=6983429">Expand</a></span>

<br>The worst part is the dumb pacifist AI. I was playing me and myself. No wonder the AI gets huge bonuses on higher difficulty. I tried a game on tough. Within 25 turns I managed to colonize 3 planets and 3 colony ship where on route, when through out diplomacy I made a peak in the 1st contacted AI. He got 5 colonies plus 15+ colonyships and more than 5000 credits (this feat I could not achieve with 10-20% bonuses). Some turns afterwards I contacted the 2nd one, and looking at powers I had 40, 1st AI 90, and the 2nd 190. Ok so I quit and tried another on challenging with Huge galaxy(which is in teh middle) and everybody. I discovered more than half the technologies and no AI has any decent army. I&apos;m fighting more than 70+ turns only constructors. Because oh god they build plenty of that. But even looking how they develop planets its omg. I think a 8year old would manage much better.
<br>Beside that there is no good macro controls. Ships list is one mess, fleet list doesn&apos;t even exist. Planets development are tedious, as I sad the AI does a really poor job.
<br>I will shelve this one and wait for the expansion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5281894">Expand</a></span>

While the game has massive potential, there are too many issues with the game at present:
<br>
<br>There&apos;s a lot of micromanagement of planets. You need to adjust the slider for research, social manufacturing and income. Then there&apos;s a separate slider for social and military manufacturing, because buildings and military units have separate production queues. You&apos;re going to need to adjust the sliders for each planet constantly to make production and research more efficient for each building, military unit and research technology. Production times are quite low, and you&apos;re going to have a lot of planets, so a good portion of each turn is spent on this.
<br>
<br>Galactic Civ 3 has limited documentation in game which doesn&apos;t provide much information about how the mechanics work. The tutorial only touches on the most basic concepts. You&apos;re going to spend a lot of time alt-tabbing to look up game concepts in your browser. The documentation in game that does exist describes your research technologies and ideology options. However, while the game mechanics have been updated in patches, the text in game often isn&apos;t updated to match the changes. Many of the tool tips describing research technology don&apos;t fully match the actual gameplay effects.
<br>
<br>Diplomacy is pretty broken at present. Some research technologies give you an option of specialization. You can only pick one choice per technology. Some of the choices are seriously unbalanced. For example, you might have a choice between 10% extra research or a 10% reduction in the maintenance of research labs. Research labs only cost about 1credit per turn to maintain, so the maintenance reduction is a negligible bonus. Since you&apos;re stuck with your choice for the rest of the game, it&apos;s a clear choice in favor of the research increase. But here&apos;s the kicker, if another civilization likes you they will occasionally give you techs. Like what happened to me, when they gave me the 10% maintenance reduction specialization. There is no way to decline the &quot;gift&quot; so I was stuck with this and 10% less research for the rest of the game. There is also an issue with tech trading where civilizations can trade tech when they don&#x2019;t have the prerequisite for it. Imagine having a game of Civilization where you can give another civilization &#x201C;flight&#x201D; when they haven&#x2019;t discovered &#x201C;the wheel&#x201D;. Apart from the obvious lack of realism, it makes tech trading unnecessarily confusing due to the sheer number of techs that show up to trade. You shouldn&apos;t be able to give a civilization a tech unless they have the prerequisite first. Because of these flaws with diplomacy, you&apos;re better off disabling diplomacy options like tech trading, random events and the &#x201C;United Planets&#x201D; when you setup your game.
<br>
<br>There is a lot of use &quot;good and &quot;evil&quot; concepts. For example, your ideology stretches the range from &quot;benevolent&quot; to &quot;malevolent&quot;. Basically, you decide whether your civilization is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;. Several of the alien races are &quot;evil&quot; while others are &quot;good&quot;. Malevolent civilizations don&apos;t hide the fact they are &quot;evil&quot; and seem proud of it. It&#x2019;s not a gameplay issue, but I feel the story deserved a bit more depth than simply painting various alien races as good guys or bad guys. It&#x2019;s like something off Fox News or CNN.
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;d say this is an OK game, but Endless Legend, Civilization 4 &amp; 5 are better. I can only recommend it if you&apos;re already bored of these other 4X games. If you&apos;ve played all the good 4X games and have time on your hands then it&#x2019;s worth a look. Its lack of polish means it&#x2019;s not worth its $50 price tag. The developers do update this game so it will improve over time, and the game definitely has huge potential. Give it another 6 months of patching or try to pick it up on sale for $30 or less.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5535190">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>For this reason when you look at reviews of GalCiv III, always look for recent reviews. Reviews from 6 months ago will not represent the game well.
<br>
<br>When the game was just released I did not like it very much. It still felt like a beta. I came back to it periodically to find it substantially improved each time.  They have now just released patch 1.4 and I started a new game.  For the first time I think I can say I am truly enjoying the game.
<br>
<br>For me the game is stable, never crashes and does not glitch. Some users commented they had problems. On my  intel i5 + windows 7 64bit machine it works great.
<br>
<br>At this point the AI has had a major overhaul and puts up a nice challenge.  This was the main thing that prevented me from enjoying the game in my previous attempts.  The two main areas that still need to be worked on are diplomacy and invasion mechanics. Stardock is scheduled to address these areas in upcoming patches.  I give it 8/10 because it is already a good 4X. Should get even better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/galactic-civilizations-iii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5647997">Expand</a></span>
