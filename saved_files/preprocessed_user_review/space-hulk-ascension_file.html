<br>
<br>Pros...Decent graphics, well thought out controls with options of how to fire, a nice RPG element addition to the game, good thinking man&apos;s game. A very polished performance.
<br>
<br>Cons...Controlling the terminators is a little tricky at first, would like a little more speech from the terminators other than a few basic phrases but I am being super picky there.
<br>
<br>My review is this game on Steam is great value for money and well worth the money as it is fun and entertaining.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk-ascension/user-reviews?user_review_id=4915137">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>My only hesitation in recommending this game is being slightly uncertain about the desired audience. For SH purists, the changes to gameplay may feel unnecessary... perhaps even sacrilegious. On the other hand, for gamers unfamiliar with the genre, the brutality and difficulty of the game may be a turnoff. Ascension probably has something meaningful to offer both groups &#x2014; it may just involve players checking their expectations at the door.
<br>
<br>*relatively modern = both mechanically, and visually &#x2014; although this is unmistakably an indie production. IT plays well and looks good... not AAA good, but good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk-ascension/user-reviews?user_review_id=4682068">Expand</a></span>

Space Hulk Ascension costs as much as XCOM: Enemy Within, but XCOM offers an immersive and expansive turn-based strategy game that thrills at every stage of the game. Space Hulk is a glorified board game, that is literally and figuratively 2-dimensional. The backstory and graphics are great, but the game falls flat, sticking to the old narrow hallways and single floor. We&apos;re told that we&apos;re stalking the halls of ancient space ships filled with dangerous aliens and mystical artifacts, but every map looks exactly the same and there are still just a few basic mechanics and interactions. Where XCOM provides a wide array of weapons, base building, team building, and strategic choices, Space Hulk gives you lack-luster choices of close combat weapons that are essentially all the same, and slightly different firing modes for your guns. I would&apos;ve liked more distinction between the classes, more varied weapons options (even if they departed from the table top equivalent). And while using action points to turn and back up might be important to the game, they&apos;re ultimately unexciting pieces of gameplay as the game devolves into a $40 game of tower defense. It also is poorly optimized, slowing my 2014 desktop even on moderate graphical settings, despite the unremarkable graphical demands of the game (2/3rd of the screen is blank!)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk-ascension/user-reviews?user_review_id=4836923">Expand</a></span>

I haven&apos;t played the tabletop game, but I am familiar with WH40K rules, and I didn&apos;t play the 2013 release.
<br>
<br>Graphics and atmospheric sound is well put together.  The game is quite dark but a little tweak on the gamma settings made it manageable.  The strength of having an isometric grid map that a map designer can quickly build many scenarios for, really stands out.  Comparing the level of tactics required to navigate a map in this game compared to XCom2012 is not even funny.
<br>
<br>The movement controls in the GUI is a little funny at first but also extremely powerful, in terms of being able to back-up, side-step, etc. Being that last terminator desperately backing towards the exit point while a horde of genestealers advances down on him really beings back the sort of desperation of the Microprose XCom that&apos;s lacking in the newer version. I do  think a more click position and drag for facing approach would have been better but c&apos;est la vie.
<br>
<br>Personally I like the mechanics but I do feel that melee needs some work (a criticism I would also level at the WH40K system).  Reducing life or death to a single die roll is a little annoying.  How about some attack/defense options other than just &apos;attack or do nothing&apos;?  Riposte, parry, etc.  in case you have someone coming to the rescue, full-out attack for that broodlord, etc.
<br>
<br>Overall I&apos;d say it&apos;s a pretty solid entry and reasonable for US$27 (but in euros not so much, but that&apos;s another story).  I hope the developers continue with the WH40K universe and bring us a more general squad-based game in the vein of the old Chaos Gate system. The engine with more unit types and more wargear could be very promising.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk-ascension/user-reviews?user_review_id=4715433">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t get me wrong, I really liked the original, but this version feels more like the house rules we all came up with to spice up the original board game.
<br>
<br>While there are some aspects of the game that remain, the missions have changed just enough to be a tactical challenge again.  Many who have played the board game already had tried and true tactics to most effectively deal with each scenario.  Throwing the whole thing in darkness and revealing the map only as your Terminators explore it makes for some tough on the spot decisions.  It&apos;s still turn based, but if you have played before, you will find yourself falling into old habits, only to end up at a dead end or corridor where you didn&apos;t expect.
<br>
<br>The downside is that you still don&apos;t have a &quot;create your own mission&quot; tools, nor are you out of the DLC woods.  Much like every one of the other Warhammer world games, you will have to buy DLCs to get new content.  While I&apos;ve come to terms about this, I&apos;m still not enthused about it.  In reality a $30 game is a $46 or more game when all the DLCs are released.  To me it smacks of dishonesty.  While some may look at it as having the game your way.  Like making a pizza.  You only pay for the toppings you want.
<br>
<br>All-in-all a fun romp.  Now that I&apos;ve written this, I&apos;m going to go back and knock out some missions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk-ascension/user-reviews?user_review_id=5052021">Expand</a></span>

Also recommended for people, who don&apos;t know anything about WH40k, but are interested in sci-fi&apos;s like Aliens (second move with Marines fighting off hordes of aliens), or anything of the sort.
<br>
<br>Leading squads of elite inter-galactic marines, with the finest weapons and armor armor in the galaxy, and hunting down hordes of the most deadly biological predators, is incredibly satisfying to watch. This is a dark, tense, and unforgiving game, and I love it for that.
<br>
<br>+ Each chapter feels pretty unique in look and gameplay, and it&apos;s worth replaying a campaign with another Marine Chapter.
<br>+ Campaigns are lengthy and offer a variety of challenging scenarios to overcome.
<br>+ Lots of tactical depth with the squad customization of skills, gear, and weapon combos, which allows you to build up your squads how you want.
<br>+ Armor and Decorative customization is a nice addition.
<br>+ AI is solid and challenging to face.
<br>+ Sound and FX are perfect - the dark, horrific atmosphere is enhanced by stellar ambient sounds. Comparably awesome to the well done Dawn of War series in this respect.
<br>+ Extremely satisfying death animations and weapon effects.
<br>
<br>I love a good soundtrack, and this game doesn&apos;t offer much in that regard, as music is used sparringly (what - which in this game&apos;s case, is not a bad thing - as the mood of the game is set not by instruments, but by the atmospheric sounds of the Space Hulks; the screams of vicious biological terrors; and the blasts of bolters shredding apart bodies and the clanging against metal - which is perfect for a horror setting.
<br>
<br>It is worth supporting this developer, as they treat the Warhammer 40k IP with great respect, and there&apos;s a lot of potential for bigger better WH40k games in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk-ascension/user-reviews?user_review_id=5069606">Expand</a></span>

The atmosphere of the game really puts you into the game (if you&apos;ve ever read any of the series), the sound is great, you really feel a loss when a squad member gets taken down and want vengeance! I have a couple bugs with buttons not appearing and bodies not &apos;dieing&apos; but nothing game breaking that can&apos;t be fixed in coming patches. The DLCs available for the game add almost a games worth of missions and each includes a new faction to play with. Noted: you can play each faction across each campaign. This gives the game great replay ability. Gear and skill upgrades (if your Space Marine lives long enough) that are great! So get out there and carry for the Emperor&apos;s will!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk-ascension/user-reviews?user_review_id=6808916">Expand</a></span>

<br>Notes :
<br>Dark environnement with death at nearly each corner. Lots of weapon at your disposal to eradicate the infestation or just increase your life time. Flash missions to find relic weapons. And a lot of chapters to try different gameplays, from longe range to close combat passing by plasma, flames, rocket and turret. Form your squad, choose your weapons and skills, then survive!

<br>Comment about DLC :
<br>Imperial Fist =&gt; my favorite chapter, with the best close combat survivability (A must have).
<br>Salamanders =&gt; campain very laggy with low fps .
<br>Dark Angel =&gt; very complex and challenging mission (A must have).
<br>Chapters DLC =&gt; only armour colour changes (mainly useless).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-hulk-ascension/user-reviews?user_review_id=7372414">Expand</a></span>
