It sets up story threads that can evolve. However that&apos;s all anything is in this game amounts to, suggestions at a better game. The moment you step back, and take the game at what it is, a mindless shooter - the more you will get out of it - at least in singleplayer. Furthermore, if that&apos;s what you want out of this experience. You found deus ex slow and ponderous, and you are more of an action junkie. Then this game&apos;s singleplayer, is solid enough. It has inventive mechanics and satisfying gameplay. Unfortunately that gameplay never really evolves. It introduces &apos;breaching&apos; however it never really expands on that concept. It just gives you waves of enemies that require the same useage of an inventive core mechanic. That&apos;s the main gameplay separator between this game and say, half life 2, deus ex, bioshock, or other beloved first person games. Those games constantly change things up, either by providing a toolset, or changing the environmental useage of an inventive ability (half life 2 gravity gun, options and tools in deus ex and bioshock). And that&apos;s a shame, because based on the first few levels of co-op. it seems like those scenarios are better designed and require significantly more management and thought. (Although still not remotely on the same level as other games). Co-op is a far deeper, and better experience for someone like me who prefers first-person-thinkers. And that&apos;s the conflict right there. I could reccomend this game to action junkies who don&apos;t want to think, however that is simply the singleplayer portion of the game. The other 50% of the money you are paying is a co-op mode that requires a different thought process. So in the end, both first person thinker players, and action junkie players only get half a game. And a not-fantastic half a game for either side. I have made the game sound terrible, yet - it actually holds a lot of promise. It keeps flirting with the idea of it being deeper than it is - and you can see it reaching out... However a valiant failure is not a 10/10 game nomatter what angle you come in from.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2149524">Expand</a></span>

Top notch graphics, very good voice and motion capture. Although it is another generic shooter at its core, it has some nifty quality details that will make you keep smiling and say &quot;cute!&quot;, and that sets it apart from the rest: the sci-fi setting, the atmosphere, the alternate firing modes, some seriously kickass weapons, lots and lots of Codex-like info pages, the breach system, skills you unlock across the game; it all works very well, and it brings a frantic and fun gunplay that allows for a variety of ways to solve the situations the game throws at you. The UI feels &quot;realistic&quot; while remaining useful for the most part, the weapons feel meaty and useful, the enemies will usually put up a fight (if the AI gets around to it), and once you get used to the controls, they are actually pretty responsive, with the exception of maybe the slides, which are kinda spotty. On the downside though, it feels like a straight Xbox port, with a very narrow FOV that together with the flashes and postprocessing effects made me feel a bit unconfortable a couple of times. You can breeze through the game on Hard without dying too many times, the plot is neither very clear nor really interesting, and the player never does any choice, so the game more of takes you by the hand across a variety of rooms and tells you &quot;alright, now kill these guys. Now these ones. Now these.&quot; until you reach the end.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s also the cheese value of this game, which cannot go unnoticed. Everything will be labeled, from &quot;hobo&quot; to &quot;bench&quot;, which I found kinda funny as it seems like the protagonist has severe memory issues. There will be nonsensical cutscenes presenting enemies on a circle and a camera panning around &quot;hacking&quot; indows on the side, and most of the chip extracting scenes are so over the top violent that you can&apos;t help but to chuckle a bit.
<br>
<br>All in all I say this is a good game if you get it for about ~10-15&#x20AC;. It&apos;s fun for kiling an afternoon or two with, I&apos;ve heard very good things about the coop missions (haven&apos;t tried them myself) and the gameplay is nice enough to at least make me consider a second playthrough in a future. And although it doesn&apos;t really fit in the &apos;Syndicate&apos; series of games, as a standalone FPS I say it&apos;s a good choice if you wanna pewpew some baddies but you&apos;re tired of military, CoD-like games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=3971329">Expand</a></span>

<br>Das Spiel gibt einem sch&#xF6;ne Schlauchlevel, eine 6/10 Story mit 4/10 Hauptcharakteren, viele Gegner, viele Waffen, viel Geballer und damit, was man von einem Shooter erwartet.
<br>
<br>Die Waffen im Spiel machen zum gr&#xF6;&#xDF;ten Teil Sinn, allerdings gibt es einige Waffen, die zu schwach, zu stark oder schlicht dasselbe sind, wie andere Waffen. Da h&#xE4;tte man einiges streichen k&#xF6;nnen oder besser anpassen sollen.
<br>
<br>Die Steuerung des Charakters ist Standard und hat sich leider nicht sonderlich weiterentwickelt: Kaum gel&#xE4;ndeg&#xE4;ngig, was im urbanen Szenario aber kaum weiter auff&#xE4;llt. &#xDC;ber kleine Hindernisse wird gesprungen, ge&#xF6;ffnet oder geklettert werden kann nur da, wo es vorgesehen ist.
<br>
<br>Da man sich nicht um Nebenelemente in der Spielwelt geschweige denn Handlungsfreiheit bem&#xFC;ht hat ist die Spielwelt zwar nett anzusehen aber klinisch tot. Der Shooter ist damit relativ schnell durchgespielt und dank absolut linearer Handlung sowie fester Skriptsequenzen ohne gro&#xDF;en Wiederspielwert. Wer Abwechslung sucht kann maximal einen anderen Schwierigkeitsgrad ausw&#xE4;hlen oder Chipaufwertungen unterlassen / anders setzen.
<br>
<br>Syndicate macht trotzdem Spa&#xDF;, solange man sich noch an der imposanten Spielwelt sattsehen kann, Interesse an dem Zukunftsszenario hat, welches das Spiel darstellt, gern mit den Waffen im Spiel hantiert gegen die Gegner im Spiel oder die Herausforderungen mag, vor die einen das Spiel bei den Bossgegnern stellt.
<br>
<br>Ich pers&#xF6;nlich w&#xFC;rde Syndicate als eigenst&#xE4;ndigen Titel ohne Beachtung der originalen Syndicate Serie eine 7/10 geben, weil es im Gro&#xDF;en und Ganzen bugfrei ist, Shooter verspricht und Shooter liefert, die Spielwelt wirklich gut aussieht und die K&#xE4;mpfe gr&#xF6;&#xDF;tenteils funktionieren.
<br>
<br>Meine gr&#xF6;&#xDF;ten Kritikpunkte am Spiel sind die Art der Gegnergenerierung[1] und die Regenerationsmechanik[2], die einfach nicht zu Syndicate passt.
<br>
<br>[1] Die Art, wie Gegner in die Spielwelt gebracht werden wirkt arg gek&#xFC;nstelt: Sobald man einen Punkt &#xFC;berschreitet oder ein Objekt bedient &#xF6;ffnen sich irgendwelche T&#xFC;ren, aus denen Gegner str&#xF6;men, teils Welle um Welle statt einmal alle zusammen. F&#xFC;r die Gegner &#xF6;ffnen sich dazu mit einem Mal irgendwelche R&#xE4;ume, T&#xFC;ren etc., die vorher verschlossen waren und es nachher teilweise auch wieder sind. Statt sich also den Weg freizuballern l&#xE4;uft man irgendwo lang, wo irgendwo um einen herum irgendwelche T&#xFC;ren aufgehen und Gegner rauskommen. Nachher sind diese T&#xFC;ren und R&#xE4;ume entweder wieder verschlossen oder vollkommen leer.
<br>
<br>[2] Die Regnerationsmechanik ist aus Call of Duty: In Deckung warten, bis die Regeneration startet, die relativ schnell 100% der Gesundheit wiederherstellt. F&#xFC;r Syndicate ist das aber unpassend, da man meist solo gegen mehrere Gegner antritt, die einen zu umzingeln versuchen, teils Granaten werfen und abgesehen davon gibt es im Spiel Flugdrohnen und gelenkte Projektile. Da passt so eine Regenerationsmechanik Marke &apos;In-der-Ecke-hocken&apos; einfach nicht.
<br>
<br>Beim Original &quot;Syndicate&quot; h&#xE4;tte sich EA aber nicht bedienen m&#xFC;ssen f&#xFC;r dieses Spiel, denn bis auf einige Begriffe oder Namen aus dem Original hat das Spiel so ziemlich gar nichts mit ihm zu tun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=4005100">Expand</a></span>

The combat powers are mostly useless except for DART overlay (time dilation and enemy highlighting). The ability to raise and lower covers in some areas are somewhat interesting but rarely used and in itself not enough to get excited about. Levels are the linear, repetitive stuff we have come to expect these days: enter room, kill five waves of enemies, repeat ten times with some seemingly pointless transport zones in between. During the single player campaign you pick up character profiles and data fragments. I assume they give more background to the story and characters, I do not know because I did never feel motivated to read them. As far as I can tell it had zero impact on the gameplay. The monochromatic visuals and monotone music theme seems strangely appropriate for the game. As others have pointed out, this is a console port. Having to press &quot;F&quot; repeatedly to open doors is extremely annoying. This effect reeks of console port and only makes sense in certain very dramatic scenes, not every time you open a bloody door! All in all, no aspect is a complete failure, the game is somewhat playable but not worth spending hard earned money on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2437068">Expand</a></span>

The game is basically a generic shooter with bad AI. and boring fights. I wish they would not use the &quot;Syndicate&quot; name because the original isometric game was great and revolutionary, not like this one.</span>

The story maybe isn&apos;t that horrible, but it&apos;s so terribly told, you just don&apos;t care about anything, be it the main silent protagonist, the world or the characters. The same, by the way, happened in Crysis 2, who had the same writer (Richard Morgan&apos;s style, I take it?).  The level design is as generic as it can be (corridors, hallways and again corridors), missions are utterly boring and completely uninspired(kill that, take that, retrieve that and etc). The so called three &quot;Dart Powers&quot; are fun to use in the beginning, but after two-three hours the novelty wears off. They are not anything special either- just &quot;Knock down, blow up or befriend  the enemy SWAT soldier&quot;.  Even the shooting parts aren&apos;t the best-enemies take half the clip to be killed,  AI, while trying it&apos;s best, just  doesn&apos;t  offer much of a real challenge, even guns scream generic.The graphics, like everything else, are average at best: low details, bad textures and the infamous bloom  coupled with great effects here and there. The sound,on the other hand, is a positive side : weapons sound OK most of the time, the voice acting is hammy sometimes (who voiced Merit?!), but nothing really bad and music fits the game&apos;s stupid, soulless shootouts pretty well.The co-op is all right, but nothing really special. The only real bright spot is probably &quot;InfoBank&quot;,  an in-game codex, which contains huge amount  of interesting (and unfortunately, completely  useless) data. In all, it&apos;s so sad to think, that such an interesting universe, with so much potential, is wasted on a generic shooter. With that kind of setting even a twelve-year old can write a better story and characters. I was expecting so much more from the creators of Escape from Butcher Bay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2336567">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s essentially a shoot&apos;em up, with an upgrade system and some beautifully crafted environments and cinematic set-pieces.  To address the major discrepancy in all these reviews.  These same people gave 10&apos;s to Deus EX: Human Revolution!  HR is alright, but the engine is inferior, the combat is no where near as streamlined, the story is mangled nonsense, and the icing on the cake: NONE of the choices you make in HR really effect anything!  Isn&apos;t that why people are railing against ME3&apos;s ending?  I don&apos;t get why HR gets handled with kiddy gloves and deserves GOTY status..end rant.  Essentially, Syndicate strips away all the broken and pointless mechanics of HR and makes for a more cohesive game.  Is it a GOTY game?  No.  Is it awesome? Yes.  Is it worth 60 bucks?  No, but definitely a must rent, or discount purchase once the price drops.
<br>
<br>Pro&apos;s: Solid gameplay, fun ride, absolutely beautiful, fairly optimized for pc (I get 40-70 fps everything maxed with a 5770, Athlon Kuma 7750, 4 gb DDR2).  Pretty modest to low rig.
<br>
<br>Con&apos;s: Overly &apos;bloomy&apos; renderer detracts from the beautiful environments at times depending on the light sources.  Very short campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2278007">Expand</a></span>

Search for it people COME ON please!<br>Now - onto things proper.<br>I read that the gameplay is great, the guns feel amazing to shoot, the enemies are engaging, the graphics are good, the sound is thumping - and then &quot;but it&apos;s not worth getting&quot;. And I hate that this is the tone of a lot of reviews. I loved the original game, and this is a completely different game, so that comparison stops there. I bought it when it came out because Starbreeze make very visceral, over bloomed, over thumping combat - I knew what I was getting. They make a game where dark is black and light is blinding. I love this style. Since we got it me and mates have played it non stop as our go-to co-operative multiplayer. In the Co-op part of the game, the RPG development elements, the relatively minimal signin nonsense, the solid feeling presentation and mechanics add another dimension to an already solid gameplay experience.  You play this game for the feel of the guns, the feeling of managing a firefight, keeping your mates alive, ripping the armoured enemies, unleashing viruses. And MINIGUN - oh yes - MINIGUN..  Having the spoils to take home and invest in your weapon upgrades - that&apos;s just the icing.  Although after a month or so of play you&apos;ll have most things fully upgraded, it&apos;s fun doing it.  We found that there&apos;s a lot of replay potential too as the enemies seem to come in different patterns and spawns each time we play.  They are smart too - and the close quarters stuff is nice, with them jinking and ducking out of fire, blind firing when the are suppressed, throwing grenades and storming locations.<br>I enjoyed the single player too, but not without reservation. This game has some Deus Ex feel because the &quot;world&quot; it inhabits is Syndicate. My friend described it as &quot;Deus Ex&quot; - without all the rubbish - and in a way it is. It&apos;s a set piece shooter with no pretense.  The acting is pretty good in the single player, the Eurocorp CEO in particular, and certainly the extra flavour of the single player makes a nice bonus to the co-op, but is &quot;good not great&quot; overall without the co-op taken into account (co-op can be played on your own - no bots tho).  Only thing that annoys me is the low likelihood now that there&apos;ll be extra missions after the community response.  While currently there are something like 10-15 missions (You travel to different countries -a la the first syndicate - and do reimaged missions from the first one in coop multiplayer game) How cool would it have been (via updates/dlc) if every country got to have a mission?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2289255">Expand</a></span>

Oh, and &quot;upgrades&quot; and &quot;DART overlay&quot; are absolutely useless, you don&apos;t need them at all. Actually, this game had a great potential, but it was wasted. If they&apos;d spend another year or so, it would be a good game probably.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2157351">Expand</a></span>

Weirdly annoying placed throughout the game handles and doors that open fast clicking at the button, well, why do they need? All the bosses made disgusting, besides the first with whom have war under a great track Skrillex. There are some minor bugs, but this is garbage. But what is good in the game? The coolest thing in this game - it shooter! Weapons feel very well, as a model of the weapon made just perfect. The interface is very original, especially like hologram illumination rounds in the cage. Interesting upgrade hero, which really start thinking about what to choose. Cool intelligence of the enemies, who never miss an opportunity send you to hell. Maybe I missed something else, but can&apos;t all remember! I will say one thing, long ago came out the game The Chronicles of Riddick, so everything was done so abruptly that I was pissed with boiling water from all parts of the game, and the Syndicate - it&apos;s just earning money on amateur of shooters, unfortunately!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2158303">Expand</a></span>

The story is about an security agent with bio-tech augmentations that will do everything to protect his company, kinda like Deus-Ex - But not. Shooting system is pretty good - you can slide and shoot at the same time (Just love this!) have Human/Machine-Mind-Hacking that you use against you enemies. Co-Op system is one of the Pros of this game and you can spend a decent time with a friend. Overall, the game is decent but definitely not a Must-Have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2222433">Expand</a></span>

Complete lack of originality aside, Syndicate does make for a good solid shooter experience if you turn off all the handicaps that was brought over fro- Yep, you guessed it. It&apos;s a console port. And one made by EA which can be seen by the most worst structured maps I&apos;ve ever seen. It&apos;s confusing, unappealing with all the excessive bloom/hue and linear which is clearly something that only EA could pull off. It&apos;s mediocre and I would normally recommend to give it a try but considering the publisher, I&apos;d say stay the hell away from this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2570945">Expand</a></span>

<br>Syndicate, what can I say about this game, or rather what it looks like? Deus Ex. this is obvious, cyberpunk, implants, corporations, the future, even such a small element of the RPG as pumping. However, it is still easy postrelkushka ... am feeling a parody, the battles are not dynamic, the game is short, simple story, the ending of anything. This is not a very interesting game, and I&apos;ll tell you simply, if you have not met the new products, you can while away the evening with a syndicate, but it is a game which is to bypass the majority, I was suddenly fell Syndicate and I did not expect. And did not get anything interesting, this game only gets 6 points, but rather 5.5 Frome Russia with love</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2174187">Expand</a></span>

A gun lover&apos;s paradise packed with ludicrously sexy, fun weapons and great firefights. The interaction with cover adds to the immersion during these firefights! You have to use your brain a bit more in this game because enemies WILL try to flank you at every turn, but you have upgrades you can get in a fun system that is similiar to the classic talent tree to level the playing field along with the DART Overlay (which is like bullet time and allows you to see through cover). Now, for the flaws: Hacking (&quot;Breaching&quot;) seems more of a gimmick and is not used nearly enough it seems. Also, the much maligned health regeneration is back in spades, but it makes sense considering the sci-fi setting. The areas tend to be corridors and shooting galleries which confounds matters further, but at least there seems to be a variety of them. I reccomend this game, for fans of shooters and guns. Because really, if you enjoy that rush you get when you aim down the sight and hear bullet casings hitting the floor, then you&apos;ll love this game. Otherwise, its just another first person shooter that I only reccomend to those who enjoy first person shooters of all kinds.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2919500">Expand</a></span>

This is a good first person shooter.  The shooty bits feel really nice.  There are a few audio options similar to the battlefield games which allow you to customize to your liking (hi-fi, home cinema, etc.)  On the right settings and with good speakers/headphones, this game sounds nice!  The guns have a ton of bass and sound satisfying to fire.  Additionally there is tons of visual feedback all over the screen for all the shot interactions.
<br>
<br>The story is ok and cliche, but if you take the time to read through the various logs and other backstory, there is more depth than is intiially let on.
<br>
<br>I haven&apos;t played a significant amount of the 1993 Syndicate, but I think this reboot hits all the right checkboxes: dystopian future run by corporations where individuals are cannon fodder combined with crazy sci fi technology.  It&apos;s not an isometric tactical thingum, but I think that was really more a limitation of the technology of the time rather than a necessity to the franchise.
<br>
<br>If you like FPS, you will probably like this.  On a side note, it reminds me of The Darkness 2 in the gameplay department.  Both have mostly shooting happening, but with one new element which adds additional variety to the design.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2926037">Expand</a></span>

Overall, though the game is a bit average. Stages are pretty linear, and you dont get to use the dart too much. there are stages of gun fighting where you must defeat enemies in an area to proceed. If done similar to the way, Bulletstorm game was then i think it would&apos;ve been much better. Its like a mash of crysis and deus ex. crysis with the use of power ups and deus ex leveling character system. a good solid shooter but can get repetitive and boring after awhile.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=3057951">Expand</a></span>

<br>The Co-op missions are nice, but the SP was just a joke!</span>

<br>
<br>There&apos;s a serious problem with difficultly levels. I&apos;m playing on normal difficultly. The boss fights are really frustrating and way too difficult for the set difficulty. Sure, boss fights are supposed to be difficult you say. And you&apos;re right. But I&apos;ve been stuck on the same 5-10 minutes of boss fight (2nd boss  missiles) for 5 hours. That&apos;s over well 50 attempts. I give up. No more game for me. I&apos;ve read walkthroughs, guides and watched videos. None of which can get me passed this prick. If fact he seems to be bugged as half the returned rockets don&apos;t explode but just blink a blue light at his feet.
<br>
<br>If I was to rate the difficulty from 1 to 10. I&apos;d game the normal gameplay is a 2, ie almost boring it is so easy. The boss fights however are a 10. There&apos;s no way I can get passed it. No way to say drop the difficulty to easy just for the fight. If you want to drop the difficulty, you have to restart the game  right from the beginning! No cheats I can find. So the game&apos;s over. I can&apos;t be bothered playing the whole game over, that and the normal difficulty is too easy for standard non-boss play, that easy difficulty would be too easy and lack fun.
<br>
<br>This is an issue of play testing during the design phase of the game. I can&apos;t believe that this was play tested and found to be satisfactory.
<br>
<br>As for the rest of the game. The FOV is really narrow and causes me motion sickness. Graphics are average, just average, for their time. The graphics option screen is severally lacking setting options. There are sliders, but they don&apos;t tell you what they are changing.
<br>
<br>Sound is mediocre. In one level there is loud music and the music setting in the menu has no effect.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s no way to change key bindings. You&apos;re stuck with what the developer sets.
<br>
<br>Overall, a very disappointing console port and game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=3268461">Expand</a></span>

The powers you get don&apos;t really see any use because you can&apos;t use them for most of the game, and they&apos;re not really interesting anyways. The story is horrendously bad, and the music is also. I laughed hysterically the first time you have to fight a boss and he kicks you in the face, calls you a  and starts talking about the west coast before Skrillex starts blasting. That pretty much epitomizes this game, actually. Surprised I made it all the way through this one, but you shouldn&apos;t bother.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=3397680">Expand</a></span>

The gunplay is exceptional, all of the guns are loud, have a nice recoil, though there is only few of them. The controls are intuitive, so it is easy to use all of the cybernetic features of your character.  All of that is enhanced by believable soundFX and music. Sadly, all of that is somewhat ruined by questionable level and  story design. The shooting would have been a nicer experience if the creators gave it more thought. Most of the fights is shootouts in open arenas, often with very scarce cover. If you do not play in coop mode with other humans, you are alone vs 10-50 enemies at once. Retaliating enemy swarm after swarm gets tiring fast and doesn`t make much sense. Even the fact that there are up to 6 types of them doesn`t change that. The same goes for the bossfights. I like the basic LEVEL-BOSS layout, although here the player ends up mostly at a big disadvantage against a boss and numerour other enemies, again in an open arena. This results in really lot of cheap player deaths. Moreover, the bosses have a special weakness that is not in any way explained, so you have to figure it out yourself, mostly after 4 or 5 deaths.  Also, the mini puzzles are not explained so you often end up just standing in a room trying to figure a way out. The single player campaign on normal difficulty setting took me 5 and a half hours  from which at least 20 mins is story cutscenes. I was tired with the game after 4 hours but went on just to beat it.  I got the game for $10 and I don`t feel ripped off, but I would`t pay anymore for Syndicate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=3639843">Expand</a></span>

On every trailer it looks NOTHING like Syndicate or Syndicate Wars.  There&apos;s no point in **** about it. That&apos;s what they did and maybe it was not a good idea, but what&apos;s done is done. There&apos;s only one question now - is it a decent game?   Well, partly yes. Single player storyline is focused around Eurocorp agent Miles Kilo. We dont know much about him and that won&apos;t change through out the game. Making him a silent protagonists wasnt a good idea... it&apos;s hardly ever a good idea. Story is generic to say at least, but it holds up, somehow. Gunplay is fun, it&apos;s the best part of the game along with so called &quot;breaches&quot;. You can literally &quot;hack&quot; someone and force him to commit suicide or side with you for a moment. Nice idea, nice possibilities. Apart from that, the whole gameplay feels like a copy of Deus Ex, but without the rpg and stealthy elements. Yes, there&apos;s an upgrade system, but it changes nothing really. Oh yeah, lower recoil ...or  20% more health. Great.   Like the others said, it&apos;s a generic shooter.  I had fun, but nothing really to come back to. It&apos;s barely decent.  Then the co-op mode - far better. It involves Left4Dead-like gameplay, including strong cooperation between 4 players. As single player appears to be a generic shooter, co-op mode is a fps game with tactical elements.  You can choose your class, earn experience, upgrade your agent and your weapons. There&apos;s no way You burst in and kill everyobody, not without a significant help of your agent-friends.  I haven&apos;t play it for long, but im looking forward to do that. It holds a lot of promise.  Concluding, generic single player, good co-op... I feel some missed opportunities here. Six out of ten is my final word.  It means - good game. Just good. Should have been much better, but still - co-op saves it all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2156334">Expand</a></span>

This future is a little to distant to get attached to.<br><br><br>As for Syndicate nostalgia: Go back and play that game, it really isn&apos;t a deep  RTS or very tactical. It&apos;s a brutal, dystopic version of Canon Fodder with its distinguishing features being its shocking violence and cyberpunk setting. This game nails those features and is a worthy successor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2152997">Expand</a></span>

No more, no less. Challenging combat, some puzzles, a dash of platforming... Occasionally, however, you encounter unskippable cutscenes (that, albeit quite short, are still unskippable) or button-mashing sequences upon forcing open some paths like a jammed door. This particular &quot;Mash &apos;F&apos; a dozen times to open a door&quot; happens much more than it should, and drags down the overall experience somewhat. The story is actually rather good, deep and insightful, but you&apos;ll have to find out most of it on your own (through the Journal, just hit TAB in-game) as what is presented to you in the form of cutscenes is just the bare-bones. Judging the entire storyline just from what is presented in actual gameplay is a huge mistake, and it&apos;ll seem like a boring, generic and plot-hole-friendly run-off-the-mill plot to anyone who doesn&apos;t bother to read carefully into every line of dialogue and every single Journal entry. That is not to say, however, that the story presentation, being average as it is, is not to blame for decreased immersion, lest you take your sweet time in the Journal. The gunplay is delightful, especially when combined with the DART6 Overlay (slow motion, heat-vision, more resilience to bullets and higher damage, all in one), your Breaching capabilities and the DART6 upgrades. You can slow down time and hack enemy brain or weapon chips for increased lethality: Persuade them into fighting for you and then shooting themselves in the face, force them to commit suicide by means of grenade (causing high splash damage) or even hack various enemy weapons simultaneously to backfire, causing damage to their owners and making them vulnerable for a few seconds. Add to this an incremental upgrade system that&apos;ll have you choosing your own upgrade path into more health, better shields or accuracy, longer Overlay (slo-mo) or increased enemy breaching effectivity and very, VERY accurate hipfiring from the get-go, and you&apos;ll be enjoying one hell of a blend between old-school pinpoint hipfire on the move and the tactical element of slowing down time to plan your enemy Breaching in real-time for the best lethality. Did I mention this game is hard? Not impossible by all means, but much harder and old-school fast-paced than your average manshoot. Both you and your enemies also have very high health pools, making this closer to a skill-based shooter than an ADHD &quot;shoot first and you win&quot; Call of Dutyfest. There are three difficulty settings- Easy, Normal and Hard- and on Normal, with moderate exploring and decent manshoot skills you&apos;ll be clocking in at about 7-9 hours, leaning towards the 7-hour side as your skill increases. BOTTOM LINE: The single-player is not so gratifying when it is about watching an unskippable cutscene or mashing a button to open a flippin&apos; door. Thankfully, the main focus is shooting things and f*cking with their minds, so it&apos;s generally fun. Oh, there is also unique bosses that require unique strategies to beat. BOSSES IN A SHOOTER. Syndicate - co-op: Enemy breaching, DART6 Incremental upgrades and the DART6 Overlay are back in the co-op, although Overlay no longer slows down time. Still does everything else, however. 9 stages that rely almost completely on combat in different shapes, be it escorting a team member while he carries something or tackling down a boss with a dozen minions kicking your collective arse. Featured in this mode is the unique ability to breach your friends: If they are alive, the breaching time will be short and you will restore their full health. If they are dead, breaching will take plenty of time, but you&apos;ll get them back in the fight. You have to be within short range to start a breaching process, but once started, you can move freely and shoot things if keep the breach button held. This may sound overpowered, but this game WILL kick your ass and you will need every single advantage you can take. So long as it&apos;s four guys in the squad you&apos;ll be fine... If you can handle a challenge. This mode is EXHILARATING, as it has NONE of the faults of the Single Player, CAN BE PLAYED BY YOURSELF (once you level up a bit) and EXPANDS upon the strenghts of the single-player. There are many more DART6 Upgrades, many more weapons, you can upgrade said weapons, MANY more breach applications... Exquisite. 9 missions doesn&apos;t sound like much, but on the easiest difficulty (there&apos;s Normal, Hard and Extreme this time around.), but on Normal they&apos;ll last you about 4 hours on your first playthrough. Difficulty changes the stages significantly (different enemies and strategies, random minibosses...) and even within the same difficulty, things are slightly randomized. You will be coming back for more again, and again, and again, and again... And if any DLC is ever released, you can bet your ass it&apos;ll be Co-Op. SCORE: Single player: 6/10 Co-Op: 9/10 Final Score: 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2156769">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a game built on everything that sells great nowadays, mixed with elements inspired by original game - an example of low risk policy taken by publisher, a game which can be sold on every platform, not only PCs. Does this really make a game bad? No, at worst it will make a game generic, not being able to compete with other shooters that had a higher budget. So, what&apos;s good about new Syndicate? And what&apos;s bad?<br>Let&apos;s start with the fact - it&apos;s not a good PC port. In fact, the port is pretty bad - it has low FOV (admittedly, it isn&apos;t the lowest FOV ever, but it&apos;s obviously too low for PC), game lacks text chat in COOP and VOIP configuration is extremely limited. Sometimes during loading to a COOP game, Syndicate also crashes. On the opposite side, PC version is obviously well-optimized and I&apos;m glad, developer didn&apos;t block access to a game&apos;s console - unfortunately, it simply isn&apos;t enough to make up for the flaws of the port.<br>Now to the core of a game. Syndicate like most of shooters nowadays is divided into singleplayer and multiplayer (COOP) component.  Singleplayer is - well, slightly generic at times. It&apos;s pretty linear with occasional scripted events. You play a character of Miles Kilo - a prototype agent of EuroCorp enhanced with DART 6 chip. In Singleplayer this chip offers 3 functions - Breach (used for opening doors, disabling turrets, shields etc.), Suicide (that makes the enemy to commit violent suicide, by blowing himself up) and backfire (basically causes enemy weapon to backfire). With that, there is also DART Vision &#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2158041">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I enjoyed this game a lot. I found it to be an inventive FPS with a lot more tactical options than are commonly found in this genre. The ability to level up your character adds an additional sense of achievement as you progress through the game. Graphically, it&apos;s one of the better looking games I&apos;ve played, although it does feel a bit blurry on some levels.</span>

But that&apos;s where the similarities end.  After playing (and not enjoying) DE:HR, I was loathe to try Syndicate...but it delivered.  Immediately you&apos;re thrust into quick, dynamic combat, supported by an absolutely gorgeous cyberpunk heads-up display and interface.  The combat is fast and brutal, and you soon find a plethora of weapons in your single player campaign: cheap smg&apos;s, assault rifles (both standard and homing), flame throwers, mean little snub-nosed revolvers that make your enemies&apos; heads explode, and even the minigun!  Each mission is a thrill ride in and of itself, one piggybacking on the other to make getting up from the computer more of an ordeal than it should be.
<br>
<br>Much has been said of the game&apos;s lackluster storyline and empty protagonist, but to me, this is one of its strengths.  I prefer playing as female characters, and while the game&apos;s protagonist is male, he has no spoken dialogue and gives little sense that he&apos;s a definitive person.  This makes it easy for anyone to plug themselves into the shoes of the game&apos;s main character and delve into the storyline, unhindered by someone else&apos;s personality getting in the way of yours.  To me, this is immersiveness far better delivered than in DE:HR, where you feel like little more than a spectator.  In Syndicate, it&apos;s easier to believe you&apos;re there.
<br>
<br>The co-op multiplayer is quick and fun too, pushing you into an integral role in a team of four.  While I haven&apos;t played this feature extensively yet, I&apos;m definitely looking forward to it.  It&apos;s challenging and exciting.
<br>
<br>The only reason I didn&apos;t give this game a 10/10 is because of its lack of customization.  More characters to choose from in multiplayer - or even better, a way to customize your own, even their appearance - would add a sense of personalization to the game that it currently lacks.  I hope the developers implement something like this in the future.
<br>
<br>While Syndicate may not be the epic novel that games like the Mass Effect series have been, it&apos;s still a fun, thrill ride of a shooter with plenty of creative ways to kill your enemies.  I love it, and I&apos;d recommend it to any FPS fan, especially one that wants a game to pull off the shelf when they&apos;re in the mood for quick, brutal fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2511552">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m sure many of you will say that i have no right to write such an unfavorable review not having played past the second mission. All i have to say to you is, It&apos;s THAT boring. It&apos;s like a huge &quot;deja vu clusterfuck&quot;. The character&apos;s movement and environment interactions are weird, there are small and POINTLESS distractions everywhere, like every friggin object in existence has to display with a name and position on your HUD. The aiming is ridiculous, the bullets hit the target  whichever direction you shoot towards and that makes no difference since you need to unload a clip to kill a guy. There are some rpg elements that can&apos;t seem to find their place in the game world (maybe to make the game a tad easier and offer an illusion of randomness). In my opinion, it&apos;s a collection of unnecessary cliches, absurdities and redundancies. All i can say is, borrow it from a friend before you decide to buy it. Maybe you&apos;ll find it more interesting than i did. I just can&apos;t seem to look past the bland and generic fps that it clearly is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2153180">Expand</a></span>

Game is fun with run and shoot.  The AI is nice on the harder levels and story, while not revolutionary, still decent for an fps.  Game looks good on PC.  The interface is def PC as well.  How many games will giv eyou the convenience of pressing MOUSE 2 to go back? seriously, that alone is awesome.  Stop whining.  If you dont like it, go play CALL OF DOODY.

It has similar controls (oh gee a shooter that controls like a shooter &apos;magine that) but really is MUCH lower caliber gameplay wise. They should have stuck closer to the original games instead of doing this. Sad really.<br><br>It doesnt deserve a 1 but i think anyone who gives it a 10 is fully mental, there has been like 1 &quot;10&quot; in the past decade, just because you paid $ for the game does not make it a 10. It really is below average on every possible level so my score reflects that, i cant say the graphics are brilliant (gtx580, 16 gigs ram, 47 inch 3D tv for a monitor), nor the gameplay (i used a 360 controller.. just because a game supports controller by default does not make it a console port you mo-rons things like no display options, no dx10+, or no rebinding keys make a game a port).. the whole game just feels low budget. The plot doesnt feel epic, i dont know what is up with the **** blurriness on the edges of the screen, and improving the character just feels like &quot;yea whatever&quot;.<br><br>I just cant in any way honestly call it a good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2152994">Expand</a></span>

Ths second Co-op missions to capture territories bit of the game is what I play with my friends mostly.
<br>
<br>The game is nicely balanced.  All the weapons I&apos;ve used so far are functional - with just enough situational specialties in some weapons and a fair few general purpose weapons.  There is a bit of an RPG / Development tree - and there are extra agent skills.  There is a cover system - with certain weapons able to penetrate weaker cover.
<br>
<br>The game looks slick.  Motion capture is nice.  The character acting in the Single player game is great - especially the CEO who is quite beliveable.  Importanly the game has the Syndicate &quot;feel&quot;.
<br>
<br>The team co-op part of the game is where it really shines IMO.  You really do get to work together nicely - the enemy spawns are slightly randomised - we&apos;ve had no problems replaying the maps and enjoy using difefrent loadouts and tactics.
<br>
<br>We are really enjoying this as our FPS at the moment.  It is hard - but there is a depth to it esspecially if you can play with like minded people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2262034">Expand</a></span>

Aside from cosmetic/stylistic similarities, this and DE:HR are very different games. The choice is in the combat, which can be extremely gratifying. You might even compare this closest to Fear 2 Project Origin, as Syndicate employs a similar slow motion system...Both games have a similar problem: A severe lack of any identifying character or relate-able narrative. At least Fear scares you with vague horror tropes- here, we are offered an array of unlikable characters in an incongruous cyber punk melange...and yes, once again you play the &apos;silent badass&apos; protagonist, for the umpteenth time, it seems. Starbreeze has done some great work in the past with riddick and the darkness in terms of character, so it is odd to see a lack of any character depth whatsoever......................AND HERE IS A BIG PET PEEVE-----------you know all those &apos;wonderful&apos; &quot;jam on (insert button/key here) X number of times to initiate first person animation sequences proliferating in FPS games today? (...that Battlefield 3&apos;s single player felt it needed to use...*cringe*) Well, be prepared to to do about 50 of &apos;em over the course of this relatively short campaign. I am not joking or exaggerating...in fact, a drinking game would get you well and fully blasted by about a half hour in at the rate they feel the need to crank these bad boys out....so, to fully digress, this is not a game you will return to. Or recall much from. But, you will get into the high scoring level to level and YOU WILL have a good time with the combat.....just, be ready to...ugh. You know.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2157273">Expand</a></span>

You can almost forgive EA for what they have allowed to happen to the IP that was Syndicate.
<br>
<br>Starbreeze does good FPS games, and their take on syndicate is a surprigingly good game if a tiny bit short. This game is fresh and a polar opposite to another futuristic fps that came out around the same time which is  also a good game, Deus Ex Human Revolution.
<br>
<br>Deus Ex Human Revolution uses mostly high clarity warm colored visuals and has a slower methodical form of gameplay, where Syndicate has a cold and visceral and stylistically surreal visual representation of a futuristic world and gameplay that is manic and satisfying.
<br>
<br>For anyone who does not know the world of syndicate, it comes with a profound sense of evil, when you take control of the agent knowing what he/she has been through to become what they are, the world starts to make more sense, and it&apos;s where this game gets really interesting.
<br>
<br>Syndicate is a visually impressive, it runs great on a moderate spec PC, and loading times are quick too. The Violence in this title is standout, soundtrack is decent and sound FX are outstanding, The story is good, but if you played the old titles you may be disappointed. - I was, but some say it&apos;s the journey that matters, and with this title, I think that rings true. While a very interesting and visually loyal representation of the syndicate world as an FPS title there are gameplay elements that were let go to make this happen. that&apos;s the trouble with switching genre.
<br>
<br>The game ends quickly, but is worth a replay using different upgrades to promote a different approach to the missions. This game is for anyone who likes fast action shooting, period. the Syndicate world has been well applied but not fully realised from it&apos;s former glory.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2876517">Expand</a></span>

Despite the hype for the weapons, they are just cookie-cutter guns. Levels are extremely linear, some are simply boring while others are quite fun. The plot is extremely predictable and cliched. As a whole, Syndicate could have been a much better game.</span>

The graphics are pretty but not outstanding, and the blinding lens flares are actually annoying. The core gameplay is regular shooting + some original weapons and the cool breaching mechanic + entertaining boss fights.  The singleplayer story is forgettable and we&apos;ve got another silent protagonist which is so lame, though the world of Syndicate&apos;s got potential, and the background info you can see in the intel pieces is quite interesting.Gameplay gets more fun in the quite well done co-op mode. So, my verdict is that it&apos;s a passable mediocre shooter, earning a solid 6/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=2914271">Expand</a></span>

There isn&apos;t an engaging story to hook you in, and there isn&apos;t even much when it comes to enemy variety. I suppose the graphics and sound design is decent, though the amount of bloom is rather excessive. All in all, a fairly unremarkable game that didn&apos;t leave much of an impression.

<br>
<br>But somehow i got used to it and half way thru i started to enjoy playing the game. With few unockable upgrades game becomes more friendly to play. Gunplay is pretty solid and guns themselves sound beefy, good audio design and animation work make gunning down enemies pretty fun. Syndicate has a decent amount of guns to play with, both standard projectile based and futuristic types. Game is exteremely linear giving very limited exploration options and plot is forced down your eating hole. I had a feeling they could&apos;ve add some choice options for you as a player to tailor your story a bit like in Mass Effect.
<br>
<br>Cyberpunk setting will be very inetersting to fans of such genre. Developers have put a considerable amount of work to create a interesting futuristic setting and lore behind it that you get to explore while playing, if you choose so. Story itself felt too bog standard and unimpressive, but its not bad, it just does it work and thats it, ending also couldve been better.
<br>
<br>Performance wise it ran pretty well on maxed settings on my GTX 650, apart from already mentioned V Sync bug. Graphics are OK, sadly lots of people got fooled by its insane visual FX usage to call them &apos;&apos;best of 2012&apos;&apos;, futuristic setting also probably made the game look better than it is. But then again its a well made game knowing that it didnt had that massive of a budget.
<br>
<br>Solid game for futuristic action FPS junkies that i can easily still reccomend in 2016.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/syndicate-2012/user-reviews?user_review_id=6817932">Expand</a></span>
