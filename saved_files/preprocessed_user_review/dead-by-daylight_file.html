<br>PROS
<br>-Creepy Atmosphere
<br>-Thrilling and fun gameplay
<br>-3 Killers all of which change the gameplay dramatically
<br>-Great Party Game
<br>-Good Music
<br>-Bloodweb is an intriguing xp system
<br>-Multiple map settings
<br>NEUTRAL
<br>-Randomely Generated Maps (mainly just placing the props randomely, you can barely tell the map is different)
<br>CONS
<br>-No queuing with friends (You need to host a private lobby with 4-5, and you get no xp) [Devs have said this will be fixed shortly]
<br>-No Dedicated servers
<br>-Bad Optimization
<br>-Bad Matchmaking
<br>-Lackluster Graphics (Would be forgivable if the optimization was any good)
<br>-No rebind-able keys
<br>-1 Game Mode
<br>-Countless bugs
<br>Conclusion
<br>A good game with a lot of promise however should have been released into early access due to multiple bugs and issues. Wait a little for the main issues to be fixed and then it&apos;s an easy yes to buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6506071">Expand</a></span>

The basic premise appears to be inspired by Last Year, while the game itself appears to have raced against it for release.
<br>
<br>DbD is currently a beta. The devs have the audacity to call it a full release and charge $20 for it, but if it isn&apos;t a beta, it&apos;s an alpha. It&apos;s riddled with bugs which seem to increase in number every patch, and every aspect of the design shows little to no thought.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is a fairly novel idea, which explains one of the points I gave the game. One player is the Killer, one of now-four, each with a unique special ability. The Killer must locate and kill the four Survivors they&apos;re made to host, with the advantages of superior footspeed and constant knowledge of the location of generators, the Survivors&apos; objectives. Survivors must repair generators, open escape doors, and leave.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s where the mess begins. Killers can only kill via the sacrificial hooks scattered around the level. In order to secure a kill, they must hit someone twice without them being healed in the interim, haul them over to an available hook, put them on it, and then either repeat the process two more times or prevent any other Survivor from coming near them for two minutes. Survivors can unhook each other, and apparently meat hooks through the intestines require no delicacy in removing, because doing so takes a fraction of a second and isn&apos;t interrupted if the hooked Survivor is struck instead of the unhooker by a misfortune of hitboxes. This is why some Killers take to their most reviled behaviour: Facecamping. Rather than attempt to play the game, some Killers will hover in front of their victims to ensure they generate the pitiful trickle of &quot;BloodPoints&quot; all life in the game revolves around. This is indescribably boring for both parties involved.
<br>
<br>Survivors can also destroy hooks, either with an item or with a unique slotted ability, which as one might predict, can lead to the Killer being completely impotent. Killers do have four indestructible hooks in their basements, but two problems arise there:
<br>-Maps are quasi-randomly generated, meaning the basement can easily be too far away from where anything is happening.
<br>-A Killer Perk which extends the time for which Survivors may be carried is near-mandatory, which also pisses off Survivors.
<br>
<br>Why can&apos;t a Killer -by name- actually kill people? Oh, they can. You just need to obtain and consume a single-use rare item which puts a stipulation on which person you may kill and is lost regardless of if it&apos;s used.
<br>
<br>While these and the generally shallow gameplay of Killer might be enough to make someone abandon the role alone, another fun factor is the terrible community. Toxic and entitled, countless players will go out of their way to antagonize Killers (since Survivors are better at this than Killers are), or even sabotage their teammates for more income. The miserible natures of these players are only supplmented by the developers&apos; apparent inability to remove what are called &quot;infinites;&quot; areas where Survivors can make use of windows or terrain to be literally impossible for a Killer to catch, failing an error.
<br>
<br>Killers only need to be 20% of the population, and still Survivor queues are massive because the devs can&apos;t even make that many people enjoy the position.
<br>
<br>Perhaps the game would be less of a misery pit were it not constantly demanding the aformentioned BloodPoints (or BP). If you&apos;re a new player, collect a few hundred thousand (many hours fo gameplay, inflated further due to lack of game knowledge) before you can use a second Perk (up to 4) against all of your opponents, who likely have the complete meta build due to the complete absence of matchmaking. If you&apos;re a competitive player, enjoy agonizing over the meaningless presence of rankings in this asymmetrical, RNG-based game, and then feel the biases the arbitrary &quot;pip&quot; requirements of BP to earn in a match instill in the community. Thankfully, there is no reward for being a higher rank, or the community could find a way to be even more salty and miserible.
<br>
<br>The actual &quot;shop&quot; system is also RNG, and also an atrocity, but I&apos;m running short on space. Suffice it to say that players must make many worthless purchases, even of items they outright don&apos;t want, can&apos;t share items between compatable characters, and are fundamentally locked into progressing a single character at a time as a result. Thankfully for Survivors, all this means is that it&apos;s more of a pain to get the Perks they want, because Survivors have nothing unique about them intrinsically.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve even considered getting Dead by Daylight, get Friday the 13th, or Last Year, or nothing, or just wait. Just don&apos;t buy this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6688854">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If this game has set out to be an immersive, terrifying horror experience, it has failed. The moment you introduce a progression system and a ranking system, it becomes all about the grind. People will play it not for the experience, but to be the best, to be number one at all costs. This, in most situations, would not be all that bad, if we were talking about a sports game or a MOBA. However, this is not either of those. This is an asymmetrical multiplayer horror title.
<br>
<br>When you enable players to begin playing &quot;for points,&quot; all elements of immersion are tossed out the window. Survivors are encouraged to do blatantly stupid things such as encourage killers to chase them, not as distractions serving to buy their friends more time but simply to farm the points. When something doesn&apos;t go their way, killers and survivors alike quit to avoid losing precious, precious rank.
<br>
<br>There is no replayability here. Once survivors learn &quot;the tactics,&quot; the juke spots, how to exploit animations, how to exploit mechanics, and most importantly, that nothing but the sweet points matter, there will be no game. There will be no engagement, no variation and no fun.
<br>
<br>The only attraction this game has is to frighten Youtubers and have a laughing good time with a small group of friends, and then discard it immediately.
<br>
<br>If that were not enough, this game is a buggy, unplayable mess.
<br>
<br>There are good ideas here. The overall theme of the game, that of an asymmetrical multiplayer horror title, is interesting. Some of the mechanics presented are unique, and on the surface, they work. However, if you go anywhere deeper into this game, more than just a game or two with friends, you will run into countless bugs including, but not limited to:
<br>
<br>*Perks that do not work. Some perks are simply nonfunctional. There has been a patch to address nonfunctioning perks, but it has not fixed all of them.
<br>
<br>*Latency issues causing warping/teleporting survivors - this appears to be because the killer is the host in all situations, regardless of who has the best internet connection. This also allows the killer to DC and take the game, and everyone&apos;s points, with them.
<br>
<br>*If survivors are knocked down near other things that require the interaction key to be pressed (default Spacebar), such as being knocked down next to a window that you can vault over, the survivor can become uninteractable, preventing the killer from picking them up to go sacrifice them, or friends from being able to help them back up.
<br>
<br>*Problems with hacking and exploiting are abundant. The game stores everything locally, and as a result it is possible for players to compromise the game using tricks or malicious tools or editing software that grants them anything from experience points (called blood points in-game) to invincibility, invisibility, super speed, infinite limited-use items, and worse.
<br>
<br>*There are a million, million clipping issues, places to get hung up on or stuck on terrain, animation errors, hit box errors, and issues such as &quot;If someone disconnects while the killer is carrying them, the killer&apos;s game will freeze.&quot; You can also become stuck in the geometry with no way out.
<br>
<br>*Various problems with the ranked system. Currently the game is plagued by disconnects and ragequitters who will pull the plug because disconnecting does NOT cause you to lose ranks, only your accumulated points. Disconnecting is completely safe because you do not lose any rank rating AT ALL for disconnecting.
<br>
<br>*Balancing issues abound. Currently, survivors are able to &quot;cheese&quot; the killer by using window ledges or pallets that they can jump over indefinitely, while killers traverse much slower. Survivors are able to hop over windows infinitely, kiting killers with no recourse (such as the hillbilly and wraith, both of whom have no effective counterplay to window hopping).
<br>
<br>*An absolutely terrible progression system that rewards you with RANDOM upgrades that you purchase with points earned in every match, which encourages people to farm points. This sometimes leads to survivors purposefully baiting killers, or killiers repeatedly spamming abilities (such as the wraith&apos;s invisibility) just to earn points. If you don&apos;t get ENOUGH points in a match, regardless of whether you escape or everyone dies, you lost rank.
<br>
<br>*A terrible ranking system based on the points you earn, which can be impeded in a number of ways, as described above. If a survivor ragequits because a killer grabbed them early, the killer gets NO points and may even lose ranking!
<br>
<br>Do not purchase this game. It is not worth your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6504922">Expand</a></span>

This was obviously rushed to market by Starbreeze as a cash grab (remember that Payday 2 micro-transaction fiasco?  Same studio...).  The matchmaking system is completely broken and the ranking system seems to provide no real purpose because of it.
<br>Example.  You just started and you&apos;re rank 20 survivor, you&apos;re really going to like when the terrible matchmaking system puts your group up against a rank 10 or even a rank 1 killer...that is, after you&apos;ve spent 5 minutes just trying to find a match.
<br>Now that you&apos;re in the game, you get to sneak around fixing generators and evading capture.  But surprise!  The match is HOSTED BY THE KILLER!  Hope he has a good internet connection, because if he doesn&apos;t and you didn&apos;t type a bunch of stuff in chat to test his ping (that&apos;s the only way to do it so far, as a latency meter or even minimum requirements are not yet implemented to let you know that you can barely maintain a solid connection to the host who must be using some sort of Pre-Y2K internet provider.
<br>If you got in a game and the host has good ping, you are going to be in for a good time....unless you get stuck on one of the several terrain glitches which will make it impossible to move and out in the open to get helplessly murdered.  If the killer is the Hillbilly, pray that he doesn&apos;t have his chain add-on which makes it impossible for others to heal you.
<br>Barring that, you just have to hope that you can stay alive long enough to either escape or be the last one left and get out through a hatch in the ground.
<br>You got out...good job, but you didn&apos;t do enough to get a pip to rank up and unfortunately escaping doesn&apos;t always equal a win.  Better luck next time!
<br>
<br>Just to show that it&apos;s not all survivor based bugs, lets talk about being the killer.  Not quite as bad a situation with the matchmaking.  You start up a lobby and wait for people to join....what&apos;s this?!  You&apos;re rank 20 and there&apos;s a rank 17 survivor (because Killers can see the survivors ranks and levels before starting a match), now your going to have to leave close the lobby and try to find a better group.
<br>Ok, all rank 20 survivors and nobody over level 10, this is going to be easy!  Start game....things are going well so far, you&apos;ve found some survivors fixing a generator and you&apos;ve got one of them on the run.  Looks like we&apos;re headed into some broken down silo...and he&apos;s through the window.
<br>
<br>Still chasing this guy around this broken down silo and everyone else has left the game and he just escaped through the hatch that always spawns right next to the silo.  RAGE QUIT!
<br>Check out the discussion boards, because this can&apos;t be how the game is meant to be played....looks like this is an &quot;infinite&quot; and was even confirmed by the devs as an exploit.....but, if it&apos;s an exploit, why is it still in the game????
<br>
<br>There are a lot of problems with this game, but in all honestly, it is still a lot of fun to play.  Before purchasing, check out the discussion forums on Steam to see for yourself the laundry list of things that are wrong.  If you&apos;re not a patient person, you&apos;re not going to be happy with this purchase in its current state.  If you have the patience and time to put into the game, eventually you will learn the maps and level up enough to start really enjoying the game for what it is....a good way to make people rage quit and an addictingly fun time!
<br>
<br>Currently, the best way to enjoy this game is by watching AngryPug play it on twitch....it&apos;s a riot to watch (dewdewdew!)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6570070">Expand</a></span>

The new killer (nurse) is OP as hell. There are multiple bugs like you losing your items or perks even though you&apos;re not supposed to. This game should be early access.

Just avoid it until the fix it, which would probably be never, because this game is like hydra. They cut off one head in an update, and 2 more pop out (bugs).

The wraith is so dumb he can just cloak and find you instantly cause you have no idea of where abouts where he is or if he is watching you unless you have a nice perk. The one main source of getting away from the killers while being seen instead of hiding is putting down the wooden door shields, and the nurse can &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;ing go through them? ARE YOU SERIOUS? Seriously make some new maps, re do the killers and get your &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665; together with the &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;t ready up issues.

<br>Update after 100+ hours in this game waiting for numerous patches to come out to see how the devs handled the bug glitches matchmaking and balancing i would like to say that this game still feels like a
<br>beta they brought out the new dlc for free and there are still game breaking bugs its unfortunate to say but i think im going to put this game down and walk away the potential is still there but the fixes don&apos;t seem to be the priority
<br>
<br>The Pros
<br>-The Atmosphere is creepy
<br>-The Game play is fun
<br>-Multiple killers with their own special ability
<br>-The blood web level up system is something new
<br>
<br>The Cons
<br>-Terrible Matchmaking
<br>-Bad Optimization
<br>-More than a few bugs
<br>-Seem to be more interested in adding new features rather than fixing current bugs/glitches
<br>-You cant rebind the keys which makes some things awkward
<br>-No dedicated servers (can get matched with a killer from halfway across the world</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6541424">Expand</a></span>

These four survivors must band together to fix generators and make their escape. The gameplay is simple, with very few complex game mechanics making it easy to pick it up and play again and again.. However, the largest issue plaguing this game is the lack of players wanting to play as a Killer. The Killer is the one that hosts the match since this game uses the Peer-to-peer multiplayer formula, so as I said, matches are scarce.
<br>
<br>Another issue is some Killers feel they must camp in order to score enough points to rank up. This not only prevents any rescue to come save a hooked survivor, but usually results in a dulled gameplay experience for both the hooked survivor and the Killer.
<br>
<br>If the Devs would start grinding away at fixing the short comings of this game, it would benefit so much more. Despite the issues, by yourself or with others, this game is definitely worth the $17 I paid.

Numerous glitches in the game play itself, i.e. traps being under the ground and thus invisible to see, or pallets standing upright in the centre of a gap when they should be by the side waiting to be thrown down, the problem with that glitch is you can throw the pallet down but it still appears standing upright in the centre and you cannot tell when approaching whether or not it has already been thrown down and if there is a need to throw the pallet down or slide over it that need likely means you are being chased hence game play interference in a needless and frustrating way. The list of different glitches i have experienced reached low double figures - 10 or 11 if I remember correctly. Not good enough - but it got worse.
<br>
<br>Now I cannot access the game at all and this inability to access the game, so far at time of writing, has lasted 8 consecutive days. When I attempt to enter the game itself, a &apos;Save Game Error&apos; appears asking me to contact Behaviour Interactive via an email address detailed in the error message. I have done so numerous times. The first time I received a response within 1 hour and 20 minutes giving me guidance to solve the problem if owning the game on PC. I had detailed specifically to them I was on Xbox One. I replied. The next response took hours and responses beyond that took days. I have requested a refund due to the sale of a faulty product. Behaviour Interactive staff seem to think their company policy overrides law and have stated no refunds are possible. They have sold a faulty product to the point where beyond simply the glitches I now cannot even enter the game and have not been able to for over a week. I have asked Behaviour Interactive numerous questions and have received either no response or generalised responses. This is a novice operation of a company and I will never buy a game made by them again nor would I advise anyone to. I have never experienced anything anywhere near as bad as this on any game on any platform previously. They have sold over 2 million copies of this game but want to keep the revenue and hope customers will be ignorant and accept it. I have had less than one month to use this game before prevention of access. I will look at dealing with them in a court. They&apos;ve made a lot of money in total from a game badly made and I didn&apos;t pay for the stress of conversing with their team or for being able to access the game for such a minimal amount of time.

<br>
<br>For the general idea of the game it&apos;s a solid 10/10 for me. BUT because of the bugs like getting kicked out of matchmaking as a survivor, getting stuck on a generator as a killer (I had to leave because of that, I feel bad because if the killer leaves everyone else gets kicked), and just a few hiccups here and there.
<br>
<br>But when the game gets a little more polish I would say it would be higher than the score I&apos;m giving it, but for now it&apos;s a 7/10.

<br>
<br>the game was fun at first, but has become horribly obsolete in a hunters eyes...
<br>being a survivor it was like wow ez pee z...with one perk also...
<br>literally the game needs real balancing in game and level matchmaking...
<br>the competitive of the game lacks everything now...
<br>sorry to admit it but the roles has switched in this game..a horror for the hunter..also lacks content...repetitive stages...fog has increased to immensely foggy...no speed up death when hitting or chainsawing your victims is odd especially since they are just hanging there...they really should just add a smart ai since I feel it really is survivor based now since hunters always kept getting nerfed...and so long Dead by Daylight...forever...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6640854">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a perfect multiplayer survival horror, with 3 different killers (1 incoming) and 3 different maps (1 incoming) that change the whole gameplay. Nice &quot;blood web&quot; A.K.A. Skill tree. Basically, good ideas good implemented.</span>

<br>First hour is simply terrible cuz of pointless tutorial which wont tell you most basic and very cruical mechanic and u have to find them out by yourself. Another 10 hours are more or less great (as long as ur thrown to atleast little balanced games with other newbies). After that, its just horror (in bad meaning) - games become all about terrible meta, bugs, exploits and broken ****s. Combine it with literaly nonexistant matchmaking which throw noob(s) at one side and fully decked &quot;pro(s)&quot; at other side, 9 out of 10 games are just onesided and boring (either all survivors escape without killer even catching one, or killer butchers every1 in few minutes).

<br>Reason why i give 0/10 are their forums with mods ordered to ban and delete any1 who is pointing out too many flaws and thus scaring potencial newcomers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6563826">Expand</a></span>

<br>Annoying for everyone
<br>Dead by Daylight is a competitive online game where you play as either a survivor, or the killer&#x2026;
<br>Both of these characters are customizable....and are leveled up by completeing tasks and actions in a match&#x2026;
<br>At the end of a match you can use your earned points and dump them into a skill tree to buff your character&#x2026;
<br>And all matches are ranked so don&#x2019;t worry about unbalanced games
<br>But these features are the only good this game has going for it, because the rest is a bunch of sluggish and boring garbage&#x2026;
<br>There is no story mode here, no prepper tutorial... Just 1 single game mode of survive or hunt&#x2026;
<br>As a survivor your goal is to escape with all the members in your group&#x2026;
<br>This is a 4 v 1 game
<br>Run around an uninteresting map looking for repair parts and using these parts the sabotage hooks and fix the generators around the map&#x2026;
<br>then activate the gates and escape&#x2026;
<br>All the meanwhile trying not get caught and healing teammates that do get injured as you&#x2019;re able to wiggle your way from the killer, and you&#x2019;re able to help your teammates off of the hooks&#x2026;
<br>Being a survivor is in no way fun at all though...
<br>You can hide in closets... push things in front of the killer as you try to run away...
<br>But for the most part youre just feeling your way around a dark map hoping you find something so you can leave&#x2026;
<br>chases aren&#x2019;t thrilling, theyre sluggish and cheap&#x2026;
<br>And things are just as annoying for the killer&#x2026;
<br>As the killer you run around the map trying to either zap or slash the players trying to survive..
<br>You can grab the hurt player, carry them to a hook and sacrifice them...
<br>Your goal is to sacrifice all 4 before they can escape&#x2026;
<br>This really feels like a game of freeze tag&#x2026;
<br>And players will constantly do the annoying playground tactics of run around a giant rock&#x2026;
<br>or copping over a ledge over and over until you just get annoyed and crush it with your foot giving them time to run away...
<br>This definitely keeps the game feeling balanced&#x2026;
<br>But it also keeps the game feeling annoying&#x2026;
<br>especially the whole running around in circles but trying to get in a lucky swing&#x2026;
<br>it is more satisfying to play as the killer though&#x2026;
<br>Of catching someone who thinks they&#x2019;re clever&#x2026;
<br>And you&#x2019;re given enhanced hearing so you can sense when a survivor is repairing a generator or just recently hid in a closet...
<br>These moments are enjoyable and almost make up for the overall dull experience that is dead by daylight&#x2026;
<br>Almost...
<br>This game is still bad&#x2026;
<br>I give Dead by Daylight
<br>a 4/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7372157">Expand</a></span>

<br>5.In game 4 of the pers and 3 maniac
<br>6.The game is Pretty well optimized (Big + Consistently on ultra +60-100) (medium computers 55) To weak (40)
<br>7.The game is a lobby something to play with friends (P. S You will not be able to swing + and -)
<br>8.Each character/maniac its three unique perk.
<br>9.All the characters except the killers and Addons but the maniac is Addons,and consumables.
<br>10.Sounds/music are chosen correctly.
<br>Cons
<br>1.The game has lags
<br>2.The game has bugs
<br>3.The game has crashes (all three points have a solution look on the Internet)
<br>4.The game has save/cheats (ban Players)
<br>5.No Russian language (soon to be)
<br>6.It is impossible to play with a friend,something to swing points.
<br>The result:more Pluses
<br>Summary:the Game is worth buying
<br>Opinion:I&apos;ve played 169 hours and I like the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6533667">Expand</a></span>

Besides escaping from the serial killer maybe there could be another mechanic in the game that players can work together to achieve a different kind of victory by killing the serial killer in different ways on different levels. This mechanic could be like the generators, but more hidden and can help to unlock a machine or weapon to kill the serial killer. when trying to power up these devices they will generate noise at random to alert the serial killer. Lastly there needs to be more torture devices in levels and different kinds so that the kill has more ways to dispatch his victims.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6566717">Expand</a></span>

<br>Anyway hope they make a huge update soon that can make this game even better.
<br>So for right now, the game is a 7.5/10 if they do a update, like I said would fix and add the stuff in the game, it would be a 9.5/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6666799">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately, I did not enjoy the game. The optimization is bad. At first, I didn&apos;t have a problem, but by the seventh, eighth, and ninth game it&apos;s clear the game is not properly optimized and I&apos;m running two MSI RX-480 video cards. The game is unbalanced. If you are a low level, whether killer or survivor, good luck. Survivor was boring; I remember playing one match as a survivor and I waited around for others to do work and walked out the door not lifting a finger other than escaping. Playing as a killer is the worse. The only one I got a KILL AFTER FIVE RANDOM GAMES was the witch and it took me three tries to kill the person on the meat hook. The only saving grace is the cost because the game is cheap. Unless you  plan on playing with friends, you will not like the grind aspect of the game and how they use the microtransactions in the game **** up the flow. AGAIN, if you not playing with friends, pass on this. I will keep the game whenever I can convince my friend&apos;s to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6827572">Expand</a></span>

<br>However the lobby and matchmaking are really like a struggle, the real survival part is when you try to enter into a game.
<br>It has some bugs and some things that has to be fixed to let it achieve a sufficient score, i would say.
<br>The audio is amazing, the graphic is okay.</span>

<br>For the better part of the existence of this game it took literally at least as long as a match itself to find a game. 50% of my game time are waiting time in the lobby. At one point my record was waiting for 160 minutes. Yes. 160 minutes. And they took 6 months to make that better, and even now its still very bad.
<br>
<br>The balance is horrible. Every patch it gets worse. Sometimes so bad that the totally dominating side turns into the always losing side. Its ridiculous.
<br>
<br>Sometimes they make unneeded changes. Like when they changed the engine version, just to have fluttery clothes (which still look stupid, btw), the game broke completely. Sounds were messed up, people got stuck even more, etc. Some of those bugs still exist, even though its about a year ago, like that the whole visibility in the distance is suddenly totally clear. Before it was all blurry, which made it very scary, because it was hard seeing where the killer is coming from or where youre actually going. But now you can see everything happening at the other side of the map, you know where the killer is and the killer can see you from miles away as well.
<br>
<br>The gameplay design makes griefing a part of the game. The developers even seem to support that. Only about 10% games I ever played were without a griefer, one way or the other. It starts with simple things like killers quitting because you burned rare offerings they dont like and thus making you lose those offerings, goes on to lag exploiters (very easily done due to the horrible netcode they use) and face camping killers, and ends with exploit using survivors. You cant report them, they wont be punished. The devs promised to fix all that, but then they changed their mind and actually supported it, released killers and perks that actually directly demand from you to be a griefer, which makes me think they know exactly how toxic their player base is.
<br>
<br>The devs are liars. They promise something new and fixes every week in their live stream, but then they dont do many things they promise. I mentioned an example in the last passage. They also are an reflection of their own playerbase. They act arrogant, insult their own customers live on air and ban people on their forums if they criticize them for their toxic behavior. They even had a contest among each other on their stream &quot;not to insult customers&quot;, which they failed miserably. That should tell you enough.
<br>
<br>How this game is still that popular after all that, is beyond me. Also their reviews on Steam look very fishy. For the most of the time they only had a bad or mixed review average. But shortly before another game in the same genre released in May, the positive reviews suddenly skyrocketed, even though the game didnt change much at all. So I think its very possible they are manipulating reviews as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7554191">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There are also loops in places where u can loop the killer for around 3-5 minutes before they get full bloodlust to get you, which in those times 3-4 gens is already done. and if they had decisive the game is gg.
<br>
<br>they completely made trapper useless by not giving traps under hook, Hag is the worst killer in game. Nurse remains the best simply because she is the only killer that can deal with infinite loops. Unbalanced addons, some killers gets completely useless addons like the hag.
<br>
<br>Survivors flashlight are also insanely strong, combined with 4 SWF. BNP changes is nice but u dont need it when u have gen tapping vs Ruined. and double pellets in the same places are just plain bad. there should only be 1 pellet, which is way enough to buy time to waste the killers time. survivors are not scared in this game. u are encouraged to taunt/ bold actions which grants u more points
<br>
<br>the devs will never understand why the game is like this until they reach Rank 1 survivor and killer.

<br>It&apos;s mad fun, the graphics are gorgeous and smooth, and no two games will ever be exactly the same.  You just never know what might happen in any given game and some of the games have extremely intense and exciting endings where living and dying all comes down to one vital decision and or move.
<br>
<br>Easy 9 out of 10, but one of the best and most fun games I&apos;ve ever played in my life and I grew up as a gamer in the 1980s, playing thousands of games in my life!  ..Well worth the money, don&apos;t miss this one people!

<br>
<br>This game isn&apos;t going to be for everyone. Odds are you will be a helpless survivor. Yes, you will be helpless. The killer cannot die. Once again, the killer cannot die. When you first start playing, you will die more than you will survivor. Survivors are suppose to be helpless against a Killer. As a survivor you don&apos;t play to win games, you play to survive them. As the Killer you have one objective. That objective is to kill. That&apos;s the game. if you don&apos;t like the concept, than Dead by Daylight is not for you. Once you become good enough and an high enough level with good perks, as a survivor you eventually will learn how to out smart the killer. Then your odds of surviving will continue to increase. I like to compare this game to a slasher flick. One killer vs Four survivors. Can you out smart the killer and escape?
<br>
<br>Now the game is not perfect. There are some bugs. Ex: Messy movement when the killer attempts to pick up a survivor. (nothing game breaking). All Killers are not the same. Some are stronger than others. (Balancing). Games have no timers. Meaning, games can last forever. I have lasted in a match for 42 minutes. Games typically last 12-15 minutes :). Lastly, if you choose to play as the killer, you will be hosting the game. To fill up your game it can take upwards of 10-15 minutes. The reason for this is because everyone wants to be the killer. Plus side, if you decide to be the survivor you will never have an issue finding a game.
<br>
<br>The game is truly a good time. For $20 I recommend picking it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=6621416">Expand</a></span>

Teleporting into walls, aimlessly floating around in a strange position when caught in traps, and bad texture pop-in. However, the rest of the game is not horrible, it is playable, and mostly enjoyable. And most of the glitches got patched by the developers.</span>

One thing that bothered me was that no matter what graphics option you choose the game&apos;s graphics look the same except with MUCH more fog. It has some optimiztion issues and gets repetitive after 4-5 maches. But now the devs added more killers to the game. My main problem with the game is lack of story, I mean obviously I don&apos;t want a long story but it completely lacks the story, they added journals. But they did not add it to the game, they added it to game&apos;s website. If you can&apos;t tell a story inside your game then just don&apos;t. And bugs....... Jesus people, did you release this game without testing it even once? It has too many bugs and they haven&apos;t fixed any of them, so don&apos;t buy this game at this state.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7417562">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Its so buggy, so unbalanced that is complete ****
<br>Cant recommended at all, its just a waste of money.
<br>
<br>The premise its awesome as so the ambience. But the matchmaking, the unbalance of the game and the bugs its just too much.</span>

The developers don&apos;t care about that neither. There are also a lots of bugs. Finally, if you want to play killers with no brain and no skill, go for it otherwise skip this game.</span>

<br>This game, in terms of gameplay, is AMAZING. The controls (mouse &amp; keyboard) are very good without heavy ---or any--- remapping. It runs smoothly, too. I know some people have said it runs bad on low graphics on even the best PC&apos;s, but I play on an ASUS laptop that has been dropped many times and nearly drowned, and it still runs good on low graphics!
<br>
<br>&quot;The game is balanced to give each team a fair edge,&quot; at least that&apos;s what the beHaviour want to think they&apos;re doing. For the most part, they are doing a good job, but if you haven&apos;t played this game yet, PERKS ARE EVRYTHING! However, the developers don&apos;t see it that way though, and they aren&apos;t that balanced. Survivor perks are stronger than they should be, and the killer&apos;s are weaker. Is playing as a killer impossible because of it? No, of course not. Can it be an absolute rage-fest sometimes? Very much yes. The balancing isn&apos;t all that helped either, saying that the developers &quot;main&quot; survivor, and are rank 20&apos;s nearly all around. (Mains are players that play practically only ONE side. These people can be identified based on their achievements/trophies, and how they share their piece of mind in arguments.)
<br>
<br>The game is also riddled with bugs, some game breaking. The most notorious, absolutely hated, and one that will make you go &quot;how is this still even a problem for a full game release,&quot; is that whenever you load your game, you have the chance to lose everything. Your bloodpoints (the game&apos;s currency), what I call &quot;shrine shards&quot; (currency for the &quot;shrine of secrets,&quot; which let you unlock character-unique perks early without wasting bloodpoints to level up the character that the perk corresponds to), your online rank, your items, add-ons, offerings.... you know where this is going. Note the game has been out for over a year with this issue, and F13: The Game fixed this issue within a week.
<br>
<br>However, none of this is comparable to what I say is the worst part of this game. And that, would be THE COMMUNITY. It is made with only one ingredient: Toxicity. The worst of this comes from the high-ranks, particularly the survivor mains. They abuse the players in their games (particularly, as you would guess, the killer of the match) for the stupidest reasons. You play as Michael Myers? You get hated for it. No, I&apos;m not kidding, I&apos;ve been in a post match and someone actually complained about who our killer chose to play as, which was Michael Myers. And it was a low-rank lobby. If you think that is annoying, just wait until you get into the high-ranks. The killer wins? At least someone will say that the killer is a camper noob, nit picking the hell out of them, then ending it with &quot;uninstall&quot; or &quot;kill yourself.&quot; The killer loses? They&apos;re called trash killers and, again, ends with &quot;uninstall&quot; or &quot;kill yourself.&quot; There is no pleasing high-ranks survivors, no matter how hard you try. Killer&apos;s aren&apos;t innocent either. They can be just as abusive for just as stupid things, but don&apos;t as often tend to start the conflict as much as survivors do.
<br>
<br>Overall, I give Dead by Daylight a 3/10. Plays and runs good with good base controls, but that is over-shadowed by a slight unbalance, game-breaking bugs, and an absolutely HORRIBLE community.
<br>
<br>P.S I would complain that this game is not noob-friendly, but what online game is noob-friendly?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dead-by-daylight/user-reviews?user_review_id=7806313">Expand</a></span>
