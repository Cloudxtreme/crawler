<br>
<br>Its also worth noting that the &apos;POP Demand Mod&apos; greatly improves this game and tackles almost everyone&apos;s complaints about game features.</span>

The good thing about Paradox interactive is that they actively keep updating their games even several months and years after their release.

What it does it does very well and what it doesn&apos;t do...well it just doesn&apos;t do it for some people. If you are a huge strategy game fan (especially of other Paradox titles) or a real history buff then you will probably enjoy this game, but if you&apos;re more of a Call of Duty fan and looking to get into a different genre while you wait for the next shooter then this game is definitely not for you. The tutorial is rather boring and all text with no hands on experimentation and this leads to a lot of frustration and searching on the forums. I think the devs wanted you to experiment in-game and play with your own style and in this forces you to do so as a lot of the game is learn as you go, but the first few hours can be very frustrating. The interface is very disheartening even for a seasoned strategy player but it soon becomes your best friend and the more information the better. Diplomacy is definitely this game&apos;s strong point over competing RTS games, indeed if you wanted you could play the entire game without going to war and still accomplish many of your nations objectives. That&apos;s not to say warfare isn&apos;t an integral part of the game, but you are presented with many options for working around a rival nation, the Prussian/Austrian Campaign is especially enjoyable in this regard. Warfare is fairly well done, however you take no part in the battle and the strategy is in getting all the right technology, luring an enemy army into unfavourable conditions, maintaining supply lines, and trying to keep your economy running enough to keep your armies moving. It is really focused on the grand strategy where winning a battle takes a back seat to winning the war. The economy is also very well done and it&apos;s management is absolutely critical to your success or failure. All in all I enjoyed Victoria 2 and if you have a lot of time and patience on your hands then you probably will too, but know that you get what you put into this game and if you put in little you will get little in return.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victoria-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2094632">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s sad to say but what this game improves is utterly out shadowed by what it loses and this is the same for Hearts of Iron 3. Here&apos;s what the game does right this, fantastically improved military system making war actually entertaining, the tech tree isn&apos;t limited to a few arbitrary techs, the addition of secondary powers, and a easier to follow capitalist system. Now for what hampers this game, the new graphics make the game run slower which may not sound like a big deal but honestly you never do much but sit in Victoria so now you&apos;re just sitting longer which is tedious, The AI upon the games release don&apos;t do anything weakingling AI in Hearts of Iron do more than these guys, Nearly every historical event was flushed down the toilet which makes the game feel like its meandering and without historical wars or events NOTHING HAPPENS, Colonization is totally stupid now since only major and secondary nations can do it (Sorry Argentina) and your ability to colonize is based on national focus which is based on pop so it only allows you to colonize 3ish provinces at one time, finally the game is disturbingly buggy which is shameful for a game just released since it means they barely product tested it. All and all the original is just a better game doesn&apos;t make this game horrible it just isn&apos;t worth the money yet since the first is mega cheap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victoria-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1386675">Expand</a></span>

The game has tremendous potential though. I think with a strong expansion pack, it&apos;ll become a classic.</span>

That short experience left me baffled.  That said, I saw that there was something to the game, and promised to devote a Saturday afternoon to it one day.  About a month ago, I did just that.  I spent a full day doing the tutorials and trying out a game of it in earnest.  I was left baffled.  Confused.  Humbled like no other strategy game ever has.  Strategy is my genre, and this was the most monstrous game I have ever seen.  But it left me utterly compelled.  Fast forward a month, and I am STILL learning how to play this game.  But it is worth it.  I would give this game a 10, but it is simply not accessible to the average STRATEGY gamer.  If I was to rate is as a game for whoever, it would be lower, simply because of the ludicrous learning curve.  That being said, for those that take the time to learn the game, kudos.  You have discovered a classic.  It is stable, the ai is a reasonable challenge, and there is only victory in your own eyes.  For those who claim there is a problem with the underlying game mechanics, they have not scoured the forums and found out why the game works like it does.  For the vast majority of things, this game was designed to work like it does, and after understanding why it was designed the way it is, you will say to yourself &quot;Oh, now I see why they did that.&quot;  I give it an 8.5 out of 10, siding on a 9.  If you buy the DLC, A House Divided, it improves the game to an even further extent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victoria-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2335173">Expand</a></span>

The possibilities are all up to you and the decissions you make. One thing Paradox excels in, is their long support for their released games and their commitment to create easily modable games. They have recieved a lot of acclaim because of this from all over the world and Victoria II is a prima example of this. The most apparent difference of Victoria II over its predecessor Victoria I, is that it&apos;s graphically improved a lot, this in my opinion is a good thing. I really appreciate the fact that you can now actually see crisp borders, instead of random blobs all over the map which should portrait your country. Another part is gameplay, with which combat and diplomacy have been improved considerably, but also some differences have been made in the overall economy and pops. These changes cannot cater to everybody, but to an extend I appreciate most options. However, I really miss the possibility to buy and sell provinces. The AI is also a bit stale, but every game I play, I notice all the other countries are building their armies to prepare for the Great War, which is quite interesting. Colonizing is very dependant upon what and how you research, making it more of a rat race around 1870, rather than colonizing Africa/Asia at a steady pace. England is also massively overpowered for a long stretch in the game, but it&apos;s your call if you&apos;d like to keep it that way, or bring them down by force.. The combat makes it possible to keep better track of your armies and also (very important) keeping them supplied and reinforced. In total, Victoria II is a great update on the original. It doesn&apos;t give my the ultimate observer feel I&apos;ve had in part one though, so it&apos;s not perfect, rather pretty close..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victoria-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2571385">Expand</a></span>

Victoria II has a lot of detail, from tech trees, to POPs, trade, diplomacy, and a lot of historical data. While in other games of paradox this level of detail is usually accompanied by a steep learning curve which would make many people hate the series, but Victoria II seems alot more balanced and straight forward. Worried about the tech tree? Well don&apos;t worry it&apos;s literally straight forward at what you need for the next tech, and not all techs are available to you at once unlike HoI 3 which you literally could research everything way before you should, especially if you like to cheat. Diplomacy in Victoria II is a bit screwy, but is still manageable and usable. Sure, vanilla Victoria II doesn&apos;t allow you to kick out **** members of your sphere of influence but that isn&apos;t reason enough to not like or play this game. The political system  seems to be well balanced on reality, with my only complaint being that&apos;s really really hard to try to get 1 party from 3% to 20+ unless it&apos;s the basic liberal or conservative parties aka really hard to create a Fascist, Communist, or anything else really nation. Now the economy system is not as straight forward as it could (ease of use), but is significantly easier when compared to other paradox games, where controlling the economy is important (I highly suggest looking into an online guide for this). Administration, is really easy to manage, make the tax levels for each of the 3 classes (lower, middle, upper), set tariffs, and decide what to spend on. (Education, Administrating, Recruits, Raw materials you need, etc.)<br><br>All and all Victoria II is a good game with some flaws, and a bit of a learning curve, but is still playable. Though I wouldn&apos;t pay more than $30 for it. 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victoria-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2014867">Expand</a></span>

The political dimensions act to remove player controls over economics. The economics are obscure (very hard to understand let alone master). And the bloody little notification windows, telling you about in-game events never stop opening! Playing this game is a huge pain in the anus. I gather that there are actually people who like this game, and feel thankful that I don&apos;t know any of them. If you are in that camp please don&apos;t message me, I really don&apos;t want to know you.
<br>
<br>THE GROT REVIEW CRITERIA: After a long time writing reviews like an anus, think its time to set a few bad habits straight: Stop insulting designers. Show some respect for the design process and getting games in circulation. Hence (1) No Red scores. (2) Game scores as follows: Bad Game 5/10. Poor Game 6/10. Mediocre Game: 7/10. Good Game 8/10. Great game 9/10. Stella Game 10/10. To get 10/10 it must be a game that can be (theoretically) play-able for 1000+ hours. Not only great but near endless fun. Games may be bad or poor but making them should earn respect. Thus even the worst POS will still be a 5/10. 0/10 no longer exists in my vocabulary. Yellow is the new red. You cannot reply about this game! Go away!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victoria-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=2671298">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>3. Once you become a Great Power you must spend the rest of the game watching the influence interface, trying to jocky your sphere of influence into the AIs. About as fun as watching an intrument-panel on a random factory-machine.

The only thing Paradox should be ashamed of when it comes to this game is just compeletely abandoning it while going on the add tonnes of expansion and bug fixes to the inferior Europa Univeralis, and just completely dedicating all work to the RGP (not even real strategy) Crusader Kings. The company has a backward investment policy. As naive as I sound, hopefully they can one day turn back and actually pay more attention to this title, and make the other titles more like this one. This game is like the misunderstood child at school, that one day grows up to become a  genius. Unfortunately this day hasn&apos;t come yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/victoria-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=5445015">Expand</a></span>
