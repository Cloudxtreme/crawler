The game looks gorgeous, controls flawlessly and it has enough content to keep you entertained for a long time but in the end it just come down to one simple fact. It represents the core of what gaming should be. Fun. Amazing work from Gaijin games and I hope we see more of that.</span>

The amount of stuff to unlock and the online leaderboards keep me pretty confident that i&apos;ll get more out of this $15 game than I have out of many full priced ones. Plus: You can put a walkman on CommanderVideo. If that doesn&apos;t sound great to you, you don&apos;t have a heart.</span>

<br>
<br>The two most important updates in this franchise are 1) checkpoints and 2) the ability to change the difficulty level on the fly.  I&apos;ve found myself ragequitting this game a lot less frequently.  And for the purists, the checkpoint is optional; you get a large bonus to your score if you choose to skip it.
<br>
<br>I do want to caution people looking to buy the game that if they hated the first BIT.TRIP Runner, they might find this game a little more tolerable, but probably still won&apos;t really like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bittrip-presentsrunner2-future-legend-of-rhythm-alien/user-reviews?user_review_id=3032260">Expand</a></span>

However, I quickly found the &quot;normal&quot; difficultly setting to be far too easy, and switched it to hard. The game instantly became extremely frustrating. It&apos;s kinda annoying that you have to do the levels completely perfectly to continue. I would have really like to have maybe one or two health points or something so I can keep going when I mess up. But being sent back to the beginning again and again and again and again and again really started to get on my nerves. So I set it back to &quot;normal&quot;, and was once again boringly breezing through the levels with little effort.  Also, the music could be better. In most levels, the music doesn&apos;t really get &quot;good&quot; until the very end, at which point it... ends. It&apos;d be better if some levels could START OUT with awesome music and just build on that, instead of starting with quiet, dinky, boring blips.
<br>
<br>Also, there&apos;s no setting to sync audio with video (like in Guitar Hero etc), so on my screen, the audio always seems a tad ahead of the video, which makes the game difficult to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bittrip-presentsrunner2-future-legend-of-rhythm-alien/user-reviews?user_review_id=2998687">Expand</a></span>

I can safely say that it&apos;s better than Bit.Trip Beat and Bit.Trip Runner 1 though, but that&apos;s not much of an achievement. The fact that games like Dishonored and Stalker have a lower score than this sickens me.</span>

<br>Much like the first BIT.TRIP Runner, I just couldn&apos;t enjoy this game despite my best efforts. The art is beautiful, and it&apos;s nice to see that Gaijin can make a beautiful, non-retro game. The music is wonderful as always. The gameplay, though... I normally really love music games of all sorts, but the gameplay is incredibly frustrating. The levels still go on way too long, and they&apos;re pretty hard, even near the beginning, which means that you will end up re-doing the same parts of the same levels over and over. I don&apos;t think the first Runner has a checkpoint system, and that is definitely a welcomed addition to Runner 2, but it&apos;s not enough. This game is certainly challenging, but for me, it wasn&apos;t a fun challenge at all.
<br>
<br>The keyboard controls are baffling. You can use the arrow keys and space bar, which I highly recommend over what they tell you the controls are.
<br>
<br>The BIT.TRIP series is a cool experiment in rhythm games, but Runner, for me, was a failed experiment and I don&apos;t know why that&apos;s the game that got a sequel. If you liked Runner, you&apos;ll love Runner 2, but I can&apos;t endorse this game for anyone else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bittrip-presentsrunner2-future-legend-of-rhythm-alien/user-reviews?user_review_id=3913938">Expand</a></span>

<br>In Runner2 you are playing Commander Video, who can&apos;t stop running. You have to jump, slide, kick and block to avoid the many obstacles in his way. It&apos;s all about memorizing the obstacles. The music helps you with the tricky timing, which is quite a creative approach.
<br>
<br>Runner2 makes its predecessor look like a prototype. Graphics are much better, nice cutscenes, pretty menues, good voice over, polished music and sound effects. Some elements were carefully added to the gameplay, but still it feels pretty much like the original game, which is a very good thing. So why do I like Runner1 better then?
<br>
<br>Today&apos;s games are often designed to be as little frustrating as possible, so that anybody can beat the game and nobody is scared off by the high difficulty. I think, that&apos;s a mistake. Runner1 had a very good level design, and there were a couple of levels which made me throw my controller against the wall because they were so difficult. Every game needs levels like that, otherwise it doesn&apos;t feel rewarding to beat it. And now for Runner2: It just took me one afternoon to finish it. Not even the final boss was particularly difficult. This is what disappointed me the most....
<br>
<br>One thing I&apos;d criticize about Runner1 was the graphics. Often the background was full of moving, flashing things. They were so distracting that it was sometimes difficult to distinguish between all those meaningless objects and the obstacles in the foreground that would kill you, when you hit them. This problem was not solved in Runner2. In its later levels it seems even worse...
<br>
<br>If I did not know Runner1, I think I would give Runner2 a 9 or even 10/10 it is just great fun! But I do know the first part, so I know this could have been done better. Still I don&apos;t regret buying it at all, and I think I will still spend some time to unlock all the extra levels.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bittrip-presentsrunner2-future-legend-of-rhythm-alien/user-reviews?user_review_id=3612855">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve played through the entire game and still aiming to 100% the game. Unbelievable fun and re-playability with solid mechanics and 2.5D graphics with this game, an easy 10/10.</span>

It&apos;s obvious from the get-go that Gaijin knew exactly what they wanted to do with Runner 2. Gameplay is incredibly solid, visuals are breathtakingly gorgeous, and music you&apos;d expect to greet you on a long sprint down the bridge to Valhalla. Every inch of this game is polished to perfection. You find yourself almost immediately absorbed into the bizarro world they present to you, your thoughts a swirling mess of music, colors, and twitch reflex. When you fail you only feel more compelled to play further, feeling the urge to show this game what-for!

<br>
<br>That being said, this is what you want from a sequel: a game that improves upon the original in every way. I haven&#x2019;t yet finished this one but I&#x2019;m about halfway through and it has already exceeded my expectations.
<br>
<br>I&#x2019;ll start with the only negative point I have right now: the Reverse Merman&#x2019;s ball sack. He&#x2019;s a character with the upper body of a fish, the lower body of a man, and testicles that hang down to his knees. I&#x2019;m not a prude, but I think it&#x2019;s needlessly disgusting in an otherwise lighthearted &amp; fun game. If you have kids, you probably don&#x2019;t want them seeing that. I&#x2019;m an adult and I don&#x2019;t want to see that. At least he is an optional character so you don&#x2019;t have to unlock him, and if you unlock him you don&#x2019;t have to use him.
<br>
<br>Aside from that blemish, this is an incredibly polished &amp; enjoyable platformer  for both casual gamers and hardcore, leaderboard chasers alike. The way they designed the point system is ingenious because while they added checkpoints into each level, if you don&#x2019;t use them you will get a point boost and a challenge boost since your experience will be a lot like the first game where you start all over from the beginning of the level each time you die.
<br>
<br>If you don&#x2019;t care about your score, though, you can take full advantage of the checkpoints. They make trying to collect the gold bars scattered throughout each level a lot more fun. Ditto for the secrets and unlockables, of which the first game had none. Speaking of unlockables, there are quite a bit in this game from extra characters to extra outfits and even more of the Atari-style, ultra retro challenges featured in the first game. Levels also routinely feature multiple paths, one of which will be more difficult (but could contain a treasure or secret) or will lead to a secret level exit.
<br>
<br>The graphics are much nicer than the original and are 3-D while still keeping the original&#x2019;s retro, 2-D feel. It makes the game look much sharper and gives more life to the characters you can play as they have more than bare bones animations this time around (the cheeseburger guy is especially fun in this respect).
<br>
<br>Oh and if the optional checkpoint challenge isn&#x2019;t enough, there is also a new &#x201C;dance&#x201D; button that causes your character to dance for a split second during the level. You get points each time you dance, but your guy can&#x2019;t do anything else while dancing, so you&#x2019;re taking a risk when you do it. Also, getting a perfect run with all the gold bars gets your guy put in a cannon at the end where you have to try and hit a bullseye for maximum bonus points. The addition of these factors plus the checkpoint boost will keep a lot of leaderboard fiends busy for quite a while, I&#x2019;m sure.
<br>
<br>I got this for 50% off at recent Steam sale but I&#x2019;d say it would also be worth full price, especially if you enjoy competing on the leaderboards. Can&#x2019;t wait to finish it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bittrip-presentsrunner2-future-legend-of-rhythm-alien/user-reviews?user_review_id=3621321">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Runner 2 is a rhythm platforming game wherein your runner...runs...at a constant pace through various obstacles. It&apos;s definitely not a traditional platformer like Super Meat Boy, and it&apos;s a far bit more simple. You simply move right and avoid stuff...but even though this may not sound like much, it&apos;s so deeper than what you might think.
<br>
<br>Levels start simple, but the game consistently throws new stuff out at you to surprise you. Jumping obstacles becomes more complex as you progress, and score attack style gameplay with online leaderboards will have you dancing about trying to maximize your performance. This game gets incredibly difficult, but that urge to &quot;try once more, and do better this time&quot; never leaves.
<br>
<br>The whole rhythm aspect of this game is incredibly well implemented. Songs move to the beat of the stage to the point where they almost mimic your performance and vice versa. Inevitably the rhythm itself becomes part of the gameplay itself.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not a big fan of the visuals, tbh. I liked the old school 8 bit look of Runner...and here, the graphics just look a bit odd to me. Aside from that, I can&apos;t complain about much else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bittrip-presentsrunner2-future-legend-of-rhythm-alien/user-reviews?user_review_id=3617799">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I can easily see many people get bored or annoyed by this game, as it can get repetitive and is quite long for such simple gameplay. That&apos;s why I think this game is good for killing like 2-5-10-20 dead minutes of the day or something like that. Personally I&apos;ve been playing this game for quite a long time but only once or twice in a weekend, or something like that, and that lets me really enjoy the game and keeps me from getting sick of it.
<br>
<br>The bottom line - but when on sale, use only when you really wish to kill some time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/bittrip-presentsrunner2-future-legend-of-rhythm-alien/user-reviews?user_review_id=4858856">Expand</a></span>
