<br>Initially - it feels fast paced and fun - but quickly becomes repetitive with fights being just too similar - and void of any real tactics.
<br>
<br>So for a mobile game played on a quick bus ride or so - it is &quot;ok&quot; ... for the spoiled PC roleplayer it is barely worth installing. Game features and mechanics are just too few to keep a long term enjoyment - and customization of classes and skills is ... well.. barebones at best.
<br>
<br>Still - in quick bursts without a demand for a deep story or complex mechanics - it is a neat distraction.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/knights-of-pen-paper-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=6085415">Expand</a></span>
