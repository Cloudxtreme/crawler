You might think there&#x2019;s more to it than that, but there is not &#x2013; this game is a walking simulator, and perhaps the least fun one I&#x2019;ve ever played.
<br>
<br>The core aesthetic is an interesting idea at first blush &#x2013; your character is blind, so you can only see things very close to you, or things which are somewhat noisy from a distance. This latter mechanic, unfortunately, is mostly pointless &#x2013; only a couple times in the game does it really give you much of a target.
<br>
<br>So, mostly, you&#x2019;re wandering around blind, trying to find your way through the levels. There&#x2019;s nothing in the levels which threatens you, just a few extremely simple &#x201C;bring object A to location B&#x201D; &#x201C;puzzles&#x201D;. Indeed, there aren&#x2019;t even very many of these &#x2013; perhaps three in the entire game.
<br>
<br>Given it takes several hours to beat this game, you might wonder what you do spend it doing. Do you spend it on story?
<br>
<br>Not really; there&#x2019;s no comprehensible dialogue, only three characters (you, the cat, and a random person you encounter once and help get their ball back). Mostly, the game is just walking around levels and trying to get to the end of them.
<br>
<br>And I do mean walking &#x2013; the character you control walks around very slowly, and there&#x2019;s no means of going any faster. As such, getting through the levels is very tedious.
<br>
<br>There&#x2019;s a handful of achievements for doing various things in the game, but most of these are basically just &#x201C;interact with some environmental object&#x201D;. Yay. Worse, you must stand very close to the environmental object to interact with them, and one of the achievements is simply walking over a few patches of nondescript ground indistinguishable from everything else. What could be more fun than that?
<br>
<br>The story, such as it is, is extremely weak and threadbare &#x2013; the lack of dialogue robs it of any real characterization, and the fact of the matter is that the core of the story is pretty boring. Do I really care about this girl finding her cat? No, because I&#x2019;m not really given any strong reason to care about the girl in the first place. Lack of characterization means lack of investment, and the two dozen or so story lines in the entire multiple hour long game does not endear it to me.
<br>
<br>There is really nothing in this game to make you want to play it. The core aesthetic is a vaguely neat idea, but that&#x2019;s it &#x2013; and, quite frankly, it quickly becomes obvious as you play the game just how tedious it really is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/beyond-eyes/user-reviews?user_review_id=6986431">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Overall, a serene and peaceful experience heightened by the vivid colors and texture. While light on story and gameplay, this game bleeds atmosphere. A great way to cool down after a bigger, action heavy title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/beyond-eyes/user-reviews?user_review_id=6892690">Expand</a></span>

While the aforementioned are my usual  fare, I found the slow pace, quiet music and sounds and beautiful graphics refreshing. To call it a game is not quite correct. It is more like a graphic novel, only using concepts and perception instead of words. Sure, the play is linear, but what else would you expect from such a simple plot. The game does not feed you with cues, allowing you to learn them from your environment. There are no map markers pointing you to the next task, but then, why would there need to be? After all, you are playing a recently blinded girl who has finally gained the courage to step out into the world beyond her front gate. A beautifully executed idea.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/beyond-eyes/user-reviews?user_review_id=7447960">Expand</a></span>
