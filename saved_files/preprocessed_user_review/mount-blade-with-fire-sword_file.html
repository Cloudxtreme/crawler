Honestly, I&apos;m a bit disappointed and feel like I should have waited for a mod before buying. First off, the game&apos;s finances are WAY out of whack; decent quality equipment costs an exorbitant sum compared to what you can make doing quests, raiding villages, etc. I figured that maybe I&apos;d just have to try to become a powerful noble and save some cash, but then about 18 hours in I get a message saying I&apos;ve been assassinated and the game&apos;s over. Really. Imagine playing Sim City for 20 hours and a message comes up saying that a meteorite blew everything up and you have to restart. That&apos;s pretty much what the devs INTENTIONALLY did here. Most of the time nobles give you quests that involve delivering letters, so a good chunk of the game is pretty much just running back and forth. Sweden is ridiculously overpowered, so try not to get on their bad side, but the res of the factions seem well-balanced. The campaign is fun and makes becoming powerful easier than in previous games, and the battles are still a hoot and firearms really do add a whole new dynamic to the game. The ability to customize your troops&apos; armor and weapons is neat, but the fact that you have so little cash to go around makes it painful to do. All in all I hope someone addresses these issues, as a few minor tweaks could boost this game from a 7/10 to a 9/10 easily.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=1636709">Expand</a></span>

I do wish the game was $30 and kept the same features from Warband and added their new features. It seemed they added cool features and left out others that made Warband an epic game. Don&apos;t get me wrong, its certainly a good buy for $15, it&apos;s just i would have been willing to pay more if it was complete.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=1626922">Expand</a></span>

I am not quite sure what to make of it.  I am very pleased that the AI is better. But many aspects of the original which I liked dont seem to be there.  I like it alot but its not a natural progression of the series, just more of the same and in some ways a bit less of what I liked.  I just cant quite work out the thinking behind this one.   Wasnt really worth buying as I own the other 2 but nevermind. Hopefully the money will be used to fund development of a Mount and Blade 2. With better graphics, bigger battles, more control and lands etc etc etc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=1621371">Expand</a></span>

This game is cheep defiantly  worth it and by the way the graphics are slightly better enjoy XD</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=1848116">Expand</a></span>

The most obvious changes are the replacement of crossbows with firearms, a new map and the 16th/17th century setting. This is the time that warfare gradually changed from melee based to firearm based.
<br>(A side note: the setting actually mixes aspects of the 16 century setting with that of the 17th century. The halbediers belong more to the former century and the musketeers/cavalry more to the latter.)
<br>There some other changes. There seem to be more quests and the recruitment system has been overhauled. However, at the core the game is the same and as such has the same problems as the old game, such as a rudimentary battlefield mechanism, a nonexistent storyline, a simplistic dialogue tree, superficial boring personalities and tedious repetitive battles of which there are way too many. And these problems are now compounded by the introduction of firearms.
<br>With muskets you can kill an adversary from the other side of the map and what is more.. he can do the same. In fact the ai is actually better at shooting because it isn&apos;t bothered by the fact that from a distance avatars are so small that you can&apos;t make them out right.
<br>My first half hour was spend being shot to pieces. The only way to escape that fate is by moving in an unpredictable pattern so the enemy can&apos;t take aim properly. In the meantime you either have to try and kill them with your own firearm(while moving about in a random way!) or with your sidearm. Battles turn therefore into protracted hit and run activities in which standing still is an invite to be killed on the spot.
<br>The militia that you can recruit at the start is woefully inept to deal with anything better than looters and once you have enough of them to actually have a chance to win a fight, your army is so slow that you can&apos;t catch deserters, brigands and such because they are faster than you. So you either have to fight enemies who are superior to your inept troops.. or hope to corner a band of ruffians,which involves you in chasing them across the map hoping you won&apos;t loose sight of them when the night sets in or when they run into a wooded area.
<br>In fact the best thing to do is not to recruit any militia or infantry but to go from town to town to find and hire mercenary cavalry or heroes so you can overtake your enemies or have a chance to runaway from them when they are too strong.
<br>In any event the game seems to promise to become a protracted boring game, like the basic game was, but now you can use firearms and play on a map that represents eastern europe.
<br>The game is neither a good role play game nor a good wargame, because it doesn&apos;t implement either aspect well and it amazes me that people actually consider this game to be good.
<br>But I guess tastes differ..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=4636344">Expand</a></span>

The original Mount and Blade was already half baked when it came out, Warband added new features with multiplayer capability, but this MBFS tries to revamp warband only to make us feel like it&apos;s a step back on certain features that made it more popular previously.  The screen shakes as soon as you move away from the playing field on the campaign map, there are less features than it claims to have, certain quests are impossible to complete because for one way or another you simply cannot enter the city/town if you are an enemy to its owner.  There is no option to get around that like trying to enter in the cover of night by climbing the walls or infiltrate its wall by subterfuge means like in warband.  Still, the restrictions does not take away the element of fun with the introduction of gunfire and new units to the scene.  The gameplay is certainly more appealing to more hardened gamers with its higher difficulty bar as without a good doc in your party you&apos;ll soon find out that there&apos;s no one left in your &quot;warband&quot;.  This requires more cunning and smarter planning on your part for the build up of your reign anyway.  Overall, I&apos;d give it a 7.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=1612333">Expand</a></span>

Warband had A LOT of potential, many things could&apos;ve been added additionally to that type of game (and the map)... Bandit chasing/killing could&apos;ve been improved and expanded on.... more quests could&apos;ve been added.... the romance/dating options expanded.... etc....  This is what people expected with the next Mount and Blade game... instead they backtracked and gutted it all out, focused on &apos;guns&apos; and new multiple tiers of junk gear and loot with mostly all COSMETIC features.  The 17th Century theme of the game is fun to play and the new clothes and whatnot look snazzy... the guns and bombs can be fun, but without these loved aspects of the game that MADE, Mount and Blade, what is it?   No character customization at the beginning or self-created story... you get a premade character to start with... which is acceptable (but why?) and the FOCUS seems to be trying to inject you into Feudal Combat or &quot;Vassalage&quot; as soon as possible.  It seems to be the main focus, as other aspects of what it&apos;s predecessor was, aren&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=2228141">Expand</a></span>

This forces the player to have a nice army composition, and plan out how to defeat the enemy.    Castle and city Sieges/Defenses have been revolutionized. Players now have a wide range of actions he/she can do in order to capture a city they can bribe the guards to gain control of the gates, poison the water supply, blow a hole in the walls, and other particular actions. yet despite these advantages combat will mostly favor the defender as the range damage would instantly kill any heavily armored unit.   The political intrigue of 17th century Eastern Europe provides a unique and interesting back story to players who read the Fire and Sword series, and the general historical events will enjoy trying to recreating history and appreciate the unique &quot;What if&quot; scenarios that the game creates.    The only downside of the game that i am experiencing is difficulty curve when fighting range units, as a well placed musket shot can and will knock you out instantly in the beginning of the game, money &quot;Talents&quot; are much harder to get then the previous games, players will have to take on more quests and side jobs in order to pay for their armies, as Tournaments no longer exist (or i have yet to discover them). Armies are also harder to recruit, as the player can only recruit mercenaries via Taverns, and Mercenaries camps until they join a particular fraction. then they can recruit units traditionally, which is more historically accurate.    Aside from That, I would recommend this to fans of previous games and those that are interested in 17th century eastern Europe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=1605284">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t get me wrong they implemented the gun feature well and they are super effective... but are they too effective? To me it seems as though its caused an imbalance and it makes the game much harder as they do super effective damage (compared to archery) and  are more direct and accurate. There are a few other problems with it, but what I&apos;ve described is my main concern.

This game (and the series) is a MUST HAVE game for any one that likes to see armies clash against each other with whatever weapons they got, this time with GUNS! and the best part, you get to be actually be inside the battle unlike the Total War series. Unfortunatly, the Visuals still will not impress anyone and a small percentage of players may notice there are some parts in the battlefield that looks slightly inferior then Warband which is never a good. But to be honest, you&apos;ll be so addicted and som immersed to this game you would&apos;nt even notice. The gameplay itself is fairly the same as Warband though will the introduction of Muskets and pistols, you&apos;re strategy and the way you think will differ; both good and bad. The negative side about having guns is it can be quite boring sense it takes very long to reload. And unlike Warband, the player cannot charge into a rank of enemies and hack n&apos; slash, killing 20 people all because a volley of Musket fire will devastate you. The positive side however is it gives a bit more diversity to the game and can make it very enjoyable once you have mastered the aiming of the Musket.
<br>The multiplayer is also very enjoyable. The feeling of being in the midst of a 50-man line all firing muskets simultaneously is just plain epic, no exaggeration there are all. Basic modifications of Trades, Recruitment etc has also made the game less complicated and awkward. Overall I give this wonderful game a 9/10. It is truely awesome and I recommend this game to anyone that is big into massive armies, medieval history or just want a faster-paced Total War game. +Addictive campaign
<br>+Great Multiplayer
<br>+Less-awkward management
<br>-Guns prevents you from being a &apos;hero&apos;
<br>-Outdated graphics</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=1693671">Expand</a></span>

You can buy stuff for your soldier as for example better weapons and armors, which is a pretty good idea. However i&apos;d like a combination of recruitment and buying gear for your army. The new guns are nice, but i see the bombs / grenades as a joke.

I do like that the game kinda leans you toward a direction to go story wise, but still gives you the option of total sandbox. I love the inclusion of guns into the game, and leveling up your character to be good with firearms is just as exciting as doing it with swords and bows. Firearms also changes the entire face of battle, charging into groups will almost always spell death now, and battles take much less time (no more chasing after that guy on a horse with a bow for 15 minutes, just shoot him dead!).<br><br>Cons:<br>The game seems much more difficult for some reason. I&apos;m always strapped for cash, and I can take out these massive loans, but am expected to repay them after a short amount of gameplay (with interest!). I hate that I can&apos;t recruit villagers anymore, you can now micro manage your army&apos;s equipment too, but it&apos;s really kind of overload especially since you have no money ever. I found the only way to really play this game is to take out a huge loan, hire a huge army, and just start raiding villages. It kind of takes away the good guy element that some players probably want to embrace. Ugh and the side quests are horrendous. I was asked to deliver some wine to a village within 7 days, and for some reason that alerts every bandit to your presence. You cant even make it halfway across the map before you are overwhelmed, captured by bandits and have all of your goods (that you&apos;re supposed to deliver) taken from you. I was asked to deliver a majestic horse to a prince or something in some castle. The quest itself had a trigger to have me ambushed and captured and the horse taken from me. Ugh another failed quest -.- and im broke have no weapons no horse no allies no army how can I even recover from this bankruptcy? Finally, got a small army up and received a quest to kill bandits. I was only able to find 3 groups of bandits so i was paid about 120 gold total. not enough to buy even a sh*tty pair of boots.

<br>
<br>I was bit sceptic about this game. Even after buying it on sale, i didnt run it for several days cause i have other games to play. After playing it however i felt in love and got addicted to it - Long time i havent spend whole days and nights with a game and feeling the hunger for more. At begining game might be frustrating, cause it takes day or two to feel the combat mechanics, but after you do that, you will also love this game. Combat system is epic and very skill-rewarding. Mounted combat is just awesome, just grab your sabre, sword, pike, pistol, bow or whatever you like and slash, pierce, chop or shoot your way trough enemies in game up to 64 players (not including troops players command in &quot;captain&quot; game modes).
<br>
<br>Gunpowder weapons adds to the athmoshpere covering battlefields with smoke. They are not very accurate tho and takes some time to reload.
<br>
<br>Melee combat is awesome. Its all about 3-4 directions of swings/thrusts and 4 direction parries + optional shield block. Very easy to learn, but hard to master. For example when you see enemy player raising weapon left, you can parry left, and the fencing begins :) If only parries-counterattacks and kick ability would be more rewarding in foot, melee combat i would give this game 10.
<br>
<br>I also expected some mediocre graphics at best and i was positively suprised. Game looks great. Animations are fluid. Seems they made them all with motion capture system so they are very natural. Also there is a ragdoll system which adds to the satisfaction when you put someone else&apos;s horse on your pike or slash a throat of enemy while galloping on your horse and then see him falling from his horse spouting blood.
<br>
<br>If you like skill-based, fast-paced multiplayer combat with mounts, swords and guns you must definitely try this game, you wont regret.  So far i have had much more fun from this game than from any 50-Euro-League&apos;s games. And i have played a lot.
<br>
<br>p.s.
<br>There is also co-op mode. I have seen plenty of servers running &quot;Captain Co-op&quot; where players build their squads and command them, defending against waves of AI controlled armies.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=1705687">Expand</a></span>

Not great but enjoyable, especially for a historical fan. The development team for the original Mount and Blade game was insanely small and even though it has grown the Fire and Sword team kept close to the original&apos;s roots, therefore the game lacks new-age graphics, voice acting, and complex writing and stories while it does offer unique game play and innovative concepts. It does have a competent RPG systems, the most realistic first-person combat system for a medieval hack and slash, and a huge world. Unlike the previous two games Fire and Sword is in a historical setting, during the Northern Wars and it places the player in the middle of the conflict between the great Eastern Powers as they struggle for dominance over one another. Gunpowder weapons are the new big thing and they are very accurately depicted, slow to reload and unable to hit the broad-side of a barn. So the combat has slowed down a little but again, this is pretty damn close to how actual 17th century battles went. It forces the player to make tactical changes and spend more time leading troops as opposed to fighting and to the game&apos;s credit the AI system isn&apos;t too bad. Your troops listen to your commands and try to kill who they&apos;re supposed to and the opposition will try to defend key positions force you from your defensible positions. If there is an enemy commander they will get even more intelligent and make tactical decisions. That said there isn&apos;t much strategy besides that, artillery is non-existent and devastating historical tactics like flanking or Pike and Shot formations don&apos;t seem to make much of a difference.<br><br>The missions are repetitive and boring, however they are the best way to level up and get money, and you will need that money and lots of it. The game&apos;s biggest fault is making you trek across the map several times to level up, doing the same 5 things. The interface leaves a lot to be desired, information is not readily available and difficult to come by. NPCs are difficult to find and sometimes offer annoyingly difficult quests while giving very little time to complete, this is made more annoying by the repetitive text and bad conversation interface. Oh and they will always offer the same 5 quests. But as the game progresses it gets easier and more exciting and it eventually progresses into a city-building sim. This is perhaps the most enjoyable part of the game and it is the only way get the best gear and soldiers but costs an insane amount of money which you will have to acquire through the repetitive quest grind.<br><br>My biggest complaint: AUTOSAVE???? Where the hell is it? There is nothing more annoying than spending 3 hours grinding money, spending tons of cash on the best gear and training for your units, going into battle, getting one-shotted by a marksman from the other side of the map, and having your expensive soldiers die without you, and then having all your stuff taken. I think the Steam record of how much I have played could be half that if you subtract the hours I have wasted by forgetting to save.<br><br>All in all it&apos;s a good game that is let down by the lack of resources in the development phase and poor interface choices. If you enjoyed the previous Mount and Blade games then you will probably like this one but if you are new to the genre you will have a hard time getting into it and an even harder time succeeding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=2129570">Expand</a></span>

Unlike the first game, they had noticably chopped out everything that answered to generate your character. You were simply given a rifle, and an axe. That&apos;s it. Let&apos;s ignore the fact i&apos;ve placed all my skills in Bows + Arrows. Oh well, looks avoidable, so i&apos;ll go buy a bow. No, looks like it&apos;s ridiculously out of budget. Another massive failing in this game is the effort and time it requires to make the smallest amounts of money. This means that all the other aspects of the game are held up, becuase they all hinge on you having the money to buy men, or to buy supplies, etc. etc. It was just, really, really stupid and I expected so much better from the creators of Warband.<br>(And all of this is while playing on easy difficulty, I dread to think what sort of lengths you have to on harder settings.)<br><br>To be honest, I hated it. I really did. I recomend Warband over this any day. I rated it a 2 becuase i&apos;m sure it&apos;s possible the multiplayer could be enjoyable, but the campaign is just appalling.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=1607161">Expand</a></span>

While a very unique game concept and a very original idea that is few and far in the industry nowadays. The game suffers from poor execution and design. Like the Mona Lisa, but giving it to a three year old to go ahead and paint it. The combat controls are insufferable and the so called steep learning curve is just poor design decisions that makes you reload, again and again. This latest iteration introduces firearms. Look we all know if someone shoots you in the face, you&apos;re not getting up in Real Life. But this translates poorly to a game. When your &apos;hero&apos; is shot, the battle is pretty much over, since it&apos;s usually an auto loss when your hero goes down. Since tactical combat is a joke, combat is a series of endless reloads and an exercise in frustration. There are of course players who are into this sort of thing, and if you&apos;re one of them, this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=1737011">Expand</a></span>

Now I like Strategy, RPG and 4x games as much as the next person, and plan to make my own one day (hence the purchase), but right from the start, this game is so unpolished, and the graphics are so bad that it really puts me off. But despite this I struggle through to find the good Sandbox Strategy gameplay that I&apos;ve heard about..
<br>I enter a battle and can either look for them or run away cause enemies are miles away (but somehow upon leaving I still must surrender to them???); so I re-enter and eventually find them. I gallop towards them firing off one arrow then my crossbow stops working - literally nothing is happening when I&apos;m pressing fire (the arrow hits the ground several meters below the targeting reticule anyway), so I run them down with my horse which does 0 damage, and they beat the crap out of me, meanwhile I&apos;m trying desperately to turn my horse or run through them; anything (nothing is happening of course as the controls are unresponsive to say the least). I die and immediately uninstall the game.
<br>
<br>The game is beyond poor.
<br>
<br>Ignoring the poor graphics, abysmal animation, terrible controls, and complete lack of a decent tutorial, underneath it all.. the game is just plain bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=2557970">Expand</a></span>

Options have been removed, the whole graphic interface hasn&apos;t improved at all, less depth to character design and the storyline feels weak.<br>It&apos;s like someone said, &quot;Hey this game worked really well, how fast can we get something else out&quot;, shame on you Paradox, this is not what I expect from your label, you guys are about developing improvements and depth to your games.

However, in it&apos;s attempt, it ends up ruining some of the things that made the original and Warband unique. WF&amp;S implements firearms and grenades/bombs, these being extremely powerful items, usually one-hit kills. However, you are not the only person who is able to use them. Because of that, you can no longer charge forward into battles with your men, as one or two shots will take you down. That ruins some of the excitement from the massive battles experience in Warbands, and forces the game to take on a more tactical approach to combat. But don&apos;t think that means you can shoot your way through everyone- the reload times can take up to ten seconds for a single bullet shot, but it can save your life in a combat situation. The game also manages to perk up the multiplayer, reducing respawn time to a mere five seconds or so and giving better battlefields. But WF&amp;S drops quite a few things. These are like the options to get married, to recruit from villages, or even to make your main character female. Even worse, the game drops tournaments entirely, removing a massive source of revenue from Warband (In Warband a player could easily make 10-12 thousand denars from a tournament.). Overall, Mount &amp; Blade: With Fire &amp; Sword tries to take the series a step further, but only takes it a step back. For M&amp;B fans, sticking with Warband is a much better option, even if this game carries a mere 15 dollar price tag.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=1615048">Expand</a></span>

The single player mode is extremely imbalanced; for example as a brand new character having completed a couple quests, on my way between cities I am often pounced upon by bands of Brigands or Raiders or Deserters who are far superior in number and my only choice is to fight and lose or give up my belongings. The Multiplayer seemed buggy, with that familiar-but-clunky combat working ok for Melee but for ranged combat the bows seemed far superior to guns because of the absurd reload time (which I realize is realistic, but come on - who bought this game to use bows?). The bugginess seemed to be in hits and blocks not registering even if it seemed like you timed them perfectly... perhaps that can be fixed later with patches, but for now I regret the purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=1606113">Expand</a></span>

(If it matters that much, you could download a mod anyway) The biggest issue I had with  Fire &amp; Sword was the map. It&apos;s all one giant grassy plain with some forests here and there. This might not matter to most, but I found it completely dull when compared to Warband&apos;s world, with deserts, mountains, and icy plains. Yeah, it doesn&apos;t sound that impressive but it worked. The world actually felt big, and it helped show where factions started and how they&apos;ve grown, or lost territory. Now that aside, Fire &amp; Sword is not bad. My recommendation, is just pay the extra $10 for Warband. (By the way, on steam, Fire &amp; Sword (2011) is now cheaper than the original Mount &amp; Blade from 2008 XD)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=1691385">Expand</a></span>

Because of the fact that this more or less than MB:Warband with them combining most of the mods and just put in an average title. So if you think you want buy this game then i ask you to think about this and other of the negative reviews. So if you want to buy it then don&apos;t just grab Warband and and install the latest firearms mod.</span>

I seen WFS for sale @ $15, and figured, what the heck, cant hurt. i played it and just got done playing it and though i cant say im crazy about it, i can say it is awesome for a $15 stand alone add on- which means you dont have to buy warband (a $30  game) so for all of the idiots comparing it-dont. and even at that the idiot below complaining about how it is too hard to make money, there is a million and one ways to make a few bucks. you can become a merchant and send caravans (an awesome bonus feature not in warband) that do not get attacked. you may be crying about how you lost money on a caravan- you lazy bastard, send it to moscow. the farther you send it, generally, the more moneyyou make. and you could even start with $200 (which can be made in 5 minutes)- go buy silk for $120 and flip it for $1200. i especially like how i can buy hundreds of troops at a time, which takes the annoying part out of training troops- in warband you had to go, city by city, collecting 3 or 4 men at a time, around your whole country. one thing i will say though is that it is laggy on a slow processor (requires 2.1ghz) but it runs fine on my 2.0ghz laptop. all in all- good game, cheap price, go for it : )</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=1655962">Expand</a></span>

The tutorial isnt well made and doesnt inform you well on the differences between mercenaries from the tavern, mercenaries on the world map, and regular units you later find in cities or stronghold.

At first, I had bought this game, along with the entire series, and at first thought, thought that With Fire and Sword was the worst of the series. However, the one day I actually downloaded and played it, I had a blast  literally! With Fire and Sword isn&apos;t the best of the series, but not by far. With Fire and Sword dominates Skirmish combat, making the player plan out a strategy, instead of just charging straight-on like the player might have done in Warband. If the player would charge, he or she would be shot down and end up losing men. Here you could take your cavalry and flank the enemy while the player&apos;s main forces are in a gunfight. However, I feel that fortress combat lacks heavily, and is in DESPERATE need of improvement.  In fortress combat, you don&apos;t have full access to your structure and you can&apos;t attack from all sides. The storyline itself is intense, good minor history lesson to those who know nothing of 17th century Poland. Lastly, this game has so many minor improvements that could make Warband a better game, and so many minor improvements from Warband were left out. So, both Warband and With Fire and Sword feel incomplete to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=2977913">Expand</a></span>

Of course, it&apos;s hardly the only new feature. An entirely new landmass, set of factions, and weaponry are welcome additions, but With Fire &amp; Sword adds nothing substantial to the overall Mount &amp; Blade experience, which is to say is still a good thing since the core mechanics that made this series addicting are still here in abundance.
<br>
<br>The Mount &amp; Blade series were never known for story or technical prowess and it never pretended to be, but anybody hoping for this one to break the mold will find little improvements, if any at all. Running on the same engine, With Fire &amp; Sword&apos;s technical strength is catering the massive battles, but everything else ranging from models to effects to texture work are all still very poor. Even the land map looks decidedly worse, and the shift to real world countries as factions ensure that the diverse locations you could explore are now limited, since the developers attempted to keep it as realistic as possible. The game this time around attempts to invest player in several plots (depending on your faction) that try their hand in a story, but the lifeless characters and general boringness of it keeps a decent story miles away.
<br>
<br>With Fire &amp; Sword carries the same excellence in emulating large scale warfare, often with lines of footmen clashing with cavalry breaking lines. The addition of firearms gives you more strategy, allowing you to formulate lines of muskets to suppress enemy lines, and given that they can also be wildly inaccurate, firearms can&apos;t always be relied on. Other than that, the way combat is handled by way of momentum and direction of attack is still highly entertaining and landing blows on horseback is oddly cathartic. Outside of combat, you take on quests ranging from caravan escort to total conquest. The latter is much more fun given that conquest in this game is a great challenge and somewhat of a grind. You are able to affect your relationships from companions to towns to full blown kingdoms, most of which boil down to whether or not you were a jerk to them. The factions, while not as interesting as the diverse set found in Warband, give you enough reason to side with them if you know your European history. The most impressive feat of the overall amalgamation of the mechanics means that no two players game worlds will ever be the same. It&apos;s closer to a simulation than anything else, with so many moving pieces that while visually absent, convey that this is a real world that has some place, and that I believe is this series high point.
<br>
<br>With Fire &amp; Sword isn&apos;t charged for much, so the few additions aren&apos;t as difficult to swallow. The mechanics that made this game grindy fun still exist, and are bound to soak up some serious hours. Don&apos;t expect much from this entry in terms of taking the next step, but rather riding the success of strong mechanics and features.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=7176387">Expand</a></span>

You can befriend a faction or even joining it by helping its men in battle, or anger a faction by attacking its men. In all, how to play the game is absolutely your choice. However, the only problem (so far as I&apos;ve only played for hours) is that leveling up is too slow. If you are fine with cheats, it won&apos;t be a problem for you, but I&apos;m not, so I&apos;m kinda losing enthusiasm. Maybe it&apos;s not a game that I should spend ten hours in one day to get a lot of achievements. But anyway, I like this game, I&apos;m enjoying it, and I think I&apos;ll spend some time on it every day.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-with-fire-sword/user-reviews?user_review_id=3248104">Expand</a></span>

And the single player game is great. The game&apos;s historical setting is very realistic. There are many features that I like from this sequel. But there are many bugs that are very annoying. And there isn&apos;t much plot in the game. I really hope TaleWorlds will fix this bug.</span>

                                        <span>The game is fantastic. The fighting mechanics are second to none, and the gunplay is very well integrated,  which adds another layer of challenge to combat. The campaign map is pretty much the same as Warband, except of course it depicts real locations. The quest lines are interesting, although still a bit bugged. If you love Warband and are looking for a similar experience, this game is for you.</span>
