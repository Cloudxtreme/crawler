While the comparisons are too obvious to ignore, Magrunner offers it&apos;s own unique take on the genre.  If you are a fan of Portal, this is a reasonably priced game that will feel familiar enough, but give new challenges.</span>

Throughout the 2/3 of the game, the puzzles were surprisingly easy to figure out, with the learning curve gradually increasing. However, the last 1/3 is borderline frustrating and annoying sometimes: the difficulty jumps suddenly, and I died at least 100 times on the very same spot; bye bye no-death achievements. Another minor problem is that you can&apos;t jump while holding a large cube: which mechanically comes into play on 1-2 stages, but otherwise, too limiting. I haven&apos;t encountered any major bugs, but certain physics puzzles seem to react strangely on my ATI card (game uses PhysX). In addition, I think two of achievements are bugged, since I received them even by clearly violating the conditions. In summary, it&apos;s quite a refreshing game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magrunner-dark-pulse/user-reviews?user_review_id=3237314">Expand</a></span>

Who has fun trying to solve a puzzle, making one mis-click, and having to jump down a platform and slooooowly inch it back up the wall with the really annoying dog-magnet over and over and over until it finally does what you wanted?  The later puzzles can only be solved one VERY specific way, and despite all the game physics allowing what should be multiple solutions, they just don&apos;t work right when they want to force the one solution.  The puzzles get harder in the worst ways possible, like &quot;oh you have to look in this particular direction standing in the corner where you have no reason to be anyway to see the only solution&quot; or &quot;good luck trying to fling yourself over this set of specific jumps while an unkillablle monster chases you&quot;, or my personal un-favorite &quot;yeah we filled this level with auto-deaths and you don&apos;t get a checkpoint cause you explored too soon and wasted it, so have fun doing it 30 times&quot;.  Also, no game should make you spend a few minutes trying to figure out how to push a button you know you have to push for some reason, only to spend even more time figuring out what the button did since the game gives you no indication whatsoever.

<br>The art work is great but the story is mediocre so far but I have yet to complete the game. The addition of the C&apos;thulu mythos is an interesting twist. Voice acting is okay and the music is decent. All in all its pleasant distraction but not a must own type of game but I must say that the puzzles ARE NOT easy. The game really picks up near the end where the creatures are present and the story gets better. The ending is well done. Regardless its worth the money ($15 on sale and $20 at release) and the time to invest. Some of the puzzles are real head scratchers...
<br>
<br>The one downside is that it is short but any longer, IMHO, would have made the game laborious.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magrunner-dark-pulse/user-reviews?user_review_id=3232017">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+ Great-puzzle
<br>+ Cthulhuuuuuu... :-)
<br>+ Rather complicated
<br>+ is cheap   13  Phhh! For this game I could give 25.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Too short</span>

In between levels, you have to wait in this ridiculous staging area where you&apos;re forced to watch holographs that serve as cutscenes  when clearly they could have just had the audio running in the background while you solved the puzzles.
<br>
<br>Pros include good graphics and a slightly engaging story.  The puzzles are very well conceived and very challenging; you may need a tutorial video or two to get through the whole game.
<br>
<br>Cons include framerate drops, a failure to understand that in physics opposites attract (in the game, it&apos;s the opposite), a really bent and absurd storyline, and painfully-long and cruel load times.
<br>
<br>I couldn&apos;t get over the failure of physics and the poor programming.  For me, this one was a pass.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magrunner-dark-pulse/user-reviews?user_review_id=3234641">Expand</a></span>

<br>Game mechanics are really interesting, except for physics-nazis who will claim that opposites attracts (that would have ruined half the mechanics of the game)
<br>Level design is really good too, and I never felt like &quot;oh it&apos;s the same mechanics as in one of the previous rooms, let&apos;s do the same thing&quot;.
<br>Graphics are pretty good (I love cthulhu  and I only saw 1 display bug on the last levels
<br>I&apos;d say you&apos;ll need 10 to 12 hours to finish the game, it&apos;s more than honorable for this genre, and excellent for the price !
<br>
<br>Everything isn&apos;t perfect of course, the story is... generic  uninteresting  and characters too (Portal fans, you&apos;ll miss GLaDOS and your companion cube).
<br>
<br>And another negative point  enemies  They&apos;re here to be avoided, to make you run solve the puzzle before they catch you... but they move so slowly that it&apos;s ridiculous !
<br>Not that you can take your time when they&apos;re chasing you, but you won&apos;t feel like you&apos;re chased by monsters, it&apos;s more like being chased by turtles... as timings are correct, I&apos;d blame the animations for that feeling.
<br>
<br>In the end I&apos;d say it&apos;s a great game, that deserves more than it&apos;s price. Unfortunately, its generic storyline/characters will make it forgettable once you&apos;ve finished it.
<br>
<br>PS: Developers are talking about opening the level editor, that would indeed be nice, because currently you can uninstall the game immediately after finishing it...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magrunner-dark-pulse/user-reviews?user_review_id=3239972">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a series of puzzles in fancy rooms and it&apos;s tempting to compare it to the Valve game Portal. While the Portal concept can&apos;t be beat, I hoped that Magrunner would have some fresh ideas, and I it does have a couple, although it&apos;s not the best puzzle game around. But when you add its odd storyline, as a whole I found the game to be rather incoherent. The puzzles seem to have nothing to do with the storyline that emerges; it&apos;s hard to imagine any explanation for the existence of the puzzles you have to complete. I was disappointed by the ending, because it really explains nothing about what was happening throughout the game. But at least the environment and atmosphere were kind of neat (apart from some irritating and inappropriate &quot;music&quot; I felt forced to turn off in a couple of areas). The FOV can be changed, yay for that. I do recommend this game if the price tag isn&apos;t too high.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magrunner-dark-pulse/user-reviews?user_review_id=4518898">Expand</a></span>

<br>The magnet interactions were a nice change from the portals or the stuff you found in Quantum Conundrum. In a way, Magrunner is still different from all the others. It is no masterpiece but it is definitely a good puzzle game. Enemies will also come in some levels to put you some pressure, and the puzzles change enough to keep you interested. The story though (if there is one) is what it is....but better than nothing I guess, and the game has still atmosphere and is polished enough to be enjoyed. 12 Hours to play everything and get every trophy. Get this cheap and go past the beginning that looks a bit lame. 72/100</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magrunner-dark-pulse/user-reviews?user_review_id=4429979">Expand</a></span>

<br>As in so many coattails riding titles, your brain won&apos;t break a sweat. All you need is jumping patience.

Not only aren&apos;t the game mechanics as simple and fun, the whole thing just doesn&apos;t flow.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/magrunner-dark-pulse/user-reviews?user_review_id=6656059">Expand</a></span>
