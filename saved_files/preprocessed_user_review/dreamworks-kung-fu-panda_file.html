<br>A decent Tie In
<br>Kung Fu Panda is an adventure platform game based off of the kung Fu panda movie, I haven&#x2019;t seen it so I don&#x2019;t know how well it lines up, it&#x2019;s rare to get a complete story in a tie in game, but going into this game knowing absolutely nothing about the movie, I found the games story to be complete with a satisfying ending,
<br>The actual game is pretty good too, not great, but a little above average.
<br>Every level starts out with jack black setting the tone, and then it goes into a pretty good cut scene with great voice acting, and then you get into the actual game.
<br>This is a beat em up God of War style Adventure game, you go around every level and defeat everything standing in your way.
<br>Combat is fairly simple, and thanks to enemies dropping food frequently, you&#x2019;ll never die in combat&#x2026; its possible, but you just won&#x2019;t. All levels feel different and all contain an optional objective. Sadly completing these optional objectives seem to give no reward, so they are as optional as they come.
<br>There are golden coins though that can be spent on health and combat upgrades.
<br>There are 13 levels in this game, and you&#x2019;ll play as a handful of the different main character about half of these levels contain a boss and aren&#x2019;t exclusive to Po.
<br>The bosses are super simply and vary from doge to quick time event god of war style, or just straight up combat battle.
<br>Levels are also very short.
<br>Not many will take you longer than 10 15 minutes. You can complete this game easily in 2 to 3 hours.
<br>Combat isn&#x2019;t impressive, neither is the length, but they aren&#x2019;t the worst part about this game.
<br>The worst part and also the best part is the platforming.
<br>The 3D platforming sections were easily my favorite part of the games, you&#x2019;ll be hopping in the clouds, across lily pads, swinging from tree branches, but the platforming is insanely stiff ultimately making it feel unsatisfying.
<br>While I can appreciate it being there and what we got is better than nothing, this game would&#x2019;ve been even better in my mind with more fluent controls.
<br>And while you&#x2019;re exploring the levels in Kung Fu panda you can collect these special green coins that unlock multiplayer levels.
<br>The multiplayer isn&#x2019;t the greatest ever, but the option is there for up to 4 players to play a very cheap version of super smash bros.
<br>While Kung Fu Panda won&#x2019;t occupy anyone for too long, the time that you do spend with it, is fun and worthwhile for fans of the movie.
<br>For what it is
