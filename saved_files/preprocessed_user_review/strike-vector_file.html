Take an incredible art style (like Hawken done right) and pair it with blisteringly fast and fun gameplay and you&apos;ve got one hell of a combination. The vectors look and feel amazing and what the weapons lack in originality they make up for in balance and punch. As you may have already been let on by other reviews this game is VERY hard to pick up and play but your patience will be more than rewarded. While I&apos;ve played enough twitch shooters to navigate the maps and avoid incoming fire easily enough I initially simply could not figure out the homing and dismissed it as near-useless. Once I got the hang of it however it became an absolute blast to use and my go-to weapon. It is my conviction that those frustrated by their initial hour or so of constantly crashing and getting instakilled will have a similar experience. So if you love this game from the moment you load it up congratulations on your good taste! And if you don&apos;t, just keep at it, I swear it gets better in a big way.

It will take time and determination to learn how to navigate the new and more than unlikely unnatural control system, but after you learn how to play it becomes a game of fun and fast paced game play. Its biggest issue in my personal opinion is in fact its high start on the difficulty curve, requiring a large amount of diligence before it becomes fun to play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-vector/user-reviews?user_review_id=3947003">Expand</a></span>

It has a feel for speed, and is exhilarating like no other game I&apos;ve played. It does require some perseverence and skill. This is not a game you can simply pick up in 5 minutes. While the controls are easy enough, and well-designed, what makes this game difficult is the sheer sense of speed. Do not be discouraged - it takes time for your brain to adapt to this game, and to be able to interpret all the spatial information that you need to be able to process in order to be able to play this game at maximum speed. Take your time, persevere, and in under 30 minutes, you will be zipping about and getting kills. However, it doesn&apos;t stop there. you&apos;ll have to relentlessly improve. It will take time to get better at this game, but you&apos;ll have a lot of fun doing so.
<br>
<br>All weapons are unlocked when you start. It&apos;s an even playing field. All abilities and bonuses are also unlocked. Again, this is fantastic. The only thing you have to unlock are cosmetic items that change the way your vector (spaceship) looks.
<br>
<br>Finally, the developer has promised that all future content will remain free for everyone who buys the game. This is quite refreshing in a world where many developers shamelessly charge $15 for a map pack.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-vector/user-reviews?user_review_id=4016564">Expand</a></span>

This game is for those with unique tastes, in the sense that it is ALWAYS fast-paced, and you need fast reflexes to stay alive.
<br>
<br>The game consists of a PvP environment in which players fight in one of 4 game modes: Bounty Hunter, Domination, Deathmatch, and Team Deathmatch. Players go into battle with their Vectors, each fully customizable with various color schemes, weapons, abilities, etc. The most unique and important part of this game is the difficult to master but extremely flexible movement system. Part of the time you&apos;re blazing past structures in Jet mode, and the other part of the time you are in a Hover (or Harrier, as it&apos;s called) form. Hover mode is extremely easy to maneuver in close areas, while Jet mode is for chasing others down and getting away from others. The integration of both modes is what makes this game special.
<br>
<br>There is a fairly steep learning curve for some, but I&apos;ve heard others can pick up the game and do well in a few minutes. Even while you&apos;re starting off and you&apos;re...trying to maneuver without crashing, being chased by someone, trying to pick up health at high speeds, or trying to shoot at others, it&apos;s ridiculously fun. Even managing to stay alive has an immensely rewarding feeling to it, as people are constantly shooting everywhere.
<br>
<br>I am aware of the bugs in the game. The developers have been said to be working on ironing out these issues. The tutorial in-game is quite poor (I managed to learn a fair bit of information from people in-game), so I may suggest looking at videos or tutorials online. The menu interface seems put together poorly as well, and I occasionally go on servers I didn&apos;t select because of whatever connection mechanics.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m putting my faith in this game, and this is because I can look past all of the bugs and issues. The core of the game is extremely well-refined, the graphics and sound are excellent, and the system requirements are easy to meet (I could run it on my integrated Intel 4000 Graphics decently, but I&apos;d still recommend having a dedicated video card.). The community has some friendly people in it, even though it&apos;s extremely limited as of right now. If you&apos;re someone like me who can look past the problems and enjoy an FPS like this one in its core, get the game. You will not be unsatisfied.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-vector/user-reviews?user_review_id=3960613">Expand</a></span>

Despite looking very pretty and shiny and having some impressive aircraft customization with weapons and support accessories, the game has very little to it in the way of the gameplay. The control is terrible. By default your craft moves extremely slowly, and if you get your rocket boost activated, you fly out of control and unable to make so much as a slight movement without your craft losing any sense of direction.
<br>
<br>The single player missions consist of poorly constructed challenges where your sole job is to fly through hoops and occasionally shoot at something that doesn&apos;t shoot back at you, all this happening under a strict time limit. You&apos;re not given any sort of tutorials on customizing your craft. You&apos;re just thrown into a hangar area with a bunch of weapons and support equipment without any idea what each of them does and in which situations they come useful. The game also has a multiplayer, with almost nobody on the servers, but presence of multiplayer is not an excuse. If the game is going to have single player missions, they should be interesting and good, and not only added as an afterthought.
<br>
<br>I didn&apos;t enjoy the music either and found its grungy rock riffs quite jarring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-vector/user-reviews?user_review_id=5239240">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There is simply no arcade style flying blast fest like it and despite its steep learning curve, the finer points of BATTEL are so well refined that it could be a professional competition. The top of the curve is HIGH. It&apos;s awesome to watch new players go from wet paper bags, over time, to mass murdering samurai.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s easy to fly, easy to kill but even easier to die. To do those gracefully is really, really hard but infinitely satisfying when you can head fake a great pilot into the exact position you need to melt his face with some well placed rockets. And it all happens in split seconds.
<br>
<br>I like that the arcade emphasis is on killing and totally ignores dying. It tracks crashing, but no one gives a damn. This would&apos;ve been an amazing 4 player quarter muncher back in the early 90&apos;s, especially if it had Afterburner II style cockpits to shake you around in. Only con is a small but tightly knit and cool player base for an arena game. Maybe another is the general lack of team tactics but that&apos;s a player thing. Can&apos;t fault the game for it. The potential is there.
<br>
<br>Hands down one of my favorites if not number 1 and I&apos;ve put around 200 hours into it. It&apos;s just that much teeth grinding fun. Weak pansies, man up and blast through the skies to die.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strike-vector/user-reviews?user_review_id=4277234">Expand</a></span>
