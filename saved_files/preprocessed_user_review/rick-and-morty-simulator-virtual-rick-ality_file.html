I would dare to say its absolute must play as you will get to interact with many familiar things and you will have several moments when you will be in awe how awesome it is you get to experience Rick &amp; Morty world from first person view. And you will have also many laughs, of course.
<br>
<br>That being said, its a 2 hour long experience, where you mostly stand in a garage and you realy dont go on an adventure or anything remotely feeling like true Rick &amp; Morty episode adventure. There are small hints of that, but they are too short and too little.
<br>
<br>The price point is flat out greedy at $30 and developers know they can charge it only because its Rick &amp; Morty. Which is fine i guess, but at $20 it would be fair price. $30 is just too much.
<br>
<br>So should you buy it ? if you love Rick &amp; Morty and you dont care you will spend $30 for the 2 hours experience, absolutely. There is some amazing stuff in the game. If you care about the price point and you care about value for money, then no. Its not good value for money. There is little to no replay value, even tho the game tries to have some.
<br>One more thing to consider tho, is the fact that the VR experiences must be pricey because there is not huge audience and if we want polished and fun experiences like these, we must support the developers. So if you think about it this way as also supporting development of better VR experiences instead of just value for money, then you should buy it. ( But $30 is still greedy ).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rick-and-morty-simulator-virtual-rick-ality/user-reviews?user_review_id=7257926">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>75 minutes for &#xA3;22, sorry but that&apos;s just not good value.
<br>
<br>Sure I could play it more, find all the cassettes, mess around, but I found and listened to 5 of them in that same time and just feel really deflated by the whole experience.
<br>
<br>With a show that really goes all out on other planets and expeditions, that&apos;s what I expected, but no, your stuck in the garage (more or less, 3 tiny excursions) for an hour and a half and it&apos;s over.
<br>
<br>Tempted to refund it, as much as I enjoyed what was there, it&apos;s not worth that money, wait for a DEEP sale!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rick-and-morty-simulator-virtual-rick-ality/user-reviews?user_review_id=7254986">Expand</a></span>

The TV show&apos;s dark sense of humor does successfully transfer over into this VR experience however you need to be a fan of the TV show to truly appreciate it.  The tried and true VR mini-game mechanics are put to good use but this also leaves the title feeling similar to every other VR mini-game or demo. The  game is limited to puzzles, shooting galleries and exploration. VR gamers seeking a more robust experience will be let down.   Nonetheless this is a polished VR experience and successful adaptation of the TV show. At $30 and with only 2 to 3 hours of content it&apos;s a tough title to recommend to anyone other than VR enthusiasts or Rick and Morty super fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rick-and-morty-simulator-virtual-rick-ality/user-reviews?user_review_id=7303472">Expand</a></span>
