Finally Codemasters got it right after 6 editions of fans repeatedly asking for certain features and mechanics in the series.  This game offers an enjoyable challenge to racing game enthusiasts and hardcore sim fans alike. It does an admirable job of reproducing the atmosphere of the real Formula 1, and is actually fun and rewarding to play seriously.  I found that with the career mode AI difficulty set to Expert and my control scheme set to Elite, the game was a good challenge without being infuriating and without dominating each race  This game is well worth a look for those F1 fans who&apos;ve been burnt by previous versions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/f1-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=6672558">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Combining driver aids with opponent difficulty gives a wide range of options that should open this game up to all gamers.  From an arcade game with no damage and unlimited rewinds to full length races more akin to a simulator, you can set things up to suit you.
<br>
<br>The complexities of F1 are all present, but done in a way that is fairly intuitive and easy to understand.  Strategy becomes much more important than in previous versions, and as a result it adds layers of enjoyment to racing.  The monotony of grinding out laps is broken by the decision making you need to have the right strategy to maximize your finish.
<br>
<br>Presentation is one of the major successes in this game for me.  The feeling of F1 is all around you, and it enhances the experience immensely.  Graphics look very good on my system, although I have had some FPS problems which I hope will be solved with better optimization down the road.
<br>
<br>VR support is the only thing missing from this title in my opinion.
<br>
<br>Overall, great game.  A lot of fun to play and great to look at.  The depth of career mode is going to keep me hooked for a while.  I was skeptical about this release after years of being disappointed, but this version is the best one yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/f1-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=6651678">Expand</a></span>

After being disappointed by F1 2015 as it didn&apos;t allow for multiple USB controllers (so separate wheel and pedals) I was hoping that 2016 wouldn&apos;t have any stupid issues like that - and I was disappointed.  While you can now use separate devices the textures and anti-aliasing is AWFUL on triple monitor setups. When playing in something like 5760x1080 things look horrible and I mean horrible.  Everything is extremely blocky and pixelated, sadly it seems that the issue persists with all multi-monitor setups.  It&apos;s like they never even tested it - which is insane as many hardcore sim racers, like me, have triple monitor setups.  If it&apos;s not going to support VR it has to support 3 screens so once again I had to hit the refund button on a Codemasters game.
<br>
<br>From what I was able to play it does seem like a nice improvement in game mechanics over previous titles making it all the worse that I couldn&apos;t play it.  So I wanted to be fair with a 5 as the problem is specific to my setup and to anyone running 3 screens.  If you want a good F1 fix with 3 screens or VR either iRacing, Assetto Corsa or Project Cars will scratch that itch nicely.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/f1-2016/user-reviews?user_review_id=6769037">Expand</a></span>
