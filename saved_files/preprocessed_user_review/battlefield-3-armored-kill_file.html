                                        <span>In Battlefield I love using tanks on maps such as Caspain Border, I expected this to be fun as such and it just wasn&apos;t. What a complete let down and waste of money, the maps are absolutely terrible. If you love Battlefield tanking I would avoid the expansion and instead play normal maps with tanks on, because it&apos;s a lot more fun than what this expansion offers.</span>

BF3 brings it all back, although, if anything the maps still feel too small.  How about a jet only map similar to Coral Sea and really expand the fighting area.  I love the fact that uncap areas are off limits.  My only gripe is that the AA/Tunguska is no where to be found in most games.  It spawns, but it&apos;s either the favorite target of everyone or I just cannot ever find except when I&apos;m in a jet of course.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll admit, my skill in this game is terrible.  And yet, one game I&apos;ll be in the top 3, the next dead last.  Balancing the game is more important in this DLC with teams.  It really is evidenced when you are at a flag in one tank and the rest of your team is  AFK, charging off alone in random jeeps, or waiting for the helicopter/jet.  Meanwhile, I&apos;m a sitting duck for the coordinated tank army fast approaching.  And the AC-130, I love it.  I hate it when I get shot capping a flag, but it adds an element that is super fresh and fun.  I find myself only joining servers with this DLC or have this DLC in constant rotation.  I have no major complaints.  If anything it is still too small.  This is coming from someone who plays flight simulators (ironic that I would play arcade); if anything I would like to see double or triple the size.  Have us in what they call a furball with guns blazing, missles flying, and even have crazy stuff like battleships with AA, emulate real Tunguskas, and dare I say terrifying things like S300s.  Bring in things like flying under the radar, loft bombing, and other cool things.  Keep it arcade, but add in more elements and bigger areas so I do not feel like my role is to do 8G turns the whole time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battlefield-3-armored-kill/user-reviews?user_review_id=2683709">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This DLC is what Battlefield 3 should be from the VERY FIRST DAY, new maps are simply BEAUTIFUL on a strong PC. This is the most beautiful multiplayer i have EVER played. Also gameplay is amazing on a new maps. I must admit that new vehicles type dosen&apos;t bring much new into the game, but that&apos;s it, all the rest is Amazing and i think you should go out and buy it NOW.</span>
