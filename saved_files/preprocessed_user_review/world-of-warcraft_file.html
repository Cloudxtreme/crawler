Sadly the new expansion &quot;Mists of Pandaria&quot; did not turn out as well as i thought but all the other ones were good and i can&apos;t wait to see what new expansion comes out next! :D</span>

Getting Items was another thing. When I got my first epic item, I was incredibly happy (I still remember which item it was). In newer expansions: Completely unexperienced kids running around in Full Epic because they did a heroic with some other kid who MIGHT had some XP in the game. I even had a full-epic off set from the stupid Triumph badges that dropped from heroics. To sum up, If you feel yourself as a beginner in MMOs, you might wanna try the newer Expansions first, but when you&apos;re tired of the no-challanges, you&apos;ll defineatly wanna try one of the Vanilla Private servers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=1547991">Expand</a></span>

If you end up playing or are playing this game keep in mind that the content is focused on PvE and waste your life away raiding schedules. As for PvP, the game has no real PvP focus, it never has, they just offer it. Regarding the future of this game, it&apos;s already undergoing a slow painful death. If your willing to purchase 100+ dollars in expansions and a subscription on top of that by all means go ahead.

Blizzard has truly ran out of ideas. If it becomes F2P or they remove monthly fee, I might continue playing it. (Yes I have played it!)</span>

Although it is also a fun game, it won&apos;t run smoothy on most modern machines and sticks to heavily to the MMO status quo. I choose WoW over EQ2 and I&apos;ve never looked back. One of the best things about WoW is the philosophy behind the design of the game. The game believes more in rewards than punishment - something 99% of MMOs haven&apos;t learned yet. When you die, you don&apos;t lose experience in WoW. When you go on quests (and there are tons for every character level), you usually get a large experience reward and something extra like special armor, rings, potions, etc. I&apos;m much less frustrated playing this MMO than I was in SWG, EQ2, or even CoH. Because it is so rewarding, it is incredibly fun. And, it doesn&apos;t take a year to get your character to its highest level. But, don&apos;t be misled, just because it is run, has few punishments, and is easy to level doesn&apos;t mean it isn&apos;t challenging and difficult in all the right areas. Give it a try and you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=377551">Expand</a></span>

The graphics, though not the most technically impressive you&apos;ll see, are very well styled and just look great. Finding and forming groups is less necessary, but also more casually and easily done in tihs game than other MMOs I&apos;ve played (EQ1 and FF11). Quests are well designed and worthwhile. Though the race/class choices are somewhat more limited than many other MMOs, meaningful differences between races (including abilities that are specific to certain race/class combos) and the talent system means that you can customize and differentiate your character in interesting ways. Death is handled well, also ... instead of wiping out potentially hours worth of progress, it usually works out to be an inconvenience and minor setback. What keeps me from giving this game a higher score is the fact that, in its CURRENT state, it is a little rough around the edges. Server downtime is relatively high, lag (on their end) occasionally rears its ugly head. The in game mail system, for myself and many others, is broken in such a way that you can&apos;t write messages to other players. Overall, it seems like a great game that can be casually enjoyed, but also enjoyed in great depth by a more intense &quot;powergamer&quot; as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=377597">Expand</a></span>

Besides many people saying PvP sucks - it doesn&apos;t. Maybe the mechanics aren&apos;t the best, but battlegrounds, attacking cities is very enjoyable. This game has a lot of haters, for sure, but nonetheless it&apos;s still the best MMO on the market, and I played a lot of them and none beats WoW on flexibility, fun factor. The only thing with it - it&apos;s outdated. Still doesn&apos;t hurt my eyes, like the games from this period, thanks to unique Blizzard style graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=1364701">Expand</a></span>

It can be fun, and I&apos;m sure it was back a few years. WoW just isn&apos;t good anymore, and can&apos;t compare to MMORPGS such as the indie Pokemon MMO, or DCUO.</span>

It is one of the most fascinating and engrossing experiences you will have in a game.  The world is immense and varied.  The classes all offer unique and interesting play styles.  The depth of the game mechanics takes months of play to realise its full potential.  Be prepared to lose some of your free time because once you are hooked you will want to play every chance you can get.  It can be &apos;turned down&apos; to run on low end systems or &apos;turned up&apos; to run on high end systems.  Don&apos;t hesitate if you haven&apos;t tried it.   If you get really involved in it, you won&apos;t be disappointed.  I give it a 10 because its is the best game I have ever played for an extended period of time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=2524275">Expand</a></span>

<br>The good news is that WoW is a good game. There was a lot to do and plenty of classes and quests to keep you busy for months on end. The bad news is that this was a very &quot;casual&quot; game and due to its success, it garnered in a decade of watered down games across all genres in order to capitalize on the less skilled gamers especially from the big companies. The funny part is that young gamers look at games like Demon Souls and think that they are a new concept but they are just pale shadows of great games that came before that required the use of mind and not just memorization. Back to WoW, for the most part, it did everything well but made many things easier. Combat was standard but enemies were very forgiving and exploration was trivial. Crafting was made easier. Class build variety was good allowing for various builds. Exploration was mundane but that is true for all casual style games until Guild Wars 2 added puzzles and random events which made things more tolerable. Quests were similar to other MMO&apos;s and raiding was straight forward and much easier than older MMO&apos;s. Regardless of ease however, it was still a fun game albeit not my favorite MMO of all time. That honor remains with Everquest with Guild Wars 2 playing runner up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4876700">Expand</a></span>

Then you have to start wondering what is missing and why you or your friends don&apos;t stay.

<br>The biggest problem is repetitiveness and occurs with all games of the genre. Re-playability is reduced with theme-park style games. At some point grinding and hack-n-slash combat become boring and causes players to lose interest. Another problem is immersion. If the player doesn&apos;t begin to feel the character is important to the world and those around, the player never becomes hooked. Immersion is successful when the character makes an impact on the world and those around. As a comparison Star wars galaxies an often hot debated topic of the past had great immersion in the days of sandbox gaming where the character was yours, the land could be cultivated and thus yours, the economy was mostly player driven, and equipment constructed could be yours often having unique masterpieces. World of Warcraft misses in this and its themepark progression and cartoony characters and combat.
<br>
<br>Finally, its about community. If the game appeals to young teens who recently just got done playing Wizard 101 or Club Penguin and have moved to something bigger, it will have a huge community. Problem is many of the teens on these games have lost all etiquette and it shows with the constant duel requests, nature of chat, and other losses of social behavior. Thus WoW is now the game for early post-pubescent children. Older adults I know that still play WoW do so out of the same action as drinking the same old beer and not moving on to fine wine or champagne.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4862801">Expand</a></span>

I understand it is difficult to keep up servers for millions of people (back in 2004) , however that does not mean the price should be the same. As hosting the game does not require extremely high end servers compared to EVE online, where every core counts.</span>

<br>
<br>Good - A huge and often vibrant and diverse world with lots of different options. Leveling can be quite fun for a while.
<br>
<br>Bad - Pretty much every server is filled with the type of douche bags I described above. An example; somebody in the general chat is looking for a player to join a party, but then specifies exactly what stats they must have and that they must have great gear. No seriously, this actually happens, there are actually people as sad as this. Its like, where the hell is the fun in that?
<br>
<br>The graphics are far too cartoony, most armor looks crap as you will most likely be wearing pieces from different sets which seldom look good together. The gameplay is now terribly dated and boring.
<br>
<br>Verdict - WoW IS NOT and never has been a great game. If you can deal with or ignore most of the other players it is just ok, average at best but not really worth the cash. Also got to laugh at the review that stated  &apos;by far one of the best PC games of all time&apos; lol, I assume the person was joking, or smoking crack at the time. Not only is not even in the top 100 best pc games of all time, its not even the best MMO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4722170">Expand</a></span>

Former Everquest player and current Final Fantasy 11 player and the graphics arent as good as ffxi but it is a lot more colorful FFXI lag oh wait what lag it doesnt have any. I am a huge fan of blizzard and hope they come up with a solution or else i am wont be playing the game but other then that the game ROCKS!!!</span>

When WoW first came out it was at the top of it&apos;s game with people who cared about what the gamer wanted. Over time Blizzard Entertainment lost focus doing things for the player and started doing things to keep all the subscriptions it could. In short to Blizzard money became king and not the player. WoW history from day one to now reflects this, anyone who played during the early days can tell you the game was fun because it was challenging but over time became a dumbed down care bear game in order to keep your 15 USD a month flowing too it. One of the major current problems other then having a random 14 year old rage at you for now being geared right when you just want to run an instance to have fun is that playing this game feels like WORK. Yes...WORK. One example of this is you HAVE to get such and such armor sets and such and such weapons before you can advance to the next &quot;thing&quot; (Really do not know what else to call it.). I am going to stop here before I risk turning this into a rant and not a review.<br><br>But the bottom line is that World Of Warcraft is a dumbed down game by a developer who lost focus on doing things for the player and started doing things for the money.  Blizzard Entertainment MIGHT be redeemed some when Diablo 3 comes out but as far as World of Warcarft goes your money would be better spent on one of the younger MMORPGs from a studio who cares.....about the player.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=2306872">Expand</a></span>

Ill give 10/10 for the game experience that was released back in 2004 and completely agree to the other reviews that mention that wow got worse with pretty much every content patch or addon, but ill judge these addons seperately.<br><br>What blizzard managed to release in 2004 was just brilliant. A gigantic world to be explored, full of adventure and challenges and all this in flawless condition pretty much free of any major bugs. It was a  completely new gameplay experience, outstandingly good in every single aspect. I still remember the very first time ive met an enemy with a dragon ornament somehow displaying it beeing &quot;special&quot; and how i had to find a group for the very first time in this game to be able to take it down together. It was very satisfying. Leveling a champ to lvl 60 was time consuming, same like getting an epic mount was a serious decision since they were really really expensive. Or epic items... Sure there were few people just beeing lucky to get a krol blade as world drop but that one krol blade was already worth an epic mount and someone actually having 4 or 5 epic items alltogether really meant something. Getting such amount of epic items required to solve serious difficulties. Even beating certain 5 man instances took up to 2-3 hours of concentrated gamplay and taking part at raids for epics was not for everyone. It not only required 40 people but also to do certain preparations.<br><br>Today theres pretty much nothing left of this anymore. There are close to no real difficulties left. items or mounts completely lost their meaning as award. The complete game is only about investing a lot of time and repeatedly doing the same things over and over again every single day until you finally collected enough of whatever you thought you &quot;need&quot; without having real satisfaction about anything at any point in gameplay anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=2084387">Expand</a></span>

The simple fact of the matter is that the game evolved with the player basis, they asked people what they wanted, and gave it to them. No other company seems able to do that. Just look at the drivel the asian MMO market has given us in the last few years. Anyway the game still has fault as Blizzard now seem to be reaching out to the more casual audience handing out none heroic loot and making encounters easier and easier. At the same time this does allow even the lowest denominator of players to experience the content before the new expansion hits stores at the end of the year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=1389766">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There is no nuance to the combat or skilful platforming required with the game only rewarding the player for the amount of time they spend glued to their screen. Virtually every game in the genre has copied World of Warcraft but that is down to its sales success not the quality of its gameplay I&apos;m afraid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=4181378">Expand</a></span>

It is pointless to play when it has 100s of copies free to play. waisting 15 dollars a month i am suprised it has such a large community. this game is Great fun gameplay but that much for this just go play somethign else like Forsaken world rappelz and many more F2p mmorpgs:(</span>

                                        <span>World of Warcraft is the best MMO I have played. Its pvp, dungeons, and classes are all fantastic. However, I feel that character customization should be improved. Also, once you get to the point where you can raid it requires a lot of time and effort to be allowed to raid by other players.</span>

I&apos;ll make separate reviews for each expansion. *World of Warcraft of course is still &quot;king&quot; of mmos and for many it was there first experience playing an MMO, myself included. World of Warcraft gave me 6+ years of satisfying gaming entertainment before I started to become bored of it about a year ago. *Blizzard is always adding new content to the game, adding new features to the game for better quality of life for the players and polishing and improving the features already in the game. Blizzard is always experimenting with new technologies to improve the game (phasing, cross-server grouping,  etc.) and is not afraid to take risks. Many times new things they add are successful, occasionally they are not, but Blizzard is not afraid to admit mistakes and take actions to fix things later. *Blizzards customer service has treated me like a King on the few occasions that I have had problems. I can count on one hand the times I&apos;ve needed to contact technical and customer support so that&apos;s quite an achievement when I&apos;ve been playing the game for 7 years, 6 years full time that I&apos;ve only had a few issues over the years.
<br>
<br>*The game is very fun to play. The quests and the characters are often very humorous and are also often parodies of real pop culture people and events. It&apos;s nice that the game does not take itself too seriously. I think it is the light-hearted humour that has made me feel most at home in the world of Azeroth for my years of spending time there.
<br>
<br>*The original &quot;Vanilla&quot; World of Warcraft was not perfect, but it was excellent for the time when it was released and it has set the standard for what other MMOs need to aim for so for that I must give it a 10 rating.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=2599395">Expand</a></span>

This game first released on what, 2004? 5? Since then, I couldn&apos;t find a SINGLE replacement for the online MMORPG genre. And I&apos;m from Korea, a country made out of online games. I agree that the game is no more enjoyable than the previous WOW titles. Half or quarter value at best. But c&apos;mon... This game is beyond the boundary of legendary. Show some respect.

Additional content and ever changing character balance tweaks keep players challenged.  Each expansion introduces new character classes and changes.  Players that want to &quot;Finish&quot; the game are missing the point.  World of Warcraft is a sandbox game  there is no end.  You are never forced to do anything in the game, you can even level cap and tweak your character at a particular level.  Leveling options are expansive to say the least with at least 7 that I am aware of; 1. Follow Quest Chains and do quests.  2. Farm Mobs without regard for quests.  3. Play PVP Battlegrounds.  4. Do Mining or Herbalism to gain experience.  5. Do dungeons and raids.  6. Engage in Pet Battles.  7. Complete seasonal quests.
<br>
<br>The game has a wide range of Professions that can be followed and levelled and features a very active trading community via the Auction House or in-game trade.
<br>
<br>Although deployment of expansions or occasional content updates usually have some bugs or glitches, up until now Blizzard has always fixed or removed content that causes problems.
<br>
<br>Given the choice between paying for World of Warcraft subscription or buying a new game each month the choice is an easy one for Millions of World of Warcraft players.
<br>
<br>For those who claim &quot;Vanilla WOW was the best&quot;, they are ignoring the occasional upgrades to the graphic engine, innovation to skill trees, quest assistance which eliminates the need of quest helper add-ons.
<br>
<br>Most regular players play for a few to several hours a week, however there are some players who simply have to be the best and end up sacrificing disproportionate time for rewards gained.  This is not a game issue though, it is a player issue.
<br>
<br>World of Warcraft creates an illusion of a living, ever changing environment and has generated a backdrop of Lore entrenched in ageless conflicts and subterfuge and betrayals.
<br>
<br>Trying to level as fast as possible is almost futile and detracts from the enjoyment that can be derived from just exploring everything the game has to offer and enjoying level appropriate content and challenges.
<br>
<br>Because the game is massively multiplayer with a strong interaction focus players may experience both good and bad interactions in the game and each guild will have a different feel based on the Guild master&apos;s guild design choices, morals, ethics and of course the general membership in the guild.  Some guilds are helpful, while others exploit their members, so players may need to do quite a bit of guild hopping to find a guild that suits their game focus and social requirement.
<br>
<br>Players who respond negatively are most likely experiencing &quot;Resistance to Change&quot;, however the one thing this game does expect from players is to constantly respond to continuous change and progression.
<br>
<br>Blizzard also regularly re-balance the game creating subtle imbalances which shift advantages and disadvantages between classes of character or talent specializations within a class.  The deck gets shuffled more or less with each expansion or new PVP arena season.
<br>
<br>Players can expect to get many years of top notch interactive enjoyment as Blizzard devotes a lot of resources to keep changing, updating and enhancing the game.  How many more expansions there will be is difficult to assess, but it is certain that players have at least one or two more to look forward to after Mists of Pandaria.
<br>
<br>This game has a lot to offer, and Blizzard have done a fine job maintaining a steady growth of new content and challenges.  This game is overwhelming in that there is always something new to do and often not enough time to do it all.  However for the many years of quality and dedication this game deserves the highest score possible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=3665172">Expand</a></span>

I have only good memories of those days and I still listen to the soundtracks and think back to a time where life was so simple and carefree hanging out in westfall, goldshire, stormwind, ironforge and the bonding time with my brother and friends. It just had so much to offer and so many different environments. What I really like is that the world was so big that there were places that were just there. Unfortunate that the expansions lost touch somehow and that they are dragging this game out still.

And when I broke my foot and couldn&apos;t put weight on it for 2 months this game was a godsend.

<br>
<br>Then you actually get used to grinding and repetetiveness you unlock more join a guild, and meet new friends. Which is kind of cool right.
<br>
<br>It has flaws like its a bit too easy, PVP is not difficult if you have Hairlooms but you will piss new players off.
<br>
<br>PVP we are talking about a 700 hours of playtime before you should start playing PVP.
<br>
<br>Pros
<br>-Tons of spells
<br>-Nice Combat
<br>-Good Missions
<br>-Good PVP
<br>-Balanced Classes
<br>-Beautiful areas
<br>-Dungoens
<br>-Responsive gameplay
<br>-High levels are fun!
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>-Alot of bugs
<br>-Not very challenging
<br>-User Friendly
<br>-Extremly repetetive
<br>-Copy and pasted areas
<br>-Low levels Arent too fun</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=2523968">Expand</a></span>

As for the people that say that you will get addicted to it, well I have two words for you. Will Power!!!!!! You don&apos;t have to play it all the time and if your worried your playing it to much, then get off. It is that simple. Go do stuff outside or with your friends for a while, the game will always be there when you get back. As for the people who say the game is just full of morons who want to know if your good at the game or not, well of course it is. But it is not completely full of them. Just ignore the stupid people and add people as your friends who actually know what their doing and you should be fine. Besides the game isn&apos;t completely based on playing with other people. In fact majority of the quests you can do by yourself. This is truely a great game and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good computer game.

<br>
<br>I remember this game when it first came out--you felt immersed, like you were in the world. You were the character. EVERYTHING you did affected the outcome, but it was still too linear--it still is. You only have ONE choice in the storyline. You can NEVER deviate from it. That makes the immersion and storytelling of WoW&apos;s storyline really bland, boring and extremely bad.
<br>
<br>Next, the gameplay. The game was using a talent system where you got talents and then as you levelled up, you&apos;d put points into them. It was a complicated system but it worked for WoW. Now they introduced this &apos;faceroll easymode&apos; setting into the game where you now have to wait 15 levels between each talent point.
<br>
<br>And it&apos;s obvious Blizzard favors certain specs and classes over the rest. Arcane magi were the best mage spec in Cataclysm, but now with MoP? It&apos;s about as useless as trying to fling mudballs at a dragon and hoping it&apos;ll die from being dirty. Rogues are now 100% useless in all situations. Every other class can out-damage them, can out-endure them, and can even find ways to make your CCs even more useless.
<br>
<br>And oh and don&apos;t forget the grinding. Blizzard&apos;s &apos;attempt&apos; at making this game compete with others by trying to make it challenging? Failed. The game, for the most part.. is boring as hell, and you spend 99% of your time in PvE just grinding. There&apos;s no real thing about this game which gives it that &apos;unique&apos; feeling. There is no immersion, there is no satisfaction, certain classes are useless in all regards, and they made the game more attuned to some stupid 5 year-old mindset rather than to the MAJORITY of the game&apos;s populace, which are 18+ individuals who want a good story, a good immersion, and good gameplay.
<br>
<br>Against other games such as Guild Wars 2, which is focused primarily around hard as hell challenges to force you to get better or stay as you are; or games like Star Wars: The Old Republic, where you are FULLY immersed into it and every decision in a questline is decided by YOU, the player, not pre-coded by a developer... WoW just falls short. Diablo 3 fell short. Starcraft 2 fell short.
<br>
<br>Blizzard has to come to terms with reality that they just can&apos;t do whatever they feel like doing, and expect it to all work out. And since they don&apos;t really -listen- to their players anymore, there&apos;s not much the populace can do for the game.
<br>
<br>In my honest opinion? Go find a different game, this one isn&apos;t worth your time or your money. World of Warcraft is nothing more than a money sink and a time-waster.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=2799980">Expand</a></span>

<br>This review may be useless, considering it no longer exists, but the original WOW was amazing. This game defined the MMORPG. Everything about it has been reused and mimicked by other MMORPGS because, lets admit it, this is as good as it gets. I understand that it sucks the life from you (it did for me) but in order to be able to do that, or to get people willing to put up to 8 hours a day into it means that it is good right? Who would put that much time voluntarily into something they don&apos;t like?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=3114920">Expand</a></span>

By that same token it does get very repetitive and in the end you just work towards levelling up so you can get a certain ability or attack. The game does lack diversity in character though and it often feels like a lot of people playing through the same game, the quests are very linear 90% of the time. Also I can&apos;t say much for the players, many like to run up and take a treasure while you&apos;re busy fighting the boss. People are also uninteresting, they are rarely willing to stop for the minute or two it might take to duel. The occupations are also very bland. While it is very original in that you can make items of real use, unlike in some other games, they are very limited. Depending on your class your occupation is almost certain. The only one of the 5 major occupations which departs from this is the interesting engineering occupation which made it&apos;s debut in this MMORPG. Which has cool creations such as goggles, dynamite, and other interesting items. The biggest problem as stated by some of the other reviewers is that the classes often end up getting very repetitive. The warrior classes run up and simply allow their character to auto attack, while the spell casters go through the same routine every time. The only one of these that does not follow this (and believe me as I have tried characters in every class) is rogue which in a true gamers hands can find himself jumping around and using an arsenal of special attacks on the enemies. Also various stealth missions i have undertaken proved lots of fun and very cool. The designers need to work to make every class that much fun. My friends complain about how boring their characters are. Other problems with this game are that the designers seemed to have gotten rather tired in the games creation. Cave after cave are identical in every way except the monsters and the color textures. Identical towers and castles dot the landscape. Also monsters often don&apos;t look any different later on, rather they take a monster that you may have fought at lvl 5 and stick it in the new lvl 25 place, make it bigger, and raise it&apos;s hp and damage. Also there are exspanses of open land that seem to have no function except as travelling land and space. Though a lot of these traits are probably common in MMORPGs I think that if they expect players to pay $50 to buy in and $15 a month then the designers need to put more effort into their games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/world-of-warcraft/user-reviews?user_review_id=379205">Expand</a></span>

Best game I&apos;ve played in a long while. PVP (player versus player)is awsome, and is supposedly in store for huge improvemnets down the line. Looking forward to the many things Blizzard has in store for this one. But even without them this one rocks!</span>
