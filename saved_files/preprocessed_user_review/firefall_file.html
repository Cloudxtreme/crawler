I thought the game had spectacular vision and charm--and, like coffee, beer, and Star Trek, would inevitably be an acquired taste, something some people would love up front while others would have to endure before they could appreciate it.
<br>
<br>The vision of Firefall as it was during development, became something else at launch. It *was* a classic PvP game like Tribes, with instanced balanced PvP gameplay of the e-sports variety, but apparently the execution of e-sports was so deliberate and premature that the testers began to hate it and began demanding only the open world PvE experience of an MMORPG. As Red 5 added more open world content, players took time out to explore it, and PvP instances couldn&apos;t even launch. So they threw out balanced PvP instances altogether. Thus the game became a different beast altogether.
<br>
<br>In the end Firefall has become a game that doesn&apos;t really do anything *well*. It does a lot, a heck of a lot, just fine, with decent graphics and sound. But while there are PvP features in the game (duels and open world PvP in designated places) this isn&apos;t a PvP game, and it&apos;s also not an RPG, and it&apos;s sort of an FPS but the AI system couldn&apos;t handle the scale of many players so, at launch, a lot of interesting content was thrown out just like PvP was thrown out a year prior to launch. The notions of thumpers and tiki torches and Chosen put the game on the right track--really great ideas to build on and replicate--but new ideas seemed to have frozen to a halt some time prior to launch. The world is massive, but there&apos;s not much going on in it. In the end you have an okay game, extremely stable on the client, quite playable in its mechanics, but quite mediocre in its creativity and content. I cannot recommend this game until they add a LOT more campaign missions, dramatically soup up operations (AI servers etc) to restore the experience I enjoyed on the test servers during development, and turn PvP back on while finding a PvP matchmaking strategy that brings players together once again. Until then, this game is a tragic premature birth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4398152">Expand</a></span>

I loved it so much I bought the $100 Founder&apos;s Pack.  I played it daily for about 6 months, even after my friends had all moved on.  I recently came back when I started seeing news and advertisements heralding the official launch.  The game I found when I logged in last week is mostly unrecognizable.
<br>
<br>PVP
<br>Gone is the instanced PVP I enjoyed so much during the closed beta, even the much hyped Jetball mode.  This was very sad for me.  Instead, they&apos;ve included an open-world PVP zone.  I was at first excited by this because I enjoyed the WvW and AvA game modes in Guild Wars 2 and Elder Scrolls Online.  What I found in Firefall though was an almost completely empty zone.  Nobody responded to me in team chat and I only once saw a teammate.  In about an hour of play I only found 2 enemies and despote having a max-level character with epic quality gear, I couldn&apos;t even dent them.
<br>
<br>PVE
<br>The playable area has more than doubled since I had last played, which was right after the introduction of the melding pockets.  This sounds great, but the big caveat is that they have added levels to the game and now the entire zone I used to play in is pointless for me to visit on my max level battleframe. This essentially means you will only ever have one zone to play in that is appropriate for your level.  The game used to proudly proclaim that you could access any content on day one and you might even survive if you were skilled.  That&apos;s pretty much gone.  The ARES missions and thumping are fun as always though.  I haven&apos;t tried the new job board &quot;quests&quot; but have heard in chat they get repetitive quickly.
<br>
<br>PROGRESSION
<br>The game used to have no levels and instead your progression came from increasing the power, mass and CPU ratings of a particular battleframe.  The then CEO even made a comment that it wasn&apos;t intended that everyone would even get a battleframe fully maxed out.  Getting your frame to max level took an huge amount of resources and crystite (in-game currency).  The XP just kind of came naturally from playing.  I felt like it was a huge achievement when I finally got max power, mass &amp; CPU on my Tigerclaw and was finally able to equip some really good crafted items.  The new progression system is a very standard xp grind for levels.  It&apos;s a fairly trivial thing compared to the effort that went in under the old system.
<br>
<br>F2P MODEL
<br>This is one area where I have nothing but praise for Red5.  The things you can buy with in-game currency are almost completely cosmetic (battleframe paints, hats, mustaches, hair, etc.).  The only thing offered in the cash shop that most players will feel they &quot;need&quot; is the motorcycle and there is a way to get one in-game if you&apos;re willing to wait.  They also have included a way to buy the cash shop currency from other players with in-game currency which is a model that worked really well in Guild Wars 2 and will probably do well here as well.  There is not gating of content or pay 2 win via the cash and that&apos;s a win in my book.
<br>
<br>CONCLUSION
<br>Firefall is an enjoyable game and has a lot to offer compared to other F2P games I&apos;ve played.  It&apos;s definitely worth the download if you&apos;ve never checked it out.  BUT, it&apos;s no longer the game I fell in love with back in the closed beta.  Gone is the go where you want, do what you want, no quest, who cares about XP experience.  Instead it offers the all-too-familiar MMO XP leveling grind and I just don&apos;t need another game like that.  I probably won&apos;t be back unless/until they bring back instanced PVP where I can at least get consistent player vs player action for 10-15 minutes at a stretch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4394613">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>And yet, somehow, it has appeal. It&apos;s fairly innovative and gear and crafting especially  works pretty well. Quests are repetitive but its storyline set-up is fun and there&apos;s stuff to do everywhere. You have your quests, there&apos;s public quests and there&apos;s gathering resources, which works even when helping others. And so you glide (yes, there&apos;s gliding, jumping and such) from quest hub to quest hub clocking hour after hour.
<br>
<br>Yeah, the AI is weak. The UI is kind of sluggish, the economy hasn&apos;t gotten under way and there&apos;s many more things. As I said, this game has everything to be absolutely mediocre...

                                        <span>Very fun and fast paced FPS MMO. It had a rocky development but as it stands now, it is worth the time. Being a F2P you should at least give it a try. Beautiful map, fluid gun play and an interesting story. The ability to use boosters and gliders appeal to tribes fans while the shooting is similar to Borderlands. Overall a fun experience.</span>

<br>
<br>I have enjoyed every part of this game. It brings the skill of a standard FPS, wraps it in the progression of an MMORPG and tops it off with a great fully voiced storyline with memorable characters. Additionally it sports a well done free to play model where all items are available to a person who does not pay.
<br>
<br>I would definitely recommend trying this game out and hope you like it enough to throw some money at the Red 5 so they can continue developing this enjoyable game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4388738">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Level system sucks: It&apos;s hard to play with your friends (especially if you&apos;re the lower leveled one) because they&apos;re off grinding away at higher level content that your just unable to participate in, and even if you did you don&apos;t get rewarded for it because it&apos;s too high level. Typical MMO &quot;grind to max level so you can start playing the game&quot; crap; typical Free 2 Play &quot;We&apos;re going to make this take way longer than it should and prevent you from using your actual shooter skill to skip content so we can sell you xp boosters.&quot;
<br>
<br>The PvP is TERRIBLE! I went in as a level 30 to the PvP zone and met up with another player (lvl 40) that was on my &quot;team&quot;. There weren&apos;t very many people in the PvP zone and we wanted to see how much damage the &quot;bike with guns&quot; would do to him, so we dueled. The game kicked me off the bike and wouldn&apos;t let me back on... fine no bikes in duels. The other player wanted to know how much damage I could do to him so he stood still while I shot him in the head. Nothing but straight headshots and he could out regenerate all my damage. Level and gear completely outweigh skill; which is horrible for a shooter. Your skill will only come into play if you are the same level and close to the same gear rating.
<br>
<br>The crafting is designed to sell you resource boosters and you can pay to skip the long wait time (days in some cases) between clicking craft and getting your item.
<br>
<br>The player to player economy is doomed for failure as there are infinite resources, your gear never needs to be replaced, and there is a finite player base. It doesn&apos;t take an economical genius to figure out that the market will be saturated in short order.
<br>
<br>The graphics are great! After you pay to get an LGV (motorcycle thingy) and a glider pad, traveling around the zones is some of the most fun I&apos;ve had getting from boring kill quest to boring fetch quest in a video game. The storyline instances are pretty fun, but they&apos;re gated by forcing you to hit certain levels to play them.
<br>
<br>Overall, the game is too much of a grind fest, the quests are too repetitive, and FPS skill means very little. It doesn&apos;t feel rewarding, it just feels tedious.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving it 2 for the world travel and graphics and 2 for the storyline instances.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4391163">Expand</a></span>

Sure there are triple-A greats here and there, but indie, F2P, and/or foreign sleepers abound. One of them is Firefall. Don&apos;t be swayed away by people complaining about the grind. It&apos;s a fun grind! Shooting things in first or third person really takes away a lot of the annoyance of tab-target combat. It&apos;s fun, frantic, and fast with Firefall. Gorgeous graphics wrap good gameplay up nicely. Look forward to big pitched firefights against aliens, space terrorists, and mutated Earth fauna, jetpacking your way through the zing of bullets and lasers, assembling cool tech yourself.

For the new users, I highly recommend to start by grouping with other players not by soloing. Group activities are a lot of fun and better than soloing</span>

<br>all bugs changed to &quot;snipers&quot; with extreme high damage and range, tedious leveling system make player boring fast, some old great classes Bastions, DragonFlyes are now a great crap, ridiculous extreme high recoil add on weapons on game and that ruined the combat for players because npcs have 100% accuracy, really sad see how firefall is doomed to fail when 2.0 coming.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=5466415">Expand</a></span>

But at the end of the day, you find yourself struggling to find a reason to stick around especially when you start the crafting gear grind.

<br>The world of Firefall is beautiful. But at the same time, it feels empty. Over time, I only hope they&apos;ll add more event types, and distribute them around. Story is OK-ish, sounds are fine, gunplay is enjoyable. But the real problem I have with this game is, the identity crisis it is going through.
<br>
<br>It wants to be a shooter. Then it wants to have RP elements. Over the beta phases, it has changed drastically, and I don&apos;t believe they have tested all of these changes properly. Many of the depth has been removed from the game, and now what we have is a shooter with a very shallow progression system. I wish they kept some of the complexity rather than trying to streamline everything.
<br>
<br>Overall, I enjoy the game, but sometimes it feels like a chore. But as a F2P title, you should at least give it a chance.

<br>Used to be addicted to playing Tribes, so all the jetpack craziness also helped me connect with this game.</span>

It&apos;s an awesome cel-shaded FPS that is light on the quests - don&apos;t expect the same old hunt-for-animals trivialities. It&apos;s an enjoyable game that offers plenty of new mechanics and elements like thumping, melding, and the social interaction. Try it, it&apos;s not an F2W. :)</span>

<br>There are definitely things that need work in this game.  Since the game was pushed to launch likely do to investors breathing down their neck, there is a lot of room for addition.  But since launch, key systems have been made and the ability to add content rapidly has been given to Red 5.  So in the long run, we should see a remarkable game, full of potential, and stories to give to to other players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4407174">Expand</a></span>

In the past month or so the world and it&apos;s content has expanded and everything has become very polished, but I can tell they and tweaking things here and there from night to night and I&apos;m sure a patch is right around the corner.
<br>
<br>*Quest: the beginning town quest(Level 1-20) are repetitive, but the quest you find around the zones are very cool and the story/group quest are very fun and repeatable with a party or you can solo them.  There is even a &quot;Hardcore&quot; mode.
<br>*Leveling: You level your frame, not yourself,  so ever new frame is a new grind, but after you get a bike it&apos;s not that bad.
<br>*Mounts: Options are very limited.  You have gliders, bikes, they just added these jeeps(?), and they have transports that run between the Quest hubs.  Gliders are easy to come by, Bikes you can either buy or you and quest one at 25 or wait until level 40. I know nothing on the Jeep as it is new, but it looks like it can transport a party.
<br>*Area&apos;s/Zones:  The Beginning area is very repetitive, but once you reach 25 and move out of the newb area the missions become more diverse and much more time consuming and in some cases only one person per zone can do the mission your on.
<br>*Somethings could better be explained to you, but zone chat will normally get you the answer to your question.
<br>*Finally, I have played a ton of MMO&apos;s and FPS&apos;s and I&apos;m really digging this.. It&apos;s fun... I haven&apos;t seen how they are going to do Guilds or handle Raids(or if there are Raids)... I have 3 toons in the 20&apos;s(Max level is 40 currently)...
<br>
<br>The game is free, fun, and ALL it&apos;ll cost you to try is the bandwidth to download it(It&apos;s a big game)...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4401216">Expand</a></span>

At first I found the character graphics a bit dull, as they are somewhat in the style of Borderlands; however, the environmental detail and world are great.

People will tell it&apos;s got loads of traveling to the point of boring. Honestly, it&apos;s probably just bored people speaking of how bored they are. The ways of travel are great, and complement the bouts of action really well as interludes. It&apos;s a pretty scape, and there&apos;s awe-inspiring group bosses that threaten the world.

<br>I fell in love with Firefall in beta, but it&apos;s like a bad relationship where you just stick around because you know how awesome it COULD be, but it&apos;s just not there. I don&apos;t know if FireFall will ever get there, and I don&apos;t think I care to stick around to find out anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4506146">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>the graphics look really great, especially if you crank up all the effects.  motion blur adds a lot to this game if you can sustain high fps.  apparently its the project offset engine.
<br>
<br>if you want a great shooter thats kinda like borderlands with a touch of unreal, then firefall is totally your game.
<br>
<br>i highly reccomend it, havent smiled this much playing a game in a while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4403673">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>PvP is alright, but it&apos;s bugged out though in some cases, but since release I&apos;ve noticed some up spikes people entering in PvP - Use boing if you want to know how many people are on the server.
<br>
<br>You don&apos;t just HAVE to do quests, you can do ares missions, events like tornado, or Incursion event, so if it comes to people reviewing the system only saying there&apos;s &quot;quests&quot; please don&apos;t take too much of it, there&apos;s enough to do in the world to level.
<br>
<br>Crafting: You don&apos;t have to craft; there&apos;s items you can get from loot that are just as good if you ain&apos;t into crafting it&apos;s just an option.
<br>
<br>People only spend like 5 minutes on the game and review it on from there being &quot;lame&quot; if you really want to try out the game at least give it a good 2-3hours - you don&apos;t just have to do the quests.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4392659">Expand</a></span>

It offers a solid PvE experience with lots of missions ranging from capture the flag types, territory control, escort, and plain old seek and destroy. Even mining resources in this game is fun when you attempt to defend the Thumpers used to extract ore from the ground.
<br>
<br>Travel around the post-apocalyptic, no - post-invasion is more like it, Brazil in all its (remaining) glory, because the action is wrapped around a cool sci-fi alien invasion where the opposing force is unpredictable in where they can strike, and their territory is inexplicably and slowly and surely encroaching what remains of the un-tainted Earth. Great visuals, fun firefighting, varied classes and roles, awesome and cool ways to travel (glider, jetpack, ATV, speedcycle). 9/10 in my book.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4402295">Expand</a></span>

I won&apos;t go explaining the positive sides of the game because they are alot and it&apos;s more fun to go and find out yourself, but i&apos;ll put some words about the negativities so &apos;perfectionists&apos; don&apos;t get disappointed.
<br>The game is lacking content, but it got officially released like a month ago, and there&apos;s already teritories being opened, be patient.
<br>It&apos;s grindy and quests are so repeatable, but there&apos;s people who enjoy grindy mmo, i personally love it if it&apos;s made enjoyable and it sure is in Firefall and keeps being varied. The quests are repeatable indeed, but there&apos;s interesting story going on there i personally did all the quests and can&apos;t wait for new teritories to open so i can see how the story continues.
<br>There&apos;s constantly updates with changes in teritories and abilities without much announcing about them. Some are pissed about it (mainly about ability nerfing without announcing it) but it&apos;s a neccesary thing...
<br>Shortly... The game didn&apos;t progress that much during the long beta, but it&apos;s undenyable that it&apos;s progressing and now that it&apos;s released they are opening teritories=new content in a faster rate. The game is unique give it a chance if you think it&apos;s your cup of tea.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4436627">Expand</a></span>

It feels like R5 really had something going for it w/ the original idea, then too many power hungry people got their grubby hands in too many different aspects of it and the end result is a complete mess. Trying to please too many people at once, including their own investors and employees, rather than sticking to one thing and just doing it well, is what caused this catastrophe.  There&apos;s no staying power other than the fact that it&apos;s the only thing that tries to combine a lot of people&apos;s favorite genres besides Borderlands 2 (which had it&apos;s own minor problems regarding a lack of replay value).  The problem is, it does none of them well... and leaves me, personally, constantly searching for an as yet unavailable alternative.  But alternatives will be coming and, unless they get their sh*t together and stop trying to jerk everybody off at the same time, Firefall (and R5) will be quickly forgotten.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4506131">Expand</a></span>

I was threatened by the community manager when I spoke up about the bait and switch feeling many had when they surprised us with durability, item decay, gated content, suddenly discovered technical limitations and that a two years prior The9 bought up the company and dictated the change in direction. Only thing was Red5 was still pushing it as something they knew they never intended to make.
<br>Ask around, you will find people who had their accounts deleted, posted edited and threats made by the Community Manager Phobos (who has zero qualifications to manage anything more then his own bowel movements). In 2012 somebody told me that Firefall was to be an inch deep and a mile wide. They were correct. The game today in no way resembled the one they showed us when we were at Red5 Studios other then it still has guns. No in depth community activity in game, no economy based around the Chosen War. In fact the economy is a treadmill of repairing gear and there really is no more Chosen War. Oh, look for the early art for the Melding Gates. Were they created because in 2010 they already knew of the limitations? Good luck getting an honest answer from that.
<br>The game is now garbage. Steaming pile of rotting garbage awaiting its day to be taken to the dumpster. It isn&apos;t a matter of if it closes but when and The9 is working on a console system of their own for China so don&apos;t expect any financial support from them.
<br>The concept was great. They should have known in 2010 what the limitations were but they are not a trustworthy bunch in my opinion so I would doubt any answer they gave.
<br>They took a decent open world shooter and turned it into a Chinese market Grinder with bits of **** I say **** because it doesn&apos;t even do the Shooter aspects worth a damn.
<br>Look at Glassdoor, google old 2010 articles about what The9 did to the company, see what they did when they removed Grummz (a repeat of 2010), then look at the state of the game and the blanket denial by  Red5 that anything is wrong.
<br>AI is garbage.
<br>PVP is worth about the same, garbage.
<br>Economy makes zero sense.
<br>They don&apos;t sell power, they just make you so miserable you are forced to pay for easier access.
<br>The shooting feels as empty and emotionless as Duck Hunt.
<br>The missions are extremely repetitive.
<br>There is no Chosen War or reason for the game existing.
<br>The random lag spikes are present 4yrs on into the games life.
<br>Gated content prevents you from playing with others and those the correct level rarely play anymore.
<br>For having an exo-suit you sure do run slow.
<br>Bunny hop combat. Not much else to say about that.
<br>Horrible voice acting, deaf lesbian porn has better acting.
<br>There is no dynamic world like promised. Instead it has a static world with randomly generated events.
<br>NPC&apos;s are zero help in defending their own towns let alone themselves.
<br>Terrain exploits.
<br>Almost no real customization. Hats, stupid, idiotic hats but little else.
<br>It feels like all the hitboxes are the same size regardless of the frame you are using.
<br>Two dimensional presentations can still make you feel a sense of distance, just not in this game.
<br>All the best art work was done by somebody who left the company in 2010.
<br>They keep blaming a past CEO for decisions The9 made and James agreed to. Now James in in charge but only until they replace him or shut things down.
<br>I regret the time I put into the game and the times I recommended it to friends.
<br>It was one of the worst outcomes I have seen from something I was part of so early on. **** in and **** out. They started putting pure **** into the game and the real developers grabbed their **** and got out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4456736">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>FireFall&apos;s numerous unique gameplay elements make it a very good MMO for me. It&apos;s not the typical grindcore and it offers a lot more fun in terms of graphics, resource-management, combat and character seletion / leveling up.It&apos;s something unique that I think any MMO player should try, especially if they want a fresh take on the genre.</span>

The FPS gameplay is easy to get into but hard to master, jumpjets give mobility in combat a huge twist and the abilities give each class archetype it&apos;s own flair and playstyle.
<br>Trying to rush your way into the game is going to give you some issues with some of the more unique systems in place but it sports a mentor program that has dedicated players to answer question you have. There are also armies that you can join up with that will assuredly make the gameplay more lively and (hilariously) chaotic.
<br>Open world PvP does need some balancing but mostly on 3 (out of the total 16) of the battleframes.
<br>Overall I&apos;d say this game has vast potential to improve as Red5 Studios has literally dragged this game out of Development Hell into its (MUCH, much more playable) state.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4407247">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>In theory it should be a good game. Open world shooter with mechs(or mechish suits, whatever). Unfortunately the game is just tedious to play. Run across the map to kill 6 mobs, just to run across the map and kill 6 more mobs.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s also full of bugs and horrible AI.
<br>
<br>Maybe they should&apos;ve taken another 2 years to build the game, because the concept is great...but the game is just awful.</span>

<br>
<br>Cons?
<br>-When servers crowded It feels crowded than it should be but this is launch week and every MMO I played goes to stable after launch week.
<br>-Class balance and arena kind of game play should be implemented in future
<br>
<br>Verdict: Very Good FreeToPlay game overall you must try</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4391534">Expand</a></span>

The first hurdle you have to get over is the lack of introduction to the class system; you start out as one of the basic classes, but it doesn&apos;t even pretend to introduce the concept of the advanced classes to you.  Now, the important thing here is that I wanted to play one of the advanced classes as my main class, so I have the option of paying $15 to unlock it or playing one of the basic classes up to max level to unlock an advanced class.  I get that the devs need to make money, too, but telling me I either have to pay $15 or spend hours leveling a class, only so that I can start leveling the actual class I want to play is very poor design.
<br>
<br>I started playing again at release and I just can&apos;t bring myself to play for more than a couple hours at a time.  On top of all of the annoyances of the class system, the quest system is back to square one as far as MMOs are concerned.  Every quest is &apos;go here, kill 5-10 dudes, go here and kill 5-10 dudes, go here and kill 5-10 dudes, turn quest in.&apos;  In the age of quest systems such as GW2&apos;s, this is unacceptable.  On top of all of this, the AI is the worst AI I have ever seen in a shooter; to make up for this, the mobs hit very hard and spawn in ridiculous groups that will instagib you.
<br>
<br>Honestly, I would recommend that everyone avoid this game like the plague.  I just feel sorry for the poor souls who gave these devs money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4394985">Expand</a></span>

So many elements that integrate into a busy PvE game - you may want to look at PvP someplace else, but all the other stuff in the game is top-notch. Kudos to the developers for staying and fighting with this gem of a game all throughout.</span>

This game had a 2+year beta period, and it changed direction so many times in that timeframe that just about nobody got the exact snippet of that beta they wanted to become the full game.
<br>
<br>The game is actually one of the more pleasant MMO games out there, the grind is short, probably won&apos;t even take you 4 days to max a class playing fairly casually, the mechanics are a bit fresh, and it manages a decent blend of shooter and hotbar MMO, with the emphasis largely being on shooter with just a few skills with long cooldowns. As of the most recent patch content in this game is up 3 or 4 fold from its release levels, there isn&apos;t more unique content, there&apos;s just now more content in the game to play. There however, is plenty of content for a game that has just released, and more to come.
<br>
<br>This is a game I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys shooters, or shooters and MMOs, but probably not to the classic MMO fan. It&apos;s free, and there&apos;s no pay to win, so if you&apos;re looking for something to try, give it a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4426828">Expand</a></span>

Due to internal turmoils game lost direction mid-way through development and final version is only what was salvaged from the original innovation idea. This game brought insane amount of disappointment. Just 5 months after release game lost 90% of it&apos;s player base and is dropping by at least -20% of active player base every month. It&apos;s not that bad as to give it score of 0, more like 5ish, but It&apos;s a train wreck with no chance of reboot and that flatlines my score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4801484">Expand</a></span>

At first it didn&apos;t hook me so much so my friends helped me level up a bit. As of this typing, I&apos;m a couple of levels higher already, I&apos;m hooked! It&apos;s not a perfect game by any means, but it has a certain charm to it that just gets you. I also love how the jetpacks are not merely cosmetic, they really add a mechanic to the game!</span>

Something about this game keeps me coming back, maybe because I&apos;m a fan of jetpacks? I guess it&apos;s also the frames setup, it so interesting that the style of play drastically changes per frame.</span>

<br>-The pvp is horrible, some people say just wait and they will get it balanced but after years of beta its not even close to being balanced.
<br>-The goals in pvp leads to anti-fun base trading since you need extreme number of rewards to trade for gear upgrade.
<br>-You can enter PvP before you are max lvl on a frame but as lvl30 out of 40 you will get 1 shoted and with the best pvp frame at lvl30 with best equipment you need 7-9 headshots to kill a lvl40 enemy while he needs 2 bodyshoot or 1headshoot to kill you.
<br>
<br>PvE:
<br>-This actually has potential but the game has very little content and no chance they will be able to produce new content to slake your hunger for new content. best you can hope for is to play it for 10days every 3 months.
<br>-Ares quests are a big part of lvling up and they are
<br>run to X--&gt; talk npc--&gt; run X kill 10+spiders/bandits--&gt; run to start. Those who defend them usually say things like &quot;dont mind ares&quot; &quot;you get decent exp/time why you complaining&quot; &quot;its not that much running&quot;. Even their defenders admit they are wildly unpopular and hated for their sheer dependance on running between locations.
<br>
<br>Good stuff:
<br>-Contol over your character the jetpack mechanics of being able to jump like the hulk and hover in the air like iron man leads you to feel like a super-skilled-ninja player when you dodge shots like spiderman. Even if your not as myself even halfway decent in shooters it gives you that gut feeling of Im-Good!. Could have been a fun offline game if they had built on this and made a fun main campaign but as a mmo it keeps giving you Missions that are 80% running and such a tiny amount of content and PvP that forces you to play in a antifun way with unbalanced &quot;classes&quot;
<br>
<br>All in all id say dip your toes into it for around 10days or so and then get up quickly before the &quot;potential&quot; trap catches you. When it comes to mmos its better to be wise then intelligent</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4496738">Expand</a></span>

Some people are complaining about the transportation in the game, but I think it is because they have not experimented with all the ways to travel in the game  apart  from walking and the motorbike, use your brain a bit and soon you will solve this problem that for some others is the end of the world as we know it.
<br>There is not necessary to do missions in the game even when they are really easy to pick up from the board. Leveling is relatively fast (again only if you use your brain. I got level 40 in the second world when it is suppose to happen in the third one)  Regarding the gear: you can loot it, create it, exchange it, buy it in the market with fake money,  and of course the old fashion style &quot;buy it with real money&quot;.
<br>Pay for win or play for win? I did not expend one single coin in the game (Max level right now and still playing) but I will like to help them cause the pretty job they did. So No! no need to spend money to be good in this game, it is absolute Free To Play. So give it a try I will say until level 15, believe me it is really easy to get level 15 and, see if you like it or no, because I am loving it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4499003">Expand</a></span>

Ok so first the bad - the quests can be a bit repetitive and slow, particularly making you go back and fore to the message board to get them, but a number of them are fun. This is a first/third person shooter, so the quests will involve shooting things or rescuing people/stuff and then carrying those things while encumbered and other people shoot at you. I think more could be made of this from an MMO point of view as the progression isn&apos;t exactly linear - but that can be a good thing as well.]
<br>Some of the reviews slating this game are more through the developers making radical changes in patches - although most of hte big changes have been done and I think what we have now is a very playable game.
<br>Now for the good - and there is  A LOT of good in this game. It was originally touted as an e-sports title, and the PvP is very slick. The weapon progression is accessable to everyone and can take time but it is satisfying to be able to play with things like reload speed, magazine size, rate of fire and now additional elemental damage. The graphics are quite stylised, but nice, and the artwork for the environments is still stunning. The freedom of exploration is also still there, although you can&apos;t place Thumpers in as many wierd and wonderful areas as was possible in the past.
<br>Squad thumping with a group is great fun and the classes are able to support each other well in game - it&apos;s intense and frenetic and was always one of the best experiences of the game.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not perfect, and at times it does feel ike there could be more there to do, but rather than an MMO to burn hours of your life in, it&apos;s more like a shooter with progression features which add to the customisation feel of your character, and improve your interaction with the world, and there&apos; alot there to make your character feel unique. Spending hours and hours doing PvE in this can get very dull particularly by yourself, but get a group of friends, and thump or do PvP and this game really shines.
<br>
<br>In short, I&apos;m older and I have less time than when I used to bury myself in an MMO for days at a time and lose track of time.
<br>With family and other commitments, this game fits in nicely, and there still remains the potential for endless expansion and world boss moments like the exciting videos of the original trailers way back when.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not perfect, but there&apos;s much more good than bad and the co-op play can make this game very exciting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4533845">Expand</a></span>

My issue was fixed professionally and quickly within minutes of the first response. The instructions were easy to follow and links were given for all folder locations and all downloads, making it a simple copy and paste or click to get where I needed. The gameplay for this game is unlike any other MMO and that is refreshing. The live events are fun! Seeing an invasion happen, rushing to get to the location and finding yourself in a fierce battle is so much fun! There are plenty of battle-frames to choose from to fit any play style. Not only is the game extremely fun, but if you ever run into any problems, getting help is fast and painless! That makes for a really great experience! Plus, the devs are always listening to the players and constantly improving the game according to what the players recommend! The game is constantly improving, always getting better and better!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4538558">Expand</a></span>

Tried a Wildstar free trial and loved it, but I can&apos;t afford to pay subscription costs. Anyway, I actually heard about this game on Zero Punctuation and figured I&apos;d try it. Surprisingly, I&apos;ve been having an awesome time with Firefall! It&apos;s free to play, but not pay to win, and you can progress at a decent plug without paying. I will probably buy some Red Beans (the game currency) at some point, but right now it&apos;s still playable. The world is fantastically build and the art style is visually appealing. The combat is really fun and varied, and you get a permanent freaking jetpack! Travel is far less tedious than other MMOs, and you don&apos;t have to hunt for quest givers. The game lets you craft everything for free, but if you pay you can speed it up. All-in-all it&apos;s been a great adventure so far, and I will continue playing. The only reason I didn&apos;t give it a 10 is because the enemy and quest models are not very diverse at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4561040">Expand</a></span>

MMO FPS sounds awesome right? Wrong if your FPS skills means very little, most mobs just run and park on top of you at lightning speeds, there are no covers or headshots. Weapons and the whole combat system feels so makeshift and clumsy that I sincerely wished at times to go back to good old MMO style of &quot;select target+spam ability buttons&quot;.
<br>Questing is tedious and boring, every quest is the same. Go to location xyz (half km away) click on 4 objects, kill 6 hostiles, walk back, get some meaningless reward. Repeat. NPCs (Aero/Oilspill) are super annoying and never shut up nor ever say anything meaningful either.
<br>People are praising graphics, but in my opinion (I play on max settings) they are ok-ish. Seen much better even in other MMOs. Some textures are very low rez, character models look really ugly in my opinion, cartoony style art is really unimaginative and used way too often in games today to impress anybody.
<br>Overall I understand R5 is trying to make money, but game is very grindy playing a fremium player. I got bored after about a week. I really tried, Firefall, but you are just not very interesting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4393358">Expand</a></span>

<br>0/10 as 6.2 is WAY more than this game deserves. I would not give it more than a 3(for graphics/soundtrack)
<br>
<br>Overall Summary: Very poorly executed gameplay with a good OST and very good graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/firefall/user-reviews?user_review_id=4398087">Expand</a></span>

The game is very nearly a carbon copy of Global Agenda, a game more highly reviewed by professional and gamer alike. Unsurprisingly, the game has released in a similarly poor launch to a market with less patience. I guess this won&apos;t be the Global Agenda &quot;killer&quot; (as if it needed one) after all.</span>
