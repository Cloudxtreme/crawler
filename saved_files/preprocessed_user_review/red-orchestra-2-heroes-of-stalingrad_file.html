I have played a lot of FPSs and tend to go for the more realistic ones usually.  Add to that my fascination with WW2 and the Eastern front in particular, I think Tripwire does a great job capturing capturing the feeling of the Eastern front.  Gameplay wise, I have tons of fun with this game.  I don&apos;t know what most of these reviewers are doing, but I don&apos;t really encounter many bugs.  The only real fault of this game is the lack of a community and the fact that most servers are just filled with bots.  The best thing you can do for that is to go on the Tripwire forums and find clan/community servers and cherry pick when/where to play.  Europe seems to have a better community of players than the US for sure.  Someone on here went on and on about the caned voices but honestly it isn&apos;t that bad, I like it actually, though I will admit there could be more options for that.  The graphics are good not great, but they do the job effectively.  For a small company, I feel they did a good job, I think it looks good.  I give this title 8.0.  I&apos;d give it higher if there community was stronger.  Still worth picking up if you value tactics over twitch gameplay.  I can play this title for hours, and have a blast.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=2322290">Expand</a></span>

Cover and mantling is very good. The maps are detailed, and offer plenty of dramatic play. The fundamental offering of WW2 combat is met, which gives HOW hope for the future.<br><br>Where HOS falls down is in leaving the realism genre for an arcade offering. More accurately, it tries to straddle the fence, and predictably, slips and nuts itself with a leg on either side. In trying to please both, HOS pleases neither the realism crowd, nor the arcade crowd.<br><br>HOS incorporates all of the tired features of the successful shooters: recon planes, mini-maps, radar, automatic reloading, leveling, and skill grinding. By doing this, it is competing against the biggest gimmick shooter companies. It will lose. TWI does not have the resources to compete on the disposable game market. Therefore, the arcade shooters attracted by bells and whistles will move on to the next game, leaving RO standing in its present state before  the realism audience. This will be a dire moment.<br><br>An example of one of the gimmicks that are not innovative and that get old quickly is the canned voices. The voices are cute at first, but soon get tedious, as they become the same thing over and over again, or give one away as they are trying to be stealthy. The unintended side effect of canned voices is that players are left unable to communicate effectively about the battlefield. This is an example of a major re playability error.  Much more attention should have been given to what players want to say, not what the software is programmed to say.<br><br>The more a game plays itself, the more disposable it is. The more a game needs to be played, the more it will endear itself to the community that made RO successful.  Canned voices is one example of the game being taken away from players.<br><br>That the game lacks any real historical context is another glaring fault that will affect it&apos;s long term chances. The maps start and stop with no contextual background, no information on the units fighting, where they are, or why they are there. There is simply a side start screen, and the map starts. An arbitrary battle that ends in a tired theme song and another canned voice. Modders and map makers will want to tell the story of their contribution. In its present state, HOS is arbitrary in its context, and repetitive in its presentation and conclusion of the map.<br><br>HOS destroys Fog of War with recon planes and maps showing enemy locations. This type of feature firmly implants HOS in the genre of disposable game. The realism community requires the puzzle of combat, the arcade crowd required targets presented at a fast pace. When the arcade players move on, HOS will stand before the realism faithful as a redundant, self-playing game. There are numerous examples of this effect. HOS should have taken advantage of the void re: realism shooters, and entered the game world defiantly, with a solid, realistic game. Instead of blinking-lights, TWI should have focused on features that would make the game dynamic for years to come: flamethrowers, spreading and persistent fire, in-game hero effects, player placed MG positions (not the forever frozen ones it has now) and any other of a myriad of potential things that the scenario of Stalingrad combat gives.  HOS should have stood firm on the requirements of realism shooters. The response to &quot;I don&apos;t know where my enemies are&quot; should not be &quot;Here is a radar&quot;. It should be &quot;listen to the battle, you will learn&quot;.<br><br>It will be very interesting to see where HOS goes from here. The bugs and balance issues will be fixed. What remains to be seen is how the game will rebound from the inevitable disposal it will face, and what the realism faithful will decide to do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1757871">Expand</a></span>

It brings the genre back to it&apos;s 2000-2005 roots to the WW2 era, and merges it with today&apos;s technology to provide an authentic, immersive, beautiful experience. This game plays differently than your popular shooters like Call of Duty and Halo, so it&apos;s not for everyone. It&apos;s definitely catered to a more hardcore audience than most mainstream titles, but still offers game modes for gamers with all tastes. The combat in this game is fast paced, but realistic. There are minimal hud elements, like no crosshairs for instance. Weapon aiming is quite unique, too. Weapons don&apos;t shoot in the center of the screen, but rather the weapon moves with the mouse until you get closer to the edge of the screen, when your camera will shift. For anyone who&apos;s played the Arma series, the aiming is similar to that. Weapon and bullet physics are also very realistic. Firing SMGs in more than 4-5 round bursts will make it impossible to hit a target further than 40-50 meters away. The game also features a full ballistics simulation. Bullet drop and travel time must be taken into account when shooting.<br><br>The game features HUGE maps with up to 64 players. The vehicles in the game feature full 3d-modeled interiors, where players must realistically navigate the inside of the vehicle to move to each position. No more instantly teleporting from the driver seat to the machine gunner seat, for instance. Vehicles also feature realistic damage models. You can take out a tank&apos;s engine by hitting it with an armor piercing round, or even kill the gunner with a well placed shot to the gunner&apos;s seat, rendering the tank useless until another player takes over the position.<br><br>The graphics and sound design are all top notch in this game. The performance was a little shaky in the beta, but in just two weeks time they have greatly improved framerates and reduced lag. Red Orchestra 2 is a must have for anyone who is a fan of first person shooters who want a more authentic experience than mainstream shooters will give you. It is a game that game developers should take notes on when designing games in the future. Tripwire Interactive put a lot of hard work with limited resources into this game, and the result is something extraordinary.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1750787">Expand</a></span>

While playing in the beta, 64 player servers were fun and lag-free until a certain patch toward the end of the beta. Since that patch, the full version is also plagued by the same problem. Pings on 64 player servers are rarely below 150 and often spike up to 400+. This renders the game unplayable for me. I&apos;m forced to join low player servers (32-24) which rarely have over 10 people in them. Also, some of the objects used for cover cause you to glitch up and down rapidly or fall through the map, adding to the atmosphere of bug-filled mess. After multiplayer frustration, decided to take a break and play singleplayer. While there is no real singleplayer (basically multiplayer maps with a slight intro and against bots), I found it fun and intuitive, a nice break from multiplayer. The AI seems smart, but is pretty stupid on normal. They take way too long to aim at you and often times miss every shot. You can play entire levels easily without ever dieing. The other main gripe I had about the AI is that they rarely fire when not behind cover (I don&apos;t even think I have seen one hipfire). Instead they seem to follow certain paths (especially indoors) and will melee any enemy they come across instead of firing their weapon. I am currently stuck on the Axis campaign due to a bug that won&apos;t allow me to progress any further. I already took a break from a game that came out 4 days ago, and my break started yesterday. That in itself shows how frustratingly broken this game can be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1756796">Expand</a></span>

Every little detail contributes to make you spend a great FPS moment. You&apos;ll never want to play a &quot;call of duty&quot; or &quot;Battlefield&quot; ever again after playing RO2. And all of this for a reasonable price and lots of free DLCs coming soon.</span>

The most deadly weapon is not a bullet, but teamwork.<br><br>At the time of release there are still some bugs remaining that I would classify as &apos;minor, momentary annoyance&apos;-type, as opposed to glaring flaws.

The depth of field effects are good; subtle but present, not overdone. Extensive in-game graphics options help widen the range of hardware that can run it well and provide those with high-end hardware the means to get more out of their system.<br>Relatively easy config editing is also possible for very specific video/audio/gameplay tweaks.<br><br>The audio is one of the most impressive parts of &apos;Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad&apos;s repertoire. The positional audio is not just immersive, but vital to your situational awareness. Distant sounds are appropriately dampened, close sounds are easy to locate. All sounds are realistically effected by the environment.<br><br>&apos;Red Orchestra 2&apos; is THE game to get if you want: realistic weapon handling, realistic and complex wounding, emphasis on teamwork, strategy and skill, fully detailed and functional tank interiors, realistic tank armor and armament modeling and more..<br><br>This is NOT the game to get if you are looking for an easy-going casual shooter. &quot;Run and gun&quot; is not the name of the game (but can still be effective if you have surprise). Just one shot will kill you most of the time and you won&apos;t find any aids like crosshairs.<br><br>If you are looking for the things RO2 has to offer, it might just be one of the most innovative and brilliant shooters ever.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1752030">Expand</a></span>

All in all its a different kinda game, and it apparently splits that splits the crowd, at the time of writing this there were: 37 positive 1 mixed and 16 negative, several have voted 1 or 0, which is just a symptom of bugs on some systems. more than 2x positive than negative, negative being mainly due to bugs or RAGE at it not being COD (or Rage :) )... Not that bad for a &quot;niche&quot; game.

It is not a new genre to be sure, bu it is a new style of game-play that lends itself more to team play and taking objectives.  It is in which teens with pwnage complexes or people that simply want the vanilla familiarity of COD can just go away and leave the real gaming to grown ups.  And that is what makes RO2 good.  It does not have the most up to date graphics, and it may still have an occasional bug, but what it doesn&apos;t do is reward players who only care about themselves and never help out the team.  This is not a game in which you go around killing and killing and killing simply to have the best story of how you knifed someone or t-bagged your foe.  The maps are huge and detailed.  Of course some of the negative reviews fail to mention that little point.  Or the 64 players, or the tight shooting, or the fact that the game can look very good with high settings, or the day one modding tools, or custom map making, or TWI being extremely responsive to the community and fixing problems quickly, or that we have true dedicated servers.  RO2 is what PC games should be and certainly more brave than what large developers are willing to make these days.  They are too afraid to kill their cash cows and so we get the same old garbage year after year and wonder why we are so bored of gaming.  Hmm I wonder why that could be?  No RO2 is not perfect, but it is very good and will get better for years to come.  It as some room to improve and it will, but the only reason to give this game a 0 is if you are a ZERO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1751173">Expand</a></span>

If your not playing on Ultra the game looks horrible but on Ultra it looks very presentable and better than COD.<br>Gameplay: Unforgiving. The game plays like older Tactical shooters the kind that went out of style when MW and it&apos;s many clones came into play. If you can stomach games like America Army, Ghost Recon, and Raven shield then this is the game for you. You need allot of patience to play this game as the learning curve is steep and the weapon balance is not even. The mp40 is so much better than all the other guns it&apos;s not even funny. I&apos;ve done fine with the bolts but you can but zero effort into doing well with the mp40 and get about the same you would as your best bolt game.<br>Singleplayer: From what I played the singleplayer is just the multiplayer maps with AI teammates that you control. Its not overly exciting and not enough of a reason to get the game if your not going to play multiplayer.<br>Sound: This game has some of the best positional sound I&apos;ve seen in awhile. You can use it to locate enemies and pinpoint were they are coming from. The music on the other hand just seems to get in the way of gameplay and even turning music down to min doesn&apos;t get rid of it.<br>Controls: If you don&apos;t like toggle well TWI just gives you big middle finger. They want this game to be as clumsy as possible to control and I almost wish it was a console port because at least then it wouldn&apos;t be has ham-fisted. You can edit the ini to allow for hold crouch and ADS but the latter is buggy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1751903">Expand</a></span>

However, its a PC game and for that its a PC game in all of its glory. Wimpy grandma&apos;s PCs need not apply here, the game&apos;s performance tweaks was changing, for better or worse, almost every other day for the beta and at release time its still not right. Yes the game crashes from time to time and on lower end PCs with low memory will crash more often than that. Yes sometimes your view occasionally flip out. Your bullets occasionally do not count. There&apos;s a plethora of UI bugs Etc etc. That doesn&apos;t matter. The game even in its &quot;not quite done but here you can play anyways&quot; state is absolutely fantastic. This is by far THE most realistic yet inviting first person shooter in every respect and steps up and improves greatly in its mechanics over the original Red Orchestra. Tripwire isn&apos;t EA. They don&apos;t ship the game and call it done and already stated that it&apos;s not done, there&apos;s more to add, and you&apos;ll get more (not even considering community content). But the ship date came around (after 5 years in development!) and this is what they have. Enjoy it. It&apos;s a multiplayer game, so enjoy its strengths, and enjoy the new bar for PC games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1751600">Expand</a></span>

<br>If you liked games like the first Red Orchestra, ArmA series, or even games like Bad Company/CoD (hardcore mode), then you should love this game.  If you can actually aim, you should love this game.  If you are super cool (like me), you should also love this game.

Extremely poor performance and catastrophic balance problems.  Also the game devs frequently argue with community members on forums and delete criticizing posts and lock threads which contain criticism.</span>

This is the game for them... but this game is terribly flawed and terrible looking. If they fixed all the bugs, maybe this game would be an 8/10 to those people only... because a game this bad looking is not 10/10 ever.<br><br>Specs:<br>i5 2500K, 8GB RAM, 2x6850... I get 40 FPS staring at a DirectX 9 wall indoors. Outdoors, 30 FPS. Gunfire, less than 30 FPS. All bug related. The beta gave me 50-60 FPS.<br><br>Sever Browser is broken.<br><br>The game is 2004-2006 looking.<br><br>By christmas this game will be fixed up and will make some people happy. But that time is not now. And do not even read all these 10/10 reviews. They are heavily biased.<br><br>This game has potential to be a fun to some, but they released a broken game. 10/10 reviewers should be ashamed for their lies. Nobody can honestly justify 10/10... unless your just some childish fanboy who wants to rip on the BF3/MW3 fans... and want people to believe this is in some way better because it fits their playing preference better.<br><br>If you&apos;re going to take any advice from these User Scores... Don&apos;t. Wait for a free weekend/guest pass, or wait for the Critics review this game. There is clearly a lot of bias going around here, but my advice is to not rush into buying this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1752777">Expand</a></span>

Game is also laggy as get out with hit detection all over the place. Your hits will sometimes register after you die.</span>

Red Orchestra 2 could of been one of the greatest games this year, it was also one title I&apos;ve been waiting for all year. Instead it&apos;s glorified with endless bugs, poor optimization, and unplayable multiplayer due to a broken server browser. They originally delayed the games release for two weeks, those two weeks have past-- they have released their product in an unplayable state, it&apos;s ultimately inexcusable. They have spit on everyone hard earned money who bought their game, shame on them.

There are so many bugs with this game it isn&apos;t even funny. Some people can snipe across the entire map, while others cannot evey get the server browser working. A lot of the menus don&apos;t allow double clicking as confirmation or you&apos;ll get prompts for cmds that don&apos;t respond, or empty a clip into someone and have them turn and one shot you, then there is the prone bug, and people being able to sometimes head shot you through the ground, destroyed tanks, even smoke. But the worst so far must be that the game doesn&apos;t record stats or xp on release so at the moment there is no point in playing multiplayer as you cannot levelup. I&apos;d give this game a 7 if the bugs were fixed but as it currently stands the game is just too broken and buggy. Wait a while and see if they patch it as tripwire generally has a good record with patches but until then don&apos;t buy it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1751867">Expand</a></span>

I reviewed the game soon after its original launch in 2011, and I certainly feel like it was broken them and not functioning as it should. (The beta was running better at the time). But like all Tripwire projects they gave it a lot of ongoing support and it became a really good game.</span>

Every little detail contributes to make you spend a great FPS moment. You&apos;ll never want to play a &quot;call of duty&quot; or &quot;Battlefield&quot; ever again after playing RO2. And all of this for a reasonable price and lots of free DLCs coming soon.</span>

It is not a clone of other FPS games but rather its own action/adventure which will leave  you wanting to snipe off that last Nazi or Soviet. That being stated, RO2 has plenty of problems in terms of bugs, single player campaign, and overall stability at times. Don&apos;t expect the single player campaign to enthrall you and make you replay over and over. It is the least memorable part of the game. So where does this game shine? It shines in its multiplayer atmosphere. Unlike other FPS games, teams must work together to take objectives or take out their opponent. Keeping in mind that the game is about realism is key to survival. A run-and-gun game seen in other FPS games will only get you killed faster in RO2. In short, I recommend this game to fans of real FPS games and are sick of the yearly cardboard cut out from other companies. However, keep in mind that there might be a huge learning curve depending on your skill level and that bugs are to be expected. However, once use to the game mechanics and style, you&apos;ll quickly fall in love with this forgotten gem.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=2652173">Expand</a></span>

I noticed at the time that this game was on free-weekend on steam, and I decided to try it out. I have not had any experience in this series before and that is a shame. The graphics are not maybe as good but they are by no means bad either. Gameplay is sometimes a little bit glitchy but I have not found it to be game breaking. Compared to other games, this game has the proper things a PC game should have. Dedicated servers, Ingame VOIP, Pretty easily made custom maps and I am really looking forward to a couple of mods, mostly Rising Storm and Karelian Front. This game has a totally different feel to me compared to other FPS games. It is really fun to play with friends and strangers alike. Due to some bugs I give this a 9, but the developers are listening to the community on this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=2828668">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a really good game, it just has trouble showing it.  The graphics are improved but the environments seem sparse.  They need more work.  This does much to weaken the atmosphere.  There is so much detail put into the gameplay, though, it&apos;s what I like most about the game.  You can adjust your sights, hold your breath, switch sights on the fly - it&apos;s very well done.  Unfortunately the game suffers from unnecessary limitations - for example, you can&apos;t opt to hold sights instead of toggle, and you can&apos;t turn off or in any way adjust the dreadful gun sway (your gun moves faster than the camera).  It really brings down the score for me personally.  Overall the game feels like it still needs work.  But despite that, it&apos;s still impressive.  A good value considering I got it on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=2535059">Expand</a></span>

So many shooters today do the same freaking thing you would think that one company made them all. In RO happily that is not the case. The combat is intense and not for those with 5 second attention spans. If you want a great game and have taste that cater to the realistic then your should definitely buy this.</span>

<br>
<br>Being a hard core RO1 fan from day 1, I found RO2 to be exactly the same as its predecessor. Immersing, intense &apos;find some cover!&apos; type of a game! people shouting, the intense firefights and the gun shots you suffer from somewhere from the window you never know, single sniper shots that force you to keep your head down because the spawn point is so damn far away, this game needs skills and training! So in short its like a simulator and you need to have that kind of a mindset towards it. In addition, the 64 player support makes it even more intense.
<br>
<br>This is not a run and gun FPS, kindly play something like black ops or Borderlands if it suffices. leave this game to the pros! I give this game a 9. Would be so readily happy to give it a 10 if only the gun sounds had a little more punch!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3095586">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is a hell of alot of fun but the map design is not so great and the tank AI is bloody awful! The graphics for this game are not revolutionary but there not to bad and they get the job done. The game is great with 64 players all running around shooting each other but the cover system is a pain in the ass and I never use because it always gets me shot. The game has a few weird bugs involving moving and by this I mean running and jumping into prone is quite glitchy and I had a few moments where I would climb over a wall and my character would either suddenly decide not to climb over it or bug out and cause my camera to fly all the place which would completely disorientate me.
<br>
<br>Overall I find these bugs to be quite minor and it is the only realistic ww2 FPS your gonna find so I say that if you like realistic FPS&apos;s you should go and buy this ASAP!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3234617">Expand</a></span>

This game is not Call of Duty.  This game is not Battlefield 3.  This game sells itself on its realism.  I will say that it is not quite as realistic at the first Red Orchestra, yet still more realistic than any other WW2 FPS currently out.  I got this game for under 5 bucks and it was probably the best investment I&apos;ve made in a long, long time.  Most of the issues that people are complaining about from when the game was released have been ironed out.  The graphics look great when maxed out and the game play experience is very smooth.  If you have a quad core processor and  mid range video card you wont have problem maxing out this game at all.  Red Orchestra 2 is also constantly being updated, with new maps and game types added from both the developers and the user community.  I noticed many people complaining about the campaign.  This game is not at all meant to be a single player experience.  Sure, you can go in and play the single player campaign, but it&apos;s really just a bunch of bots running around.  This game never sold itself as a single player experience and to be quite honest, if your playing this game for that experience you must be new to PC gaming.  Noobs will struggle to find a groove at first, but one thing that really helps new guys is really just stay alive.  The kills will come and you&apos;ll be loving every second of it.  Another issue that I see people complaining about is the HUD and the voice acting.  The HUD is simple and can be simplified even more, creating a very immersive experience.  Also, you can set the games audio to use the nations native languages (German and Russian) rather than your own team speaking English and the opposite speaking their native tongue.  This helps to create an even more immersive experience in my opinion.  On another note, the sound in the game is quite good.  5.1 surround sound is a fantastic experience when paired up with this game.  Overall, this game was a great buy, as I&apos;ve gotten over 80 hours of gameplay for under 5 bucks and I have no plans to stop anytime soon.  Must have for realism FPS fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3119824">Expand</a></span>

You will find yourself entrenched in gritty war scenes ranging throughout Europe and the Pacific fighting battles where every small arms fire fight will feel greatly rewarding.  The games visuals are slightly aged, but that shouldn&apos;t bother anyone who appreciates truly well thought out game play.  I personally have not touched the single player in this game because of my addiction to finding out new strategies and tactics against human players on the vast battlefields in which the game takes place.  Leaning around cover, blind firing over barriers, tossing (unmarked thank god) grenades into windows, shooting through tiny gaps in walls, and much more makes the immersion in this game fantastic.  Even more fun is the initial charge into battle when the entire team is letting out a fearsome war cry.  I will reiterate, if you like WW2 games, this IS the one for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=3290232">Expand</a></span>

The game may had a few bugs during the release, but most are gone and not really annoying. The only bug that is currently most visible is when ragdolls decide to fly into the map because they just got torn apart by a tank shell, artillery or a grenade. But the gore and the realistic bullet ballistics / 1 shot = 1 kill is splendid. Some reviews here tells the reader that the game doesn&apos;t fullfill the promise of realism, well they must have accidentally played on servers without &apos;&apos;Realism&apos;&apos;-mode.
<br>The game is a truly unique game and feels like Battlefield 1942 but with a more gory and dark atmosphere.
<br>+/-:
<br>+ 64 player servers
<br>+ In-game VOIP
<br>+ Different Soldier Classes
<br>+ Not hundreds of different weapons, with thousands of different accessories.
<br>+ As close you can come a realistic WWII game with &apos;&apos;Realism&apos;&apos;-game mode: 1 deadly bullet = 1 kill.
<br>+ Continued development. (New maps, new weapons, new vehicles)
<br>+ Doesn&apos;t require a specific level to get to play with the class you want and the weapon you wishes for.
<br>+ Dedicated servers.
<br>+ Earn upgrades to your weapons when you kill enough enemies to level up your weapon.
<br>- Not as popular as other FPS-games, needs more PR? It&apos;s sad to see a great FPS game have less players than a free2play game as War Thunder with it&apos;s 3000 players online.
<br>- Countdown, if you don&apos;t cap the next capture zone within a few minutes, then a clock starts ticking down.
<br>- Arad2, what can I say. It&apos;s not a successful or popular map with it&apos;s large open area and mostly tanks.
<br>Not so much else.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=4428689">Expand</a></span>

Tripwire Interactive listened to both player and industry criticism, and responded by creating 2 entirely new modes of experiencing the game, the classic mode for Ostfront players, and the action mode for industry critics who believed the game to be inaccessible to casual players. Additionally, the vast majority of bugs in the game, which the community assisted in identifying, have been resolved. For the vast majority of players, the game is technically excellent. There is a control interface which players can manipulate a variety of graphic factors from a Low to Ultra setting. This allows players to manipulate the graphic template of the game to suit their particular processing speeds &amp; allowances. Such visual effects (but not limited to) of artillery exploding, destructible surfaces, bullet cracks, and suppression effects-- are all amazing. As gameplay is concerned; Heroes of Stalingrad, similar to the first game in the Red Orchestra (RO) franchise, Red Orchestra: Ostfront, is a challenging, difficult game. It is a game where one bullet kills characters. It is a game where the character becomes tired, or suppressed by enemy gunfire, or despondent. It is a game where your weapon may sway, or that you need to brace your weapon for an accurate shot. It is a game where one minute, you may be assaulting a postion, and the next, running for your life away from it. It&apos;s a game where players use bayonets &amp; rifle butts to kill each other in close combat, is not uncommon. There are many ways to play the game. There is a character progression system from Raw Recruit up to the Hero class, and there are many different specialties such as sniper marksmen, or squad leader, to progress as. Players become more proficient a number of attributes with progression.  Success on the battlefield depends on one side or the other occupying objective areas, or &apos;cap zones&apos;, and characters who participate in team-oriented play by taking these &apos;cap zones&apos; are rewarded with points used in their progression. Red Orchestra: Heroes of Stalingrad, is an intensely satisfying game experience. It&apos;s also a very demanding one. Heroes of Stalingrad is the best WWII tactical FPS on the market. To be a member of the Heroes of Stalingrad community is to be one of the Few &amp; the Proud of the gaming elite.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=2450271">Expand</a></span>

In a market dominated by testosterone pumped macho men saving the world Red Orchestra 2 takes a step back into the harsh reality of World War 2.<br>The individual player cannot win a war by his self. To succeed one is going to need to coordinate with your team, however this doesn&apos;t go without saying that player skill is still quite valuable. Completing objectives and working with the team nets XP, which is used to level up your honor. As the player levels up, his character becomes visibly more grizzled. Weapons also level up, and they do so individually. Through the different levels a weapon will gradually become more clean, and eventually the standard issue version of the weapon. Levelling a class or weapon will even increase certain stats such as suppression resistance, accuracy, stamina, and other significant factors in fighting. These stat increases aren&apos;t overpowering or unbalanced as they don&apos;t directly increase factors such as damage, instead they indirectly aid the player in accomplishing his or her goals. The entire stat system contributes in making everything you do rewarding. Firefights in Red Orchestra 2 are intense and satisfying experiences. Sound design, the breathing system, and damage modelling collaborate to turn gunfights into strategic encounters requiring both fast reflexes and smart tactics. It is possible to hit various organs inside an enemy&apos;s body as the game has in-depth damage modelling. A shot in the heart is an instant kill whereas a shot in the gut will take some time to bleed out. When a player is shot he can apply a bandage which negates all of the effects of being shot. There is a limited number of two bandages per life so the player will have to take care to avoid being shot. Aiming is drastically different from most first person shooters. The weapon in your hands is not glued to the center of the screen, but instead it moves with your mouse. Weapons also collide with in-game geometry such as walls and fences which adds a nice touch of immersion to the experience. A third person shooter inspired cover system is also implemented, but in a first person perspective. When taking cover a player can blindfire from cover or pop out and fire much like in the typical third person shooter, however it is quite different as you are not aware of where the enemy is until you pop out of cover. This system works very well and is essential for winning a firefight.<br>The atmosphere in this game is unprecedented. Teammates around the player constantly say context sensitive lines about the current situation, and in some cases another player&apos;s character will reply. Suppression also ties into this as a character under fire will inform his team that he is pinned down. When a player dies it is usually accompanied with the character calling for his mother or even horrific gurgling noises; there was many a time that I was almost saddened by killing the enemy in front of me. In culmination the character lines, gritty art direction, and environments within the game depict the horrors of war in a very effective manner.<br>Though it had a rough launch, Red Orchestra 2 managed to enthrall me with its many features and depth filled gameplay. Don&apos;t let those who can&apos;t over look some technical flaws in this game fool you, this is well worth the money and then some. Thirty dollars for this game is almost undercutting the developers with the effort and attention to detail they put into the game, and I would happily more for this masterpiece. Even the so-called &apos;triple A titles&apos; can&apos;t live up to the work of art that is Red Orchestra 2, and I doubt that they ever will.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1784111">Expand</a></span>

<br>&quot;Game is clunky.&quot; (upgrade system or wait for patch!) &quot;action key bound to many things.&quot; (remap them to seperate keys!)
<br>&quot;hit detection all over&quot; (realistic bullet drop!)
<br>&quot;hits register after you die&quot; (server side feature to prevent unrealistically knowing you got kill you didn&apos;t see!) This game ROCKS, people that can&apos;t handle more realistic options need to go back to Halo.</span>

The game simply is not yet finished.  The gameplay is engrossing, realistic, and incredibly fun.  Unfortunately, the experience is hampered by a variety of issues - poor performance, inconsistent lag, crashes to desktop, and various minor bugs.  My system meets and exceeds the recommended requirements, yet averages 30 fps on custom settings with everything set on either low or medium and 1280x720.  I have even made a number of config file tweaks which have yielded no significant performance improvements.  As someone who is a big fan of Red Orchestra Ostfront and Killing Floor, Red Orchestra 2, so far, is a huge disappointment.  Tripwire continues to work on resolving current issues, but in fairness, should have delayed release of this game until further work could be done on it.  The single player campaign is a complete waste of time.  It consists of offline skirmishes against bots whose AI is so atrocious you will breeze through it even on the higher difficulties.  There is no reason this game needed a single player campaign.  I would&apos;ve been much happier with a more robust online mode THAT WORKED than have a multiplayer FPS with a tacked on single player mode, which is what the game is now.  If you are considering buying this game, I would wait and advise you to monitor the Steam and Tripwire forums until major updates have resolved the major issues and improved performance.  While the launch may have been a disaster, I have high hopes this game will overcome its hurdles and prove itself the best multiplayer FPS experience of 2011.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1761602">Expand</a></span>

It is much closer to ARMA2 than it is BF2. For those who are reading to see what this is about, this is a game where there&apos;s no cross hair (and no, it doesn&apos;t mean the center of the screen is where you shoot), your gun moves independently on the screen so where it points is where the shot will go, there&apos;s no cone of spread. Realistically modelled ballistic with penetration system, a thorough display of firearm understanding (ability to switch to iron sight with sniper rifles, manual bolting a bolt action rifle, ability to dial range on weapons, and ability to perform tactical reload and press check to estimate ammo left in weapon) When you are hit, 7 times out of 10, you&apos;ll go down, same goes with the enemy.<br><br>This is a far more polished game than the first one was, however, the first game was an unpolished bus, this game is a more polished... bike? not sure if that metaphor even make sense but I hope it did. Anyone who&apos;s played the first game or claim that they do, shouldn&apos;t and wouldn&apos;t give a low score based on the release, TripWire&apos;s track record means you&apos;ll get atleast twice the content in a year&apos;s time, and it will continue to grow. Many of the original features have been taken out, but new ones added in, this feels more like a polished, little multiplayer game, than the previous, massive, unfinished (but ever changing/evolving) UT mod. Few changes though: We can no longer bail from a tank, or shoot weapons out of someone&apos;s hand. Maps are considerably smaller than the first game, so while you can dial your rifle&apos;s range up to 1500m, the maximum engage range is around 250m, everything is a lot more controlled, but not necessarily in a good way. One of the worst thing about the game, is the terribly voice acting, how hard is it to get a German and a Russian to voice in their native languages? With TripWire&apos;s massive German and Russian fanbase, I&apos;m sure someone would love to volunteer to do it? Hope this would be addressed soon too. It&apos;s very annoying that many of the low reviews are from people who clearly are frustrated because of its completely unique game mechanics, and thereby sucking completely, or fanboys from other FPS games giving useless reviews to pull down the score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1753359">Expand</a></span>

What remains to be fixed are some annoying gameplay issues that might take a bit longer to resolve - notably broken achievements, unlocks, and statistics. Nevertheless, the game is still very fun and quite challenging. Most of the maps are balanced and well done, although the instant death caused by inadvertently straying into an out-of-bounds area is extremely annoying. The clunky interface screens are the worst part of the game but this is quickly dismissed once you are actually in a match since combat is compelling and immersive. The achievements are generally uninspiring but that&apos;s a minor disappointment. It would be nice if there were more rewards and unlocks - what&apos;s there feels like simply the start of what could have been a great progression system. Vehicle controls are a bit frustrating and the weapon selection limited but fortunately the developer has plans to improve these. The game has a variety of different classes and weapons but the gaps are notable and frustrating (there are no classes for vehicles, there are no stats tracked for vehicle or grenade kills, some weapons have levels yet others don&apos;t). Statistics are also limited (no end-of-match stats for number of deaths, team kills, etc). The single player campaign is essentially an underwhelming tutorial/practise session. However, despite the rough edges, the multi-player game experience is much more compelling than either of the more popular Call of Duty or Battlefield franchises. The game requires considerably more teamwork and squad tactics and the atmosphere and realism is a much closer approximation to World War 2 infantry combat than any other than any other first-person shooter. If you are willing to look past the statistics tracking fiasco, the game is quite good and certainly a worthwhile puchase considering how invested the developer is its improvement.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1772238">Expand</a></span>

Thinking tactically instead of rushing straight towards the enemy is really great, which we saw in so many fps shooters before. I love to play it but there are some things that need to be enhanced. Small things but all together they lower the game to something it doesn&apos;t deserve.<br>One of the most important things is maneuverability. If u run towards a cover and quickly want to dive prone it happens that you get the message &quot;cannot lay prone here&quot; where there are no obstacles around you. If seconds count it can be really frustrating to stay standing in a crater and get directly shot. Another fact is that there is too much difference between the ability to look around with iron sights on or off. It feels sturdy and you&apos;ll die a lot trying to swiftly aim on an enemy after running cause without aiming in this game you&apos;re completely lost.  Another thing is shooting out of cover. It happens you&apos;ll be in a trench trying to aim but if you stay crouched you see the top side of the trench, nicely made as you&apos;ll discover in detail but you want to see the enemy, so the only solution is to stand where not only your head is waving like a giant out of the trench &quot;here I am&quot; but your torso sticks out too. I mean why make a cover place where u can only stay behind or get shot, it should cover your aiming and not work against you.<br>A great thing is the possibility of being a commander who has great responsibility. He can make the difference by laying artillery at good spots, asking for recon if none knows where fire is coming from and force re-spawn and has two smoke grenades which are probably the most important part of an attacking force. The downside of this great future is that it can be taken by players who play it for the first time. They do nothing, order nothing,... Why not couple the function to a certain level of experience in other classes such as squad leaders. They steadily learn the game with responsibility but not all. And if you want to kick them out of their role not one single dude reacts. Why? Cause every message, advertising for the server, joining of new players is all listed in white lines. You can&apos;t read it all in the heat of the fight so why not highlight certain important items in red? 2 seconds and it&apos;s gone and you can&apos;t vote on the same player twice. So there you are, play the entire game with a noob commander and the only shell you&apos;ll meet is one of the enemy.<br>Great things why you should buy it? I have the feeling since playing Killing Floor that Tripwire listens to their customers and probably patch it further.<br>The game is really adrenaline filled when you have a good team and you can be shot from every angle by snipers, artillery. The maps are so big you can easily outflank an enemy, lay up defences from flanks, cover your advance with smoke grenades, lure the enemy in a risky attack. Classes are well made with realistic guns, aaargh the reloading, and according sound. You have so many weapons per class that you&apos;ll need many hours to upgrade them, including yourself. The first games you play on any map is total chaos, you don&apos;t know where to run, what to do which makes  the difference between an elite and a rookie very high. And the in game voices are priceless. Charge to your enemy while taunting with 32 other teammates will stay in your memory for a long time...Cheers</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=2442115">Expand</a></span>

Some of the glitches include enemies sliding across the floor, appearing to be dead but they are actually still alive. Some enemies will vibrate in place, etc. Problems with the difficulty are common, where some enemies don&apos;t attack, and others will try to melee and not shoot. Then it gets really challenging when the enemies hide and get critical hits whenever you do so much as peek your head above cover.  The missions are excellent, however it can be argued that the Soviet campaign is almost the same as the German campaign except instead of many Offensive missions it has many Defensive missions. Sometimes Red Orchestra 2 can be extremely frustrating, and sometimes it is extremely fun. It&apos;s a dark and mature game, and if you can get it for $20 or less, go for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=2958167">Expand</a></span>

Today there are still some issues left and we didn&apos;t receive everything that was promised by TWI. Several major parts are missing that could really improve the game  like vehicles, more tanks, a friendship system, customizing options and actual destructible environment.</span>

After getting into a game and getting decent frames(30 FPS) You get dumbed down CoD style maps and a ranking and unlock system. I thought this game was supposed to be realistic not an arcade shooter? In Ostfront 41-42 I could easily choose my class and have a selection of 1-3 weapons used by the real soldiers of that faction. The classes were still there though. After playing a few hours i had made my decision. I bought a game that had small maps with BF2 like gameplay and it didn&apos;t even run. On to the developer opinion: After waiting for about a week for news about Crossfire users TWI finally posted something. They basically said AMD Corssfire users were having bottleneck issues between their CPUs and GPUs. If this is the case then why can I run BBFBC2 and the BF3 beta @ 100+ frames @ max settings? very disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1792208">Expand</a></span>

The only reason why there are bad view&apos;s is because in today&apos;s games they dumb it down for today&apos;s gamers. So when a good game comes out that actually requires skills, teamwork, and using your brain instead of running around shooting dying respawning and doing the same thing. This isn&apos;t your money grab Modern Warfare game or Battlefield, it&apos;s a game made by gamers for gamers. This game is flawless when it forces people to work together, and puts your shooter skills to the test. I like it very much, the fact that you don&apos;t have people spawning where ever they please quick scoping and firing from the hip like it&apos;s no trouble. The game was simply not designed to accommodate people who can&apos;t handle difficulty.  Which is a very good thing, that way we&apos;ll always be up against skillful people who are very good at shooters, instead of having to deal with 90% noob&apos;s and waiting for that 10% group of skilled people.  The only problem are yes, its bugs, and some of its annoying mechanics. The most of which piss me off would be that the muting players is seemingly broken, and the vote system is broken. Otherwise there really isn&apos;t much bad to be said about the game. It&apos;s a good challenging shooter, like no other.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1753669">Expand</a></span>

I know some people like this game, and I am not going to say it is trash. But I am not alone here, and I know countless people who refuse to even play the game anymore due to its instability, poorly made maps. RO2 is spray and pray game just like COD. Lets talk about controls: Left CTRL is a magic button. With this button you can hide behind wall, give ammo, pick up weapon, use bandage. Problem is for example if a weapon is near a wall and than you have a hard time if you wish to pick it up. Unlocking system in RO2 is a horror I just cannot explain how bad unlocking system is. Don&apos;t waste you money on this half product.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1804075">Expand</a></span>

Probably sold so much because of stupid hats, Worst $60 I ever spent in my life. I really want my money back. Oh and the most terrible thing in this game is the tank gameplay, Its just absolutely ****</span>

The gameplay is great because it requires tactics. Whenever you get a kill, you feel accomplished. Whenever you die, you feel disappointed that you let it happen. If you think you&apos;re good in FPS games, you need to play RO2 to test your skills on the battlefield. During my time playing, it was somewhat hard to point out who&apos;s my team, and my foes. You have to remember what colour/design of the outfit your team and foes are wearing or else you might end up screwing up. My final thoughts on this game: There are a few minor bugs in the game during launch, but that&apos;s okay. It doesn&apos;t affect me to the point where it&apos;s a big deal. Hopefully they will iron out the bugs and of course, optimize the game better. Other then that, I give this game an 8/10. It&apos;s unique, complex and fun. This game is definitely worth the money. Tripwire Interactive is doing a great job when it comes to PC games. Hopefully they don&apos;t give up on this game after a month or so.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1752248">Expand</a></span>

Save your money and read a book. I thought the time effort and money I put onto researching and eventually buying this game a shrew investment which would be an enjoyable and tactical feast of game play with some good visuals. I am afraid I am wrong in every way. RO2 is one of the least enjoyable games I have played for sometime. It is like playing a very dull flight simulator only on the battlefield.
<br>I will put it simply this is like Call of Duty 2 trying to be a simulator and taking every enjoyable aspect out of the gameplay. Sorry to compare but this is exactly how it feels.
<br>Controls are wooden fiddly and non intuitive. Graphics are woeful. The occasional hue, sun glare, and haze effects do not detract from virtually zero detail and textures and just plain dull graphics. The &quot;tank&quot; view is hysterical like something seen from a ZX spectrum from the 80&apos;s. Worst of all the sound is laughable and the effects close to appalling. Other issues are dull gameplay and uninspiring maps with no feel or soul. The reason I bought this game is that I was sold on this. If the game was as massive as ARMA 2 then I would forgive the lack of graphical depth, however the maps are probably only twice the size of CoD games.
<br>The only reason to buy this game in my opinion is that you have a specific interest with the developers of from people who know the developers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=2578285">Expand</a></span>

Whether the genre is to whither and die, in the hurricane of change and stagnation or rise and shine and become more popular then ever before remains to be seen. This being finally a AAA game means that Tripwire has a chance right now at this very moment to establish itself firmly, and guarantee a fun experience blending arcade and realism, without anything too boring. This genre is my favorite and I cannot deny it. If you like these kinds of games just buy the game. But be prepared for bugs, yet fear not! Tripwire works hard to iron them out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1776820">Expand</a></span>

For some perspective, I am a diehard fan of the original and have a strong interest in the history of the Eastern front; I played a LOT of RO1, and while I didn&apos;t expect the same game with better graphics, I did expect a similar feel.<br><br>I only got that feel under layers of pointless and totally contrived unlocks, an excess of automatic weapons, and general speeding-up of things like shouldering weapons or reloading which results in almost Call of Duty-like moments every now and then. Don&apos;t get me wrong, this game is NOT a twitch shooter. The lethality of weapons is still quite good, and the way they handle is as lifelike as we are ever likely to see in a game. Animations are great and look very natural, movement is flowing (a huge improvement over the original). Tanks in particular are drastically improved, you actually feel like you&apos;re driving a giant 30-ton steel monster now.<br><br>But there are oh so many problems. The faster pacing and the proliferation of SMGs and semiautos means you&apos;re lucky to see more than 5-10 bolt actions on a full 32-player team... not just historically wrong, but also detrimental to the tense, deliberate gameplay RO is known for. The unlock system was pretty obviously thrown together as an afterthought to try and attract more fans of mainstream shooters, as some weapons cannot be upgraded at all and others only have cosmetic upgrades. The upgrades themselves are often contrived (going from a brand-new 1943 scope design to a clunkier postwar design with the MN91/30 sniper rifle, upgrading to a 75-round saddle drum only used on aircraft for the MG34, and in the case of the G41, a 1943 scope on a 1944 mount for an entirely different rifle - all this for a game set in Aug &apos;42 to Feb &apos;43) and were added with little to no concern for balance. So far the map design fails to even approach that of the earlier game; the two maps Tripwire chose to remake are not the ones I would&apos;ve picked, that&apos;s for certain. The visuals aren&apos;t bad (they&apos;re actually pretty nice in places), but it&apos;s clear that Tripwire&apos;s art team don&apos;t have much experience with current-gen art assets. Performance is pot luck, with some people having no issues and others finding the game unplayable. The game itself is rife with bugs, even so many weeks after release (and following several large patches). The sound design is mostly good, but the accented English voice acting is terribly written and awfully read. Native voices, which are superb, cannot currently be enabled without swapping critical game files - risky with VAC and Punkbuster running. Tripwire did promise there would be an option for this, but none has been added yet. While issues with stat tracking were fixed, it gave a worrying insight into what the game will be like in a month or a year when everyone has a hero character - any semblance of historical authenticity goes out the window when Soviet troops are running around with scoped MKb.42 rifles.<br><br>I really, really worry about this game&apos;s future. Underneath all the slapped-on rubbish lies the greatest shooter I have ever seen. The mechanics are sound, the feel is great, and the satisfaction to be had is immense... you just have to swim through the sea of unlocked fantasy weapons, poor English voice acting, and schizophrenic map design to get to it. The game is rapidly turning into a ghost town only a few weeks after release, and I hope this is a lesson to Tripwire about leaving their niche to try and take money from the CoD/BF crowd... but from the attitude they&apos;ve been displaying on their forums, I doubt it&apos;s sunk in.<br><br>My advice? Wait for a sale, and get excited for the mods that are in the works. I really wish I could give this game a 10 now, but it seems it&apos;s up to the community to make it what it should have been (and what the devs promised us it would be).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1795339">Expand</a></span>

Though it is true that it was a little unplayable on release day, by now almost all of the bugs (for me at least) are gone. I still hear of others having them, but it has really smoothed out and the speed of this refinement is quite impressive, making me like the developers even more. On the merits of the game, it is indeed a niche game. If you think COD is in anyway even representative of how a battlefield should look like, don&apos;t even bother. But if you want to experience the terror of bullets whizzing by and the fear that the next one may kill you or it could pass by and you live on, then this game is for you. This feeling of being in the soldier&apos;s head is highly rewarding and adds a new level to the game. The gameplay itself does have its downsides as it can be extremely frustrating to charge across the battlefield only to get picked off by one shot. Or to be stalking a man in your sights for 5 minutes, only to have him find you and pick you off at 200m. This, though frustrating, is what makes the game great, as it gives an excellent feel for realism (of course it&apos;s still a video game) and it makes actually getting a kill that much more rewarding.<br><br>The graphics aren&apos;t too impressive, if you crank them up to high (they start on low) it looks okay, but that&apos;s really not what this game is about, it is about intense gameplay, not thrilling graphics and killer action.<br><br>The controls are pretty standard, though it is noticeable how usable the mounted weapons as they act freely with the environment, letting you move around and change positions without having to unmount then remount. Instead your character just drags his gun into position, remounting when you&apos;re in the right spot. Though this sounds trivial, it makes using machine guns much easier and is of course more realistic as firing a light machine from the shoulder or the hip is extremely hard. There are so many other little things that give this game so much depth. Some other examples are the 3D sniper scopes, the actually usable cover system, the having to climb to different positions in a tank to replace a dead man, and much, much more.<br><br>So, in summary, if you want a soft, easy game to play, this probably isn&apos;t it. However, if you have any interest in WWII history and want to feel a more realistic FPS, then you perfectly fit the niche for this superb, though still slightly bugged game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad/user-reviews?user_review_id=1763164">Expand</a></span>

This game instills a level of fear and panic and really captures the vibe of the german-russian battles were both sides were desperate.  Unlike other shooters your not some unstoppable killing machine,  you are just a scared solider caught up in a war much bigger than anything ever before it.  You will die in 1 bullet most of the time and you will die often, you will be anxious.

For me, it succeeds in all these things.<br><br>The reason it will divide opinion, and when I say divide, I mean Black and white. There are no shades of grey here. The reason is expectation.

This is not for you.<br><br>What RO2 does have is tense team-based gameplay (In so far as you are more likely to succeed as a team player) Incredible immersion where you actually feel thrilled to get the kill instead of it being another stat. It plays at a slower more realistic pace than most FPS games and actually involves a lot of skill in your chosen role. It is tense, heightens the senses, and is just so refreshing from the over bearing forces of modern FPS games. When you kill an opponent, capture an area, push back an assault, or just simply stay alive in the face of adversity. You really feel like you have achieved something. Not many games make you feel this way.<br><br>It drags you into its darkness and holds you fast to the horror of warfare. Quite an achievement for an online shooter. You fancy some of that immersion?

Many of those who followed step 1 will not have any other reviews, or has a history of giving unusually high/unrealistic reviews. Companies use certain people to plant false review information as well. Discount these reviews at all costs. 3) Read every negative comment you find, and see how many of them complain about the same issues.
