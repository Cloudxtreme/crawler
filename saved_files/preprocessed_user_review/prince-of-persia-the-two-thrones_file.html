This game has a few bugs though, sometimes the prince gets stuck sometimes and the game becomes unplayable and I&apos;d have to restart the game to continue! And it shows &quot;analog sticks&quot; instead of moving the mouse. It shows the buttons right, though (Left-click, right-click, space, etc.). And it doesn&apos;t properly support widescreen and doesn&apos;t show buttons on the Xbox 360 controller properly (I don&apos;t understand what&apos;s button 1 and button 7 on my controller). Anyways, it&apos;s a great game and worth playing. I felt it was a bit too easy, but nevertheless, it&apos;s an awesome game. I played it again now! It&apos;s a masterpiece, but has a few short flaws. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia-the-two-thrones/user-reviews?user_review_id=3177379">Expand</a></span>

The story is probably the weakest factor of the game, with plenty of plotholes here and there.
<br>Then there&apos;s the graphics that I personally love. They look great and are very fitting. The only downside to the graphics are the textures that, when inspected closely looks like a bunch of pixels put together.
<br>The music is that Persian kind of music that really fits the game. The best track was probably the stealth theme that would play when the Prince assassinates his enemies.
<br>Said gameplay of Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones is the games biggest and greatest factor. Running along the walls of Babylon is a blast, as is backstabbing your enemies. Something that&apos;ll result in a speed-kill. A speed-kill is basically a quick-time event where you push the attack button each time your dagger lights up. Actually, stealth is probably the way a lot of player will play. This is because it&apos;s a lot easier. Something that&apos;ll prove useful later in the game. Another new mechanic in Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones is the dark Prince. A more powerful and shadowy version of the Prince. This isn&apos;t really that fun to play with as the Prince&apos;s health will drain each second. Luckily you&apos;ll only play as the dark Prince 25-33% of the whole game.
<br>So is this a good game? Of course it is! Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones is a good and fun action-adventure with great gameplay, good music, good graphics and a so-so story. In the end, Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones gets a 8 out of 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia-the-two-thrones/user-reviews?user_review_id=3425973">Expand</a></span>

Set straight after Warrior Within&apos;s events the Prince returns with Kaileena to Babylon where he finds it under war by none other than the Vizier himself, come back to life because of the events at the Island of Time. The combat is typical of the previous game but made slightly better, adding combos and giving the ability to steal weapons and kill and enemy at the same time without looking up a secret guide on the Internet like on Prince of Persia: Warrior Within. Thing is though, they start moving away from combat in this game bringing in stealth kills called in this game Speed Kills. If the Prince is undetected and behind in enemy or in acrobatic placement he can do an animated Speed Kill which is quick, deadly and stylish through a series of left clicks when his weapons glow. Yes they&apos;re quick times but they&apos;re fun ones that are easy to do! The graphics are like Prince of Persia: Warrior Within&apos;s yet vastly better! The Prince also now has random encounters where he&apos;ll be transformed into his dark side, his evil side, his Dark Prince! He has a whole new combo system and looks completely different! The best part is when the Prince transforms back the Sand infection spreads up his arm more and more, each time he transforms! Like the other two games before this one has Life Upgrades but unlike Prince of Persia: Warrior Within are less hidden but still a challenge. Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones is a great game and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to feel the Prince&apos;s true acrobatic and fighting prowess and someone who wants to see the outcome of the Prince&apos;s story! Trust me, if you&apos;ve played all the others before, the ending will make you cry! I did!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia-the-two-thrones/user-reviews?user_review_id=1726547">Expand</a></span>

Graphics are a tad dated on the one hand, but on the other hand it makes for a game that can be ran well, unlike FEAR or Doom 3. The controls are difficult to get used to. I wished that the camera angle was fixed to following behind the character and free look was activated by a keyboard button. It is difficult get your bearings when facing off with multiple foes because of the always-on freelook, but the attack moves and combos are great, a lot of variety. The save system is the biggest flaw. You can only save every so often at certain points. There should be a quicksave feature, because some of the acrobatic/climbing/jumping maneuvers are difficult and have to be rehearsed until you get the hang of it, and if you fall to your death, you are sent back a bit, and have to repeat the same maneuvers which you had done previously. Fantastic music, I actually keep the volume for the in-game music turned up, unlie the irritating thmuping music in Half-Life 2. Nice cut scene graphics as well. The only bug I have encoutnered is that the mouse cursor in the in-game options menu occasonally freezes, requiring a restart.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia-the-two-thrones/user-reviews?user_review_id=384767">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s the best 3D prince of persia game. Having been developed before video games because mainstream garbage, it has decent difficulty, unlike the new prince of persia games. And it feels good to play something that isn&apos;t crap nowadays, so I try old games. It&apos;s fun if you like the genre of jumping from ledge to ledge, as in tomb raider, if you have no idea what is this genre then pick up the game even more because it will be a fresh awesome experience. The combat system is the worst part of the game although it is good that you can kill enemies instantly in this prince of persia, by backstabbing them strategically. IF you fail to do that, you have to have a boring battle with them, so i guess that&apos;s incentive to get it right! The levels are creative, well done, there are some challenging puzzles, the levels are never repetitive, and yes the game is actually challenging which is very well appreciated. The graphics are outdated at this point but who cares. Although the levels aren&apos;t repetitive the basic game mechanics somewhat are, this game has the feel of good without being great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/prince-of-persia-the-two-thrones/user-reviews?user_review_id=2444203">Expand</a></span>

<br>I am writing a brief review of the PC Port, so i will hola people who claim this was a very good Console game.  However, the PC Port is beyond ridiculous - it is a spit in the face of PC Gamers.
<br>Ubiosoft, are you responsible?  If so - my money will go somewhere else henceforth.</span>

<br>
<br>By far the best and the most fun of the trilogy. There&apos;s never a dull moment. Chain slicing sand monsters and stabbing walls with the dagger to reach high places is oddly satisfying every time. Acrobatics are so smooth you feel freedom and get to feel cool as you reach unreachable high places.
<br>
<br>Also it&apos;s the first one in the series to add some real personality to the characters, making the story feel more real as you face the greatest antagonist yet - yourself. I loved the dynamic between The Prince and Farah, and even more so between the noble and serious Prince and the evil and wisecracking Dark Prince.
<br>
<br>Lots of changes in scenery and in the flow of the story and gameplay helped the game remain diverse and avoid becoming repetitive and monotonous.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately even this entry is still plagued by bad camera. In fact, it has the worst camera controls of the trilogy. Mouse movement is so stiff it takes forever to turn the camera, obviously because of the lack of proper mouse support.
