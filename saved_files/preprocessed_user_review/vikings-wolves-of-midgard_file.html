Don&apos;t expect massive amounts of loot or infinite replayability, though. However, the game offers 20+ hours of fun combat in a fantastic norse mythology setting and amazing set-pieces. Graphics are very nice and support up to 4K resolutions on PC. Combat is very challenging and additional depth is being offered through weapon and armour crafting as well as rune additions and a customizable skill tree to suit your playstyle (dual-wield, swords, axes or ranged weapons). Use of magic and skills is absolutely required and make the game and its many different foes, sub-bosses and end-bosses very interesting. This is no stupid hack &amp; slash like in other ARPG games but careful timing and skill execution is indeed needed for even minor enemies. If you like a somewhat more complex and challenging ARPG, Vikings Wolves of Midgard is a good choice. 8/10 cross-posting from my blog.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vikings-wolves-of-midgard/user-reviews?user_review_id=7174672">Expand</a></span>

I don&apos;t love Diablo, I love the Vikings, and yet not regret the purchase. Fps with no problems at all, good optimization, and at the moment with technical problems encountered, although the Incentive is there anyone complains about the optimization. But what me personally is a bit annoying is the fact that male characters voiced by the same actor (as I understand).
<br>The gameplay is brisk, which is typical ARPG. Kill enemies, collect loot, sway - no surprises. Although the developers have added mechanics of &quot;impacts&quot; - when, for example, bitter cold and you mernisi, so you need to warm up. Variety. You can still roll that sometimes helps (especially the first boss).
<br>Classes as such, but there are gods that you worship, it is possible to choose Loki hack and all axes, then choose another weapon and you worship Odin, and you have other abilities.
<br>Me interested in the game setting. And the enemies look cool, especially the bosses. One of the major advantages is the soundtrack. The most memorable song played in the menu, but in battle you are accompanied by a bouncy tune that will not get the hump (well, pre-order give the soundtrack).
<br>As for me, Vikings - Wolves of Midgard came out not worse than Diablo 3 .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vikings-wolves-of-midgard/user-reviews?user_review_id=7148957">Expand</a></span>

Got a lot of flack at release for bugs but majority of them were ironed out within the first couple weeks if release. The game isn&apos;t the longest but it is fun to build up your village and has a unique way of leveling up. Great with a controller and can be difficult but not impossible (I only played at regular difficulty). Give this game chance and play it yourself, best to grab it during a sale as I don&apos;t really think the quantity of content is worth the release price. Other than that a great time playing the game and posted this to pull up the score on a  game that was well worked on and continues to get support from the devs. People complained about it not having native support for 4k at launch and give it negatives or zeros, what is wrong with people these days? I&apos;d honestly give it a 8.5/10, higher if they add more content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vikings-wolves-of-midgard/user-reviews?user_review_id=7342292">Expand</a></span>

<br>First playthrough is... boring.
<br>Everything after this - worthless. U get everything deleted except of your skilltree (even the +% of whatever by leveling up - deleted!)
<br>So, i u wanna buy a game with 12h Content, many bugs and scripted loot......</span>

Other than completing 3 challenges within an area it really is just a march to the boss. The areas are pretty easy though. You rarely have to worry about dying. Then you get to the final area where the boss is and basically the difficult spikes to the unrealistic. Pretty much every boss has minions that attack either at the same time or before the boss. There is no health potions per se so you can heal a couple of times at most. If the boss fight has a fixed set of minions (how you regen health) then you basically get to the boss and have no health regen left. The boss then tends to either do a massive amount of damage or freeze/stun you and then stomp you. The areas are small so there is almost no place to hide and, without regen, you are just a couple of hits away from death. When you die you have to redo the whole boss battle. The area you just marched through to get to the boss provided no real benefit. This is the personification of bad game balancing.  Even if you replay and replay an area over and over again to level it takes far too many times to get to the level you&apos;d need to be to defeat a boss without a large chance of luck. Not really sure what the designers were thinking when they decided the level curve but it had to be - make the boss impossible so players have to repeat an area a dozen or more times doing the same thing over and over again for a very small level increase - this is awesome!!
<br>
<br>Perhaps if the devs bothered to actually fix the boss battles so they were a little more realistic in comparison to the areas you traverse first then I might raise my score but right now this game just reeks of rushed development.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vikings-wolves-of-midgard/user-reviews?user_review_id=7808903">Expand</a></span>

<br>Surprisingly enjoyable
<br>Wolves of Midgard is a diablo style hack and slash game that you can play solo or online if you can find someone where you play as a male or female Viking to save the world from the frost and fire giants
<br>The character you choose does change the story and dialog slightly, but both campaigns are the same But it will hardly matter as really the story just became static before too long, I had no interest in what was going on..
<br>But I still managed to enjoy my time with this game&#x2026;
<br>But that&#x2019;s not the only reason this game is surprisingly enjoyable&#x2026;
<br>Its mostly a surprise because of how repetitive it really is&#x2026;
<br>Every mission from start to finish is the same
<br>and the dungeons here all start looking the same after a while as well&#x2026;
<br>plus the loot isn&#x2019;t really that cool..
<br>But I still enjoyed my time slicing through enemies and swapping out gear&#x2026; collecting their blood to level up&#x2026;.
<br>When you do level up you get skill points to spend on a tree based off of a norse god..
<br>These gods are attached to weapons though which is just a little annoying&#x2026;
<br>And theres a level cap of 30 here&#x2026; so it isn&#x2019;t as simple as just grinding for your new favorite weapon
<br>it forces you to have to choose your weapon type early on before you get a chance to play with them all or even see what youre going to get in the future&#x2026; if you want to be as powerful as possible
<br>because unlocked skills in each tree as gifts from the gods&#x2026;
<br>Theyre special moves and attacks you can do during battles that can only be done with certain weapons equipped&#x2026;
<br>The combat here feels fairly satisfying&#x2026;
<br>Theres decent challenge here and youre able to roll to dodge attacks&#x2026; but there isn&#x2019;t much more to it than hit and dodge and throw down some special attacks&#x2026;.
<br>And at the end of each level theres a boss&#x2026;
<br>the bosses are pretty cool, only 1 or 2 gave me any trouble though&#x2026;
<br>And they feel varied enough to still be an enjoyable endcap to each level..
<br>After youre done with this 10 hour campaign you can start again in new game plus, capped out at level 30.. but your gifts do carry over or play as the other character&#x2026;.
<br>there isn&#x2019;t much incentive to do either though&#x2026; especially due to the low level cap&#x2026;
<br>I enjoyed myself..
<br>but theres nothing here that youll want to experience more than once&#x2026;
<br>Wolves of Midgard is an enjoyable experience..
<br>You wont regret playing it.. but its nothing special&#x2026;
<br>I give Vikings: Wolves of Midgard
<br>a 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/vikings-wolves-of-midgard/user-reviews?user_review_id=7197182">Expand</a></span>
