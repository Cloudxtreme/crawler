The replayability of a game that is now 12 years old and was largely overlooked at the time of release must always be questioned.  But when I play this game now it truly is as wonderful and gripping as when I first played it as a wide eyed boy.  It is such a shame Cavedog shut down shortly after making this masterpiece as a game as unique and inspiring as this has been sorely missed in the RTS genre.  It truly is magnificent and I cannot express my happiness that I found this game all those years ago.  This game stands head and shoulders above all other games in my eyes and if there was one game I could play eternally it would be this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-annihilation-kingdoms/user-reviews?user_review_id=2085077">Expand</a></span>
