The length is also pityful, certainly not longer than an hour even if you&apos;d brute force all solutions.<br>Probably those guys were too busy to take the shooting of their making of to bother making a proper game. This is a complete ripoff, that becomes of huge proportions given the pricetag; please don&apos;t consider giving this a try even if it&apos;ll ever be available for free.

Unfortunately the charming aesthetics of the game are hampered by Flash, the chosen method of production. The soundtrack is soothing, however it can become slightly repetitive by the end of the game. But these are both minor criticisms, and in my opinion Lume looks great.<br><br>Lume is filled with puzzles and its difficulty ranks higher than the average modern day adventure game. This has sparked some reviewers to criticize the game as abstract or unintuitive. Personally, I felt that the puzzles were quite logical. They encourage the gamer to be attentive to minor clues and to use their own thinking power to find the ultimate solution. This might be off-putting to someone whose only experience with adventure games are the fantastic but easily solved creations from TellTale games, but to someone who likes puzzles and likes games, Lume is a welcome change of pace.<br><br>My main criticism of Lume is that it is very short. Although it has a fairly low price tag and it is only the first episode in a potential series of games, I couldn&apos;t help feeling disappointed when it was over in just a little more than an hour.<br><br>Bottom line: Great look. Good game for puzzle-lovers. Very short but also fairly inexpensive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lume/user-reviews?user_review_id=1613294">Expand</a></span>

You think you&apos;re done with the first room, but the it turns out to be the end of the game. Furthermore its missing some congruent game design, presenting one style of resolution and attention needed to the level, and then randomly changing to a different design. Requiring some pixel hunting, continuous re-clicking to find the clues. Inexcusable. A common issue with a new developer, or when they haven&apos;t tested the game outside of their group.
<br>
<br>There is maybe 15 minutes of content there, maybe 7 puzzles in the game. Not worth the $7 on steam. If you got it for free, it might be worth a play but maybe not even that, considering the frustration that comes with the unannounced pixel hunting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lume/user-reviews?user_review_id=2477511">Expand</a></span>

If you look up the answers, or even hints, expect to finish the game in under an hour.<br><br>If you like the art style, then maybe you can find more value in Lume than I did.

The game only lasts an hour so it&apos;s definitley something you don&apos;t want to buy until it&apos;s on sale.

<br>All in all its worth playing through if you pick it up either on a massive sale or in a Humblebundle, but at a $7 price tag for a very saturated genre with less then an hour of gameplay (can take as short as 10ish minutes if you know all the puzzles, but for your average point and clicker first play through might take between 35-60 minutes depending on how long you get stuck on a puzzle.  At the time of this post the game is currently 70% off on Steam for $2.10, which yeah you could pick it up at that price and feel like it was worth it, but at $7 it leaves you feeling a little bit lacking with so many other good point and clicks that have more plot to them and more then just 2 scenes the entire game that take a lot longer to get through.
<br>
<br>All in all its a great pick up for a good sale, but I would avoid it at full price even if full price is merely the cost of a single fast food lunch, just on the bases that you can get a much deeper, much longer experience in many other games in the genre for a similar price point, for example the entire Broken Sword trilogy will only cost you $3 more at a total of $10, and just the first 2 of the 3 games you get there will take you between 13-16 hours just doing the main story and not any of the extras... yes time played per dollar != a value comparison because 20 hours of boring game play for $20 is of lower value then 5 hours of extremely enjoyable game play for $20, but still if you enjoy what few puzzles there are in Lume you will enjoy puzzles in most other point and click games, so will probably find the Broken Sword trilogy more bang for your buck even if they don&apos;t look as pretty.
<br>
<br>Again its not a bad game, its just extremely short leaving you feeling like you paid $7 for a demo and never really got a game for your money. Which is exactly how I would describe Lume, a $7 demo for a game that could have been turned into something wonderful if more areas and puzzles where added into a full game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/lume/user-reviews?user_review_id=3915145">Expand</a></span>
