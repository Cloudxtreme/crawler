How was I surprised when the game turned to be so awesome. Great story and the climate, amazing music and art, as well as great graphic. First game to fully utilize full 3d combat and movement in space. And what combat it is! Sure, the controls can be confusing a bit at the beginning, but it&apos;s nothing a few minutes in tutorial can&apos;t fix. The story is simply amazing. Enthralling, one may say, and If you have a heart somewhere there inside your flesh, you will be moved by it. Maybe even to tears. All in all, amazing game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=1493496">Expand</a></span>

I couldn&apos;t get far in the single player player campaign though because it requires a huge amount of skill and strategy. however I thought that the multiplayer was great (and still do). I came back a few years later and attempted the single player campaign again and it was ninja gaiden hard. Every level your up against a fleet much larger than your own, but this game is just so addicting you just can&apos;t stop playing, you don&apos;t care how hard or how long it takes to get to the end. The story line is also engrossing. you can&apos;t help but not feel bad for these guys. and of the 3-15 days you put into restarting levels and having more of your fleet survive to the end of the level so they carry over to next level. (yes they do that).However when you finnaly get to the last level and the second there seems to be slightest chance you could win against a fleet 5 (yes)5 times the size of yours, (lots of both strategy and skill involved) your heart skips a beat. once you are about to finnaly ahnillate the enemy it&apos;s almost impossible not to start a victory dance. You have just put so much effort into it that you can&apos;t help but celebrate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=84546">Expand</a></span>

I waited for reviews before picking this up. 2 weeks later, Homeworld became my only desire for weeks on end. Even now, it taunts me from the CD shelf. If you&apos;ve never played Homeworld and you&apos;re into this kind of game, you&apos;ve been missing out. A classic gem. What are you waiting for?</span>

The simple interface is nice and allows beginners to easily adjust to the uniquely great gameplay. Hotkeys speed things up and the option to remove certain effects from the game such as bullet effects can speed things up for the people with older computers. Even with the graphics engine I would still prefer this game to almost any present day console game. Long and tedious missions actually require you to think instead of just building a huge fleet and bombarding the enemy, because of this it stays away from a stereotypical approach to gameplay. Soundtrack is one of the best I&apos;ve heard in any videogame, right up there with final fantasy and halo games. A well placed music track of Adagio for Strings really shines. The soundtrack and the game are definately worth your buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=401511">Expand</a></span>

I was never into space strategy games, but Homeworld changed that for me. One of the best games to come out of the Golden Era of PC gaming (that is the end on the 90s). I am looking forward to Sins of a Solar Empire as a spiritual sequel.</span>

The MP aspect is well-done, with many custom maps that have been and spread through the community over the years, I have been a fan of this game for many years and as a veteren RTS gamer I can say this game ranks in my personal top three.</span>

For many players, the game looks too complicate as you are dealing with a 3 dimension tactical map, but if you hang on and master it (not that difficult, just need some practice), then the payback is huge. The other thing player find very difficult is that you start a mission with what you had in the previous one (or what you lack of). But there is nothing better to let you feel in total immersion, and catch a COS &quot;completion obsession syndrome&quot;, where you will try to take over as much as enemy ship before getting to the next level (i finished the game with a hundred ion fregate (at 5fps, back on my p3 667). I played it again, this time on a 1080p projector... wow.

It&apos;s a deep strategy game, with great graphics, story and awesome sound (not only music).<br>Full of that kind of details that make a good game a great one. Unfortunately I have never found again a RTS game like this. Highs: everything except it&apos;s low<br>Lows: Sometimes can be slow (worse when replaying missions)</span>

                                        <span>I won&apos;t sit here and say that you&apos;re going to love this game simply because RTS games aren&apos;t for everyone. I on the other hand love this game. It&apos;s one of my all time favourites and sits amongst a select few that I believe deserve a 10/10.
<br>
<br>The visuals, music, gameplay and story are all top notch. Buy the remastered version.</span>

This game is a funny one, at first you don&apos;t get what the fuss is about. Sure the graphics are amazing, but the single player seems slow and unimpressive. However, once you fight a battle later in the game you will be hooked forever. The battles are intense and your tactics must be spot on or your whole fleet will be space dust. There are all sorts of great tactical devices to use in battles too such as cloaking generators, gravity wells, shielded frigates, mine layers etc. All adding to the fun. Even now, 4 years later i still play this game regularly. I still find new ways of completing it and the great soundtrack and graphics make the whole experience an amazing one. The only downside to this game is that after you&apos;ve defeated all the enemies on a level you must wait for your resource collectors to finish collecting everything which can take a VERY long time on some levels. You can move on to the next level if you dont want to wait but resources are so tight in this game that you cant afford to just leave it behind. In fact if I lose a Heavy Cruiser - the most expensive ship in the game, I reload the level (unless its the last level). An automatic resource collection feature would&apos;ve been nice when you leave to the next level. Appart from that one flaw this is one of the greatest games ever made. Easy to learn but impossible to master it has me hooked forever! Forget about Cataclysm and Homeworld 2, this is the original and one of the greatest ever strategy games.

Even replaying this amazing game more than a decade later it is still unsurpassed as far as game play, graphics and sound is concerned. The single player campaign is on my list of essential sci fi literature along with Alien, Star Wars and Starcraft. And on top of the spectacular pacing of the story comes great visuals, tremendous sound and tough as nails tactics. At every turn you feel as if you really are way out in space, and some of the scenarios are breathtaking and feel really lethal. The single best feature of the game for me is the fact that all your forces carry on between missions, giving you a chance to plan out your fleet from the start as well as a powerful urge not to lose any ships. Needless to say this is pretty hard to accomplish. On top of this resources are tight as a drum, and you`ll happily fly for ten minutes each way just to pick up a single grain of space dust if you have to.
<br>
<br>If any negatives can be found they are negligible. However for people unaccustomed to RTS games Homeworld will be very tough to get to grips with beyond the first couple of levels. Even once the relatively tricky procedure of learning how to control your fleet in 3D is done with, the campaign is just unbelievably hard. It is hard in all the right ways though, and doesn`t cheat you. But still I can see it being a bit overwhelming for many people.
<br>Secondly, I have also identified a graphical bug which causes the occasional star to stick on the left edge of the view after it should have disappeared off screen. And finally in Homeworld there is a powerful compulsion to remain in each zone until every last resource has been gathered by your slow moving harvesters. This is because you need all of it, and it really does take the odd half hour for this to get done on some levels. And because people complained about it a high speed gathering function was added for the sequels. But this is an artifact of the gaming community in the classic PC era, which was composed of very patient people, quite unlike today. It was expected that games would reward patience as well as skill, planning, overview and tactical ability. Personally I loved it (And I detested the fast gathering in Cataclysm and Homeworld 2, possibly as the only person in the world.) since it gave me a welcome break between the hectic missions during which I could watch the backgrounds and listen to the relaxing music. Anyone who doesn`t need a breather after the intense missions in Homeworld should have their blood pressure and other vitals checked..
<br>If none of this turns you off then go get Homeworld with all appropriate haste! It is one of the most flawless games ever released for the PC</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=2732419">Expand</a></span>

The story line was fantastic, tactical gameplay and upgrade systems where also top notch. Not really seen another game of its type since. Really wish someone would bring another game like this onto the market. This is a MUST PLAY GAME for sci fi tactical gamers.</span>

Wanna know why? keep reading.<br>PLOT, SCRIPT, NARATIVE AND WRITING:  On the dessert planet of Kharak due to a satellite malfunction the people who live there discover an ancient startship in a dessert along with a hyperspace engine and a stone with coordinates with to what appears to be their planet of origin, called Hiigara curved on it. The Kharakian clans put aside their differences and collaborated to build a huge mothership that would take them to Hiigara. A neuroscientist named karan developed a system that connected a human being with the mothership as its living computer. Karan volunteered and became the ships living computer and commander. First trials are about to begin, and this is where the game begins and where my spoiling ends. The writing of  the game has a poetic direction. The narrator, the characters all feel like they are coming from inside a poem of sorts. This whole direction of narrative is very original and effective in contributing to the game&apos;s atmosphere. The voice acting seemed dull at the beginning, but this changed fast. It has a subtle emotional tension that works really well.<br>GAMEPLAY AND MECHANICS: The mothership is your primary base of opperations. There you can build all sorts of ships, from the smallest scout to the biggest battlecruiser, but it cannot move and while it is very durable it can&apos;t dish out any real punishment. There is also the carrier, a unit that has more limited building capabilities and the research ships that are used to acquire new units and tech and which you can only have six at any given moment. And now lets see the part of the game that really made it stand out. Its unique, for an  RTS, 3D space navigation. Now there is an extra dimension to navigate. This opens up new possibilities in tactics. Send ships, not just around, but also above and under your enemy, a function that i believe was greatly appreciated by those who liked multiplayer. This mechanic is implemented excellently in HW and really works, but it has some minor quirks. You see, to move your unit you can&apos;t just  right or left click somewhere in the map. You must either select the appropriate option from a menu opened by right clicking the unit or units whom you wish to move and then left clicking on the map, and you must keep pressing shift in order to choose directional height. Fear not though. The tutorial does an excellent job on teaching you the ropes and the movement system is relatively easy to get used to.<br>There is also a world map mode accessed by pressing spacebar. From there you got an over all view of the entire map so you can monitor various fronts, you can see where resources are denser and you units appear as green dots(enemy as red while colour varies in multiplayer). One of the best features of the game is the fact that whatever you have(units, resources etc.) carries on to the next mission. You must be effective in the missions ahead as it would be unpleasant if you have ended up on the next mission with very low resources and with a very small ineffective wing of interceptors vs a full enemy fleet. Missions themselves are very unpredictable in nature, and I wont say more about this element so I dont spoil them. Lastly many missions will make you fill like you fighting against all odds, and you do. Enemy forces will often outnumber your&apos;s quite a bit and you will be like &#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=2300565">Expand</a></span>

Relic took the RTS format and added an additional dimension in a space strategy game that arguably has yet to be bested. The singleplayer experience is moving, challenging and memorable.

The interface, overlay, and lets face it, is really hard to manage and get used to. right when i started this game i had no idea how to manage the overlay, and it took a long time to get used to it, it is not friendly at all.

Homeworld is a SPACE game. that&apos;s right,  tapping into a brand new theme for a game, this is revolutionary, and for me amazing, i love space. and they do it fantastically. i have nothing to say other than that, you just need to play it, NOW. That is if you can find it. I have always thought that this game was underrated, and never got the attention it deserved. so go play it, after you can find it<br>9/10 -out of this world, literal...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homeworld/user-reviews?user_review_id=2158788">Expand</a></span>

Going back and playing this masterpiece tells me two things. One is that at least in one point in time there was a game well worth the price tag. It also tells me that with the remastered edition on the way that we are not totally lost and on a bad path. Homeworld is a gem in a vast and confusing game market. Not many other RTS games compare. It was unique to its play style and shows off a 3D tactical environment. Truly one of the best strategy games ever conceived,
<br>
<br>In a nutshell and being totally honest Homeworld is a must buy. Its true to the name classic just as much as Halo: Combat Evolved was for the FPS market.
