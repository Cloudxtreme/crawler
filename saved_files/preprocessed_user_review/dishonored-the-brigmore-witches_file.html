<br>Dishonored takes the top honor as the best game I ever played&#x2026;. and the DLCs are the best DLCs I have ever played. This is the same review for both DLCs  The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches  and they should be played back to back.
<br>
<br>At first I was Sad to play the first DLC  I started with a new character  The Assassin Daud. I was Sad that all the character building and equipment was lost&#x2026;. but this quickly changed  I was still very good because of all the skill I picked up through the first campaign and Daud begins to level up&#x2026;. and I chose different skill tree sets  and then I was happy  very happy&#x2026;. The storyline and goals are as fun and the maps as great. KnifeOfDunwallBrigmoreWitches is really all one game. And be forewarned  choices you made in the primary campaign come back to surprise you. Salivate you Pavlov dog  Add to Cart and Enjoy.

Very interesting levels at the same level as the original game, a fantastic story where you decide how finisht it... For me the best DLC of a game ever.

You still play Dowd. The new DLC&apos;s premise is that Dowd is trying to bring down the society of Brigmore witches, they don&apos;t show up in the entire game but are the main enemy. The campaign is split up into three different levels. The first level you visit the prison of the original game, the second is a new area we haven&apos;t seen before that is gangster overrun streets. And the third level is the Brigmore manor, the witches home. It is an overgrown garden filled with different plants. New elements have been introduced like new powers, sadly they didn&apos;t use all the powers from the original game. They would have been useful, it was sad they left them out. You still have RPG perks to unlock that give you different abilities. Levels look beautiful and are very open and there are a few new enemy types. Now to get to the important part. The confrontation between Dowd and Corvo has multiple enemies and the decisions you made as Dowd affected the ending not the decisions you made as Corvo. Because if it was the other way around then everything you did would have a purposeless ending. Overall, the DLC is $15 and it took me about 3 hours to complete. If you took more time to look around it would take longer. The DLC is great and I highly recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-the-brigmore-witches/user-reviews?user_review_id=3522277">Expand</a></span>

You continue to play as Daud with possibility to unlock a brand new power distinct to these from the previous DLC the Knife of Dunwall. The second level of the power is fun to use in combat and I invite you to try it even you are hard-core stealth player. You will find it really entertaining. The story of Duad itself is not a simple addition to the original game. Daud brings to it more personal touch as your hero is not silent anymore. The DLC takes places in three locations (note that I do not count Daud&apos;s hideout here). The first is a recyclations of the old one from the game but it offers a very unique experience. The second locations is the best designed and the most complex. There are two very different ways how to deal with the situation in the mill-factory which adds some depth to the mission. The last misson adds a new combat experience but unfortunately you feel that some of the potential of this location have not been used. In overall this is a decent conclusion of Daud story which will not dissapoint you. I personaly recomend you to download an ultimate difficulty mod as without it the game is way to easy even on the ultra hard setting. It makes you feel that the stealty approach is not just a choice you made but on contrary it is a must in order to success.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-the-brigmore-witches/user-reviews?user_review_id=3580378">Expand</a></span>

I mention this just to give you an example of how long this DLC might last if you play completely stealthy and without killings. Now, a few words about the DLC itself. As you probably know, &quot;The Brigmore Witches&quot; continues the story of assassin Daud, killer of the Empress and Corvo&apos;s rival. His skills are basically the same and I didn&apos;t notice and major changes from the first DLC, &quot;The Knife of Dunwall&quot; in terms of atmosphere  game mechanics. However, that does not make this DLC less fun  it contains great story, dark and brutal cutscenes (which perfectly blend into the script), decent-looking environments and very satisfying overall experience. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed original Dishonored and &quot;The Knife of Dunwall&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-the-brigmore-witches/user-reviews?user_review_id=3423405">Expand</a></span>

The sound is great, the graphics are top notch and the game play continues to be rewarding and addictive.  With Knife I got around 5 to 6 hours of game play and Witches gave me an additional 8 hours for a total of 40 hours for the full game and DLC for a single play through.  Considering I got the game on sale for $20 and spent $20 on the DLCs, a dollar an hour for extremely enjoyable entertainment is very worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-the-brigmore-witches/user-reviews?user_review_id=3436079">Expand</a></span>

The Prison level (which is also the first level) is extremely short and I was quite disappointed with it. The second level puts you in the middle of a gang war and it is easily the longest level in the DLC. The final level, Brigmore Manor, is of moderate length and is the hardest level yet (including the main game and both DLCs). Brigmore Manor is probably my favorite of the levels because of how different it is from any previous level in Dishonored. Instead of prowling around in city streets, you&apos;re at a single manor and you can explore the grounds around the manor as well as inside it.
<br>
<br>There are a host of new enemies, weapons, and powers to use which helps to get you to try new things. You also get to continue from your save in KoD so you can continue with all the powers and upgrades you already earned, which is great. I was once again disappointed with the length of the DLC. I had hopes it would be longer, but my first playthough (on high chaos) took about 3.5 hours. My second playthrough on low chaos (including not killing anyone, and not alerting anyone) took only 2.5 hours. Also, i did run into a few minor bugs, but nothing game-breaking. Sometimes characters were supposed to be talking, but they didn&apos;t actually talk (luckily i had subtitles on so i could see what they were saying nonetheless). Also about 2 or 3 times when i was talking to a fellow assassin or the outsider they would appear off screen when they were intended to be in the middle of the screen, which was a bit strange.

<br>Ultimately, Brigmore Witches is just more of the Dishonored we know and love, with a few added bonuses. It will take you a good number of playthroughs to find everything, every passage, every secret, etc. And the playtime you get from all oft those playthroughs combined will easily make Brigmore Witches worth the purchase. But, if you&apos;re someone who is only interested in playing through once, then you may want to hold off until it&apos;s on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-the-brigmore-witches/user-reviews?user_review_id=3423404">Expand</a></span>

If you played the original, then you know what to expect. it&apos;s challenging (depending on your chaos rating) and it follows very nicely with the theme of the original game. The only thing I would prefer is why Daud instead of Corvo? But still, it is definitely worth it and a good DLC follow up. Don&apos;t miss it it.</span>

<br>I would describe the maps as dark and dingy with somewhat horror undertones throughout the game (not really a surprise given the title, witches); I miss the classy mansions, like the mascaraed party, I liked exploring those rather than exploring decrepit buildings, however, they are done well for what they are, just not environments I want to explore again.  I finished the DLC a month ago and have not wanted to play it since.
<br>Con:  Watch out for the strange bone charms, I think the &quot;invisibility&quot; one absolutely ruined the enjoyment, the AI would seem retarded because I&apos;m wearing it (they can&apos;t see you when you don&apos;t move, making stealth kills laughably easy)  it was like playing with a cheat code entered so I disabled it, I don&apos;t think it should even be available as it makes stealth achievements far too easy.
<br>If you liked Dishonored and already have the other DLC&apos;s you&apos;ll want to see the ending to complete the story; certainly not the best missions or maps in the series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dishonored-the-brigmore-witches/user-reviews?user_review_id=3511082">Expand</a></span>
