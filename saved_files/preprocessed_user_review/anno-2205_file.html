We&apos;ve lost our random-maps, story-mode is mandatory, no sandbox, the AI is now completely non-existent as an actual opponent (100% story and menu based), the few features that have been kept from the previous games haven&apos;t even been explained by the extremely lacking tutorial / story.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t even know how a developer could see this as the next logical step in the series, even if it was serving as a reboot (which it isn&apos;t, judging by release times and the fact that it&apos;s simply continuing the naming conventions of the previous games).
<br>
<br>For anyone who wanted more of the same, you&apos;re better off scouring for mods for the previous games (Anno 2070 has one or two big mods out there if you can find them).
<br>
<br>Aside from its severe issues actually being an Anno game, it brings its own serious host of issues:
<br>
<br>The in-game economy is extremely volatile. Without extensive pre-planning you are simply screwed over every time because the game fully expects you to max-optimize all of your buildings before they are really usable.
<br>
<br>The AI that pops up as dialogue (Not like it pops up anywhere else now) is extremely spammy and even if you try to cancel its pop-ups, it barely gives you a minute before the spam continues.
<br>
<br>In general bugs, there isn&apos;t too many and that area seems okay, other than the time I got my ship to sail through islands because obviously the pathfinding simply did not care.
<br>
<br>The loading times are pretty bad too for the new multi-map mechanic. I&apos;m running Anno 2205 on SSD with an i7 skylake and a 980Ti in my rig, but I still wait 20-25s for a map to load, and many times it ends up with a story cinematic over it and the game simply will not run smoothly and I end up with a jittery cinematic as if I&apos;m trying to run this on a 20-year-old PC
<br>
<br>To note, the lead-developer of this Anno installment is the same one working on the previous 3 titles. The same person who knew the success formula to Anno has managed to completely override it into this strange product that no longer relates to its predecessors. It&apos;s as if Call of Duty decided its next installment would be better with RPG stats and isometric 3D.
<br>
<br>This is no longer Anno. If you want Anno, you&apos;re out of luck.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5643807">Expand</a></span>

<br>- No mutliplayer! I loved to play Anno 1404 Venice and Anno 2070 with my friends on custom randomly generated maps.
<br>
<br>- No sandbox mode.
<br>
<br>- No factions! Really?! WTF! The whole complexity and depth of the game was destroyed.
<br>
<br>- Overpriced. This game should cost $15 for what it offers.

Most of the time you&apos;ll find yourself watching the needs bar, applying the formula supply &gt;= demand. A few more twists when it comes to the coverage of a few buildings, but I&apos;m not talking about industry here. With the exception of the arctic region, you can place the industry wherever you want. Stick a building on the other side of the map and in an instant, your citizens will be happy and the demand will be met. There are no fluctuations, no time in transit for the goods to reach their destinations, no traffic worries, nothing about how the workers will reach their factories, no shops for the population to purchase the goods.
<br>
<br>The stupid side missions and the passable but completely unwanted mini combat games which take place in a separate isolated environment, together with the nice graphics, have all helped me progress in the game. But the problem still remains. This game is not pulling me in, and the cities seem lifeless from high up there where I&apos;m watching the income and the needs bar. Playing in multiple regions having slightly different rules is a nice refreshing twist, but Ubisoft Blue Byte has unfortunately missed the ball with the dumbed down simulation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5743271">Expand</a></span>

Do this twice and help Doctor EFG to get crates H/K. Then click once to build a prebuild building, and haul more crates from all over the map to other places on the map. Now talk to the CFO from UltraCorp and haul crate L to place M. The CFO also lost crates at N,O and P. Please haul these crates behind your truck ( it&apos;s 2205, so you have to click and click and click again to hook the crates to your vehicle) Now talk to the board of directors, who seem to have lost some crates..... ah.... reinstalling Anno 1404 will hopefully make me forget this... not a game, but what... tour of mindnumbing duty.

There are positives to this game, I won&apos;t deny that. The biomes are pretty cool, and the graphics are pretty. Compared to previous instalments in the series however, I can&apos;t recommend purchasing this game for those who have enjoy those. Whereas before, there was actually some process to becoming more familiar with the amount of resource buildings needed for your population, that is gone. Instead, you&apos;ve got an easy to use menu that displays how much of a resource you are gaining or losing, and takes out all the guesswork. It is simply stupidly easy, and there isn&apos;t any re- playability value. You are going to absolutely love this game if you&apos;re one of those people that didn&apos;t like the previous games because they were &apos;too hard&apos;.
<br>The combat, while pretty and full of explosions, is arcadey in nature, and has pretty much absolutely no bearing on your success. Whereas in ANNO 2070, you would be required to build up a fleet and engage in battles to protect your trade routes and smite your enemies, your only motivation now is for rare resources that you can&apos;t seem to get rid of fast enough. Quests keep on being spammed at you constantly, making you mildly tempted to tear out your hair at times. No multiplayer or scenario mode, basically make this a one-time play through game, which is infinitely poorer than previous instalments, so you may as well start with those. To reiterate, this game doesn&apos;t really belong in the same series as the rest, and should only be picked up by the casual crowd who like stupidly boring games after a long day at work.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5869331">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What did I get? A dumbed down casualized Anno game. Dont get me wrong the visuals are awesome and the first time you get to the moon is just awesome. But.... thats all? There is no endless mode.... in an Anno game... they removed everything unique about the Anno games and dumbed it down! Factories teleport their stuff everywhere. No logistics! There is actually only the story over and over again. You could ognore it. But sometimes you have to do it or else you can not advance.

Overall Anno 2205 is a great game. I&apos;m glad it&apos;s different. Characters are interesting and awesomely voiced. Also, major sector quests are cool.

<br>Can&apos;t wait to see orbit and tundra, i would love to have more content. I would love to see Mars.

I&apos;ve read the negative opinions most of them are from players that were expecting the same. Im not saying the changes are good nor bad but for me it played pretty decently.
<br>
<br>I enjoyed building my corporation, buying competitors and expanding to their lands, Im not the fan of the RTS element of it, but I played it 3 times to get some starting resources and than never touched it again, so far I never lacked the materials they provide. Several hours in the game starts to be a bit more complex, oh well not complex the game is rather easy going. I started knowing nothing, I ran into debt after quite a while as I&apos;ve build a **** of unnecessary architecture, once I did I got a bailout with interest and rather easily figured out whats what, the game doesnt punish you at all as I quickly moved things around and disable production in all production facilitates that were producing excessive goods. From than on the game mostly orbited around chilly city building. I really enjoyed that aspect of building &apos;good looking&apos; city instated of min-maxing everything with ugly looking most optimal builds. The arctic is kind of exception from that rule but I liked that those regions have a different feeling to them, like logistic seems to be a **** in arctic region mostly due to you being limited in usable space and having to cover long distances between your mines, the moon is rather expensive on the other hand, you have more freedom but it cost quite a bit, once you upgrade the starport so it can transmit energy it also opens up additional ways of managing your resources.
<br>
<br>My opinion is a bit biased because Im playing this game in 3d and it looks really well (apart from some issues with rendering that I can live with), mines are super good looking as is the skyline of the mix with more advanced buildings or massive crop fields / facilities you eventually have to build. The ability to relocate freely really gives you freedom to build 4fun. People that are looking for a challenge might be disapointed. I almost completely disregarded the campaign if there is any, I&apos;m not sure I havent noticed :) for me it feels like a sandbox, very chilly, you dont seem to be pressured by anything, so you should keep that in mind if you&apos;re looking for something else.
<br>
<br>Lastly I havent noticed any performance issues, I mean the game is not running in 120fps all ultra (im using an old 680/i7-3930k combo) but I can set the settings relatively high and still enjoy city building in 40+ fps its not the kind of a game that requires twitch reflex. The loading times are barely noticeable, the first 10-15% seems to be getting a bit than it just swirls and is gtg I usually check / adjust trade routes in that time so I dont notice it that much at all. I suppose if you dont enjoy the game at all you will boil inside for all the extra time you need to keep up with the game ;p maybe you should just stop playing than? There is really no point in torturing yourself thinking you will change the game to be somethign else with the power of your imagination.
<br>
<br>Im not sure about replay value but I expect it to be minimal, wihtout &apos;factions&apos; per say and it seems like you can buy-out all the regions from your competitors during one playtime so there would really be very little incentive to start over than just to have a different start place and maybe expand differently like maybe go fast on corporate levels and money to buy out one of the earth competitors before going to the arctic I have no idea but there might be one reason to play it again, not sure if there is more. I wouldnt buy it at full price, it was like half the price on greenmangaming and its not that bad of an offer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5651149">Expand</a></span>

Most of the original Anno features are changed or removed. These features made Anno games unique and preferred. Removing or simplifying the original functions just killed the game.
<br>
<br>Anno 2205 is more like a spin-off from the original Anno games. I do not consider it part of the sequel. Now it is just one of the many city builder games with nice graphics.
<br>
<br>Money makers at Ubisoft, it does not work like this. In Anno 2205 I was expected &quot;Anno 2070 with moon race&quot;. Ships not only on the sea but spaceships, space trade vessels, space harbors, laser defences in the spaceports, unique gadgets to find on the moon, space laboratory, space station....a lot of inventions...
<br>
<br>Sure it will be discounted in a couple of weeks....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5653993">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Anno 2205 a highly anticipated yet. A logical continuation of the excellent Anno 2070 would have been welcome. Lot is lost in Gameplay, too, no doubt. The concept was planed at all levels, management, strategy, diplomacy. Once apprehended game mechanics we finish the tutorial scenario partly fifteen hours ... then politely asked to determine a goal to reach 1 million. And this is the end. No different scenario. No sandbox. No new map. If you replay the game you retype the same scenario, and especially the same map. No more random map.
<br>
<br>Fini also the management of warehouses, since the system is automated. Fini management or trade routes had to build its own merchant vessel fleet, there also is automated and shortened to a simple exchange of goods on the world market or in its own territories.
<br>
<br>Fini also trees productions, there you have a groin 50 goods to produce in all (3 territories) against the triple see double in previous games including Anno 2070 where we had with each of the three factions full production trees .
<br>
<br>Fini tax management which sometimes saved us from bankruptcy. Again this is automated.
<br>
<br>And diplomacy then? ... Nonexistent.
<br>Bon bah trade then? We&apos;ll see in a few days or weeks the limits of the global market system ...
<br>
<br>So visually beautiful, it has more the feeling of the hands a beautiful empty shell. We already feel coming 3 to 4 or 5 dlc 15/25 euros each, that will make the full game Anno 2205 it should have been at launch. In made if you want to get in Anno 2205, know that it will cost you 100 euros in a groin and several months of waiting for a full game.
<br>
<br>It also feels that Ubisoft is on the wrong track, already the last 2 assassin&apos;s creed was not a success (me being taken in by marketing AC unity I have not bought the last AC syndicate), whereas now he sabotages us the Anno series with the help of blue byte ...
<br>
<br>Anno 2205, a game made for trailer pretty but empty of its essence ....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5664579">Expand</a></span>

<br>To be honest i didn&apos;t play much before come here and search for reviews curious what the others has to say. And sadly i will agree to them.
<br>Breathtaking scenarios, outstanding graphics and the experience to travel to moon are for sure the positives of the game. But there is no Anno in them.
<br>
<br>-No Hard-trading decisions. That system along with the use of the warehouses is almost obliterated from the old series.
<br>- No danger in each section with no battles.
<br>-No Drastic environment, environmental changes or checking the climate feature that was in Anno 2070. Sad that this wasn&apos;t included in the game.
<br>-Ships really feel that there is no use of them.
<br>-Fun enjoyable quests missing from the game.
<br>-Strategic resources are no more strategic. You can farm anything, anywhere, in any island. You lose the need to search for taking an island just for its resources.
<br>-Mission maps are like a mini game which reminded something from the 90&apos;s. I found it poorly made and repeating.
<br>
<br>To be honest as much as I anticipated for the game feels like i didn&apos;t get a reward. I am sure that the expansion that follows (always does) can be a great improvement to a game, that has a potential, but not the proper quality for the Anno series. How much we must wait and see...
<br>
<br>If not for the graphics and the moon experience the score would be even lower...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5663877">Expand</a></span>

Don&apos;t know why it gets so good reviews (well some aren&apos;t that good). The thing is its more like some puzzle game that should be available on mobile. There are no ai opponents like in previous anno games, military aspect is almost non-existent, and economy management is nothing in comparison to previous anno titles.
<br>
<br>The main core of anno series was great balance between city builder and rts, and that is what made this series so awesome and uniqe. In previous titles you could not just grow your city but you had to take care of possible threats. What we have now is some simplified puzzle game with maybe great graphics but who cares if you have nothing to do after like 15 hours of gameplay. I hope they will fix this game in expansion because it really is not worth your money. You can buy it at -75% discount but not for full price.
<br>
<br>Actually don&apos;t buy it even on discount unless they will fix gameplay in some expansion and i still hope they will.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5646666">Expand</a></span>

I am a newcomer to this series and I say that I regret not hearing about it before. Anno 2205 is indeed a mix of city building games like Sim City and Cities XL, and also RTS games like Age of Empires and Empire Earth. What the developers tried to do was create a world in which you can smoothly mix the two without going overboard on one or the other. They succeeded and created a whole new genre. Rather similar to the old ways of Europa Universalis, this game thrives based on the ways in which society was based. i.e. free trade markets. You must colonize an island of your choosing and begin manufacturing goods. Each island has its own unique resources.
<br>
<br>The game purposely makes it hard to gain gratuitous amounts of income, unless you know how trading works. When you start producing goods, if you are clever you will produce more than your island requires. By putting these items up for sale, other factions will begin to visit your island and buy these items off you for a decent penny. You could also set up your own trade routes with your own ships and force the process faster. The point I want to make is that if you want to get the most out of the game you need to open a free market for your island, and trade. This is the way the human race as achieved its standing position in the world: trade. So you say, &quot;Kiwi, trading is fine and all but tell us more about the spotlights and downfalls of the game!&quot;. I&apos;ve been pretty generous with the compliments of this game, so lets talk about its biggest downfall. The campaign...is fun but terrible to go through. The campaign is separated into some main missions with sub missions inside each one. Each mission carries over into the next until you go to a new main mission. This is where it gets to be a problem. When I started the game I managed to get through the first two campaign missions just fine. When I got to the final main mission, I got 3 submissions into it and realized my economy was almost irreparable. There was nothing I could do to save it because my income was negative, and I had 0 money. Sure my plants were producing goods, but not enough to sustain my population. The fact is that I slacked on thinking ahead in the first two missions. So I went back through and replayed them, now my economy is top notch and I am set to do the final mission.
<br>
<br>On the topic of buildings. Some people say that it&apos;s the same buildings over and over, not true. There are multiple looks for each house, and you can rotate the other buildings so you get a different look each time. No city in Anno will be 100% the same unless they tried to do it. The graphics are near flawless and it runs great. I have a normal Dell and it works fantastic. Watching all the production facilities work can be fun for hours. No production facility is the same. The water effects follow superposition of waves, which means you can do interference problems. (I have a degree in physics ^^). I found myself playing with boats in order to recreate Youngs double slit experiment. (It worked more or less if you are wondering). Speaking of time, this game is long. I recently got my first monument finished and I am working on a second. It took 15 hours in a game for me to get a monument up. This can be done much faster! In fact I could probably do it in 3 or 4 hours now. (at least putting the foundation down). The point is, if you do everything right, a monument will be a great and easy addition to your city. But...we don&apos;t do everything right so you will end up destroyed quite a bit of houses to get your monument in the right place. (unless you are clever and checked wiki). Difficulty...this game is hard, but it does get easier. Area use is a big property of this game. If you are clever you will use the smallest amount of area for maximum efficiency. I give this game a 10 out of 10 for great gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5661811">Expand</a></span>

This game is a mistake, and not worth a Anno title, it destroyed what made Anno great.

Tips for next game:

Go back in history (1910) would be great.
Bring back the military aspect with fleets and bring back AI players.

I have previously played Anno 2070 I would have to agree with the overall consensus that Blue Byte has tried to adapt the series to cater to more casual players, removing areas such as diminishing resources and taking out the coop aspects entirely.
<br>
<br>That being said what is on offer is still grounded in traditional Anno concepts, you still have to manage trade between multiple regions to advance your population, with each new population level demanding a vast array of products to grow. The new Arctic and Lunar settings bring to light areas which city sims are yet to really explore and do so in a way which makes each development site feel unique and burdened with their own problems for you to solve. For me personally trying to grow your moon colony whilst supporting it from Earth with resources and also balancing your economy is when the game is at its best.
<br>
<br>The visuals and sound are great, with the graphics really having a colorful flare to them which ever increases the games futuristic feel. Each building is beautifully designed and animated with Anno 2205 also adopting the module building expansions from Sim City, allowing you to personalize your industry buildings and further expand them without having to build an entirely new one.
<br>
<br>The game does fall of the rails a bit when it comes to combat, with the ship battles being comparable to that of a mobile game. Basically you will be granted access to these external missions whereby you control a small fleet and attempt to destroy a rival corporations infrastructure and resources. With the combat revolving around using special abilities and spam attacks.  I&apos;ve never really understood why combat was needed in Anno games, when the focus is predominantly on city management and trade and for me this mode felt a bit rushed and ultimately pointless.
<br>
<br>Overall I do feel that this game is a step forward, Anno 2205 still retains the core features that made the original games great (if somewhat simplified) and also brings new elements to the table with the additional regions to settle. I do understand where some people are coming from by expressing their annoyance with its simplification but I do believe that if you enjoyed previous Anno games or city sims in general you should at least consider looking into Anno 2205 as it is at least trying to innovate in areas, even if that means taking a few steps backwards in others.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5647317">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>One tends to be quite conservative when it comes to long time franchises. There is a certain and very specific expectation of &quot;what the game should be like&quot; - which acts counterproductive to progress.
<br>
<br>With that said ... the new Anno is in many aspects - a very new game. The look and feel of the UI and how you approach it is the same or at least very similar - but it kind of lacks some core mechanics. But lets start with the positives... :
<br>
<br>The game looks very good and runs very well even on medium computers. Design and style fits very nicely into its near futuristic outlook. It is not over the top &quot;Star Trek&quot;- like in terms of city design and technology (aside from flying cars) ... there is still a good balance of beauty and industrial design that kind of comes in an &quot;Apple&quot;- look ... sort of. (meaning, everything is a bit too sterile, too white, too smooth - but design-wise in a positive way)
<br>
<br>The terrain looks amazing (at a great cost - which i ll get to in the negative things) - and the feeling of tranquility - which i value highly for Anno games is present. Yes - it is real time ... and yes - there are opponents (or meant to be... ) you are still given a lot of time - and the game mechanics do have patience and forgive all but the gravest mistakes. (a little too much forgiving for many people i daresay)
<br>
<br>But wait - there are negative sides, too ... :
<br>
<br>Firstly - my beloved &quot;Endless mode&quot; kind of misses. I have to admit - i do not care for the Anno story ONE BIT - i consider them about as tedious as a tutorial to a game that is not too complicated to understand. With the absence of the endless mode comes (or at least i guess that is a consequence) no random maps. As pointed out in the positives - the terrain looks great ... but not random - rather re-designed. And while the more recent Anno titles used predefined islands rather than tile based seeds anyway - here the entire world is kind of &quot;set&quot;. So ... yea - it is a bit like Sim City on a fixed area map.
<br>
<br>Then there is the lack of any urgency. I did point out that the tranquility is a very nice aspect of Anno - but it never felt like a total absence of enemies. While Anno enemies may not have tried to conquer and invade the players sand castles - there had always been a kind of competition over the resources of the various islands ... a kind of &quot;he who comes first...&quot; - along with a grudge of the ones that were only second.
<br>
<br>One reason i can see for that is that the game is not really &quot;existential&quot; anymore. By that i mean ... in the &quot;past&quot; Anno titles - it was all about imperialism, independence and autonomy - even at the cost of living at the edge of starvation. In the last &quot;future&quot; Anno, it was about survival against nature on a mostly hostile planet (i think we can consider water to be hostile to humans for the most part). The latest Anno however never made me feel like there was any real threat at all.
<br>
<br>Other than that ... comparing the game to city builders like &quot;City Skylines&quot; or even &quot;Sim City&quot; ... i kind of feel a little disappointed by the geometry of building. I realize that it allows the game to probably run much better on lower end computers - but i still wish it would allow me to build my settlements other than in 90 degrees square designs. While it made sense on the tile based Anno titles - the new maps simply are so much more organic - yet the cities we build do not match it. This is but a small nitpick though.
<br>
<br>All in all - it is a solid 8/10 from me - a worthy successor that is daring enough to depart from the old anno roots. While i may not agree with all the changes - i fully agree with change by principle. Buuuuut .... personally - i kind of (still) prefer to play Anno 2070 - if i want to play an Anno game that is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5657596">Expand</a></span>

<br>Essentially ubi$cam destroyed anno franchise it removed EVERYTHING THAT MADE an ANNO* game an anno game, what a goddamn disaster and shame incredible one of the oldest franchises on pc dies at the hands of ubi$cam, it had a good run though anno 2070 was stellar, not an perfect game but still an 200% anno game not like this anno 2205 wich is -125% anno its an pos city builder wich isnt that good anyway if i WANTED TO BUY A DAMNEd city builder i would of purchased cities skylines not anno

<br>This game is POINTLESS, and you WILL BE BORED AFTER 6 HOURS.  (*Assuming you have played 1404 and 2070 to death already).  Hope I didn&apos;t ruin the surprise.
<br>
<br>1/10 seems a harsh score, but considering the &#xA3;60 fee I paid for this, it feels justified.  I have played this for 2 days and I have no wish to return until the DLC is released.  Why would I bother, there is nothing left to see?
<br>
<br>I&apos;m probably just reiterating what others have said, but here is the pro and con list:
<br>
<br>Pro:  Um...  I&apos;ve not thought of a pro yet.  It looks OK in UHD, I suppose?
<br>Con:  &#xA3;60??!  (with season pass)  Come off it Ubisoft
<br>Con:  It is soul-less and monochrome in nature.  Even Germans want to funk up Wagner sometimes!
<br>Con:  Dull.  So very dull.  It&apos;s like watching files copy from one directory to another.
<br>Con:  A better tutorial is needed for newer players.  Flashing icons to show what to click, perhaps?
<br>Con:  No replay value.  Islands are set in stone, and there is no multiplayer.
<br>Con:  No random maps (see above)
<br>Con:  Feeble rewards for finishing missions.  A light show?  Really?  4 hours work for a poxy light show?
<br>Con:  Missions are unrewarding, dull, and are designed to waste as much of your time as possible.
<br>Con:  You cannot actually win or lose, because you cannot lose your islands
<br>Con:  The &quot;enemy&quot; is actually totally impotent, as is the player.  As I said you can&apos;t win or lose.
<br>Con:  No invade or being invaded - the &quot;competition&quot; only serves to offer you missions (see &quot;dull&quot; above).
<br>Con:  You cannot see what the competition is doing - you either outrank them or you don&apos;t.....
<br>Con:  ....But so what anyway?  You can&apos;t win or lose, remember?  (Oh, have I said that before?)
<br>Con:  No apparent &quot;end game&quot;...  Things just stop happening.  That&apos;s pretty anti-climatic.
<br>Con:  One dimensional characters - couldn&apos;t care less about any of them, and they don&apos;t matter at all.
<br>Con:  Only 8 ships??!  What the...?  No upgrades apart from &quot;rank&quot;?!
<br>Con:  This game sucks of being forced in to publication early after a huge cut in features.  Blame the d***head in charge who project managed the game or forced a premature release.
<br>
<br>It breaks my heart to see the series come up with this.  No doubt it will sell a load because of the fan base, so Ubisoft will assume it&apos;s a trick worth repeating, but this is a terrible game.
<br>
<br>In summary:  AVOID! Try buying 1404+Venice or 2070 instead (if you have not already).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5653297">Expand</a></span>

If the thing that excited you about the previous Anno games was multiplayer or ship combat or a story plot than this definitely isn&apos;t going to go well for you.  if you, like me, played the previous games strictly single player and relished the balancing act of growing your cities and balancing the trade network between them then you are IN LUCK!  It would seem that Blue Byte put 99% of their development budget into making this game for you.  This is a seriously fun city builder and it is immensely satisfying to keep everything going smoothly.  Disclaimer:  I have only played the game on the hardest difficulty settings, so keeping your budget balanced is actually tough and there are no bailouts.  I flirted with bankruptcy a few times getting my Arctic region up and running, but by the time I started my moon colony I was totally unprepared for how expensive it would be.
<br>
<br>Overall, I rate it a 9.  But I think this one is going to be Love / Hate for fans of the series with very little middle ground.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5665269">Expand</a></span>

Even if Unisoft manages to make a masterpiece it somehow always finds a way to screw things up. Hopefully they will add a manual save option by an update soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5649970">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve sunk about 5 hours in it today and I loved every minute of it.
<br>
<br>Compared to Anno 2070, I feel that the gameplay experience is a lot smoother. It&apos;s always extremely clear what kind of material you need. The buildings&apos; area of operation are much less restrictive. While a house can be out of range, now the community buildings are considered a resource in themselves. This enables the player to be more creative with his cities without being punished too harshly because of building placement. In my humble opinion, this is a huge positive change.
<br>
<br>To the people that say that trading has been removed from the game... Are you for real? It&apos;s still there, but now you don&apos;t spend hours managing the most inconsequential trade routes with boats. Now you just have to keep an eye on how resources flows between your colonies and make sure your production can handle the demand.
<br>
<br>Talking about the colonies... Having three biomes with completely different play-styles is really fun. Switching between each one adds variety to the game. And they are pretty.
<br>
<br>The campaign integration is, in my opinion, very well done so far. Maybe it won&apos;t work for everyone, but I think it&apos;s a good way of making the world feel real. Honestly, I could hardly bother doing the Anno 2070 campaign because I found it tedious. Here, it feels like a suggestion. &quot;Hey, by the way, I know you&apos;re busy but could you help us not dying pretty please kthx? Or just keep doing your thing, whatever.&quot; While the Lunar terrorists are a bit unbelievable, at least they are menacing villains with a really cool leader.
<br>It&apos;s too early for me to give a verdict or talk about the re-playability. However, based on my experience so far, I am very pleased with my purchase.
<br>
<br>TLDR; I really liked Anno 2070, but I feel that Anno 2205 is a better game so far. I give it a solid 8 if you like the genre.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5644817">Expand</a></span>

This is a split from the ANNO core that i personally love. no multiplayer? magic cropbuildings? horrible performance? no, this is a new game entirely and if you are looking for a new ANNO game you should look elsewhere</span>

Even in 2070 the stench of corporate entanglements in bluebytes was heavy and rancid. However, it was tolerable in the end. Now some of the greatest aspects of the game are completely ruined, washed away by lazy design choices and lacklustre gameplay.
<br>
<br>1 - It&apos;s cheaper to trade with the world market in any case to complete a trade route/supply chain, entirely because of the trade-routes cost to manage, on top of building production, energy cost, logistics, ect. There&apos;s no &apos;easy&apos; way (practical) way to sell excess goods as you make them and manage them either as there is only 3 slots you can have to the world market, so you are constantly either strapped for cash, or rolling in it. It&apos;s a waiting game.
<br>
<br>2 - I actually like the sector idea, it was poorly done however. 9 building maps and 2 crisis map limitations is a massive &quot;**** you&quot; to any anno player, especially as the continuity of Anno 2070 was destroyed. What I mean by this: The Ark presented a presistant present throughout the entire games. You could build stuff in 1 map and transport it using the ark to another map, and you had bonuses associated with the ark itself. Any sort of customization in that route is gone, but that&apos;s not all. There&apos;s no real sort of career progression, and voting is kinda worthless...? Daily quests are non-existent and every quest in this game is a terribad fetch-quest, so what you can do on those 9 building maps is pretty much &quot;fill it up, and your done.&quot; which leads me to point 3.
<br>
<br>3 - There&apos;s no reason to advance.
<br>What I mean by this is that the reason why you progressed in a map was so you wouldn&apos;t be eliminated in some way. You would progress in every map by building up your cities to unlock ships, weapons, and eventually, the ability to research and develop, unlocking cool things like the Hydro-dam and the Eco-Formers. The two unique sides each had an end-game reason to get them as well. You got to the end of Ecos to get access to sheilds, and the end of Tycoons for nuclear missiles. There was real variety, and a real need to develop yourself. There was many games where I felt the crunch... stocks on islands were being bought by AI, and friends were scrambling in a cold-war-esque military buildup, winning initial battles by the fire of commando-ships, to eventually fielding the bigger boats... then Aircraft.
<br>
<br>4 - Military Aspect. The military-aspect for many was boring, but really... If there doesn&apos;t exist a threat to your existence, what the hell are you playing for? This should have been expanded, not shelved and hidden away in &quot;Crisis centers&quot; - about as fun to play as crushing your toes with a hammer would be fun to enjoy. Beyond the mandatory crisis-related battles, there&apos;s no way in hell I want to play on those maps. I ignore the quests indefinitely, only so I wouldn&apos;t have to do them. That&apos;s bad design when I don&apos;t feel like playing something because it&apos;s simply boring to do.
<br>On top of that fantastic design choice, was the fact that you only have 8 ships, given to you, that you click to upgrade. It&apos;s a shame to, because they were onto something with the fuel and abilities for ships, and I wish that element would have been elaborated and brought into a meaningful game.
<br>
<br>5 - Anno 2205 is afraid to be intelligent, and is afraid that you might be intelligent. Everything is managed for you, to the point where you have nothing to do. However, they have designed the game around wasting time. A lot of what you end up doing is build up a city block. Check to see if your arrows are red. Build more of Red-Arrowed goods. Upgrade (by clicking every god damn building instead of having it be smart enough to do it on it&apos;s own, unless I missed that very necessary feature somewhere.) I&apos;ve mentioned the trading, but without actually managing trade and goods flow, there&apos;s nothing to do. There&apos;s no research as I&apos;ve mentioned before (as far as I&apos;m aware.) and it basically boils down to &quot;See, look at how pretty your city can become.. PRETTY ISN&apos;T IT?!&quot; - Anno, you aren&apos;t SimCity, you aren&apos;t Cities: Skylines. There is no city-management in this game besides plopping stuff down. You don&apos;t manage tax rates anymore. You don&apos;t manage sewage flow or garbage pickups. This was a strategy game, as much as it was a city builder, and you did a pretty good job of blending those two things in the past. I&apos;m just sad to see that it&apos;s no longer the case.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5647403">Expand</a></span>

The game is a 180 degree turn away from Anno 2070 and in my opinion should almost be labeled under a different series. The positives are there the game is enjoyable to a point. The graphics are amazing and combat is moderately fun ( even with the arcade feeling of picking up power ups.) therefore i give this game a six out of 10 because of the entirely missed opportunity making this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5645822">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Overall this is another fantastic Anno game, unlike the Total War series, Anno still hasn&apos;t dissapointed me! Also just as a heads up, alot of people hated Anno 2070 to (Go check all the uplay complaints and setting complaints on steam forums or steam reviews). But give this new game some time and you will see it is actually a better endless mode than previous games, it is just not on the main menu and starts after you beat the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5645128">Expand</a></span>

It gets rid of a lot of mechanics that were cumbersome, and puts its focus on build up part. It is strongly designed for the singe player aspect and has no real multiplayer components, but if you like to play at your own pace multiplayer is nothing that works out pretty well in these kind of games anyway. Thus I am not really missing it.
<br>
<br>In terms of atmosphere and game-feel I really got into the mood of establishing a mega corps, that runs colonies and cities. It is a game where you need to immerse yourself, checking statistics, checking data and numbers, optimizing and re-planning your industry parks to really get most out of it.
<br>Do not make the mistake and approach it like a Sim City game. It really is something unique in terms of game-play blend. For me the motivation comes from slipping into the role of a CEO that is leading a mega-corp, and feeling empowered to create a mega empire.
<br>
<br>The multi session game-play takes some time to get into, but once you got used to the switch it works fine. I recommend installing the game on a SSD hard disc, to minimize loading times when switching sessions.
<br>
<br>The military part of the game is not really well implemented. If you take it for what it is, a little diversion from the build-up part, it can be fun for while, though it really is always the same with not much depth or options. Then again, this isn&apos;t the focus of the game, so you could also just skip them entirely, if you want. They are not mandatory.
<br>
<br>If you look for a relaxing game, where you want to immerse yourself as a grand planner, and tweak the balances of consumption, production, power supply, workforce and logistics, then this game is for you.
<br>
<br>Overall it can be said that the game is excellent in the areas it is meant to be good at. For true build-up gamers this is a 10/10 game. There is enough build space to expand expand expand, build build build and create huge networks with huge cities.
<br>
<br>If you look for RTS combat or adventurer-style story telling with interesting plot twists, then this game is not really for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5642836">Expand</a></span>

The upgrades for artic and moon colonies are lackluster with the focus on the original colony you set up. once you finish what is essentially the campaign the is nothing to do but try and get in more investors.</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">15 hours later and I&apos;m finished with no reason to replay.

<br>
<br>&#xA3;50 for 15 hours in a game of this genre is absolutely pathetic.
<br>
<br>also the combat, my god the combat, around every 10 minutes you will receive a combat mission. The frequency that you receive these is about correct to stop you just waiting around for enough new citizens to come to your city however the are only 3 combat missions. These 3 combat mission will rotate randomly and they are the only ones ever given to you. They are a piece of piss and I suggest you just hold down the numpad plus button from the get go to halve the time it takes.
<br>
<br>Long story short the designers of this game seem to not know what makes the genre enjoyable.
<br>
<br>If you want to play anno go play 2070 or 1404 both of which are much better games. This isn&apos;t a fresh take on anno this is a mobile platform worthy game that lacks the content or complexity to deserve it&apos;s title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5660178">Expand</a></span>

<br>It looks great, campaign is quite boring (as always in Anno) but the good thing is that the campaign is now integrated into the endless game mode. You don&apos;t have to start over after completing a mission, you can build an entire empire in a single game.
<br>Anno2205 copies some ideas from city builders like Cities Skylines or even SimCity. It introduces new game mechanics like energy, men power and logistics while abandons AI competitors, reduces trading and removing ship battles from the building zones and moves it to specific battle zones.
<br>
<br>All in all, if you liked Anno and don&apos;t mind to have some new game mechanics included into the game you will like 2205 as well. If you are completely into the old style Anno you probably may not like this game. But its not a crappy game like all the 0-5 ratings intents.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5766178">Expand</a></span>

Isso d&#xE1; alguma credibilidade ao meu pequeno review de Anno 2205. Primeiramente, &#xE9; bom esclarecer que o novo jogo &#xE9; diferente do antecessor. Mas com um detalhe, ele continua t&#xE3;o divertido como antes. A cadeia de bens que deve ser montada e na sequencia levada aos benef&#xED;ci&#xE1;rios, ou seja, os habitantes, est&#xE1; mais racional. Anteriormente n&#xE3;o se tinha uma no&#xE7;&#xE3;o mais precisa da quantidade de bens que deveriam ser transferidos para ilhas, o que muitas vezes fazia com que se produzisse determinado produto em quantidade maior do que a necess&#xE1;ria, ocasionando desperd&#xED;cios de toda ordem, e preju&#xED;zo de recursos valiosos.
<br>
<br>Dessa vez o menu (UI) tem um papel fundamental na organiza&#xE7;&#xE3;o da produ&#xE7;&#xE3;o, pois ele passou a ser exibido de forma intuitiva, permitindo ver rapidamente qual item est&#xE1; com a produ&#xE7;&#xE3;o negativa, e qual est&#xE1; excessiva. Com isso fica mais f&#xE1;cil incrementar a quantidade de uma determinada comodidade e satisfazer assim todos os habitantes.
<br>
<br>No lugar de criar uma vasta cadeia de transporte de uma ilha para a outra, em Anno 2205 a configuara&#xE7;&#xE3;o dos mapas foi  radicalmente alterada. Temos tr&#xEA;s ambientes distindos para explorar. Come&#xE7;amos num continente com clima temperado, depois passamos para uma regi&#xE3;o glacial e por &#xFA;ltimo conquistamos uma parte da lua. Cada local possui sua pr&#xF3;pria infraestrura e economia, de modo que alguns itens do outro continente e do satelite da Terra s&#xE3;o enviados de um lado para outro por meio de um &#xF4;nibus espacial. No lugar dos navios, o transporte de bens &#xE9; feito 99% das vezes por naves espaciais. Fantastico!
<br>
<br>Acabou-se aquela exig&#xEA;ncia por vezes irritante de suprir a cidade com bombeiros e hospitais, mas foram mantidos a delegacia de pol&#xED;cia e o centro comunit&#xE1;rio, que diferentemente de Anno 2070, agora podem ser colocados em qualquer parte da cidade, abrangendo toda a &#xE1;rea pelo n&#xFA;mero daqueles pr&#xE9;dios admnistrativos no mapa, e n&#xE3;o exclusivamente pela sua &#xE1;rea de alcance somente.
<br>
<br>As batalhas foram transferidas para um cen&#xE1;rio espefico, permitindo que o foco do player se concentre apenas na constru&#xE7;&#xE3;o da cidade e na produ&#xE7;&#xE3;o das comodidades e na distribui&#xE7;&#xE3;o de bens. No decorrer e no final das batalhas - que s&#xE3;o navais - se recebe como pr&#xEA;mio itens raros que n&#xE3;o podem ser produzidos por f&#xE1;bricas, o que implica num modelo de grinding para certos melhoramentos. Por falar nisso, agora se ganha XP ao fazer as miss&#xF5;es, e dependendo do seu n&#xED;vel ser&#xE3;o destravados os blueprints e amplia&#xE7;&#xE3;o da capacidade de acumular recursos.
<br>
<br>O jogo n&#xE3;o tem um modo &quot;continuos game&quot;, mas at&#xE9; agora confesso que n&#xE3;o senti falta dele. &#xC9; na campanha que as coisas acontecem, e ela &#xE9; imesa!
<br>
<br>Comprei Anno 2205 no dia do lan&#xE7;amento por R$ 129,99 e valeu cada centavo. Recomendo fortemente o jogo para todos que s&#xE3;o, assim como eu, f&#xE3;s dessa s&#xE9;rie maravilhosa. Num primeiro momento alguns poder&#xE3;o estranhar as mudan&#xE7;as. Mas acredite, elas vieram para melhorar o que j&#xE1; era quase perfeito. A Blue Byte est&#xE1; de parab&#xE9;ns!
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>- A engine gr&#xE1;fica tornou o game absolutamente lindo. De longe &#xE9; o jogo de simula&#xE7;&#xE3;o de cidades mais bonito da historia dos video games;
<br>
<br>- Racionaliza&#xE7;&#xE3;o da cadeia de produ&#xE7;&#xE3;o, pelo aprimoramento dos menus e em fun&#xE7;&#xE3;o do crescimento n&#xE3;o t&#xE3;o acelerado das demandas pelos habitantes, o que tornava a vers&#xE3;o anterior um tanto angustiante;
<br>
<br>- A substitui&#xE7;&#xE3;o do transporte de bens atrav&#xE9;s de espa&#xE7;onaves ao inv&#xE9;s de navios tornou o jogo muito chique e empolgante;
<br>
<br>- N&#xE3;o &#xE9; preciso mais se preocupar com o meio ambiente, pois na vis&#xE3;o da Blue Byte, a humanidade aprendeu com os erros do passado e, no futuro, a quest&#xE3;o ambiental na terra est&#xE1; totalmente controlada;
<br>
<br>- Praticamente todos os bens produzidos no novo game s&#xE3;o diferentes da vers&#xE3;o pr&#xE9;via, isso &#xE9; muito legal;
<br>
<br>- Roda muito bem com tudo no high e ultra, em 1080p, em um AMD FX 8350, 8Gb RAM e uma GTX670.
<br>
<br>Contras:
<br>
<br>- Alguns travamentos e restarts aleatorios, mesmo com o PC em 75~85% da capacidade m&#xE1;xima;
<br>
<br>- Em alguns mapas, como no glacial, as exig&#xEA;ncias dos habitantes s&#xE3;o altas. A falta de aten&#xE7;&#xE3;o nesse cen&#xE1;rio pode levar voc&#xEA; a bancarrota num piscar de olhos, Muito cuidado com seus recursos financeiros;
<br>
<br>- Existe um alerta sobre a possibilidade do jogo causar apilepsia em alguns jogadores que &#xE9; demorado e n&#xE3;o pode ser pulada pela tecla &quot;ESC&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5747314">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Sorry, but this game from Ubisoft was the worst in Syria Annaud. The gameplay is dull, dull, does not pull at all! I love the strategy, but this was the worst of all that I saw. A bunch of bugs, glitches, crashes. My GTX 970 should pull off perfectly, but bad graphics. Notice the strong drawdown FPS. Hopefully with time everything Ispra Just dip the year! Yes, and the price is too high.</span>

I can see how you can give this game a positive review if you never played any of the predecessors but if you are looking for a title like the previous Anno games you will be disappointed.
<br>
<br>In many places the games has been over simplified to the point where roads are a pure aesthetic and resources are exchanged between all buildings and islands totally automatic. The only trade that has to be set up is between different climate zones and even that just has to be done a few times in the entire paly through and we never get to see a single ship during this.
<br>
<br>Any sense of exploring the world and finding the best spots for your expanding empire is lost when you realize that all islands only differ in size and nothing else. The same mountain can be mined for any resource and the same soil gives any crops.
<br>
<br>The new rare resources mechanic is interesting on the surface but it quickly becomes clear that there is little to no choice to be made here. In the end only a few updates are worthwhile and those are must haves. After that adding a single functioning building just becomes a hassle of clicks until all small parts of it are placed. Without any noticeable freedom of choice.
<br>
<br>In the end this game just made me want to install the predecessor 1404.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=5659378">Expand</a></span>

<br>if you loved 2070 than forget about it this is NOTHING like 2070.
<br>
<br>1st of there are NO continuous/random generated maps you get one island and one sector every single time this never changes. You can purchase other islands from rivals but that&apos;s it and there is a limited amount to purchase.
<br>
<br>Next the gameplay might as well be on auto pilot there is literally almost NO challenge to playing this. It feels like a damn mobile game everything has been automated for you all you need to do is build something and make sure the goods are not in the minus than that&apos;s all you need to do you don&apos;t even need trade routes they don&apos;t exist except  to other sectors but even that has been dumbed down!
<br>
<br>There are no battles between islands or rivals either all battles are done in a separate map on their own and even they have been dumbed down. The map is littered with fuel and special icons that give you actions to do and they are not sparse even at high difficulty. So you&apos;ll find yourself not even attacking half the time just collecting icons than sit back and watch them do all the work for you!
<br>
<br>You will find yourself getting bored with this very very fast it only lasted 1 week for me. If you loved 2070 than stay away from this garbage do not waste your $ on it and boycott all anno games from here on because ub$soft have absolutely destroyed this franchise!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=6486637">Expand</a></span>

It had some advantages, since it had become boring, to some extent, to deal with all those details and micromanagement issues. In this game we build 3 kinds of cities, normal ones, ice ones and space colonies. Each one produces what the other need, so we have to develop them and trade what they make with what others make.
<br>
<br>If in other games of the seires we suffer with micromanagement issues as our empire grows. In this one it is too oversimplified, everything seems too previously calculated. But It was good to some extent, as we could expend more time building and expanding. I had a really good time playing the game, but it got a little boring before it should. Even so it doesn&apos;t change the fact that it is a very good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/anno-2205/user-reviews?user_review_id=6571432">Expand</a></span>

<br>- No trading between islands in the same region
