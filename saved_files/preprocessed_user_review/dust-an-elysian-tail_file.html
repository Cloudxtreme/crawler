<br>Dust is honestly one of the most enchanting and charming games I&apos;ve ever played. The fact that all of this (other than the music) was made by one person just makes this whole thing even more amazing than it already is. And if you&apos;re wondering about the music, then you won&apos;t be disappointed. Not by any means whatsoever. All-in-all, this proves to be perhaps *the* most captivating PC experiences I&apos;ve had. The art, the music, the surprisingly dark story...everything.

The game is beautiful and the work the developer has done with painting the environment, the enemies and the protagonists is OUTSTANDING! This game must be one of the best looking games I have ever played and the npcs are all voiced which is a nice and impressive touch (fidget&apos;s voice is the best). I rarely write reviews but I think this game is worth it. I don&apos;t think anyone would dislike this game since there isn&apos;t anything bad in this game. And the price makes it all the more appealing. I recommend this game by all means and hope we see a new project from the developers as soon as possible  ^^</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3185838">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game&apos;s story is really surprising, you can run through it, jaded, and ignore it if you want, the gameplay is fun enough and the personal evolution of your character and his choices by themselves are worth the price of admission, but if you start paying attention you&apos;ll uncover a rich plot covering issues like Racism, the Moral Struggle of Absolute Justice vs Acceptance, and little a brother not accepting the guy his older sister likes.
<br>
<br>The story, 30% in, is enough to start some conversations with a friend or gaming significant other :)
<br>
<br>The game will get a full 10 from me because for what it&apos;s worth, I can&apos;t find a problem with it worth nitpicking, but broken down this would be my score.

<br>Menus 9

<br>The 2D cartoon style is well performed and fits really well the universe, the fights are really cool too and the combat system is well though.

The pace was perfect, the skill tree provided noticeable and significant upgrades to the play with every choice and the story was engaging. The voice actors were top notch.

<br>The graphics are beautiful, and action is very fluid. The price was right so I gave it a shot and was well rewarded.</span>

This game takes what made the greatest classics of the 16 and 32 bit era what they were and upgrades that formula with modern design sensibilities and high definition art. As if the strong features of the actual game itself aren&apos;t enough, at a paltry 15 dollars it&apos;s an ambitious success that you&apos;d have to be foolish to overlook, even as a budget minded gamer, and make no mistake: This is one very well executed port that feels like it belonged on PC in the first place.
<br>
<br>The story itself reminds us of a time when the fantasy genre in video games wasn&apos;t desperately clinging to the coattails of Tolkien or drenched in angst and J Pop style, and the gameplay teaches us the valuable lesson that designs of the past are still relevant and can be improved upon. Bright, whimsical storybook fantasy story and characters that yet manage to be woven seamlessly into a serious and perhaps tragic story are found alongside straightforward and gripping gameplay that does nothing to divert the player from the goals laid out in front of them. In short, Dust makes up a sleek and well assembled package that shows far more polish and planning than you&apos;d expect of a big name let alone indie.
<br>
<br>Like Bastion or perhaps Cave Story, it&apos;s a throwback to days long gone, improving upon the strong foundation left behind in such a way that it begs the player to question why such things were ever abandoned to begin with. If this was a game you found yourself watching and waiting for on PC, make no delay in picking it up, it really is a no brainer purchase. It is a game that will suck you in, though, so be warned: You may want to put aside some time for it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3187489">Expand</a></span>

So many throwbacks to other indie developers that it made me smile. So thank you game developers for a game that not only I can play but my kids can play as well, that really brings you into the story!

<br>
<br>Esto es lo que nos propone Dust: An Elysian Tail, un juego donde se desenvuelve una historia no solamente original, sino verdaderamente atrapante y con varios giros en su desarrollo que no son para nada predecibles en realidad. Una historia en la cual te encuentras con varios personajes &#xFA;nicos y memorables, sobre todo los principales, de los cuales te hacen querer saber m&#xE1;s sobre ellos.
<br>
<br>Si extra&#xF1;as juegos al estilo de los cl&#xE1;sicos &quot;Castlevania&quot; encontrar&#xE1;s varias similitudes a ello en &quot;Dust&quot;, que cuenta con una jugabilidad sencilla pero completamente adictiva, niveles amplios y con elementos de RPG ya que nuestro personaje puede subir de nivel y portar objetos que lo ayuden a ser m&#xE1;s fuerte. Tambi&#xE9;n existe el uso de ataques m&#xE1;gicos que llegan a ser bastante espectaculares
<br>
<br>Este juego cuenta con varios secretos y parodias por descubrir en los cuales llega a hacerse menci&#xF3;n a otros juegos reconocidos de otras empresas.
<br>
<br>En cuanto a gr&#xE1;ficos es impresionante ya que son totalmente coloridos, atractivos y con escenarios perfectamente dise&#xF1;ados, cada uno con su tema propio muy bien adaptado.
<br>
<br>La banda sonora es de las mejores que he escuchado en mucho tiempo, sencillamente perfecta, encajando con la atm&#xF3;sfera de forma muy exacta, permiti&#xE9;ndonos sumergirnos placenteramente en esta aventura &#xE9;pica. Es incre&#xED;ble la manera en que encaja de forma maravillosa en los momentos mas cr&#xED;ticos y emotivos de la historia.
<br>
<br>Las actuaciones sobre las voces de los personajes es algo que cabe destacar tambi&#xE9;n ya que los di&#xE1;logos son interpretados incre&#xED;blemente, convirtiendo el intercambio de dialogos entre personajes en algo muy apetecible y entretenido. Sobre todo en las escenas de &#xE9;xtasis donde las actuaciones llegan a convertirse en algo muy bello.
<br>
<br>En res&#xFA;men: &quot;Dust: An Elysian Tail&quot; es un juego que no te puedes perder si eres amante de las aventuras fant&#xE1;sticas o simplemente buscas un buen juego que te haga olvidarte completamente de la vida cotidiana para llevar tu mente a lugares fant&#xE1;sticos y coloridos... sin necesidad de drogas.
<br>
<br>Mis felicitaciones a los desarrolladores.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3325760">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What is truly amazing about this game, however, is the story of its development.  With the exception of the music composed by Hyperduck Soundworks, everything else in this game (design, art, story, programming, EVERYTHING) was done by one person working unassisted.  And this one person went into this with zero knowledge of game design and programming.  He taught himself everything as he went along.  The fact that he was able to start from nothing and produce a game of such impeccable quality...it is a tremendous achievement, and truly inspiring.  The game deserves a playthrough based on that fact alone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3353068">Expand</a></span>

<br>Cons: Characters and some elements of the game are excessively twee. If you have an aversion to anthropomorphized animals, kawaii characterizations, or Disney-level cheese, you will probably be put off to some degree. Developer(s) put heavy emphasis on a storyline that is very linear, naive, cliche, overwrought, and largely unexplained. If you&apos;re hoping for a big twist or reveal near the end, you&apos;re going to be disappointed. Dodrill&apos;s thanking of &quot;an everloving God&quot; in the credits makes me wonder if the story was supposed to be some kind of allegory, and if an agenda is being pushed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3693693">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_3662953"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">This game was a little surprise for me: I was initially unsure of trying (either for the furry-like creatures, either for the castlevania style of gaming), but in the end I saw how it was fun and I got it myself: the result is that Dust is one of the funniest, most engaging action-rpg games around. Granted though it has plentiful of flaws that in my opinion don&apos;t give this a perfect score, because some are annoying and some are weird. The story, for starters, has a fatal flaw: it almost disappears during the middle of the game because the plot &quot;forcefully&quot; says to wait for the right moment, and that&apos;s annoying because it could have handled better by just giving us small hints and keeping the plot more constant; in the end, we focus on other things while we &quot;wait&quot; for the final resolution. Also, although this is highly personal, the choice of using furry-like creatures (AND BEFORE ANYONE EVEN BREATHES, I DID LIKE THE CHOICE OF IT) is a little unoriginal because it&apos;s a story of racism: for some reason whenever I read stories about furries (games or not), it&apos;s often racism or hatred between two of different species (with some exceptions): in my opinion they could have gone easily with humans instead, but I will lie if I said that the furries actually do give a nice cartoony touch and they are greatly well done and detailed. Infact Dust is not only a great character and very cool, but also very interesting and very likeable and that&apos;s a huge accomplishment to make, since cool characters tend to be annoying (Dante...here comes the dislikes) and likeable characters tend to be secondary characters of (bad) main characters (the sub characters of Tales of Xillia it&apos;s the first thing that pops in my mind). Speaking of, even Fidget (the secondary character) isn&apos;t all that bad either and it&apos;s likeable too!. However, her voice can be annoying. Also the secondary characters are good, although we won&apos;t know them for too long and they&apos;ll basically disappear after their quests. Ok story is out, what&apos;s else that doesn&apos;t work? The combat: the combos that we will get aren&apos;t that many but they are useful. For 5 minutes, after that you&apos;ll only know to use one skill: Dust Storm. What it does? With Fidget&apos;s spells, you can basically nuke everyone on the area without much trouble (and when you get the flying storm, it&apos;s even easier), and you&apos;ll get this in the very first level, making the game extremely easy: no point rising the difficulty, for it will only increase the damage from enemies and their hp, making it just more annoying than difficult, with also one big annoying thing: the save points only recover a portion of your HP, depending on which difficulty you play with (if the lowest, it fully recovers, if higher it recovers a quarter), and this is personally a big annoying flaw because, in the first hours of the game, you&apos;ll rarely get full hp unless you get food, which is expensive at first and unless you play on the easiest difficulty the HP WILL NOT recover in any other way except food (later on, you get regen items, which is something). Luckily this wasn&apos;t an issue, but I didn&apos;t like this design choide, since fights will be easy (and short) and levelling will be also very fast considering that the more combo, the extra xp you get and later on we do get very useful skills that will be needed to complete the maps (slide, double jump, climbinb, etc). Luckily we get some trials during the game (6 if I&apos;m right) that will also give you some break from the usual slaughter and will put to test your main skills, but in here I noticed another issue: the controls aren&apos;t that perfect, since a lot of times they tend to be not precise (the dodge doesn&apos;t make you invulnerable while dodging and has a fixed range; slide has a fixed range too and climbing &quot;won&apos;t climb&quot; on it&apos;s own, but you&apos;ll have to jump): this issue is most notable while doing the trials, since precision is almost required for getting 4 stars, but for the rest of the game is no big brainer and you won&apos;t even care. And for last, the game isn&apos;t exactly long: I finished at 100% in 15 hours max, but for those who don&apos;t want to complete the game will surely take 10 hours more or less, depending on how much you&apos;re rushing. But I think the good points overcome the bad points: graphically it&apos;s a gem, animation is fantastic on Dust (not as good on the rest of the characters), voice acting is very well done and engaging (a bit too overacting now and then), level design is great and the story even with flaws is very good and has an good and often misused idea behind (SPOILER: the soul merging) that is well done. And it&apos;s cheap too. If you love games like Castlevania, this might a great gift for your collection; if you love Action-Rpg, you will like how fast and easy is to play. Only thing that might drawback people is the furry elements but, considering the quality of the game itself, I dare say is a detail that you can easily ignore. Give it a shot: it highly deserves it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3662953">Expand</a></span>

<br>playing dust feels wrong, it seems unfinished and flawed. there is no strategy behind the combat system.

Items are nice and all, but not really something to think about. Just use the best thing you find. The story is clich&#xE9; to the point of cringing and the characters are the most basic of archetypes with little to no depth. After all this bad talk, I have to say I still enjoyed playing it. It just could have been a much better game. Oh, and I hate the fact that this game seems to cater to furries, but I won&apos;t judge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3212011">Expand</a></span>

However, it then suddenly hits you over the head with a seemingly endless underground level that features large amounts of platforming and enemies that can only be beaten by parrying, whereas the first 40% was a fast-paced and flashy brawler. It suddenly expects you to have mastered techniques you never before needed, which indicates that the designers didn&apos;t really know what made their game fun and put their money on the wrong horse. Even the anthropomorphic  stuff gradually disappear to make room for more platforming puzzles and combat all but disappeared from the game, aside from a few tedious encounters with shielded foes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3222813">Expand</a></span>

The tooney art style is easy on the eyes, but also distracts you from the deep storyline that the game follows. Make no mistake- this game can get heavy. Is it a game for children? Sure, a child could play it, but the game is much more than that. I found the writing in the game to be nothing less than phenomenal. The character quips and attitude that were present were highly appealing, especially anything that was said by Fidget. The quests that you undertake throughout the game are nothing special, but the over-arcing storyline is a good one to pay attention to. The combat in the game is solid and very flashy and pretty rewarding. My only complaint about the game is how repetitive the combat can get, however. Once you find a few combos that work for you, you rarely use anything else for the rest of the game. And there is A LOT of combat- every time you leave a section, monsters respawn in every area you cleared. I felt like there was a decent amount of back-tracking throughout the game, so I fought more respawns throughout the game than anything else. But that is the ONE downside to the game overall. Everything else was fantastic- from the characters to the gameplay to the item management to the RPG elements, everything was handled fantastically. It was well worth the 14 hours it took me to beat the game (it&apos;s probably possible to beat the game in about half the time, but like I said, I did a fair amount of backtracking and searching). I would recommend this game to just about anyone.
<br>
<br>PS Games like this seem to suffer from pacing issues- they&apos;re not quite sure when they should end. Dust just about nails it, in terms of length. Nothing feels terribly stretched out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=4131901">Expand</a></span>

It does has some majior glitch at times, i havent noticed on pc except half the screen get cut off in the title for a bit, and for the xbox it does crashes to home screen. just save multiple times for different slots like an elder scrolls game and if you see a power up that your supposed to get that is not there. i&apos;m sorry but new game or reload a save file that doesn&apos;t have that problem. so far ive had to new game once. This is really a good game. Better then muramasa in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3291605">Expand</a></span>

Excellent story, amazing characters, graphics was stunning,  rpg elements, drama, humor, it has it all. There is a lot to do in this game with its many secrets you can find. Anyway if you haven&apos;t played it you should definitely cheek it out.</span>

You can see the developer took his time and put effort into every detail. Sure it&apos;s only 2D Side Strolling but never once did I think &quot;Oh this looks cheesy.&quot; Every time I went somewhere new it always started with a &quot;Wow.&quot; or &quot;Amazing...&quot; This game is defiantly worth it&apos;s money. Another note is... this game instantly gets 2 bonus points for a PERFECT PORT to PC. This puts a lot of AAA game industries to shame.
<br>
<br>Story is fantastic. It&apos;s well told. It&apos;s not going to be something phenomenal but just how the pacing is done and how each part is teaching Dust a lesson as he gets his memories back and how it tells us a little bit of his past at the same time just keeps you going and wanting more. Although I don&apos;t know what to say about the ending but maybe a sequel for this amazing game?
<br>
<br>Characters here are memorable and I will never forget them. Some people will have problems with the characters being Furry but no one had a problem with StarFox now did they? So get over it. Dust and Fidget are an amazing duo and I couldn&apos;t help but laugh almost every time Fidget spoke. Her disregard for the fourth wall and the jokes with it just cracked me up. Dust&apos;s core character is really generic but his voice actor brings him to life and makes you feel the emotions he&apos;s going through It never once came to my mind that &quot;Ew, Dust, is really generic.&quot; and I hope no one else feels the same. The sword Ahrah doesn&apos;t have a huge impact but you can defiantly see him as support role as well as main. He&apos;s trying to bring back Dust into someone better and reteach him his skills. That&apos;s enough to make me remember him.
<br>
<br>So this game is a 2D side stroller so it&apos;s visuals and graphics must be sub-par right? Wrong! It never once made me think they were poor or under developed. I thought they were amazing and really high end for a game like this. The enemies were detailed the backgrounds were amazing the character cut scenes were superb! Did I really pay 15 dollars for this game?
<br>
<br>Gameplay and controls are stellar! I mean it just feels, perfect. Everything responds quickly it moves smoothly it&apos;s just, fantastic. I can&apos;t really go into detail because, I can not really describe it. It&apos;s just amazing.
<br>
<br>Difficulty falls short or maybe I&apos;m just skilled? I stuck it on Tough my first run through and found it anything but tough. Most of my deaths come from hazardous terrain. Never did I see any boss or monster challenging. Again though I think I am a great gamer as when my friend and my girlfriend played this on Tough they had difficulty with a lot of enemies. So I can&apos;t really say for sure if the game is too easy or too hard. I guess it just depends on how good of a player you are.
<br>
<br>Would I recommend this game? Hell yeah! GO BUY IT NOW DAMMIT! This is an absolute required game for everyone! I still can&apos;t believe I payed so little for this game. I would have easily paid 40 dollars for this!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3272720">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros: Great story, Great dialog, spectacular art style, cameos from other indie game characters (fez, braid, super meat boy etc..), very cheap, many hours of pure fun, the ending is very touching, main character is energetic, humorous conversations :)
<br>
<br>Cons: Bosses are very easy, some repetition from backtracking and revisiting environments in order to complete some side quests or unlock achievements, Dust needs more combat moves

For the most part the hype is well deserved. For a casual action RPG/platformer look no further. The combat mechanics are deep enough not to feel terribly button-mashy, but neither are they challenging to master. The comedy is campy, but fun, and fits the animation well. Be prepared for furries, though. And the voice acting is... generally good... but I cringed at more than a few lines. I&apos;ve read a few reviews that describe it as &quot;the best ever&quot; but that is far overreaching. It&apos;s okay, certainly not great. For me, the real appeal of this game is that it&apos;s just plain fun. It&apos;s a great platformer with great RPG elements (the gear/item options are particularly fun to search for and upgrade), and I had a lot of fun simply exploring the map in search of treasure. Absolutely worth a spot on your hard drive.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=4008136">Expand</a></span>

The controls are tight, and they serve well in the simple, yet addicting battle mechanics. The storyline itself is very intriguing and adds more purpose to actual completing the game. The voice acting is pretty good as well. I am simply put, and indie game whore and fanatic, and this was, simply put AMAZING. A must buy. 10/10</span>

The fair mark would be 85/100 or 8,5/10. This game should not be missed by fans of ARPG, Platformer or Brawler genres. Though I can advise it pretty much to any gamer because of it&apos;s top notch quality in every aspect.</span>

<br>
<br>A few small flaws:
<br>1. occasionally imprecise parrying
<br>2. the cartoon cut scenes are somewhat poor quality
<br>
<br>As a metroidvania fan I highly recommend this game.  Bought for $2.99 on sale, played 25 hours.  Will play again every few years for the rest of my life.</span>

It features incredible gameplay, outstanding animation, top notch character introductions and development, brilliant, brilliant music and excellent, convincing voice acting. The RPG elements in the game, while simple compared to many other ARPGs, are very well executed and complemented the game perfectly. About the only minor gripe I really had was that traveling could have been made easier by being able to choose a specific save location in an area from the world map when revisiting it to find secrets/treasures after learning new skills. Then again, the process of having to go from either the beginning of and area or the end of an area to get to these points enabled me to gather a lot of resources and do a lot of leveling that made me prepared for the difficulty at the end of the game. I would seriously suggest picking it up as this is worth every $$$ spent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=4245789">Expand</a></span>

The art style and voice acting alone make the game worth playing for hours on end.  The game play is a standard side-scroller with combo/button mashing mechanics built in.  While not entirely original it has enough diversity in the way it approaches the system that it is far from a repetitive bore-fest.  I just cannot say enough about the gorgeous visuals in the game.  Dialogue is delivered through a high quality portrait of the character talking and the images are lush and well animated.  In addition the voice acting is just fabulous and if you don&apos;t immediately giggle when first hearing Fidget speak this likely is not the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3918934">Expand</a></span>

The combat is great (really spectacle fighter-y), platforming is good, and the storytelling is near-perfect. The only things that bring this down is that at some points, the voice acting is less than desirable and the 4 boss fights throughout the game (excluding the final boss) are nothing very special. Another thing is that a Windows update currently brought a bug that causes some backgrounds and cutscenes to be cut off on the top and some backgrounds to not display at all (like on the map screen where you should see the Navi-esque companion Fidget sleeping or eating marshmallows over a campfire), but since this could easily be fixed in a future Windows update, I will not allow it to affect my score. If you ask me, this is a must-have.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3339981">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game easily earns a 9 but for the effort this guy took and the new fresh story i give it a full 10.
<br>This game clocked me 18 hrs but i was enjoying all visuals and playing at the &quot;Tough&quot; difficulty level,since the other 2 are just too easy and make the combat very effortless,so pls play at tough or higher difficulty.
<br>
<br>Thank u for reading my review and i hope i gave u reason enough to buy this game,but seriously buy the game !!!
<br>Thats it for me, Lunate signing off!
<br>
<br>P.S: If ur guessing why im not telling u his name,thats because i want u buy the damn game and play it and then judge the guy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3251496">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only complaint is that after playing it for well over 17h, you can get a little tired of the combat style, but i couldn&apos;t stop myself from playing it 24/7 thanks to it&apos;s amazing story and characters. Worth meantioning is also that only one guy made this game (not counting voice actors and artists working on music) in only four years! Since he released it on Xbox first he made sure to make the best goddamn port i think i have ever seen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3247712">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game is not expensive, and really worth buying</span>

<br>
<br>It can get a little tedious towards the end due to repetition and quite a bit of backtracking, and with hard difficulty it can grind on your nerves a bit, but on the whole, for a game of this length (around 15 hours long) and this polished state to be done by mostly one person, it is quite the achievement.
<br>
<br>If you like this type of games, this should be definitely one for your list. Do not expect the new dawn of gaming revolution, but it&apos;s pleasant enough to earn a place in your fond memories once you have finished it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3398164">Expand</a></span>

Forget the mega-budget monstrosities like Call of Doody; this little game has actual heart. I would trade every soulless megabudget game that will inevitably be released next year for another meticulously hand-crafted game like this one. It&apos;s not just the literal artwork that makes this game incredible (and the artwork truly is beatiful)  but the entire experience the game provides. From gameplay to character development to story to soundtrack, Dust is an enthralling adventure that is refreshingly unique. This game might not have the million-dollar polish that the huge games have, but, to me, that didn&apos;t matter one bit. The gameplay is a blast and the story is surprisingly serious. The characters are instantly memorable, and if the game doesn&apos;t leave you breathless by the end, well, then, I don&apos;t know what would.
<br>All in all, a real masterpiece of an indie game  one that is worth far more than $15, IMHO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3391866">Expand</a></span>

<br>The battle mechanism is quite a homage to old-style 2D hack &amp; slash which turns out to be executed nicely. No clutter, no BS yet you&apos;ll feel it&apos;s generally varied and fluid enough to keep you interested. The side-quest and treasure box system is challenging and rewarding enough to have you spend quite a lot of time on, while not distracting from the main-line story. Therefore the gameplay feels solid throughout.
<br>
<br>The indie developer who made the game, Dean Dodrill, certainly put his heart into the gameplay. His attention to details is respectable. Every game area feels characteristically distinct and alive(if you&apos;ve played Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic you&apos;d get what I mean.) Not to mention the totally amazing tribute to other indie games which is seamlessly a part of this game. Especially the parts of stylistically simulating the gameplay of Fez, Braid, and Bastion. Though only a fraction of actual playing time, its implementation must have demanded tons of time and dedication. Contrast this with big productions nowadays, which are fast-food products: looking marketable but lacking in soul and sincerity. Although such contrast is no surprise anyways.
<br>
<br>With that said, I feel its story mostly mainstream at best. Sure it would be quite impossible to demand a video game of a story with Nobel-Prize(or even any serious literature) level of quality and complexity, but the story still feels a bit simplistic and failing to build on its quite promising backbone: protagonist&#x2019;s identity to produce convincing and touching accounts. It feels as if there should have been much more interactions between characters, as well as much more in-depth depictions of characters. Instead, characters look good-or-evil, which is highly unreal; story looks more like something to string the gameplay together rather than a serious stuff by its own right, and the ending feels most thoroughly traditional-Hollywood and uninspiring, even a bit rushed. Though probably it&#x2019;s a common phenomena for video games, I would say that Braid and Bastion, also as Indie Games, have told much more original and edifying stories than this one.
<br>
<br>In the end, while I gave Bastion 10 stars, I would only give Elysian Tail 8 stars. Not to say it&#x2019;s not a good game. Only that it looks slightly less awesome in my eyes. In all, still definitely a game made with heart, and worth trying for everybody!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3893986">Expand</a></span>

Has a great story and alot of action and fast pace run and jump. The best part like i said is the story is spectacular. better than some AAA titls out there even. HIGHLY suggest this game</span>

You may think that the story is stupid and childish, you are mistaken. So what the story is about animals? That does not mean that it is merely meant to be played be children. Dust has an amazing combat system, stunning presentation, and amazing voice acting. Some games don&apos;t even have a personality to go with their characters, some games don&apos;t even bother to give their characters a tone in their voice. But Dust is different. The characters are almost real. The tone, the way the characters act. It&apos;s almost real. I was not a big fan of RPG games. But games like Dust and Path of Exile have made me fans of a genre I once didn&apos;t care for. Dust is a wonderful game, and well worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3675931">Expand</a></span>

<br>This game is amazing and easily one of the best ones I have played in the last years. The graphics are GORGEOS, the environments are breathtakingly beautiful and I&apos;ve come to love the characters over the course of the game (gotta admit, I found Fidget to be pretty annoying at first, that changed pretty soon tho).
<br>
<br>I would highly recommend this game to anyone!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3831098">Expand</a></span>

Not much can satisfy like a good old school branching 2d platformer, so I snatched Dust: An Elysian Tail when it was on sale.  It is an excellent game - ASTOUNDING when you consider it was made by one person who had to learn how to code as a first step!  I&apos;m not taking that fact into account with my review (I&apos;m tough but fair), nevertheless much respect to him for this amazing achievement.
<br>
<br>The biggest pro for me is the fluid and rewarding combat system.  Everything is very smooth, the visuals are very entertaining and chaining together a big combo is very satisfying.  The enemies towards the beginning are way too easy but as you go there are a few quite challenging enemies starting about halfway through.  A tip for anyone with even a passing familiarity with 2d platformers - use at least the tough difficulty setting, otherwise this will be way too easy.  The artwork is a highlight.  Every environment is beautiful, with multi-level backdrops, beautiful plants, animals and settings.  Game pace is good, secret areas are well done.  The animation is very good, but Dust himself kind of runs around like he has a stick up his ass.  The sound is pretty good.  There are also several homages to old games (and I mean OLD, even back to NES games) that I enjoyed more than I thought I would.
<br>
<br>I only have a few minor complaints.  First I found the story interesting but the conversations long winded.  Probably 25% of the dialogue should have been chopped.  It messes with the pacing of an otherwise great story.  I think the complaints about Fidget being annoying are overblown.  I also wish that there were more weapons to collect besides Fidget&apos;s three ammo types, especially since only one was useful.  As good as the combat system is, another type of sword or boomerang or SOMETHING would have been nice.  My biggest complaint is the amount of trouble I have to go through to get the game working with my Logitech Rumblepad 2.  I had to use x360ce to emulate an xbox gamepad.  It works great but was a pain to set up.
<br>
<br>That&apos;s all!  Great game, would definitely recommend.  I&apos;m very much looking forward to a sequel, which I&apos;m sure will address some of my minor complaints.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=4247442">Expand</a></span>

I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the gameplay. Considering that this game was made mainly by one animator who wanted to make a game, it is very good.
<br>
<br>Without spoiling the story, you play as Dust, who is currently suffering form amnesia. A sword that can control the element of wind comes to him, along with the sword&apos;s guardian (and Dust&apos;s new companion) Fidget. Together they go on an adventure to recover Dust&apos;s memories and discovering the truth behind his existence.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is slightly similar to Muramasa: Demon Blade. It&apos;s a side scroller where you have a very overpowered blade (if used properly). Fidget is used to add variety to your attacks with her powers. As you play you gain new abilities and items which allow you to access areas previously blocked off. Pretty straight forward.
<br>
<br>As for the characters, in regards to the designs and dialog, I found them charming. Many see it as childish or immature  or too &quot;furry&quot; which honestly the designs are no different then a lot of the anthro cartoons we all have grown up with), but I found it to be enjoyable. The one liners had me laughing and the characters actually managed to get me very absorbed in the game. I didn&apos;t want to quit until I had beat the game.
<br>
<br>The game is rather short, but in my opinion it was well worth the money. I have replayed it several times and still find it as charming as when I first played. The story was actually very unique and well done. It surprised me. I recommend that anyone who purchases Dust An Elysian Tail is that you please keep an open mind. Let yourself enjoy the story and don&apos;t focus so much on the art style choice (which I have seen many people avoiding because).
<br>
<br>Highly recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=3891887">Expand</a></span>

A fantastic story with twists and turns, a beautiful art design that  reminds me of Disney when it was good, solid combat and slick controls, tight level design, ambient music, and I really love the graphics, if not washed out.</span>

<br>
<br>Only a few flaws I could see. Like how your almost never getting the crafting materials you need on a drop. Good thing they have the thing of selling it to buy later. Also the last lever overdoes it on the enemies making it repetitive and annoying after a while. Finally the only flaw with the story is the Villain&apos;s reasons for the evil thing he&apos;s doing is very questionable and it didn&apos;t feel like there was enough build-up before the final battle.
<br>
<br>Overall I&apos;m glad I played it and hope to see more like this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=4582349">Expand</a></span>

The game can be enjoyed best with a gamepad, I used a Steam Controller and it worked like a charm.
<br>The plot is very enjoyable and the characters lovely (how can&apos;t you love Fidget?). The RPG elements are an interesting addition, that keeps the player more interested in the game. There are lots of easter eggs (if you have played Bastion or Fez, keep your eyes open...), and the map that tells you how much you have explored of each area saves the player from wasting lots of time in searching where nothing is present, or from giving up searching bonus and conclude the game.
<br>Overall, I warmly recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=6385560">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Yet, gameplay gets repetitive, annoying, and boring, to my taste
<br>-Usually not that challanging
<br>-Weak attempt to combine RPG elements in Platform game
<br>-Plot and storytelling are generally not that good
<br>-Soon enough it becomes just smashins buttons and watching the screen goes VOOSHWOOSH
<br>
<br>Artistically, Dust is truly an amazing button-smasher. Oh, no, whooops, RPG-Platformer, what am I saying...
<br>Silly me.
<br>So, yeah, while it feels really (REALLY!) unfortunate to give this game a negative review, I&apos;m going to have to do that, because Dust eventually ends up being, as I just said, a button smasher. Merely and mostly a button-smasher.
<br>
<br>And the sad thing about it, is that this is pretty much the only thing about the game that is actually bad, in my opinion. And so, all of Dust&apos;s good aspects are going to waste on the final result....
<br>
<br>At the very beginning of the game, Dust reminded me of Rayman, and in a good way. Meaning that, it reminded me the glory days of platforming games, or at least that glorious series which had somehow managed to keep some of the first installment&apos;s magic in it towards the years.
<br>Dust begins with that magic as well.
<br>It gives you a feeling of an aspiring Disney film.
<br>It has lush and colorful graphics, which seems hand drawn, and seems even more terrific in my opinion with the post-effects turned off, in the so-to-speak &apos;lower&apos; quality.
<br>It also has a magical soundtrack, combines many sort of genres, catchy and dramatic moments, and it fits the game perfectly.
<br>The different areas of the game are very immersing and seems like there was much though put in their design.
<br>
<br>So, really, the developers had prepared a great ground for the actual game. Really incredible atmosphere and environment.
<br>
<br>Too bad the game starts to fall short as we reach the actual content.
<br>The plot is nothing special, it isn&apos;t too bad but not much good either. It is mostly predictable, it starts alright but then you see it really isn&apos;t anything interesting, with the exception of just a few moving moments.
<br>Still, it isn&apos;t enough to push you forward AND make you enjoy yourself.
<br>Towards the end, unfortunately, I didn&apos;t even care much what the characters were saying, but just kind of wanter to get this over with...
<br>
<br>Of course, a game with terrific gameplay doesn&apos;t HAVE to have a good story.
<br>But sadly enough Dust won&apos;t deliver on this aspect as well.
<br>Dust is mainly a platformer, and therefore its gameplay isn&apos;t that complex and you can imagine how it plays out.. Of course, there are some terrific platformers, some mediocre, and some bad ones... Depends on the execution, right?
<br>Well, here the execution didn&apos;t go so well to my taste.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is basically a simple platforming gameplay, and you&apos;d slowly gain some abilities, and yet it becomes incredibly repetitive and boring, and also somewhat annoying. It isn&apos;t even too graceful, as as the game progresses you&apos;d find yourself among more and more HORDES of enemies, and not single enemies. It actually becomes the core of the game pretty quickly. And what will you do then? As I said at the very beginning, you start Smashing Button! Three buttons, smash them with all might. At the very beginning of the game you&apos;ll learn the different &apos;moves&apos; you can do with those buttons but soon enough you wouldn&apos;t care, as it doesn&apos;t make that much difference. Why, you might ask? Because you wouldn&apos;t even see much of these moves. As you amash the attack, jump, and moving buttons, pretty much all at ones, at many times you can&apos;t really tell for sure what&apos;s going on on your screen. You&apos;re just watching Dust jumping from point to point as there are lights and bombings and explosions and hurt enemies faltering anywhere, as even you&apos;re sidekick says once in the game: &quot;Seriously, have you seen the screen? He goes VOOSHWOOSHSHWOOSHVOOSH&quot;. And that&apos;s an understatement.
<br>
<br>Last but not least, let&apos;s not forget that&apos;s a RPG-Platformer. Of course. The devs tried to add some RPG elements, but personally I found them very weak and not integrated to the game so well.
<br>Yes, there are side-quests, there are exp points, leveling up, so-to-speak abilities to improve, some &apos;crafting&apos;, some stats, some clothes which would raise those stats....
<br>All these features just felt very out of place to me, they weren&apos;t that interesting or crucial to the game, and didn&apos;t add much challange to Dust, which I completed on Normal with all sidequests and most achievements done, and pretty much with ease.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t say this is a BAD game. It does have magic in it, and many good aspects. But only halfway through the game I just felt it was more of an annoyance to me than fun. And that definitely shouldn&apos;t be that way, so, no, I wouldn&apos;t really recommend on this one.
<br>Unless smashing-buttons aimlessly and watching your screen goes VOOSHWOOSHVOOSH is you&apos;re thing, of course.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=4862753">Expand</a></span>

<br>The heck with the furry haters and internet trolls, this game is amazing. Let alone my favorite game of all time! The art style is amazing, the characters are well-developed, and the music is astounding. Yes, I may be a furry, but that doesn&apos;t prove the point that you&apos;ll be attached to certain characters. ESPECIALLY Dust himself. Even the development was interesting, because it took 4 years to make by one guy (aside from the music, voice acting, writing, etc.) The game also has addictive gameplay and makes a unique use of the controls. Even though it is a RPG, you won&apos;t have to grind in it, which is less painful. The bosses are great and challenging fights that make you feel depressed at the end. Speaking of which, the game can get dark at times, even if it&apos;s rated E 10. All in all, this game is PLUPERFECT. PERFECT ART. PERFECT CHARACTERS. PERFECT STORY. PERFECT MUSIC. PERFECT GAMEPLAY. PERFECT QUESTS. PERFECT EVERYTHING!!!
<br>
<br>And to think, 29 people posted negative reviews of this game. All I can say is this: I know I&apos;m supposed to be open to other opinions, but whoever hated this game is bound to face their demise.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dust-an-elysian-tail/user-reviews?user_review_id=4853273">Expand</a></span>
