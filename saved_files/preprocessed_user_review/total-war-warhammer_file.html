After the release of Total War: Attila, I was worried that the franchise might not rebound, but with Warhammer it seems to be on the right path, but not necessarily the right direction. What I mean is that I&apos;m playing Warhammer, but it doesn&apos;t necessarily feel like Total War. The game has been dumbed down dramatically, in particular with managing provinces and raising armies. It&apos;s not necessarily a bad thing, but it lacks the Total War feel. Of course you have to expect some give and take in that regard, but it&apos;s also the reason why I only gave it a 7 and not an 8-10.
<br>
<br>Yes the game has great graphics, yes it runs much smoother than Attila, however it didn&apos;t really expand on the elements that made so many of us love Total War in the first place. In fact it felt like they tried to do the same things they did with Attila, for instance, there are only 4 starting races, with one bonus race if you pre-ordered. That&apos;s about the same amount of factions in the first game, as far as unique unit types. So what you can expect is numerous new factions being added, but only at a cost. The trick to appeasement is to offer new stuff, but not significant amounts of new stuff, to make us believe that they&apos;re not trying to nickle and dime us on additions to the game.
<br>
<br>Alright, so the game play is good, simplistic, but good. The addition of a fantasy element really does make you think. Is it a bad game? By no means. Is it everything I&apos;d hoped for? By no means. Would I still buy it knowing what I do now? Most likely, but I&apos;d still be griping about what I felt should&apos;ve been changed or kept the same. Maybe I&apos;m just one of those people that can&apos;t be satisfied. Anyways, I hope that helped.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6426639">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Like any tw game it does have its typical total war issues. Nothing serious. The game performs great on my old gtx 780. I`m getting high/ultra settings and a lot of eye candy on. + huge unit numbers. Which is perfect for me.
<br>
<br>Keep in mind that installing the latest nvidia driver makes the game hang on the warhammer logo. Playing steam offline helps for now. Suppose this will get fixed soon as rtw2 had the same issue.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6426960">Expand</a></span>

I believe they did. Then you may ask &quot;Is this another Rome 2 fail launch?&quot; and I&apos;d say no, for me, the game is fine on launch and there are no obvious game breaking issues.
<br>
<br>TW Warhammer offers the choice of 5 distinct races. Each of the races plays quite differently and has some unique mechanics going for them. Character customization is better than any TW game before, with lots of magic items, skills and followers to tailor them to your needs. The campaign map looks spectacular, with lots of awesome-looking landmarks such as skull mountains, volcanoes and unique structures allover the place and when the evil factions Chaos or Vampires get hold of a province, the terrain changes to a hellish landscape, which is a nice touch.
<br>
<br>The battles run a lot smoother than Rome 2 and the the variation in units is massive. Each race starts with some basic stuff like spearmen and archers, but as you progress in the game you start to unlock the creatures that make them unique, such as demigryph riding knights, flame cannons, boar-riding orcs towering giants or undead dragons. Bringing your customized generals and heroes into the fray feels really rewarding, as they send lesser warriors flying just like Sauron did in the Lord of the Rings movie.
<br>
<br>Overall the game seems somewhat easier to play. In Rome 2 and Attila in particular you had to juggle food, squalor, sanitation and all that, but in Warhammer the buildings have no penalties so you can just build whatever you want. Some regions have unique buildings or resources so there is some variation and not every province will be a carbon copy.
<br>
<br>Since the Campaign part of the game is turn based, the time it takes to resolve rounds is important, and I have to say they are REALLY quick, roughly 15-20 seconds with the movement of enemy characters turned off, which is a breather since Attila would take up to a minute which is really frustrating sometimes.
<br>
<br>There are two negatives I can point out so far. First, in battles, the magic spells are not completely balanced yet; magic is a limited resource so you can only cast so many spells, but magic missiles seem to miss all the time and do less damage than a cannonball if they do hit while the recharge of magic spells is so fast that you wonder why they even have a recharge time, as you&apos;re waiting for mana anyway.
<br>
<br>The second is the lack of variety in battle maps. The battles in the field have a lot of variation, but siege maps are mostly the same. And there is not really any other type of battle (no river battle, no minor village battle), which is a bit of a shame if you&apos;re in it for the multiplayer battles and you want to play a different type of battle.
<br>
<br>So, overall, 9/10, good performance, beautiful fantasy setting, lots of unit variation, nicely distinct races to play, but it lost a point because of no good balancing on magic and they should have put in more different battle maps.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6426392">Expand</a></span>

Trade agreement al, dost ol, i&#x15F;te size total war diplomasisini &#xF6;zetledim, bu bitti...
<br>
<br>Ha tamam hadi bunu ge&#xE7;tik total war&apos;un en g&#xFC;zel ve benimde en sevdi&#x11F;im &#xF6;zelli&#x11F;i RTS yan&#x131;d&#x131;r. &#x130;&#x15F;te burada taktik ve simulasyon &#xF6;zellikleri konu&#x15F;ulabilir. Serinin en iyi animasyonlar&#x131; ku&#x15F;kusuz Shogun 2 oyunundad&#x131;r. Rome 2 ve Atilla ve tabiki bu warhammer oyununda iste askerler havaya k&#x131;l&#x131;&#xE7; sallamakta, birileri sebepsiz &#xF6;lmektedir.

B&#xFC;t&#xFC;n birimler tam disiplin dikd&#xF6;rtgen prizmalar&#x131; halinde durmaktad&#x131;rlar, oysa &#xF6;zellikler rome 2 ve Atilla oyunu i&#xE7;in konu&#x15F;ursak, barbar &#x131;rklarda bu disiplini g&#xF6;rmememiz gerekir. Ayr&#x131;ca 3-4 varyasyon d&#x131;&#x15F;&#x131;nda b&#xFC;t&#xFC;n askerler hala ayn&#x131; g&#xF6;r&#xFC;nmektedir, hala ayn&#x131; hareket sekans&#x131;n&#x131; tekrarlamaktad&#x131;r. D&#xF6;v&#xFC;&#x15F; durumu zaten bahsetti&#x11F;im &#xFC;zere daha vahim bir haldedir. Kimin neden &#xF6;ld&#xFC;&#x11F;&#xFC; bile bazen belli olmamaktad&#x131;r.

<br>
<br>Yani b&#xFC;t&#xFC;n bunlar s&#xF6;z konusuyken bu sa&#xE7;ma sapan oyun, Total War camias&#x131;na bir hakarettir.

<br>So far it was worth every cent i did spend on it. I played around 1000 Hours now and already preordered the next part of the Triology. CA/Sega will have a hard time with the next Historical title because if they go back to copy&amp;Paste factions, people will hate it. They tasted the High standard now and most people cant go back. If you want to have hundreds of Hours good entertainment with a High replayability in a Fantasy strategy Game: This is your Game. Its will be the first complete Warhammer Game ever made. And im sure such a mammuth Project will not come again so soon.
<br>Thanks CA/Sega to be so brave and made such a High Risk niche Project of High quality.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7392264">Expand</a></span>

<br>Also it should be noted that against the wishes of an adamant fanbase CA was chopping the game up for DLC&apos;s long before it was out. The &quot;Chaos day one DLC&quot; was just shameful, but even basic options like blood and gore are a DLC in this. Next Total War we&apos;ll probably have to pay for sound effects.
<br>
<br>So the base game itself, covered in insulting little dlc moneybags and locked content is about 70$ Canadian.

This game is truly a fresh start for total war as they have never made a game like this before, veteran total war fans might be annoyed because certain thing have been dumbed down like how the map size is not as big as previous ones but the game its self is as I said a solid foundation for something great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6484338">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you&apos;ve played Shogun 2 though... bit of a different story. See, this game is not &quot;bad&quot;, and is actually comfortably ahead of the more recent Rome 2 and Attila Total War games, but the problem is the rampant streamlining of the game at the expense of immersion and challenge.
<br>
<br>In fact, it&apos;s so stripped down that at times you feel each individual battle is a tech demo of what could be, rather than a finished product. I feel incredibly harsh saying that, as so many things are done right here and the level of detail involved is stunning, but all of that is tainted by the game alternating between too easy and too obvious. Would it have hurt to put a bit more focus on the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; elements of getting your armies together and so on? How about making the battles feel like the epic blood and thunder encounters the Warhammer universe is famed for? Why are all the battles incredibly short? Why is every single siege in the game the same thing over and over again?
<br>
<br>It&apos;s like they had the basics there, and forgot to build on them. Can I still recommend this game? Yes, I really can. In fact, I know this review is going to look unduly harsh, but it&apos;s because I&apos;ve played Total War games in the past that are simply hands down better than this one, even though if taken in isolation this is a good strategy game in its&apos; own right.
<br>
<br>As a fan of both strategy and Warhammer, this is both a decent game and a massive disappointment at the same time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6528402">Expand</a></span>

You manage your settlements and armys on the campaignmap and fight huge realtime-battles on the battlefield. Settlement management is a HUGE improvement over Rome 2, you don&apos;t have uncountable options to upgrade your buildings (with only minor differences) anymore. I even prefer this system over Shogun 2, where npc&apos;s just upgraded their provinces which costs you food (a valiuable resource) when conquered - which you couldn&apos;t make unhappen, you had to live with that. But that doens&apos;t exist anymore. You now have buildings that make sense, you always know what to build. You have your buildings for military stuff and upgrades (eg. forges) as well as buildings for money, towngrowth, public order and so on.
<br>There is also no Food in the game as a resource besides Gold anymore, but Towngrowth instead (you need to get it to upgrade your buildings). I don&apos;t mind that change, it&apos;s neither worse nor better then before.
<br>I am a 40k fanboy, and I like fantasy universes as well, so I hadn&apos;t any problems to get used to this new setting, and I quite like it. I enjoy the huge unit variety, the monsters and heroes you get attached to when watching them ripping your enemys apart doing their questbattles to gain special armour and so on, all the new spells and abillitys are fun to use as well.
<br>It&apos;s super fun and it was almost impossible to stop playing this game for the last 7 days, always stayed up to 1 or 2am even when i needed to get up early the next morning. There is so much to do in this game and you always want to play only one more turn.
<br>Game on higher difficulties can be challanging, I played Shogun 2 for about 700h and I&apos;m quite good at that kind of games. But I had a hard time to survive with The Empire on very hard, hardest faction for me so far, and I played (and finished) all exept Chaos and Vampires (playing them right now) on very hard.
<br>If the performance would be better, I would rate this game 8/10. It&apos;s pretty damn good, not perfect, but a improvement over Rome 2 (and partly even Shogun 2). I see myself playing this game for the next 1-2 weeks quite excessive.
<br>Co-Op-Campaign is fun as well.
<br>
<br>Graphics are fantastic 8/10
<br>Animations are gorgeous 10/10
<br>Performance is slightly under average 5/10
<br>
<br>I&apos;m playing on high with a gtx780ti, i7, 16gb and my fps are jumping between 30-60fps, both on the campaignmap and while playing fullstack-battles. Sometimes your fps will drop for no reason and you have to tap out and in again to normalise it. Same goes for v-synch, when you have it on (to avoid really annoying screentearing) you will have some graphical bugs until you retab the game. You have to do this every single time you start the game. Also Fraps won&apos;t show you the fps when playing the game, thats pretty odd (you&apos;ll need to use Steam for that). After 70h of gameplay (already) I only had one single crash (when I started the game for the first time).
<br>
<br>Besides the performance there are only a few things that bug me out. Like diplomacy isn&apos;t that important in the game, most factions won&apos;t agree to whatever you offer them, exept they want it themselfs too, but on that occasion they will come to you to make you the offer (like trading, non-aggression-pakts, alliances and so on). So you pretty much can ignore diplomacy for the most part.
<br>Another thing that I find annoying is the fact that you have to spend all those points your heroes get after almost every single battle (up to 29 at level 30) as well as the items and followers you get for them (who give you minor bonuses in battles or on the campaignmap). You get them and even lose them almost every single turn. It&apos;s a clickfest and I completly ignore them by now and doing just fine on very hard.
<br>On harder difficultys I didn&apos;t find myself using agents a lot, I actually play without them. They are hard to level up, will very often fail their missions and will get killed by enemy agents anyway who will have a ton of them. They aren&apos;t worth their money in my book.
<br>Autoresolve is broken, you&apos;re better off autoresolving then fighting for your own, you still can win when the enemy has the favour. When I played Greenskins on very hard I overfoold the map with my &quot;Whaaags!&quot; and played 6 (!) battles manualy. Rest (about 120+ battles) where autoresolves. Greenskins where the most easie and fast to play race so far.
<br>
<br>Well that&apos;s it for so far, I hope my review helped some of you guys out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6460135">Expand</a></span>

With Total War: Warhammer, the engine&apos;s teething issues feel as though they have finally been resolved.
<br>
<br>The combat works in a similar way to how it did in Rome, albeit with more satisfying cavalry charges and better animations. It feels a bit strange to be applauding a game for feeling like a game from 2004, but the teething problems have taken a long time to resolve.
<br>
<br>However, despite the actual simulation of melee combat taking a huge step in the right direction, I cannot in good faith recommend Total War: Warhammer to any veteran of the series, for a number of reasons.
<br>
<br>The campaign has taken a step back from all previous titles. The map feels small, and the joy of expanding out, conquering varied factions and culturally assimilating them into your new borders just doesn&apos;t exist here. For a start, you can only conquer regions that belong to your faction&apos;s designated nemesis: This will mean that you will either be ruining an extant civilisation or reclaiming what was yours anyway.
<br>
<br>This design philosophy also seriously restricts the replay value of the campaign. Previous Total War games allowed you to go into a campaign and adapt to whatever scenario you decide. Even in Attila as Western Rome (which on the surface feels very set in stone), you have a huge range of possibilities: You can attempt to hold onto your thinly spread territories with military might; you can cede territories to the raging hordes whilst redesigning your inefficient and corrupt empire into a wealthy, centralised Italian kingdom with the intent to reconquer once you&apos;re in good stead; you can disregard your poor holdings in the north, betray your Eastern Roman brothers and create a powerful Mediterranean empire, or you could just attempt to create a huge range of vassals and client states with your struggling empire at the helm.
<br>
<br>With Warhammer, none of these options are afforded to the player. As the Empire, you will always start in-fighting with your elector neighbours (and face hundreds of strategically uninteresting battles where you just fight the same units you field). As your empire begins to take shape, you will turn your attentions to the Vampire Counts (who need to be destroyed as a win condition), before ultimately consolidating your empire, allying with the Dwarves and defeating Chaos. The first time you do this, it feels amazing, but every successive playthrough is exactly the same. There will never be a need to fight the Greenskins or Dwarves as the Empire as their settlements cannot be captured.
<br>
<br>Another issue is that each faction has very specific mechanics to consider: whilst this sounds good on paper, it makes playing them far less interesting. The mechanics of offices, family trees, religious conversion, trade and diplomacy have been split up and assigned out to different factions.
<br>
<br>The battles also lack many of the more in-depth tactical elements that previous Total War games had. You can no longer pick from a range of arrow types (unless you&apos;re Wood Elves), you don&apos;t have access to special formations (such as wedge and spear wall), and your options for unit spacing and preset formations are severely limited. Every faction only has two formation types: archers first and melee first. This doesn&apos;t work very well given that two of the playable factions don&apos;t even have access to archers, so your only options are to deploy in a straight line. It also makes all units feel very basic, put there to fulfil a single role like the units in Command &amp; Conquer games. Your spears are for monstrous units, your swords are anti-infantry, your guns are anti-armour etc. It seriously limits your strategic options and forces you to just hope you&apos;ve taken the right army for the job instead of working with what resources you have.
<br>
<br>Graphically, the game has significantly less fine-detail than previous titles. Guns and artillery pieces no longer have reloading animations, model variance is much smaller than even Medieval II, and all cavalry have the same coloured mounts. This makes playing as chaotic forces such as the Greenskins very jarring, as they look far too ordered.
<br>
<br>This review feels like it is being negative, but I will close by saying that Creative Assembly have succeded in creating a game that captures the Warhammer universe: I just believe that the sacrifices made to pull off this vision have created a game that feels much less detailed, vibrant or interesting that any previous title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6911083">Expand</a></span>

I have never had any experience with any Warhamme games before, so I was mesmorized when I entered my first battle, but that was soon to fade.
<br>
<br>It is not that battles are bad or poorly made, they are just all the same, and it becomes very tedious in the long run. The enemy very rarely engages you, they just stand there and wait for you to engage. And sieges are all exactly alike, which after 100 hours of gameplay makes you auto resolve more or less every battle there is.
<br>
<br>Diplomacy is a joke - an utter joke. Vey little effort were put into this by the devs. You can play the game without ever really engaging in diplomacy, but just pressing &quot;ok&quot; and move on. It is not really that important for succes of your progress, sure it will make things a bit easier, but not much. What really makes my blood boil, is &quot;Join War&quot; option. If you you allies, or ask them to participate in a war against a certain faction, they never show up or help you defeating the enemy faction. The &quot;Join war&quot; option is random at best, and more or less useless. The overall feel of this game becomes &quot;lather-rinse-repeat&quot;.
<br>
<br>But, the one thing I loathe, the thing I absolutely hate and makes me scream at this effing game and ragequit is the &quot;Heroes&quot;, and their lack of succes. Now, math has never been my strong side, as go the same for the devs. How so? Let me explain. If a hero has, for instance, 59% chance of succeding in a certain action, how come it takes up to 15 attempts for that action to succed?! If succesrate is 50% or more, it should according to my calculation take a maximum of 2 attempts, for an action to be succesful. Nothing is more frustrating than watching a single enemy hero massacre an entire army, while you can do nothing to prevent this. There is no point in having heroes, except bolstering your army with perks.
<br>
<br>Despite all of this, my real beef with this game is the DLC&#xB4;s. This game has become a symbol of GIG (Gaming Industry Greed). The game itself is 60 euros, and at the current moment the total price of DLC&#xB4;s are 34 euros, so total price of game pushing almost a total of 100 euros. This is insane. All the DLC should already be in the game at the price of 60 euros. Now, the DLC&#xB4;s look good and fun, but if I buy this, I would support GIG hence signalling that in the future they can pick apart games and sell them off at ridiculous and unaffordable prices. I simply cannot and will not support this action
<br>
<br>So, my advice is do not buy this game in its current state. Put it on your wishlist, and buy it on sale in about a year or so.

<br>
<br>This is another weakly developed game from CA with a great base to build upon, but squandered.  Every single faction you play is exactly the same.  Same start point, same tactics, literally the same beginning.  Thinned out, slimmed, SIMPLIFIED, streamlined, there will be nothing left when the decision makers of the current CA are done.  Most of their games are just cash grabs with ONLY enough development to look the part, but not be the part.   Such a great chance to endear yourself to the fans, but instead go for casuals.  This type of game ins&apos;t for hardcore casuals but apparently that&apos;s all they have working on their games, and its a mandate at the company.  So make a title, strip out features, market it like crazy, and find people shallow enough to pretend its another great title when IT IS NOT A GREAT TITLE AT ALL.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6450227">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Defensive game play is all but dead, so is any form of defense based strategy as sieges are linear, nonstrategic,  races. Everything happens fast, with most battles over in under 5-10 minutes. Garrisons are defeated by random rebelling and traveling heroes, which are impossible to beat. On VH and Legendary its almost impossible to keep order in check as dwarves or empire, at least, to stop magic spawning rebels with the best tier troops and a general from quashing a settlement or two before you can even arrive.
<br>Melee heroes have no meaningful abilities, which last only seconds giving perhaps a 8-22% increase to some usually irrelevant stat like charge defense or speed. Magic is relatively useless and the number of spells one can use a battle is also fairly low to be meaningful. Since CA put focus on heroes and magic, all units have lost any micromanaging skills. There are NO shield walls, open rank formations, no cavalry formations; nothing. you set your line, and play stupid heroes, who are way too weak in late game and can beat anything in earl;y game.
<br>The economy and technologies are heavily dumbed down, and it becomes difficult to fund over 4-5 armies, except AFTER you&apos;ve destroyed Chaos and conquered half the map. Heroes, generals, and units all cost upkeep, and the more you have, the higher the upkeep by a % for all.
<br>
<br>TLDR: Highly dumbed down and simplified total war with interesting world and factions but feels like a broken Beta and the simplest Total War to date, which quickly loses it&apos;s charm.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6452409">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. So arcade like. It couldn&apos;t be more arcade like if it tried: when winning a battle as Chaos fireworks erupt and a treasure chest slaps up on screen telling you the loot you&apos;ve won.... There are also no death animations when you slay the rival army.
<br>2. Graphics are average at best, and I have a 780ti. No night battles that I can see. Units look caricature like and blocky, rather than refined. the maps are small, and on maps with an element of sea view, you can see the corners of the maps, since when did the sea have corners...
<br>3. Arcade like. Again I feel I need to mention this. I got so bored after a few hours. The battles are click fests with little tactical oversight needed and the campaign is so light on features that I roll through the turns at lightning pace, quicker than any TW game
<br>4. The list goes on. All through the game you will be like &quot;what happened to x feature? Where did it go?&quot;
<br>5. Music is forgettable, which is a crying shame
<br>
<br>Pros?
<br>1. Umm.... it works day one. The fact that this should even be mentioned as a win shows how poor the TW series has become
<br>2. One day it will come good when the modders have had 2 years to work on it, adding features and improving graphics that CA should already have done.
<br>3. Unit variety. Different races makes for slightly more imaginative unit rosters</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6451594">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Anyway&#x2026; The game, on paper, is great. Warhammer and Total war is (was?) the beloved dream of many geeks of my generation. The fact of having a scenarized game with the final Chaos Incursion is pretty cool. It provides consistency in a game where there is a rich lore. The regional occupancy Mod allows getting of regional occupation limitations (it would have been cleverer from CA to provide it official)
<br>
<br>It really is an immersive game. It&#x2019;s a long time I haven&#x2019;t been that much immerged in a game. Playing the Orcs and expanding from the Badlands to the snowy Northen Karaks of Dwarves was a cool experience on my first playthrough. Playing the Empire and expanding to the North and East to face as a protagonist the first Chaos Invasions was super cool. You can expect to have extremely Epic battles, 3vs3 to Death battles ringing the end of mankind! The graphics are great. The Lore is (except some &#x201C;meh&#x201D; things here and there) is superbly rendered. The epicness is really there. But&#x2026;
<br>
<br>Then comes the late game (the first 100 turns are great, then it&#x2019;s over&#x2026;)
<br>
<br>In fact there is a core problem with this game. There is something wrong. There are actually 2 things that ruin the game.
<br>
<br>The first thing wrong is the way the Chaos Invasion is handled. Mixing Chaos and Northern Tribes invasion is pretty cool but Skaelings are the pain of my existence. Those Norsemen have literally free spawns. Irrelevantly from their holdings they can insta-spawn full army stacks and endlessly attack you over and over and over and over.
<br>
<br>I order to get rid of them, don&#x2019;t expect to mobilize less than 2-3 full stack armies (representing probably 100% of your force&#x2026;) in order to destroy them. In other words: IMPOSSIBLE to do when at the same time you need to deal with Chaos Invasions and spreading corruption causing your regions to revolt and full advanced troop Rebel stacks needing at least a full army stack of yours&#x2026;
<br>
<br>This really is a problem: Skaelings are too powerful and it literally ruins the experience.
<br>
<br>Second problem: stupid A.I. When you mean Stupid A.I. you mean cheating A.I. When you mean cheating A.I. you mean: complete immersion destruction.
<br>
<br>I don&#x2019;t care the A.I. being able to summon 2-3x more troops than I do. I care about having to constantly play &#x201C;Chaos Whack-A-Mole&#x201D; and &#x201C;Skaeling Whack-A-Mole&#x201D; because cheating A.I. goes faster than you do despite all your buffs and exactly exactly where you&#x2019;ll land and knows how to avoid fight.
<br>
<br>I care about suffering all attritions and A.I. not suffering them.
<br>
<br>I care being overwhelmed by swarms of Agents corrupting my regions having like 90% chance of killing my agents while I have, on paper, 30% chance if killing them but in reality it more looks like being 1% chance of killing them.
<br>
<br>No&#x2026; NO C.A. If you can&#x2019;t make A.I. clever enough don&#x2019;t make it cheat in any other way than spawning TROOPS FOR BATTLE!
<br>
<br>So now, mix problem 1 with problem 2: result is pretty simple: expect having s**tloads of small roaming armies running through your lands down to the least defended city (since A.I. doesn&#x2019;t have fog of war he knows where to go), razing it and making your full stacks busy chasing them on a F***ING CONSTANT BASIS since Skaelings will stalk you all the F***ING TIME&#x2026; Jesus&#x2026; What a horrible choice from C.A&#x2026;.
<br>
<br>You want to make Chaos Invasion difficult: Make Skaelings a SMALL faction and make Chaos bigger. In my playthrough it&#x2019;s easier for me to defeat chaos than Skaelings&#x2026; It makes no sense&#x2026; That literally ruins the immersion.
<br>
<br>On the top of that. Add other regressions:
<br>-	River battles are not present anymore
<br>-	Sieges are AWFUL. Either one or two side walls. No Squared cities. Thank you. Strategy please?
<br>-	Fixed Story: Since the &#x201C;story&#x201D; is here and Chaos steps in very quickly, what will happen will always be the same. Don&#x2019;t expect to play more than 2 or 3 times and experience every time a different playthrough. Source of lack of replayability.
<br>-	Lack of playable factions. Second source of lack of replayability
<br>-	Beastmen DLC: mix of orcs and chaos: doesn&#x2019;t add much replayability
<br>I would like to much this game to be good. But for the moment it&#x2019;s a hate and love feeling I have toward it. And so few would be needed;
<br>-	Nerf Skaeling and make chaos stronger
<br>-	Stop making cheating A.I. (no attrition, different RNG results, A.I. being always quicker than you despite all your movement buffs). If A.I. is not clever enough, simply make it spawn more troops. It&#x2019;s a much better decision.

<br>Rome ii, Atilla &amp; Shogun 2 are graphically much better.

First the good:
- Factions are distinct and flavorful both in unit roster and campaign mechanics
- monsters and magic are awesome
- city/province manegment is simplified without losing to much depth
- modding support can fix a lot

The Bad
- sieges have been ridiculously simplified to &quot;Improve the A.I.&quot; but the A.I. is still thick</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Big Total War fan

<br>- modding support can fix a lot
<br>
<br>The Bad
<br>- sieges have been ridiculously simplified to &quot;Improve the A.I.&quot; but the A.I. is still thick as a brick so this was pointless and ruined a big part of the game IMHO
<br>- only 6 army rosters in the whole game which is disappointing for total war fans (1-2 unique units for some of the non-playable factions would have gone a long way)
<br>- agents can get frustrating
<br>- magic is messed up (doesn&apos;t scale with unit size)
<br>- general lack of content (will be better later with DLC /MODS)
<br>- disconnect between WFB units and TW units as a lot of units either don&apos;t exist (especially unit variants with different gear) or don&apos;t work as a warhammer player would expect (black orcs, ethereal units...)
<br>
<br>the game feels like early access
<br>not enough content and a bunch of little things that annoy you
<br>
<br>would recommend waiting until more DLC/MODS are released before buying</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6471283">Expand</a></span>

This however is a nice feeling game and has provided more of a challenge to me compared to other TW games I have played. However I did not enjoy the random bugs that would appear such as when my 5 of units at full health suddenly rout to 1 unit that has less morale and is near destruction for no reason other than AI being dumb. It has caused me to go from winning a battle with 80% certainty to suddenly a heroic defeat. This has more or less killed a few campaigns I have played seeing as once I encounter that bug I immediately step away from my PC and not boot this back up again. Other than the occasional bug I appreciate what CA tried to do here and if they would release a TW WH40k version I would give it a shot since the promise was there and hopefully the execution is better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7064016">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>That plus CA and GW&apos;s decision to allow mod support gives me a lot of faith that any future DLCs/FLCs/mods will keep fleshing this game out over time, but I totally feel that the game is worth the 60 bucks as is right now.
<br>
<br>Didn&apos;t pre-order but purchased day 1 and still got the pre-order bonus race pack which seems worth it for the different race experience.
<br>
<br>It doesn&apos;t run 100% perfect but it seems to run better then Rome2 or Attila and I thought those games were alright so this is easily &quot;good performance&quot; in my book.
<br>
<br>The economy is simplified but idk if I really miss trying to juggling squalor and corruption forcing me to build certain buildings i don&apos;t want instead of just the unit producers/stat buffers that i really want. Corruption is now more tied to number of armies instead of settlements which seems like a pretty good game play change so far too.
<br>
<br>agent spam is annoying but not completely broken, there are mods for them though to give you less headaches.
<br>
<br>Lords/Agents don&apos;t age and die so it actually makes them matter way more to me, wasn&apos;t expecting that. Some spells need tweaking but overall pretty good.
<br>
<br>performance 8/10
<br>battles 10/10
<br>races 10/10
<br>settlement management (seriously, I haven&apos;t enjoyed this part of total war since Rome1) 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6442589">Expand</a></span>

Each City has like 3 or 4 buildings in it that you can build so the great city of Altorf can have like one bar, one black smith and a shrine.... imagine your city your in has those three things. A bar a shrine and a blacksmith thats it, sounds more like a hillbilly village. No kill animations at all, forget what you herd or think you saw bottom line is its all a bunch of air fighting infact those plastic models warhammer make are closer to actually fighting then the digital cousins total war made. Simply put its air weapon slapping fighting. No blood, not a drop in this world of eternal warfare where soldiers eat drink and sleep war and some races actually eat other races there no blood. Heroes literally are insane walking robo cop Jesus type characters, they care nothing of the world no taxes food, water supplies buildings nothing they just pick up a hammer and go to war aand if they die they resurrect. Its retarded, the whole world revolves around these characters which makes it seem empty, the map seems so cluttered and it looks like there is 400 thousand things you can do but it literally all bells and whistles, you can build like 3 things in each city, recruit like a handfull of troop types in each army, theres nothing total war about this, war-hammer is to involved this is not a marriage of equality its all about war-hammer, War-hammer is the abusive partner and total war is dish washing cloth cleaning food cooking quiet scared spouse who gets **** beat if one foot is out of place. The Dwarfs all have axes????? No dwarf in a total war game is that retarded to only have regiments of axe men, oh right but this is all about Warhammer and only about warhammer so if the units in warhammer world dont have it then it shouldnt exist.... this is not a fair deal at all I do not even blame CA for doing this game half arsed I mean its dumbed down and limited because Warhammer the table top game is not designed for total wars capacity. Total war can do anyhting if allowed but they are not allowed so I guess Ill have another regement of axemen thank you to go along with my other 34 groups of axe men that means I have 35 regiments of axes, seems like the old rock paper scissors is way more advanced then warhammer total war, I mean axes is all i get for infantry so I just have rock.... 1 step forward 3 steps back. The battle field is again the same, its just plain and no adverse affects no real benefits at all like even just a generic fence that you can place gunners on should make them more accurate, or long grass to make goblins better at killing because you cant see them, its just stale and old gos sake get a new engine total war really your not innocent in this **** hole of a game. Once you give us kill animations theres no going back, you can not have airfighting we will get bored, every total war player loved zooming in to see the death blows romans did to barbarians and now nothing, you know the saying you dont know what youv got till its gone well I knew what I had, the community told you to stop the kill animtions so the gameplays better well longevity is key not how the gameplays I guess its a bit of both but no not in this case boredom will set in Heavy with no cool **** to keep your brain saying wow what a kill move, the one time you can wow us with Legolas / Gimli / Chuck Norris/ Bruce Lee / can go on forever you give us airfighting... and dwarfs just hit the floor in anger and everyone dies somehow, it boring, so so boring. In its current state it Super Cartoonish it all looks like cartoons, nothing looks like its made of flesh, nothing has meat to it, the cavalry chargers are pathetic, they are so bad it hurts, how do you fly 30 feet when a horse hits you? how, your a dead rag doll with no life not a **** bouncing ball when a Horse hits you your a rag doll there is no flying, it tramples you it doesnt make you a baloon zero physics and this is 2016 ladies and gentlemen so this franchise is dead. CA you need an entire new team, new ideas fresh young and eager because you making the same game with different skinz adding and removing the same things you have done before while no progress, your like madden now, same game with different skinz. Here is what I am really pissed of about I spent alot on the highkingedition and im ok with that rob me whatever but what im most pissed about is this and this is hard to explain so let me get started. I had no hero, I was on a mountain had 5 ranged units and 5 infantry enemy had about the same size with hero, My plan was to just kill the hero so all 5 crossbow men regiments shot him repeatedly till he engaged them, he was almost untouched...... I repeat UNTOUCHED??? 120 men in each regiment so 600 crossbows in total shot 4-5 volleys at him so around 3000 arrows, bolted arrows hit him.... and he wasnt dead??? he wasnt even scratched so his men engaged me fresh as i focused on him he was fresh and I got slaughtered, my plan was pointless, 3000 arrows do nothing, I mean **** off. what is this game so if you do not have a hero your army is pointless I mean come on wtf like I said Robo cop walking jesus Legendary lords and its all about them so why dont they just dual and everyone goes to the bar in town???</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6439336">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve restarted 3 times now, since even with everything on easy I just get slaughtered by turn 40-50 by orcs waaaaagh. I have 7-8 cities at that point and as much army as I can upkeep, I play the battles manually and according to community guides (dwarves = have lots of ranged, never move, make formation with melee at front, ranged behind and cannons further behind, and keep some more melee on the sides and behind to intercept enemies that are trying to flank you, wait for them to come to you), and it doesn&apos;t matter, I still get slaughtered because orcs arrive with 4-5 lords with maxed armies, all moving together. They also move way faster on the campaign map than me, and the AI always moves them just out of your range when it&apos;s not ready to fight you, so it&apos;s impossible to catch them out of position. So there&apos;s nothing you can do apart from just wait to get slaughtered while the enemy heroes assassinate everyone you own with what appears to be a 90% success rate (while my own heroes have 25% and always fail and critical-fail). I have to admit that I don&apos;t understand this game and what I&apos;m doing wrong. I&apos;ve almost given up on it, and my score will reflect that. It&apos;s not the challenge that bugs me, but the fact that I feel helpless and I&apos;m just not having fun.

<br>
<br>Each race plays differently and each has a massive amount of character and charisma.  The graphics and sound are lovingly crafted, nothing in this game has been skimped.  Each of the 5 factions has fully fleshed out graphics, sound and story.  It all gels into an immersive atmosphere which can suck you in for hours.
<br>
<br>All in all this is a very well put together and polished game.  It was clearly crafted by a team that loves warhammer and the result shows.  Delaying the game has turned out to be for the best because it has been such a sweet and smooth release.  A truly great game, worthy of soaking up endless hours.

<br>-sound 5/10 : mediocre, generic, nothing special, doesnt speed up the pace or give you the feeling to fight great battles
<br>-AI/gameplay 5/10: The same problems all (most) TW games got. Units not hitting each other, units just hitting into the air. Just 2 formations (ranged in front or in back), ranged units feel weak, no gore. Siege is lame, you could just storm the walls or land with air units behind the gate and it is open.
<br>
<br>If CA adds gore, more tactial options like formations, real hitting/fighting units instead of this &quot;air-guitar&quot; farce, some decent spell-graphics this could be fun. this was its just a dumbed down version of TW with Warhammer skins.
<br>I cant recommend it now. Maybe in 6 to 12 month if we got some patches and more mods. I would love to see improvements to the graphics and AI from modders and im looking forward for the time we got some more nice mods.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6460265">Expand</a></span>

<br>Having played over 30+ hours now, I can say that I think the negative reviews reflect only the growing pains for this expanding series. This game bespeaks polish and genuine care for the source material. The game, while having been simplified, also throws in a lot of new mechanics that, in the end, wouldn&apos;t work with the unique needs of these fantasy factions. As such, newer, streamlined, and more intuitive campaign mechanics have taken their place. Not to mention the fact that this game does more than any other to get new players up to speed quickly.
<br>If you like both Total War and Warhammer this may well be unmissable. Just know, this game is more Warhammer than it is Total War. I think most of the bad reviews expected this to be a Total War game with Warhammer mechanics, it&apos;s not. This is a Warhammer game with Total War mechanics. If you want this to feel like a follow up to Attila, you may want to give this a skip. Everyone else should come and enjoy one of the best Warhammer games ever made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6439553">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unfortunately the Total War part of the game, the core gameplay, has been dumbed down and simplified quite a lot from previous TW games. In some ways it makes the game easier but reduces the strategy involved and the overall satisfaction of completing a campaign. There are only 4 races, plus an included DLC race, and you can only go to war with certain factions, so it feels pretty barebones and restricted. I&apos;m sure CA will be adding more races as DLC but I feel even with the Chaos as a pre-order inclusion there are not enough races. Not being able to play factions like the Skaven, Lizardmen or Tomb Kings is a shame and when you start the game just seeing 5 of the factions as playable is very disappointing (much more so than I was expecting, I knew there would be 5 factions before I bought the game) it feels very much like the game has been chopped down to sell to you in pieces. I don&apos;t think making the Chaos faction a pre-order hostage was a very good move either, it should be included free for everyone, without Chaos the game would feel even more limited than it does already.
<br>
<br>TLDR: What is in the game is very polished, but it feels like Mannfred von Carstein has rampaged through the game and only left the minimum bare bones that CA could get away with selling at full price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6427215">Expand</a></span>

It has a lot of units and factions with still a lot of dlc&apos;s incoming with even more units. Great strategy elements were you actually have to think off .

After the Total War series was revived with Shogun Two a few years ago, they have changed the format all over again with Total War: Warhammer. The leap to fantasy with this game brings an energy and polish that surpasses anything they have made before. A truly excellent Total War and Warhammer game, this is how license crossovers should work.</span>

<br>And they did a great job in letting it come alive: the units look beautiful on the battlefield as they do also on the strategic map.
<br>Your heroes level up and chose skills, you wield powerful magic, equip your heroes with legendary items and earn new mounts in special quests, each individually for every race.
<br>The map is huge and you get headaches when your imperium armies already fight on 2 sides and then the chaos begins to invade the lands.....
<br>I can just recommend every Warhammer Fan to get this game asap and also thos who either love fantasy strategy or are addicted to the lord of the rings....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6426561">Expand</a></span>

<br>Battles are more enjoyable, especially when you start using magic. We have more war-machines, guns and cannons, and also big world which is gonna expand even further in near future.

<br>Send hero break enemy troops, raise dead to block enemy cavalries... They are so many examples of what have never been possible in other Total war.
<br>
<br>Also, they have truly succeed to create 5 factions with different gameplay:
<br>- Dwarfs need to avenge any insults against them. If they cannot avenge, they face revolt and they are mistrust by other dwarfs allies
<br>- Ork can chain victory to start Waaaagh that spawn armies to attack opponent
<br>- Vampire can corrupt around them and raise armies at old battlefields
<br>- Chaos ... ok it is like Attila horde (with giants monsters and spawned horrors)
<br>- Empire may be more classic if you do not want to be too lost in a fantasy world
<br>
<br>So in short word: This game will get its place as one of the best Total war.

<br>
<br>To those complaining that it&apos;s &quot;dumbed down&quot; or &quot;too simple&quot;, most of these changes were made for the AI&apos;s benefit (both in the campaign and on the battlemaps). Oh, but CA should&apos;ve magically made the AI better to handle more complex mechanics! Sure, but they&apos;ve been trying that for YEARS and they haven&apos;t succeeded. You know what that means? It&apos;s not possible. You think you can do better? Go submit your resume; I&apos;m sure they could use you. Total War: Warhammer was a good chance to simplify some of these mechanics because the fantasy elements provide complexity in other areas (like character development) to help offset some of the sacrifices.
<br>
<br>To clarify for those who don&apos;t know, building trees and province management have been simplified. Gone is Food; gone is squalor; gone is a variable tax rate (you can choose to turn taxes on or off, that&apos;s it). In exchange, enemy Agents (especially those of Chaos and the Vampire Counts, who have a Corruption mechanic) provide a source of constant/repetitive negative Public Order, as well as the normal things like conquest. Dwarfs have a unique mechanic, their Book of Grudges, which also affects Public Order. It&apos;s not as difficult to manage PO as it was in previous Total Wars, but that doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;ll have +100 in every region.
<br>
<br>As for performance, there were some Day 1 issues, completely normal for any major release. They&apos;ve been resolved for the vast majority. The game runs well at 1080p, but at 1440p+ you&apos;ll start to notice the framerate if you have anything less than the most powerful graphics cards. More optimization can be done, yes, but it&apos;s LEAGUES better than Rome II or even Attila.
<br>
<br>I gave it a 9 because there&apos;s one thing that I know will be fixed, but which is still a bit of a problem right now: the lack of additional units and playable factions. I can&apos;t rate the game based on what will be coming in the future, I have to look at what&apos;s here now, and while it isn&apos;t lacking - each faction feels different enough to warrant a full campaign, unlike previous Total Wars where everyone was human and more or less the same - it does make me wish for the rest of the world. For those who don&apos;t know, this series is planned to be a trilogy, with two sizable expansions coming in the future. DLC and Free-LC will come in the meantime.
<br>
<br>Oh, and probably the best thing - if you don&apos;t like something, there&apos;s a good chance you can mod it out. Don&apos;t like regional occupation (the system that limits you from occupying every region on the map)? There&apos;s a mod for that. Want both Legendary Lords to start at the same time? There&apos;s a mod for that. Think battles are too fast or the AI is not aggressive enough? There&apos;s a mod for that. Any game that provides mod support deserves much more than a bad rating simply because you don&apos;t like what&apos;s there in the vanilla version. Think about it!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6435197">Expand</a></span>

<br>The graphics are good, the gameplay is actually really fun, the battles are excellent, but unit just throw themselves into the enemy.  So grouping them up is really important.  The way hero&apos;s just demolish ranks of units is awesome to behold.
<br>To be completely honest, I&apos;m a battlefield player, but Total War Warhammer has won my heart. 10/10 will be playing this until BF1 comes out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6444304">Expand</a></span>

The steep learning curve and slow drawn out battles are the same as any other game in the series. The graphics might be great for a TW game, but they are not good for a modern PC game and much worse than the trailers (I&apos;m playing at max settings). This game is also sad for long time WH fans since most of the spells and a lot of the units were discontinued last year. I&apos;ll try to slog through the campaign at some point since I&apos;m such a die hard WH fan, but it feels like a chore and right now I have a lot of better things to be doing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6444589">Expand</a></span>

<br>I was really excited and bought TW: Warhammer near launch. It runs great and was fun for a bit. However, soon lost interest.
<br>
<br>Pros-
<br>Not many bugs
<br>interesting for a short while.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-only assault cities from one side of a wall.
<br>-can only build a couple different buildings per faction, with a handful of unique building that can be build on specific cities. these unique buildings only give a bigger bonus compare to other buildings. Some of these building provide bonuses such as troops starting with more experience, more gold of turn..
<br>-no naval battles.
<br>-no unit formations. ex. loose formation
<br>-shallow character skills. your unique leaders has 3 more skills (and these only give some passive bonuses. all other heroes have the same skills as their class. Could be more interesting if they could randomize this a bit
<br>-can only capture specific cities for each race.
<br>-very few and pointless story battles.
<br>-Seems like lots of content is not yet implemented (more factions, leaders) and are going to be sold separately in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6597885">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Esta primera afirmaci&#xF3;n se que puede generar un poco de pol&#xE9;mica, sobre todo viendo la cantidad de votos negativos que contiene esta entrega a comparaci&#xF3;n de los anteriores, pero es por el mero echo de que actualmente las personas se esta dando cuenta del timo de los DLCs, cosa que yo no valorare en este an&#xE1;lisis por un simple motivo. &#xBF;No os gusta? no lo compr&#xE9;is, ver&#xE9;is como, si todos hici&#xE9;ramos eso mismo, al final o los pondr&#xED;an m&#xE1;s baratos o a&#xF1;adir&#xED;an algunos de estos de modo gratuito (una cruzada que lleva mucho tiempo activa, pero que poca gente utiliza). Dicho esto, paso a valorar el juego.
<br>
<br>Esta valoraci&#xF3;n esta solo enfocada al modo campa&#xF1;a, no toco el multijugador.
<br>
<br>La historia y los acontecimientos en el juego son interesantes y bastante variados, dejando inter&#xE9;s a lo largo de toda la partida por mucho que la mayor&#xED;a de facciones ya no os planten cara. Orcos salvajes, tribus, Caos... sin duda son variados y dan guerra. A&#xF1;adir que no tengo mucho conocimiento del Universo Warhammer (lo poco que conozco es por los juegos relacionados que he jugado, y por peque&#xF1;as cosas que he leido), asi que no puedo valorar este apartado desde un punto de vista rolero, solo jugabilitico.
<br>
<br>Las facciones por fin son m&#xED;nimamente variadas entre ellas, ya no en aspecto solo, si no en forma de juego. Por ejemplo, el amor por la guerra y la sed de sangre Orca se traslada muy bien al juego. Una de las cosas en este tema de las que m&#xE1;s he o&#xED;do discutir es el sistema de conquista, ya que las distintas facciones no pueden conquistar todo el mapa por sus afinidades con el entorno y dem&#xE1;s. Mucha gente lo odia y a un peque&#xF1;o grupo le gusta, yo soy de los segundos por que me encanta la estrategia que otorga esto, ya que al no poder conquistar todo, tienes que pensar por que zonas puedes moverse de una manera m&#xE1;s correcta para poder ganar una guerra con un enemigo que este lejos.
<br>
<br>En cuanto a gr&#xE1;ficos ya sab&#xE9;is que esta saga siempre ha destacado. Animaciones, mapa, variedad en las animaciones...
<br>
<br>Sin duda yo lo recomiendo para todos los amantes de Warhammer y Total War, hacia tiempo que no me lo pasaba tan bien con un juego de esta saga.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7082434">Expand</a></span>

But, the final product deserved a very better finishing.
<br>
<br>The game itself it&apos;s correct. A simple copy-paste based on previous Total War games (Rome 2 and Attila). The map maintains the system started back on Rome 2, and basements are build in that way. It is far the time of Medieval 2 or Shogun 2 where the building of a base was some kind more open, with a lot of chances to be done. The graphics should be better. Yes, the battles are quite awesome, but nothing that we haven&apos;t seen on RTW2 or Attila. The map looks nice, and it&apos;s close to what the world of Warhammer is.
<br>
<br>By the way, one very negative aspect is that Total War franchises had become pure DLC games. If you want to experience the game fully, you need to spend a very big quantity of $ on the DLC content. Yes, it adds new races, with their own units, but this is something old Total War games used to bring on the base game. DLC contents should be intended for expansions like Napoleon Total War or the Kingdoms expansion from Medieval 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=7154785">Expand</a></span>

Longswords, Karl Franz, Slayers, Doomdivers, Hordes of undead, Winds of magic, Flying creatures I can&apos;t take much more of this great stuff.

<br>I ONLY play multiplayer in TW games since NTW and im also a fairly good coh2 sc2 grey goo and moba player.
<br>
<br>this game knocks it out of the park.
<br>with 6 great multiplayer factions who are hugely different the competitive aspect is great.
<br>It plays great in comparison to the poor TWR2 and the removal of many bad systems combinded with the addition of some great new unit types make this game complex and not shallow at all.
<br>
<br>First Magic, it is a huge change and influences the game tremendously. Use your mana well as the regen depens on the amount, Fun mechanic!
<br>
<br>Furthermore the &apos;&apos;large&apos;&apos; units like gigants are great they are super strong and beat every other units but are hugely expensive. this makes it risk reward as every faction has access to multiple strong anti lange units. even artillery functions as it.
<br>
<br>Speaking of artillery, they nailed it. Art (artillery) is fun to use and relativly balanced. Cannons will shoot down hordes of skeletons but wont do **** against some scaled dragon ogers. art can now also target air which is great, using explosive rounds against dragons is huge.
<br>
<br>The races are fun in every way. but the new way they affect atributes is even better,  Armor(the mechanic) is great, Deathblow, terror spectral units, these are all new tools that we havent had before.
<br>
<br>All in all I can tell everybody that the multiplayer is competitive and more complex that it has ever been.
<br>There for I give it a soild good, which means a 10 on this platform.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6454772">Expand</a></span>

I own all the other but never really got into them. I tried Atilla and Rome 2 but just couldnt get hooked. This game on the other hand has hooked me and is a solid 60-200 hour game depending on tastes.

<br>
<br>Note: I, like total biscuit, don&apos;t believe in scores.  I just gave it an 8 cause it was green symbolizing my overall approval.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>-Game is stable on release *for the majority of people*
<br>
<br>-Heroes add a new dynamic to the game that can make battles much more involving
<br>
<br>-Asymmetrical factions are a definite plus
<br>
<br>-The ai is much better about diplomacy(although on legendary they are all war mongers)
<br>
<br>-Large units are functional for the first time ever in a tw game.  My biggest concern for this game was, based on the crappy unusual unit ai for elephants, chariots, etc in past tw games, the large units were going to suffer from abhorrent pathing, which turned out not to be the case.
<br>
<br>-Each faction as a unique research tree and mechanic making for unique play styles on the campaign map as well as the battlefield for each faction.
<br>
<br>-Removed unfortified city battles.  This decision is great imo because the majority of battles in my experience with atilla and rome2 were unfortified city fights.  These fights always degenerate into uninspiring meat grinders with little to offer in terms of diversity.
<br>
<br>-Great mod support
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>-Auto balance is absolutely horrid(more so than usual).  Particularly with 1 man units(certain heroes, giant monsters).  You will auto resolve a fight with 99 percent chance and they die every time despite everything.  Another issue is that sometimes auto resolve is just illogical when reinforcements are involved.  I&apos;ve seen on multiple occasions I have attacked a settlement where I had a 99 percent chance to win the auto resolve despite the fact the enemy had the same number  and composition of units as me spread over two stacks.
<br>
<br>-The hero item system in the game is absolutely pathetic.  The stat bonuses they provide are negligible the majority of the time. This combined with the fact there is no way to buy items(which would have been a great feature) makes their presence quite hollow. Items also do not affect your hero cosmetically which is a damn shame.
<br>
<br>-Magic system is simply dysfunctional in the game&apos;s current state.  A lack of direct damage scaling for larger unit sizes combined with useless vortex spells makes for some disappointing fireworks.
<br>
<br>-The multiplayer is barebones, but for some reason they have a ladder despite the fact this game is absolutely NOT balanced yet.
<br>
<br>-Battle AI still can&apos;t handle pincer attacks from front and back.  It will simple face all of it&apos;s melee units to one front and let itself get sandwiched
<br>
<br>-*MY BIGGEST PROBLEM*City siege battles are a joke.  Ever since Shogun 2 and ESPECIALLY after Rome 2 I&apos;ve be absolutely appalled that my favorite type of battle in the game, sieges, no longer feels like a siege.  In warhammer tw all units have ladders FOR SOME UNEXPLAINED REASON and yet they can&apos;t attack the city without having a battering ram, siege tower, or some piece of siege equipment.  Also for some unexplained reason the large iron gates can literally be punched open FASTER THAN A BATTERING RAM by a squad of infantry when accounting for how long and how many casualties a ram receives when trying to knock down a gate.  Now turrets seem to have infinite range to attack units on the edge of the battlefield for some reason which is ungodly stupid because if you put reserve cavalry in the back of the map it is dispiriting to discover they all died before the gate opened...
<br>
<br>-AI controlled group attack is missing for some reason...
<br>
<br>-Playing as chaos feels quite hollow as they have access to all of their best units quite quickly
<br>
<br>My thoughts on some other issues
<br>
<br>No Naval Battles: To be honest, I always felt like naval combat has been a hollow feature and more of a check box then a fully fleshed out feature.  The simplistic nature combined with the tedious unrewarding style of combat make for an interesting spectacle maybe once or twice but afterwards i would just auto resolve everything naval after that.
<br>
<br>The unusual restriction on races being unable to capture certain types of provinces: CA knew about this, so they worked with modders so there would be a day 1 mod to change it so you could capture everything like normal tw.
<br>
<br>Battles are too short!:Another mod that was released day 1 which properly adjusts moral, armor, damage, etc for fights that feel much more weighty.  Unfortunately you also have to take the various building, hero, and recruitment changes as well as the improved  campaign ai(oh no) that come with it. Just know you may find the battle system in vanilla unacceptable if you which for more realistic drawn out fights.
<br>
<br>Overall I feel this tw game, as many people have put it, is a step in the right direction lacking the stellar qualities to make it truly amazing but no doubt a good experience for a triple A title(if you are into tw).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6459683">Expand</a></span>

The artillery is a blast to use (pun intended), the &quot;Monsters&quot; you can command and fight are imposing and great fun to attack or command.
<br>The difference in the races make me want to not even auto resolve the battles since they&apos;re such great fun. Now if you compare that to Rome II, where the battles could turn into a slog, the Warhammer mechanics are amazing. Your Lords/generals are heroes in their own right and unlike the previous games you don&apos;t have to worry about time taking them away, so you can level them up to your heart&apos;s content in a gloriously fleshed out fashion.
<br>
<br>In short, it scratches all of your itches:  It&apos;s a deep strategy game with management of resources and buildings. It&apos;s got tactics as you plan and command troops. It&apos;s got glorious visuals and sound as your armies clash with impact, explosions, and magic effects.  It has a detailed RPG mechanic for your heroes as they gain power.
<br>
<br>I would say more, but I&apos;d rather be playing it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6463444">Expand</a></span>

The battles are huge, the map is identical to the fantasy universe most players know and love. Pit in the 5 factions and you got yourself one, epic game. There are however some issues which need to be adressed:
<br>
<br>Gameplay:
<br>The gameplay in general is smooth and entertaining. The core mechanics revolve around tailoring your army to your opponent and having the right dudes fight the right bad guys. Flank your opponent and when a unit you don&apos;t like gets too close, bring it down in a hail of bolts and bullets. Sadistics like myself will find endless entertainment in seeing broken enemies get run down by ones sinister forces.
<br>However the gameplay have some issues:
<br>
<br>1. Lord Characters.
<br>
<br>Being the embodiment of the player on the battlefield, it is not surprising that these guys are true powerhouses. Maybe even on the tip of being too powerful. Seeing as individual models  in the  game do  almost no damage, and characters having a minimal amount of space around them,  it is not uncommon that you can have 10 units hitting a fleeing lord and it still takes like 30 seconds before they kill him. While the Lords aren&apos;t exactly overpowered, I think units should have more of a chance against them.  They aren&apos;t even human right now.
<br>2. Running and walking.
<br>
<br>Seriously this is a mess. Clicking AND ATTACKING makes your units walk. Meaning if I want my units to actually charge an opponent (and get a bonus) I need to press R.
<br>
<br>3. Fog of War.
<br>
<br>Want to attack that ranged unit in the forest over there? Okay, point and click, press R to run.
<br>However if that unit stops shooting for a second and goes invisible again? Well, then you have to manually re-assign your unit go kill them or just walk/run into the forest. More an annoyance because of the lack of an attack move button which usually exist within the RTS-genre.
<br>
<br>4. Missions and Quests.
<br>
<br>The quest system in TW:W is fantastic, giving you quests based on your current situation during the campaign, giving you these small objectives every now  and then. The missions however, to get some of your Special Character&apos;s gear? I went through the entire Empire normal campaign without ever touching it (which was stupid of me since those were easy). The Vampire Counts however, need to travel across half the map to a region they have no interest in and win a battle there. Whether that is historically correct or not is irrelevant. That is just annoying to have to do...
<br>
<br>Graphics:
<br>
<br>Gorgeous. Playing it on low graphics is a nightmare (which I  had to with my Radeon 6930), almost pixelated, but it runs excellently on my new GTX 960. Very nice.
<br>
<br>Setting:
<br>
<br>The setting in general is glorious as I mentioned in the intro. My only complaint are the Vampires who are absolute jokes. I don&apos;t know why, but Creative Assembly has for some reason made them all talk like they were part of a horrible Shakespearean play. They even make references to stupid parodies of his plays. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t want to make the same mistake as McDeath&quot;. Come on. Way to butcher the characters of an entire race. YOU EVEN HAVE A QUOTE IN-GAME WHERE MANNFRED SPEAKS NORMALLY! God dammit CA.
<br>
<br>Other than that, it is really, really good. The distrustful elector counts, the arrogant nobles of Bretonnia, the destructive forces of Chaos and Orks and the stubborn and grudge-holding Dwarves. Everything feels incredible.
<br>
<br>In terms of blood and gore, I tend to agree with the public opinion that it is missing. Also, most models have some sort of invulnerability save. Hitting them with direct hits from bloody mortars sends half the dudes flying and yet doesn&apos;t kill a single one. Not a single time occurence. You&apos;ll see.
<br>
<br>And yet, I am hopeful.
<br>
<br>The game has quite a lot of glitches but none which are gamebreaking. The fundamentals are definetely there, but with some patch-polishing I believe this game could truly shine the way it should.
<br>
<br>Overall the score is 8. The game is lacking alot of things but also have lots of positive sides which are plain for most people to see. The game is entertaining and fun in that sadistic and maniacal way which I tend to enjoy, and I think alot of people would  support that statement.
<br>
<br>While many give the game bad reviews, my gut-feeling tells me they are basing it too much off the earlier Total War games,  which I have never played and never intend to play.
<br>
<br>In newer releases I would like to see:
<br>- Attack move Button
<br>- More non-magic and non-hero ways to kill heroes
<br>- Blood and Gore
<br>- Attacking makes the player&apos;s units run
<br>- More Races (Skaven are obvious, Wood Elves/High Elves would be pretty good too)
<br>
<br>And of course.
<br>
NEW VOICES FOR THE VAMPIRE COUNTS!

All in all a nice game, easily on par with other newer releases from most other firms.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6468986">Expand</a></span>

The Warhammer IP allows the battles to get to a whole new level for Total War, as well as give the factions more variety than any other Total War game has had before.
<br>
<br>One thing I was surprised by was how much better the campaign was as well. City upgrading is straightforward and intuitive, as well as more varied between factions. Technology also seems to provide more important bonuses than previous entries. The best part of the strategic campaign is that Creative Assembly seems to really have designed it around getting you into the battles, which are the strongest part of this game. The only thing working against this is how difficult it can be to catch enemy armies and force them into battle, but throughout my campaigns I never found a shortage of epic battles to fight. Quest battles also work better than I expected and provide narrative to the title. The chaos invasion also provides more narrative, and is somewhat similar to the Huns in Total War: Attila.
<br>
<br>The battles themselves are without a doubt my favorite in a Total War. Each race plays so different, and each unit has its own place. There isn&#x2019;t the problem previous titles have had where there are a ton of the same unit with minor stat changes to give more &#x201C;unit variety.&#x201D; Every unit feels like it has its own place. The addition of monsters, flying units, hero units, and magic all really adds a lot to the battles without being overwhelming.
<br>
<br>The unlock trees for agents/heroes is also much better than previous entries, and it seems like Creative Assembly went all out and wasn&#x2019;t afraid to make these units powerful. Being able to unlock a flying mount for your hero really changes the way they interact with the battlefield as well, and you no longer have to keep your general back for most of the battle. Agents are still annoying on the campaign map, mainly due to the AI spamming them and the difficulty of countering enemy agents.
<br>
<br>Overall this Total War game has been very solid for my first 40+ hours of playing, and I expect to rack up many more to come. Definitely give this a look if you&#x2019;re a fan of strategy games. And for what it&#x2019;s worth, this is the smoothest release for an ambitious Total War yet, so congrats CA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6476847">Expand</a></span>

I loved the new direction, even if it was just trying it out.  The fantasy world let it try out so many cool new things and was very exciting to play and sets it apart from all other total wars. The two big cons, all the content you have to pay for. Im dropping $60 on a game i dont want to have to buy $100s more. And of course the dumb down combat. I thought al lthe new units and powerful heros would ADD to the combat but sieges are a joke. The land combat which is the majority of the fighting lives up to the hype. I only wish siege battles which are critical points on the map were a little more fun (shogun 2 was far superior in this....). Anyways, a fun series and a new twist on it was worth the buy. 8/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6631716">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>When i finally got into the game i started playing a campaign as Empire, my first battle was a mixed experience, sure the unit detail is nice and the hero 3d portrait is a nice idea, but  the battles still feels like something is missing like blood and gore, limbs seperation and decapitations.
<br>
<br>Do i need to add that it&apos;s a must.
<br>
<br>It seems Creative Assembly has little worry of how much the rating and Denuvo cripple the game and it is more than likely they will lose more customers than they plan to get with it.
<br>
<br>I feel a 5 is generous right now considering the state the game is in, the lack of blood and gore makes the game come off as a average cartoon game to me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6428715">Expand</a></span>

I was disappointed when they pushed the game back a month back in April but took that as a good sign. I have updated drives, rolled back drivers, verified cache, ran the Day 1 &quot;Quick Fix&quot; Patch, tried running the game in offline mode and prayed Sigmar but this game will still not load. Black screen crash every time. It is a shame because I love the total war series and Warhammer and this matchup seemed perfect, too bad CA still can&apos;t figure out how to launch a damn game. Blizzard, please buy out CA so we can get some good games like say...Overwatch
<br>
<br>*Edit*  Finally got the game to launch past the first load screen into the main campaign by choosing to not do the tutorial battle.
<br>
<br>Now that the game actually works it is fantastic.
<br>
<br>Warhammer components unique armies, creatures,  MAGIC, stances, hero leveling and a sort of narrative aspect give it the fantasy feel you would want. Air combat is awesome.
<br>
<br>Total War components: Still have stances, map is beautiful, province management like in Rome 2 where a duchy has about 4 different regions in it. Diplomacy options are still there. They have added a council where you can set your heroes into similar to Crusader King 2. These guys give you extra bonuses. City tiers like before, though only capital regions reach the cap. The battlefield itself has the fantasy elements actually on the map. Overall great job with this part. CA you need to work on your damn launch date bugs, triple, quadruple test the next TW game.
<br>
<br>Gripes: More of what has been mentioned, i really dont like that you cant declare war on everyone. Magic at times seems a bit OP and I can see a patch fixing this. No naval stuff, though there is very little water on the map anyway.  And of course, where is the rest of the world and races? 4 is awesome for now, and if they next DLC is like this I will likely buy it but it definitely is a marketing gimmick.
<br>
<br>Once all the races are out I expect/want a map like Empire Total War with the various hemispheres and trade nodes where I can conquer all of the map!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6442002">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Complaints that there are only 4(5) factions - not true at all. There are 5 different RACES - that&apos;s a huge difference. Each race has many different factions. Following this logic, all previous TW games only had ONE faction, did anybody complain about that? Also, with a mod we can play pretty much any faction of any race we want (haven&apos;t tried it yet).
<br>
<br>About dumbing the game down: For me it just feels like they removed a lot of unnecessary stuff and made things clearer. But there&apos;s still plenty of complex decision making involved when managing settlements, diplomacy and armies. So far I love the fact that I don&apos;t have to spend 10 minutes in city screen for each settlement. Makes the game flow so much smoother.
<br>
<br>After spending 40 hours in game, I can only say good things about it. And I&apos;m looking forward to at least 160 more hours :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6477510">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s very stable and I had no crashes or stuff like that. And even game mechanics and the AI actually work! No comparison to the buggy catastrophe that was Rome 2 at release.
<br>
<br>But how is the actual game you might ask? Well, it&apos;s the best TW game released in a long time and maybe ever. The AI is without question the best ever seen in a TW game and it actually feels like the AI factions are trying to win the game. Both on the campaign map and in battles. Normal difficulty is already more difficult than &quot;hard&quot; was in previous games because it&apos;s not so easy anymore to cheese the AI. Stupid stuff like running around your settlements with a single cavalry unit while the defensive towers slowly but steadily take out a whole enemy army does no longer work. The AI reacts to what you do and tries to flank whenever possible.
<br>
<br>Even diplomacy works. It&apos;s still not very deep but at least what is there works this time and factions act in ways that makes sense which is a MAJOR improvement over previous TW games.
<br>
<br>I also really like how diverse the factions are. There might not be that many, but the difference in play style, both in battles and on the campaign map, between the different factions are HUGE! There are the Dwarfs that center around defensive turtle tactics. Or the Chaos campaign that feels almost like an RPG since you do not build any settlements and only move your heroes with their armies across the map. All the playable factions are very well done and how diverse they are is one of the biggest strengths of TW Warhammer in my opinion.
<br>
<br>The only issues I had with the game so far are a few balancing issues which are to be expected considering how diverse the factions are this time around and which will likely get fixed in future patches. For example most ranged infantry (archer and the like) are too weak in my opinion and never seem to be doing enough damage to justify having them take up an army slot. Also Dwarven infantry might be a little bit too strong. And there are quiet a few spells that seem to be mostly useless.
<br>
<br>Overall 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/total-war-warhammer/user-reviews?user_review_id=6486225">Expand</a></span>
