<br>1. The dev team is extremely poorly operated. Each patch is 1 step forward, 2 back. They correct a few things, then destroy others. These errors are simply brushed aside for &quot;next patch&quot;. Its very obviously Behavior has ZERO and I mean ZERO internal QA or testing, as major flaws in design go live....then the forums light up with disastrous results.
<br>
<br>2. The servers are Amazon based, and are terrible. Delay in receiving damage means constant burst damage drops you in a heartbeat, often after you out of line of fire. Poor net code, poor design.
<br>
<br>3. Balance is terrible. LSM are clearly the favorite faction of the devs, and receive constant upgrades and new items. Ranged damage is insanely OP,  and melee is pretty much RIP in the game current state..
<br>
<br>I could go on...but really there isn&apos;t any point. Ive spent over $200 customizing my guy, trying to like the game....but even the art takes months and months to be delivered, and its often poorly done.
<br>
<br>All in all, Behavior lied about what the game would be, their lead Nathan still calls is an MMO which just goes to show how sad and desperate he is in saving face, and the game just went F2p so its pretty much maintenance mode 6 month life cycle left..
<br>
<br>The only reason anyone really plays it anymore is there are a lot of very loyal 40k fans. Its just too bad that once again, a trash company drags the 40k brand through the mud. Behavior really shouldn&apos;t be making software. This debacle proves that.
<br>
<br>Perhaps if it was another company, you could hope they have the talent and experience to fix the game, Not Behavior. Micky Mouse company that lacks pretty much everything, expect lying to their face base.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-eternal-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=7072571">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Apparently there has been a lot of trouble behind the scenes, more then I feared, as we are nowhere near that scale yet. The game has become another feather in the cap of those who decry Early Access.
<br>
<br>It does have an emphasis on large-scale battles and team coordination, but as it stands the playerbase simply isn&apos;t skilled enough to provide an entertaining experience. This isn&apos;t Battlefield, where you can just strap some explosives to a car, drive in and clear out an objective point in one unskilled swoop. You need cordinated strikes, and on the rare occasion such an assault comes together, the results are glorious. But the team sizes continue to go up and sweeping balance changes persist, so I have hope still. Multiplayer shooters are in a sad state nowadays with the dominance of insipid, Call of Duty-styled blink-and-your-dead gameplay now enshrined for all time by Blizzard&apos;s shameful display. The earliest playable build of Eternal Crusade felt immidiately different from both that and from Space Marine, the multiplayer of which was unfortunately guilty of the same lazy design as most shooters, it&apos;s awesome campaign not withstanding.
<br>
<br>I played the beta for a bit in March of 2015. The dominance of melee I heard others cry about was not apparent to me. The issue was that player characters were simply not durable enough. The balance was creeping towards the genre standard and that is not appropriate for a fun or strategic shooter, and certainly &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;ing not for a Warhammer 40k game.
<br>
<br>Then I played in June of this year. The state of the balance then was, honestly, not great. It&apos;s way to easy to get killed before you know what&apos;s going on, either by people with guns or the much-hated melee, much like other, &#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;&#x2665;ier shooters. This was different from the earliest build I played and while I&apos;m happy the Eldar are finally in, the combination of poor balance, graphical issues and network issues makes the game uneccessarily difficult to play. I knew there was a good game buried somewhere beneath a mountain of bugs and balance issues, but the prospect of ever playing it was growing dimmer by the day. The coop isn&apos;t balanced either.
<br>
<br>Now the launch date has come and gone, and we are no closer to that goal. Perhaps Space Hulk: Deathwing shall prove a better use of my time. Still, as of launch the lag and graphical issues have substantially impoved, but from what I can tell there remain outsanding balancing problems, especially with the Eldar.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-eternal-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=6710838">Expand</a></span>

Yes, it needs to be optimized, and yes there are balancing issues. I will give them a 1-2 month grace period to solve these issues, and hope to see this game transform into what we all hoped it would be on launch. This is a clear case of a publisher pushing a game out within a timeframe which didnt allow for implementation of all the mechanics and systems the founders wanted. I believe that the Devs however are very faithful to the franchise and will work hard to make this game better. I guess what im saying is as the consumer base we will see what happens.
<br>
<br>+If you are a 40k fan, and have a patient mind and dont rage at everything, this game is worth picking up.
<br>-If you are the opposite to the above, then either wait a few months on this title, or skip completely.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-eternal-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=6707456">Expand</a></span>

Balancing is still a major problem Eldar being way overpowered and steamrolling every other faction.

<br>
<br>The character customization is not bad but makes you buy &quot;RTC&quot; Rouge Trader Coins a premium currency which is a major downside after already forking over the price of a full game but for those who want to support the development i can see how i don&apos;t mind doing it.
<br>
<br>The Game does have potential but i do insist to wait for a sale. It&apos;s not a great game but its your average 3rd person shooter with a great atmosphere to it. IT IS ALSO BEST PLAYED WITH A CLAN IF YOU SOLO IT CAN BE EXTREMELY BORING AND DIFFICULT ITS A TEAM BASED GAME.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warhammer-40000-eternal-crusade/user-reviews?user_review_id=6720738">Expand</a></span>
