Seems this area was specifically designed for CO-OP.

<br>DS2 uses various ways of psychological warfare like the repeating pewpew sounds by the casters in shrine of Amana. However i feel that they went too far with Frigid outskirts in this DLC which is a pretty large entirely white, semi permanent snowstorm area with a boss at the end and no bonfire near the boss. After spending an hour here (having reduced brightness early) my eyes start hurting and given the fact that you will probably have to replay this area as it&apos;s pretty difficult especially on higher NG and if you are mad enough to try and solo it (deisgnated as coop area) and you will spend even more time here if you want to find all the loot..... it&apos;s not cool at all to wreck your players health like that.
<br>
<br>Other than that the DLC focuses heavily on the enemies ganging up on you. Even larger groups than in the sunken king DLC.
<br>
<br>Bosses are alright but Ivory King is no challenge whatsoever as long as you collect all the dudes that help you in the fight (not counting summons).
<br>
<br>I would recommend picking up Crown of the old Iron King over this one unless you have already done that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-ii-crown-of-the-ivory-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=4563548">Expand</a></span>

Beautiful dreamy kingdom covered in snow, freezing atmosphere, complex level design, solid challenges, nice boss cats, one particular NPC that made me laugh with his behavior, but the biggest highlight for me are Frigid Outskirts, that place is intense! Getting lost in a massive blizzard, can&apos;t see a thing, fighting armies of deadly horses and invaders, broke down 4 different weapons on my journey there.. amazing! It&apos;s also worth noting that the game time is almost doubled compared to previous 2 DLC&apos;s, so at least 10+ hours if you do everything. This was a very nice closure and goodbye to Dark Souls 2. 9/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-ii-crown-of-the-ivory-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=4559569">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Best DLC of the Crowns Trilogy. Nothing particularly innovative about it... and that&apos;s absolutely fine. The immersive level design is there, the challenging combat is there, there are some great new bosses and mini-bosses, etc.
<br>
<br>All in all, a super-tight, engaging and polished DLC that extends the enjoyment for us lovers of the Souls series :)</span>

It reminds me of DS1 and Demon souls a lot.
<br>No ridiculous red phantom enemies, and normal enemies can be hard but beatable. Theres good loot here and not a lot of cheese from enemies/bosses (except this bi*ch Maldron, hes back). Actually bosses have new models from what i can see, so its a plus. No more rehashing things from previous games (except frozen Covetous demon, but hes no boss here). Seems like FROM understood their lesson. One minus though- you fight giant tiger pet, and then the coop boss is the same giant pet, but reskinned. And there are two of them. So yea, it could be done much better.
<br>This dlc is worth its price. Maybe its not the level of awesomness of Artorias dlc for DS1 (its shorter and not that epic), but still good. If you want to buy only 1 dlc for DS2- buy this one.
<br>But still i urge From to take some time, and create one big original expansion as Artorias of the Abyss, with new bosses, enemies and big areas. It would be fantastic, while these small dlcs look quite bland in comparison. Maybe these small dlcs make money, but are not as loved and wanted by fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-ii-crown-of-the-ivory-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=4752698">Expand</a></span>

The player is tasked with traversing the Frozen Eleum Loyce in all its grandeur, and unveil the secrets of the Old Chaos that reside beneath the land. Now out of all the three DLCs, I found this one to be the easiest, since Frozen Eleum Loyce&apos;s level design is linear for the most part (optional areas that are blockaded by ice become accessible in the latter half of the DLC.) Enemy variety is limited (excluding NPC invasions and the occasional mini-boss) with a majority performing dual roles as both caster and tanker, while their attack patterns are easily discernible, and their placement within the levels is very forgiving and doesn&apos;t promote ambush attacks. This being Dark Souls, though, the game showing a slight easiness doesn&apos;t mean that you could just run around and fight to your heart&apos;s content; diligence is still needed, or you&apos;ll end up in a tight spot.
<br>
<br>What&apos;s interesting about this DLC is that it&apos;s the closest thing that we will ever get to choosing a difficulty setting in a Souls game. The final boss is somewhat hard to fight, since he&apos;s surrounded by three portals which constantly pump out resilient knights; the battle becomes a slaughter if you&apos;re not good enough. The most skilled of players could defeat him and his band of merry men without even breaking a sweat, but for casual people like me, we go on a treasure hunt. Within the walls of Frozen Eleum Loyce lie three ominous knights, locked behind closed doors of what looks like self-imposed exile. Approaching a knight reveals a cryptic message, and teleports it to an empty seat above the final boss area. Each one you find will help you fight the end boss, and eventually sacrifice himself to close a portal. So basically, it&apos;s like easy-medium-hard for each hidden knight that you find. Add to the fact that you could also summon two other NPCs/players and the final fight becomes a battle for the ages.
<br>
<br>Lore-wise, it contributes a whole lot to the Dark Souls mythos. The DLC expands on the Children of the Dark, and how they helped shape and influence the great monarchs who once ruled the land. There are also reveals about the Old Chaos, which continued to burn long after the Chosen Undead had defeated the Bed of Chaos.
<br>
<br>Overall a good DLC with much to offer, and new challenges to overcome.
<br>
<br>And there you have it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark-souls-ii-crown-of-the-ivory-king/user-reviews?user_review_id=6945298">Expand</a></span>
