And what a wonderful character she is! At first when you talk with her, she says light things (gives you hints, says puns that dad would be proud of). But the things she says keep changing throughout the game, and it really feels like she&apos;s there with you, helping you and supporting you as you uncover these dark and difficult secrets that your neighbors in the hospital carry. By the end of the game, you learn some amazing things about her that (for me at least) really affected me. Yes, I cried. Probably about 4 or 5 times. But the game didn&apos;t leave me feeling sad; strangely, it filled me with hope. Most of the game, I actually felt like I had been taken to another world and filled with a sense of wonder. There were also several times where I started laughing because of how ridiculous some of the dialogue is (Bad Attitude Onion, Rupert, Buff Glowshroom); I wasn&apos;t expecting it to be a funny game, but it was actually very funny.
<br>
<br>So yes, play this game if you want to experience a moving story, you want to feel a sense of wonder and adventure, you want a good laugh, or if you just love good video game music. The soundtrack itself is a reason to play this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rakuen/user-reviews?user_review_id=7327232">Expand</a></span>

The part I found the most remarkable, was how much the game made me feel as though I was looking at all of these themes through the eyes of a child. I experienced a sense of wonder, vigilance, fear, loneliness, humor, and everything in between; all the while getting to know a cast of very interesting characters. The writing was very effective in that each character, each news clipping, each narrative element felt as though it had its own distinct and realistic voice. Even the most obscure NPCs had entertaining dialogue worthy of being read. The soundtrack is excellent; some tracks are complex and mysterious (Spirit Envoy, The Keepers), some are bittersweet and perfectly simple to match their purpose (My Little Girl, Yours). The puzzles are cleverly intertwined with the gameplay and narrative (when I realized the meaning behind the anagram puzzle in Gemma&apos;s section, I got chills).
<br>
<br>In reality, I would rate this game a 9 or 9.5 because of the limitations that come with rpg maker (which I believe the game was made in). You can&apos;t change the screen resolution from 640 x 480, controller support is just alright, etc. However, none of these things actually detracted from the overall experience. The reason I gave the game a 10 (as opposed to a 9 or 9.5) is because I&apos;ve found that user rating on Metacritic seems to be quite binary. 10 means you recommend the game, 0 means you don&apos;t (or that you&apos;re trying to lower the overall score by giving a more drastic, but unfair rating). I think this is a good reason Metacritic should implement a thumbs up/thumbs down system and display the percentage of users who recommend the game, as it&apos;s a more accurate reflection of how the population has received the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/rakuen/user-reviews?user_review_id=7387483">Expand</a></span>
