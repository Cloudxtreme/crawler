Enemy and friendly combat and pathfinding AI is weak. Both sides will shoot continuously into hills and walls and get trapped in corners. No one takes cover or has a sense of self preservation. Team mates will shoot anything that gets in their firing line (including you and other squadmates). I had to restart a mission because, even though all mission objectives were met, one of my teamates wouldn;t get in the helicopter to end the mission. I must have completed something in the wrong sequence. I&apos;ve never played a game where shooting the gunner of an APC or hiting it with 3-4 rounds from an assault rifle will cause it to explode. You can throw hand grenades 400+yards. There literally is no need for the anti-tank weapons - simply take out armored vehicles with your trusty Colt 45 sidearm. This add-on had lots of bugs and felt like it was released incomplete. The original BHD was much better implemented. The multiplayer is the only saving grace.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/delta-force-black-hawk-down---team-sabre/user-reviews?user_review_id=378995">Expand</a></span>

Well as long as you have no desire for any realism ie ballistics, movement penalties, recoil, this will be your type of game. It becomes real dull real quick, with every man and his dog grabbing a MG and blasting away.</span>

The recoil is realistic, the way you move isnt realistic in anyway shape or form. This game shouldn&apos;t have been released just yet. As you go along you will see alot of bugs the developers should have seen and fixed. With all the new games that are coming out and the games that came out late last year im surprised novalogic would put this on the shelf. If you wasnt disappointed in the first black hawk than i guess you will like this. a note tto the developers, a little realism would have been nice.
