<br>This game has very nice graphics, but not the best according to modelling. Alien models are quite cheesy, but funny in a good way! Immersion is great. If you put key in a slot and move at other camera position, the key will appear in that view too and contrariwise. I loved the music too, it puts you in right mood. You can also do several puzzles in order you want and them are actually quite easy. You can get stuck easily too, but this is not the hardest puzzle-oriented point and click game, that I&apos;ve played.
<br>
<br>Very good point and click game with intuitive puzzles and great atmosphere and voice acting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/voyage-inspired-by-jules-verne/user-reviews?user_review_id=4771239">Expand</a></span>
