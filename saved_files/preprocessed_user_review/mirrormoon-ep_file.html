<br>
<br>So why have I given MirrorMoon such a low score?  Because the controls are a broken mess.  I don&apos;t mean the galaxy flight control screen either.  I mean just trying to change options etc... don&apos;t work.
<br>
<br>MirrorMoon feels remarkably like a half-written hobbyist project that someone then decided to charge money for.  Putting in standard twin-stick FPS controls wouldn&apos;t have hurt the feel of the game but it would have made it a lot more accessible.
<br>
<br>Not being able to configure controls really doesn&apos;t help either.  Having the controller only work on the moons (but then be un-disableable (word)) is a pain.  JoyToKey is your friend.
<br>
<br>Give it a couple of patches (which haven&apos;t happened) and this game could be enjoyable.  Or at least an experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrormoon-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=3944670">Expand</a></span>

The game is easy to pick up on, although it has minimal in game descriptions. This gives the game a very satisfying feeling when you figure something out. I am a couple hours in, and I can say for sure, from the moment you open it to the time you take a break, the game is stunning, and VERY well executed. My only fault with this game is it&apos;s visual simplicity. It sets up the player in an environment I still am not accustomed too, as it feel cartoon-ish. I love the game&apos;s price tag and the game-play is very unique and a nice break from the usual run n gun, plat-former, survival, or horror game. This is a bit more than a puzzle game as it immerses the player in a world with what I feel are problems, not puzzles.This game was a fantastic buy and I am honored to review this game before anybody else </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mirrormoon-ep/user-reviews?user_review_id=3481660">Expand</a></span>
