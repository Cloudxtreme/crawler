The first iteration of Far Cry was, while not necessarily perfect, a solid first person shooter. It&apos;s big, beautiful world let you approach the varied missions using a variety of tactics making it challenging and giving a sense of achievement. After I played this extremely beautiful game for about 15 hours (I tried so hard to like it), I was very disappointed and felt frustrated that the majority of my actions in the world made little or no difference. For example, I laughed hard when I annihilated one of the infinite-random-henchman-emplacements drove around the next corner and thought, &quot;I wonder how long &apos;til the henchmen return?&quot; So I turned around and went back only to find the infinite-random-henchman-emplacement teaming with life again. Not a corpse, nor blood stain in sight (Realism, anyone?)! This was my experience when I drove to a mission, when I drove away from a mission, and when I just wanted to drive around looking at the scenery. I laughed at the utterly pathetic plight of my avatar. I agree with Samuel W. This is a disgraceful sequel to a worthy first person shooter. Tetris has what some may not even call graphics and is repetitive yet challenging and extremely fun to play. Far Cry 2 is the most beautiful, repetitive, and mind-numbingly tedious game I have ever played. Poor form. Go play Crysis, the true sequel to Far Cry, and leave this third rate third world game well alone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=424959">Expand</a></span>

I have been banned numerous times because people thought I was cheating, when on the advantageous side of this flaw. It&apos;s like the developers really didn&apos;t spend much time playing their own game online. It may take a while to realize that you&apos;re not playing a bunch of cheaters, but rather the game is super-buggy that way. (and you may be banned by people who haven&apos;t figured that out yet) But when the game isn&apos;t bending reality in inconsistent ways, the multiplayer experience can be really fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=747028">Expand</a></span>

The reason it is such a good game is a combination of many small but important game elements. Instead of crushing you under tons different role-playing elements Far Cry 2 breaks it all down into three different sections: Daimonds, Drugs and Guns. The game is gritty without being frustraiting (except on Infamous difficulty). Your guns wear down and you heal yourself by performing first aid depending on your injuries. These elements alow you to feel in tune with your charicter, and your buddys almost take death out of the equation. Instead of constantly pressing the quickload key you are instead asisted by your buddy in question, who drags you out of harms way and covers you as you patch yourself up. This is a refreshing change from haveing to replay a sequence because of some bad luck. On the other hand you do run into a AI glitch every once and awhile but thats a total nitpick. And some animations are a bit stiff, however this anomaly is few and far between and no where as bad as other games. In fact I couldnt help but but admire Far Cry 2&apos;s fluidity, sequences are smooth and the graphics in some places are breathtakeing. The story is interesting and changes depending on what charicter you choose. It is NOT Cliched, yes it is set in Africa and involves daimonds but that doesnt automatically make it cliched. I wont talk about the finer parts of the story but let me tell you some scenes are innovative and unique for a FPS. Over all this game may look like a generic jungle shooter on the surface but if you play it you will not regret it. And as a side note I played Far Cry 2 on my PC and had no problems with the controls. The game crashed once throughout 44 hours of gamplay. Truth be told it is an excellent PC game. NOT a Console Port. Granted there is no lean and no prone but i never found the absence of these to be a problem. Truly a one of a kind game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=419295">Expand</a></span>

I cant believe the amount of people who have given this a low score. I also own crysis but you know what, i think i prefer FC2 over crysis. The AI is smarter in FC2, they dont get confused when you snipe them. The only down side so far is that the enemy take a few too many shots to take down (crysis was the same pre-patch) but 1 head shot still does the trick. I can only assume this problem is made worse on ps3 as aiming with the control pad is difficult. But everything else is just really really good. Anyone who doesnt like this game just cant be playing it right, yes you have the same checkpoints that you have to keep attacking but there&apos;s many ways to approach just like crysis but with the added ability of using fire. For instance as you approach a check point take a little time to see where people are, if they&apos;re all inside the buildings then why not lob a couple of molotov cocktails into the surrounding fields and watch as the enemy is forced out into the open by the incoming fire (make sure the wind is blowing in the right direction of course) then you can take them out with whatever gun you happen to prefer, or with a bit of planning you can place some explosive in a strategic place then use fire to force people into that area then BOOM, detonate via remote. People have said the cars always break down?? I&apos;ve been playing for a week and the only time i&apos;ve had a break down is when my motor has been shot to pieces by the enemy. Even then you can just get out and fix the car yourself. There is a problem with online play as the connection keeps dropping but i&apos;m sure this will be sorted out. Otherwise i love playing online, all the game mechanics still apply online. You can set fire to just about anything, drive vehicles and mend them. You can heal your fellow team mates when they&apos;ve fallen which in itself can be dangerous and exciting as you never know whether its a trap, the enemy sniper could still have his sights aimed on the fallen man waiting to take down anyone who trys to help. For me this game takes all the good elements from games like crysis, far cry, and even GTA and blends them to make a superb gaming experience. Cant understand how anyone can hate this game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=418933">Expand</a></span>

The first type demands a deep story, relishes in highly dramatic scripted battles and so is necessarily kept &apos;on rails&apos; by the game, since this caliber of storytelling is still impossible to do dynamically. Well, Far Cry 2 isn&apos;t your game, get back to CoD! The second type relishes in freeform, dynamic gameplay, i.e. sandbox games. We enjoy a bit of storyline too, but not so much that it distracts from our main reason for playing shooters: inflicting epic amounts of violence on unsuspecting, virtual people, choosing our grim methods from a range of options. For us, Far Cry 2 is an absolute blast. First the negatives, since it&apos;s far from perfect. Weapon damage isn&apos;t at all realistic, with both you and the virtual fodder being able to soak multiple shots. Respawn times for the endless patrols is far too high, and you&apos;re rarely able to drive around for more than one or two minutes before being intercepted by another jeep full. The good stuf: both the engine and the virtual piece of Africa you get to roam in look absolutely stunning and realistic. Weapon handling is flawless. Vehicle handling is flawless, easily beating e.g. GTA. Love sniping? This is your game. Love brutely murdering goons with the best in-game flamethrower ever? Got it. Just watching how fires spread will convince anyone with any feel for quality that this is something special. And it still has drama, dynamically employing scripts to create involvement, where LESSER games like the Call of Duty series have to rely on stupid virtual people casually waiting until the player&apos;s arrival before displaying their wafer thin emo. It&apos;s a shame Ubisoft refused to release an SDK for this, resulting in a distinct lack of mods which could (and would) solve the few annoying faults of this masterpiece. At its current price, anyone who relishes freedom, fun and great graphics should get this.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=739907">Expand</a></span>

But also I was impressed that the terrain maps are made so that you can traverse the country side off road if you want. It is a challenge to navigate your jeep off road while the benefits in so doing in evading the roving soldiers is advantageous sometimes. I was surprised how realistic and fun the driving can be. Boats and walking or running are other ways to reach points on the map. And because of this there is plenty of freedom in approaching your goals in missions. The goal of completing the missions in the game are fun and addictive. The scenery and music lend to this but are not distracting. In fact I have noticed that nothing as far as trees or rocks seem to be repetitious and each detail of the scenery is rendered naturally and realistically. Out of the graphics area in the game one weapon, the rifle with a scope is a little big and takes up a lot of my field of view in the game- but that is nit picking some. Frequent saves are an annoyance but that is balanced by absolutely no load times or cut scenes. You don&apos;t know when you could die so before going through check points it is a good Idea to save. There are no load times in the game in going from one part of a region to another (except for bus rides) which is impressive to me considering the speed at which the amazing graphics are blazing by at times in lengthy journeys. Combat is a little too easy at times. I would suggest an experienced FPS player start at the game at Hardcore. Also the game plays fine and looks wonderful on my system a middle range computer with a 3ghz single core processor and good graphics card. If you plan to buy a game for yourself and enjoy long single player missions this game is for you. The multiplayer component looks promising but I may save it for later. After about 20 hours of game play I have not finished it and killed the Jackal. But I suspect it will be a fulfilling and climatic ending.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=418982">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s different, but just because a few whiners think different is bad so doesn&apos;t make it true. I played very little of the first game, had no expectations for this one, and was thoroughly delighted. AI is decent, Fights are fun and intense, flame thrower&apos;s a joy to use (get up-wind of a complex, burn baby burn and peg them off when they flee, or watchem squirm - priceless). For those who are bitchin that this &quot;too&quot; real (old guns jam, you get malaria, etc) - go play doom 1 or tetris - that&apos;s likely more up your alley, lol - who ever bitched a game was too realistic? go do puzzles or something.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=83459">Expand</a></span>

The reason it is such a good game is a combination of many small but important game elements. Instead of crushing you under tons different role-playing elements Far Cry 2 breaks it all down into three different sections: Daimonds, Drugs and Guns. The game is gritty without being frustraiting (except on Infamous difficulty). Your guns wear down and you heal yourself by performing first aid depending on your injuries. These elements alow you to feel in tune with your charicter, and your buddys almost take death out of the equation. Instead of constantly pressing the quickload key you are instead asisted by your buddy in question, who drags you out of harms way and covers you as you patch yourself up. This is a refreshing change from haveing to replay a sequence because of some bad luck. On the other hand you do run into a AI glitch every once and awhile but thats a total nitpick. And some animations are a bit stiff, however this anomaly is few and far between and no where as bad as other games. In fact I couldnt help but but admire Far Cry 2&apos;s fluidity, sequences are smooth and the graphics in some places are breathtakeing. The story is interesting and changes depending on what charicter you choose. It is NOT Cliched, yes it is set in Africa and involves daimonds but that doesnt automatically make it cliched. I wont talk about the finer parts of the story but let me tell you some scenes are innovative and unique for a FPS. Over all this game may look like a generic jungle shooter on the surface but if you play it you will not regret it. And as a side note I played Far Cry 2 on my PC and had no problems with the controls. The game crashed once throughout 44 hours of gamplay. Truth be told it is an excellent PC game. NOT a Console Port. Granted there is no lean and no prone but i never found the absence of these to be a problem. Truly a one of a kind game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=419165">Expand</a></span>

For me personally this is a huge bonus...i say hooray because i hated Far Cry after the first few levels. Stupid AI that you had to pump 10,000 rounds of ammo into before they died...rubbish! This game has a slower pace and a brilliant open environment. I&apos;m happy to drive about taking in the sights. Sit on a hill scouting out a target before attack. Yes some of it is repetitive and it&apos;s highly annoying the two opposing factions don&apos;t actually fight each other. And it would be nice if everybody in the game wasn&apos;t out to kill you. Graphics are lush, sounds are nice. Vehicle models are good. Weapons feel good. I can see why people are upset with this game and why it&apos;s scoring so low with quite a few users. It&apos;s simply not fast paced or moving seemlessly from mission to mission like COD4. The story and characters in COD4 were excellent, this doesn&apos;t compare. The lame multiplayer doesn&apos;t help. But i&apos;m happy. It&apos;s nice to have something slower and open ended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=418936">Expand</a></span>

There is also some minor problem with the field of view (16:10 here) and the mouse sensibility but both can&apos;t be fixed easily. Now if you think the game is repetitive -this is a FPS FFS- just don&apos;t use the road, free roaming, stealth, incredible setting and engine, etc, this is the best FPS of the year.

I was actually quite surprised that it ran so smooth with high quality settings. The game has its little flaws like it had them on xbox 360 but damn, so little flaws for so many good things, I simply wish there were more games like this one.

If they only made the waterfalls better, added more animals and underwater visuals this game could trick you into thinking your actually in a desert/jungle. Game play was alright. The side missions were god awful repetitive. I stopped doing them after like 14. The ai was annoying as f**k. You&apos;ll be driving down a road and get spotted then they would chase you until a- you killed them b-they drove off a cliff. Plus as mentioned, enemies and take a notorious amount of bullets. Also, the ability to cut across a river is sometimes useless. Many of times i jumped into a river to cut across and save time only to find myself swimming a mile down the river to find a piece of land that will allow me to come up onto shore. But i have yet to find a game that didn&apos;t have little things that aggravated me. All in all i recommend this game. Even though it could have been way better, It still was a good experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=418932">Expand</a></span>

And when you are playing it, you have to immerse yourself completely to enjoy it.This game is one of the first of its kind.

But the enemies are a little mind less but that really doesn&apos;t make a difference unless you play on hard (I play on medium) This game is enjoyable.</span>

For warring factions, they&apos;re pretty damned friendly to eachother -1 for lack of non-combatants. Where is everybody else? Sure, there&apos;s no cities or towns except for the central mission hubs, but I&apos;d expect women and kids there at least. -1 for enemies taking too many bullets. +1 for graphics. It looks great, fire looks awesome, the changes in weather and day/nights are breathtaking at times. +1 for no aliens. I stopped playing Far Cry after half a level of those mutants. That completely broke the game for me. +1 for malaria, jamming guns, &quot;field surgery&quot;, cars being fixable instead of either brand new or exploding. Yes, the animations can be tedious but I actually enjoyed having to be rescued by a buddy after a gun jammed while I ran in Rambo-style and I got swamped. It&apos;s not a &quot;run in guns blazing&quot; game for me, so these little interruptions add a bit of depth for me. +1 for the map system. I rock at getting lost in any single game, but the paper map guides me without breaking immersion. What may make the difference between me and a lot of people that give low ratings is that I am in no way in a hurry to finish the game. I enjoy looking around, circling a camp a few times to plan my assault. I am fine with spending time to drive to my missions, it adds realism and gives me a chance to look at the scenery. I just love the different subzones, ranging from desert to almost jungle-like. If they patch the respawn rates and amount of bullets the enemy can take, I&apos;ll be playing a near-perfect game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=419557">Expand</a></span>

Sure the missions are repetitive and there is a ton of driving, but the missions are exhilarating and the driving is interrupted with guard posts that keep the game exciting.</span>

You can use flamethrowers and stuff to distract enemies but the minute they see where you shoot from, they basically just come at you, using cover along the way. Some of the nuances of the AI are interesting but the sum total is not great. It&apos;s kind of cool to hide nearby and hear them arguing over whether or not to pursue. The realism in the environment is great but two parts of the realism are terrible: no matter who you pull jobs for everyone wants you dead, and it takes way too many shots to kill people. If you&apos;re only wearing a pair of shorts and flip flops and you get hit in the chest with an AR-15, you&apos;re dead. In this game it takes like five hits at least. On the other side, the game is more immersive than anything I&apos;ve played and well worth it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=419131">Expand</a></span>

No game out right now deserves a &quot;1&quot;. Grow up children, and try making a game from scratch yourself. On to the review: The story seems a bit lacking in depth and history. The ability to choose your protagonist was a good one in theory, but it seems to have toned down any character development that could have occured. As to gameplay, the more I play this game the more I appreciate being able to choose my own style of play. This is not a game for Halo-style single-objective play. I really enjoy that I don&apos;t have to execute my objectives in the way set to me by the game developer. How may times have you played a shooter where you have to run-over-there-and-blow-up-that-AAgun? Nothing kills immersion faster for me than an objective that doesn&apos;t make sense. &quot;Why do I have to run up to that tank? I don&apos;t want to.&quot; In Far Cry 2, no matter what your playing style, there is an alternative. I&apos;ve been impressed (mostly, but there are some flaws) by the AI in Far Cry 2. Here are some things that impressed me: 1. Cover matters. If they haven&apos;t seen you, they don&apos;t know you&apos;re there. There are no times where enemies just start chasing you. You have to catch their attention before they notice you. On the other hand, they can be a little short-sighted until you start shooting. 2. VISUAL cover matters. Hiding in a bush, tall grass, or behind a thin cover of foliage keeps you hidden, at least to some extent. 3. The AI uses tactics. If you stand on a ridge (or somewhere else you can be seen from), fire off a few rounds, then get under cover and change locations, the enemy will go to the last place you were seen and search from there. This opens all kinds of tactics to be used. I like laying out IEDs then luring the enemy into an ambush. All in all, it&apos;s a solid title. I&apos;m excited to see it with a bit more polish.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=419186">Expand</a></span>

FC2 is about negotiating the world--dealing with threats, managing your resources, exploring, and keeping it together long enough to finish the mission and get back to resupply station. I recommend playing it on one of the harder difficulties, since the game gets better the more you have to think tactically about what you can and can&apos;t do. The game deliberately hamstrings your ability to travel and resupply to heighten the tension you feel when you are in the wilderness and low on ammo. It works, but you have to buy in. Definitely a must play on Hardcore or Insane.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=420539">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are absolotely amazing, a definite landmark for gaming. The map editor is worth the 60$ alone. Altogether, this is the best FPS I have played in my life. A must buy whether you&apos;re into the genre or not.</span>

However, if you like more straightforward and simple action shooters, this isn&apos;t one of them. For those who want instant constant combat action, this might get boring. But for those who like to wander around a bit (and maybe shoot a Zebra or two), plan their moves and then execute them, this game should provide some great fun. The graphics are great and the environments amazing. However, it seems that this game is better played on a PC: a) with more memory the world doesn&apos;t need to load that often b) you can save whenever you want. From what I&apos;ve gathered, these have been reported as drawbacks on consoles (not completely sure though, haven&apos;t tried myself).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=418597">Expand</a></span>

The AI is brilliant at times, although sumtimes the AI is dum.. But they actually search for you, you can outsmart them with some effort, but they actually have to see you to shoot you.. Unless its a sniper... The graphics are amazing, the fire is an awesome feature, you can blow trees apart, swim ,drive .. fly... wat more do you need? IT really is a great game, you feel as if your actually in the world.... In my opinion the traveling miles and miles for each mission doesn&apos;t tire.. I love every minute.. and being stopped by random enemies is great, as you would get bored without them... I must admit the world does seem lifeless at times, with no cars traveling on the roads etc... But it is an amazing Triumph of a game... Not a GImmic at all...

<br>You are misrepresenting the game by this obvious and deliberate deception. (which although not a groundbreaker, is ok really).

<br>I now expect the same guy to write back under about 12 assumed names telling me how wrong I am.

I was hyped for this game from the time I saw the first screenshots and techdemos showing off the fire and world dynamics. And the game play did not disappoint. Admittedly, it takes a little getting used to finding your way around this massive and immersive world full of thugs and rabid warmongers. But once you get the hang of it, it just keeps getting better. I spent the first 5 hours or so trying to figure out how to play this game. And yes: I ran into those checkpoints full of respawned gunslingers time and time again. I was assaulted by some dude in a civilian car while just travelling along time and time again. I ran out of ammo or jammed my weapon or failed to administer first aid and died because of it time and time again. Until I figured out that you don&apos;t HAVE to go THROUGH that checkpoint to get from A to B - you simply go around it. You don&apos;t HAVE to travel along roads - you can travel off the beaten track or take a boat or bus - and you&apos;re much less likely to get shot at. Plus this kind of evading strategy takes you places where diamonds or Jackal tapes are hidden. You don&apos;t have to get a jammed weapon every clip - just go and stock up on purchased weapons from the shop before you head out. And suddenly those checkpoints become valuable destinations to refill your ammo, syringes and explosives, not just some tedious affair. FarCry 2 is not meant to be a linear, highly scripted, action-every-5-seconds CoD clone. If you play it like that, you are bound to be disappointed. It is meant to be explored. You are meant to find your own way around this world. And if you do, you&apos;ll be rewarded with epic firefights, some truly amazing F*%$-off! moments, and an experience that will stay with you for some time to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=420477">Expand</a></span>

Try and stand your ground when you fight, you will be flanked, enimies will use cover and you will die. Think full scale open world and u will live much longer. There is no correct way to complete a mission, the fire propagation is an amazing tool graphicly and for use in combat. Each weapon has a real feel to it, breaking weapons and jams add to a sence of fear that you may have to improvise weapon choise greatly effects the outcome of a mission and the way you deal with any give situation. Pick a sniper rifle and dominate from far away, but if you fire several shots from one place be prepared to be swarmed and killed. Pick a shotty and move in close, but stay moble and think &quot;i cant say this enough&quot; think about what you doing or you will die. Farcry 2 is a thinking game, if you dont think then u wont have fun, i smell a cult classic more then a main stream game as, its just to much for people used to tunnel shooters. For others like me that have been waiting for freedom in our fps thank you ubi.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=418761">Expand</a></span>

Far Cry 2 is worth your money, or at least a rent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=75524">Expand</a></span>

Amazing visuals and effects make this game look amazing, although the LOD changes of foliage and geometry are sometimes a little jarring. Attacking the various checkpoints and, indeed, targets is always a fun bit. Although sometimes the AI seem to have magic eyes and are able to spot you amazingly well (normally rocket dudes too!) it makes sense that they should be able to see at least as well as you. One particularly memorable combat for me was a sneaky-sneaky infiltration into an enemy base. I snuck around dart gunning and knifing my way through enemies that I came across, occasionally launching a grenade at an ammo stockpile to divert attention from my position. By the time I actually reached my objective I had most of the NPCs running around screaming that they wanted to go home! There isn&apos;t an enourmous variety of weapons (compared to say, Jagged Alliance 2 1.13 :-P) but rather than pack the game with a million different guns which are all more or less reskins, the developers seem to have attempted to have one or two different styles of weapon for each slot. For example, it&apos;s possible to equip sniper weapons to primary or special, or explosive launchers to any slot, which means more or less that although you are restricted to 3 weapons with one from each slot, they don&apos;t have to be assault rifle, pistol and rocket launcher as you might expect. One thing that does frustrate me is the total lack of climbing ability. It kind of levels the playing field a bit (otherwise you could just sit on top of a giant mountain and snipe everyone on the map) but it seems a bit strange to say you have an amazing open-world game and then restrict you to only 1 or 2 paths into each area. The sniper weapons are a little samey too, with each one being more or less a one-shot kill, and there are no bullet physics to speak of which makes sniping your way through encampments ridiculously easy. Bullet physics, especially wind, would fit very well into the game as well, since you can watch trees and flames blow in the wind. I&apos;d just like to point out that perhaps the developers of Far Cry 2 saw the title reflecting the paradisic nature of the setting which has been reduced to a war zone - a &apos;far cry&apos; from the paradise it appears to be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=418915">Expand</a></span>

Then reality kicks in and declares war on denial. Denial struggles briefly before being overwhelmed by realitys awesome facts. In their(ubisoft montreal) attempt to make a game thats non-linear with freedom to go where you want etc, they got the open world map bit right at least. But after the n-teenth time you have to consume an outpost in a glorious sexplosion of fire and bullets, just to get to the corner store 50 metres down the road in your JeepTM(shudder) you start to wonder why they bothered. You cant move without something shooting at you, as the AI is retarded in the way only a enraged animal could compare, attacking with no reason or motive other than, I can see you, die. Actuallly they dont even need to see you, or have line of site to know where you are, wow! So for all the fantastic scenery in the 50km/2 area you have to explore, its kinda like not seeing the forest for the trees, or in this case the ALWAYS aggressive npcs. This is a shame beyond measure, when placed in comparison to competing titles like fallout3, a world filled with detail and lore that gives more immersion then even the very best graphics can make up for. Theres nothing worth exploring in farcry 2, cause theres nothing to find, its just a dead landscape that provides nothing more then obstacle you have to traverse to get to you next killing field(missions), peppered with npcs you have to kill on the way. Over the course of playing, you will either be given or earn access to this conjealed mess of game devices that offer no real differentiation from one another. Oh, bar the self propagating yet self extinguishing fire. What point is there to getting an upgraded hunting/sniper rifle if the one you already have will kill in a single shot and is fantasticly accurate? And the faux rpg elements of providing stats for weapons, that have no real bearing on the actual performance of said firearm. Pistols more accurate then assualt rifles? Yep sure thing. If you love shooters and care not for depth or feeling, then this title is probably for you. But if it takes more then pretty explosions and mindless killing to keep you interested steer clear of this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=421400">Expand</a></span>

Instead, you are dropped in the middle of a beautifully rendered Africa with the freedom to tackle a variety of missions as you choose. The gameplay reminds me to Grand theft Auto, a comparison I&apos;m surprised more people havent made. Yes, pretty much everyone will attack you, but it is a shooter. Most people also complain about the long travelling times, and the repeated guard post attacks. The guard posts are a small minus for me, mainly because of how they instantly respawn when you go just about 100 feet or so away from it. But the travel is actually fun for me, and if it really takes you too long then you obviously should only be playing scripted, linear games where the next predictable objective is always directly planted right in front of your face. No, Far Cry 2 is for those of us who actually want to live and breathe our character in his setting. Yeah, the story could be better, but the varitey of weapons and different ways you can tackle missions make it really fun. I do wish stealth was easier too, you cant really sneak around compounds knifing people in the back ninja style, but you can use stealth to bypass guard posts, especially at night. I only wish there were other African animals like lions and alligators.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=421517">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> Probably the second best game of 2008 after Fallout 3. Completely immersive and way fun. The AI is a little bit psychic at times and you definitely don&apos;t want to run and gun your way down the road because you end up fighting jeep and outpost after jeep and outpost...but if you slow down and play a little bit stealthy this game really opens itself up to you. Overall I&apos;d recommend it!</span>

You can manage which missions to do and when, how to get around (on foot, jeeps, buses), and most important the approach you take to a situation. You can take the roads and deal with patrols and checkpoints head-on (good </span>

It doesn&apos;t pretend to be an RPG. It doesn&apos;t pretend to be something as pretentious as Crysis. No, this is Far Cry 2, and it actually lives up to the name. Plot doesn&apos;t seem to figure much into the game so far, but that&apos;s okay...because the game truly IS open-ended. Sure, you have to go take on missions and there are certain objectives that you have to do, but the world is VERY open. The way I see it is, this is like a MUCH better, fully polished version of what a game like STALKER should be...minus the inventory system. It literally sticks you into the world and there you are. You can find diamonds and upgrade weapons and safe-houses. And the graphics in this game are AMAZING. I&apos;m running it on an 8800GT and it&apos;s letting me run it at 1280x960 with all the DX10 features and most details turned all the way up. It looks really great. The lighting and foliage and atmosphere are wonderful. The editor is great too. They&apos;ve made it even more intuitive than the one for Far Cry is, and it allows you to literally plop yourself right down into your map AS you&apos;re making it. Excellent game. And the filesizes are amazing. I was surprised when the game was less than 4GB. Not sure how they did it, but it&apos;s good to see a game that isn&apos;t an 8GB monster.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=419147">Expand</a></span>

Yes, you do have to clear out enemy checkpoints (guard posts) every time you go through them. What so many of them fail to grasp is that YOU DON&apos;T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THEM. Maybe someone used to Halo or even Call of Duty expects to perform the same action over and over again, but this game is NOT Halo or Call of Duty. For my playthrough, I adopted a full stealth strategy. Silenced Pistol, sniper rifle, and a rocket launcher if I needed a lot of bang. When I first started, though, I was popping caps left and right with a shotgun and flamethrower. But the thing about this game is that you&apos;re NOT relegated to any one experience. As I said, I adopted a stealth strategy. How do I deal with checkpoints? Either sneak around them in the brush, or shoot a guard from a distance, wait for all his buddies to come looking for me, then sneak through while they&apos;re busy searching. And the game ENCOURAGES this. Or, if I&apos;m not in the mood for sneaking, I can borrow a boat from the Dock at the bar and take the river route. Very few guard posts and they&apos;re less likely to chase you. So if you think you&apos;re having a hard time, CHANGE your strategy. You&apos;re not limited by the game, you&apos;re limited by yourself. As for the game itself, its quite beautiful, at least before you start blowing it up. The fire effects are pretty awesome but still have a ways to go. Best I&apos;ve ever seen, though. You can actually predict where the flame will go based on wind direction and terrain. What else can I say? The world is very immersive. AI is frustrating, but in a good way. Often I&apos;ll think I was perfectly hidden when someone will spot me becuase I poke a gun barrel around a corner. Often I&apos;ll kill a guard, think i&apos;m in the clear then find out he had a buddy just down the road who saw me kill him. And sometimes that buddy will shoot off a flare and call MORE of his buddies to finish me off. All in all, this game punishes your mistakes to be sure, but definitely rewards good performance. So if you play this game, don&apos;t think that you&apos;re limited to roads or checkpoints. Don&apos;t think you have to kill every enemy or do every mission. Make the game yours. Kill some buffalo or zebras. And most of all DON&apos;T get discouraged, where theres a will (and a lot of ammo) theres a way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=420677">Expand</a></span>

And as far as people being made that this &quot;has nothing to do with FarCry&quot;, actually the developers always said that the island was the main character of the game. the name itself is meant to imply a sense of isolation and survival against all odds, and that is still the theme and character of this game. before you dis a game, i suggest you know what you&apos;re talking about. this is a game for hardcore gamers (as far as the campaign) they didnt make a game to try to apeal to everyone, they made a game to apeal to the people who are jaded by the WW2 clones and space . this game was a brave attempt at doing something new with the genre and they&apos;ve produced a well polished, beautiful, and sometimes punishing game, that i assure you, noobs need not apply. If you&apos;re jaded than go back to playing crysis or COD. I&apos;m sold on Farcry 2. i suggest anyone rent it, and if its for you, than it&apos;s well worth the purchase. nuff said.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=418647">Expand</a></span>

The new game engine should be a crowd pleaser. Obviously you are going to need a reasonable rig, but a reasonable rig will provide more than reasonable performance. Expect your same hardware to perform with detail you could never achieve with Crysis or the tweaked warhead. The multiplayer mode looks promising, with Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond (Flag), and a capture the zone mode. However, the terrible browser and connection issues are marring a potential very pleasant addition to what is surely the best single player fps of 2008!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=418702">Expand</a></span>

Take the bus. Like travel? Drive or take the boat. Hate stealth? Run and gun with a SAW and RPG&apos;s at noon. Like stealth? Sneak in at 1 AM with silenced weapons. One of the best things about this game is the &quot;calm before the storm&quot;, as you scout out an enemy camp with your binoculars from a hill high above, planning your attack style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=418784">Expand</a></span>

If you&apos;re at all creative and you respect a beautifully open ended world, this game is absolutely amazing. The world is beautiful, I almost crapped myself when I found out the original map was not the only place you could go. Guns perform terrificly, and the all of the guns require you to unlock them first, making them ever so satisfying. The game is about survival and accomplishing your goal of killing the Jackal, in one way or another. It&apos;s great fun, and if you are a fan of the GTA series you may enjoy this. This really is a new shooter, the best way I can describe it is as a well pulled off first person Mercenaries, with much more realism. Sniper rifles perform as you&apos;d expect, however don&apos;t expect too much long range shooting. Assault rifles are great up close, the weapon degradation is never very annoying as long as you maintain your weapons and don&apos;t use the rusty stuff the bad guys drop. Everyone complains about Malaria, but you have like 10 pills per bottle, and the attacks occur every 30 minutes to an hour, so you can potentially run 7-10 hours on average before having to do a short delivery mission to get more. People complaining about it are twitch gamers that should honestly stop whining and go back to xbox live. Visually the PC version is brilliant and left my mind boggled, even at DX9. I&apos;m running and HD4870, 4GB of RAM, and 3.0Ghz E8400 and I get a good 30-50 FPS on ultra high, which looks a hell of a lot nice than the Xbox or PS3 version. Even on those versions the world looks very good, except for a dip in FPS. This is a great game, I highly recommend it! It does have DRM, but you get a install back if you uninstall the game! You get 5 installs, and with uninstall it&apos;s not a big deal. My only issues with the game: A few main missions are rediculous. I had to defend a barge that was under fire from all directions, while repairing it. I blew up a gunboat, and it landed on top of the boat, the part where I needed to be to repair the damn thing. It let me repair but I was hurting due to fire... If you dont have quicksave like on PC, that would have been ungodly hard to beat. Driving takes a long time. I wish they would have had some ambient radio like in GTA to keep you occupied. Checkpoints are annoying, but you eventually learn how to buzz past them or around them. Great game overall!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=418848">Expand</a></span>

Simply put, the high detail and realism just aren&apos;t enough to mask bigger flaws in the game. Length of game: 10 hours - 40 hours Gameplay: 7/10 I like the openness of each area and the mixed tactics to assaulting every outpost or location. Unlike a traditional straightforward first-player shooter such as the Call of Duty series, the game will allow you to approach each enemy differently depending on the weapons and your individual style. I also like the strict first-person view through the entire game. From shooting enemies to reviving allies to performing surgery on yourself, the camera focuses on how your individual character would act. However, there are MANY flaws in the AI: first, they respawn much to fast to be realistic. (Walk/Drive away from an outpost and come back and fresh troops will replace the ones you just killed minutes ago.) Second, the AI&apos;s ammunition isn&apos;t realistically consistent. (Keep an enemy with a mortar alive and he&apos;ll keep firing shells even past pounding a mile-deep crater into the ground.) Third, the AI takes way too many bullets to kill. (8 AK-47 rounds to kill a guy without a shirt on.) There are many other first-person actions that are very much simplified (like checking ammo in a clip and repetitive stabbing motions with the machete), but those would only be the icing on the cake here. Graphics/Animation: 10/10 Some of the most realistic I&apos;ve ever seen in a game. With the graphics setting on your computer turned up to the highest, the fire blazes very realistically and the sun&apos;s glare catches you when staring directly at it. The AI doesn&apos;t seem to have a leg or arm sticking out in a random place, so that helps. Only fault here is the tremendous amount of computer power required to run the game at full graphics quality, but this is a necessity for all high-end PC games. Sounds/Acting: 3/10 The sounds of the game are horrible. What little music there is happens to be completely boring (and much too quiet!) and only makes the game less appealing as a FPS. The only positive here is the action music, which will make your heartbeat race during an intense firefight. The game&apos;s voice acting is absolutely horrendous. The actors make no breaks in speaking and do not sound the least bit realistic, especially for a game that strives on realism and higher quality. The game is also very serious and humorless, and even the jokes that the actors make are overshadowed by the darkness and bleakness of their surroundings. Replay Value: 1/10 Absolutely NO replay value whatsoever. At the beginning you have a choice of many different characters, but the choices you make don&apos;t affect the missions/gameplay that you end up with. Also, the missions you can perform are very tedious and repetitive. Assaulting an outpost or area becomes the same, over and over, killing enemies or destroying a target or talking to an NPC. Essentially, this becomes the backbone of the game, and absolutely kills the replay value. However, if you like doing the same thing over and over again, this game (and a job on an assembly line) may be perfect for you. Multiplayer: 5/10 Not much to say here, other than the fact that the multiplayer has a Call of Duty-based style. In fact, I would prefer multiplayer over single player because of the fact that you fight human players instead of repetitive computer AI that repeatedly hurls itself at you. Despite its multiplayer mode, I would have prefered that the mods sacrificed the multiplayer and instead focused on working out single player improvements. Lack of a co-op (2 player) campaign also deducted points from this category. Player Created Mods/Addons: 2/10 Little player support here in the way of modding capabilities. Ubisoft has ignored players&apos; requests to include SDK (which would allow much expanded player modding capabilities) and the most people can do is make new maps for multiplayer. Final Comments: I would NOT recommend this game. Most gamers (especially those who enjoyed Far Cry 1) would be severely disappointed with the outcome and gameplay of Far Cry 2. Why do old games with horrible graphics but incredible gameplay (such as Counter-Strike Source and Half-Life 2) remain popular even today? The uniqueness of their gameplay overshadows their lack of graphical detail. Although this game has excellent graphics, a very realistic world, and open choice in gameplay, the repetition and slightly problematic AI for single player causes this game to go down under.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=739396">Expand</a></span>

So basically, if you get into it and experiment with it its a blast, and if you don&apos;t, I pity you. I also give it an extra point for graphics and more specifically portraying Africa so beautifully. I can&apos;t think of any other game which does Africa remotely well.

After the first five hours of game-play the scale of the game really starts to hit you and suddenly it becomes a sheer joy to play - if the game was a drug the effects start to kcik in and it feels great. its when you realise that ever mission in the game (there are about 35) is EXACTLY the same that you start to feel a bit betrayed. SURE, you can approach each identical mission in a new and expressive way and SURE - each mission takes place in varying environments. HOWEVER, the objective is ALWAYS one of two things: Kill a man or Blow up an object with explosives. That is just two missions repeated roughly 15 times to make 35 missions. I find it baffling that the creators could produce such a detailed and imaginative environment and such a beautifully crafted fighting system only to come up with the most unimaginative and simply boring mission system to go over it! Assassination or Sabotage, thats it, thats all you will be doing for 30 hours and every time you go to get a mission your heart sinks a little bit &apos;Oh! What a surprise! you want someone dead! I didnt see that coming! ive only gone and done that 13 times already! Its ok..This time ill try using nothing but a flare gun.&apos; I would give this game 10 if they had spent the time varying the missions how about these possibilities: Undercover Missions, Hunting Missions, Decoy Missions, Puzzle Missions, Rescue Missions, VIP Missions etc etc . The game may be the best SinglePlayer FPS ive ever played but its also the most disappointing - a bit like a one night stand with a beautiful woman who doesn&apos;t really like me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=419654">Expand</a></span>

Yes, you do have to clear out enemy checkpoints (guard posts) every time you go through them. What so many of them fail to grasp is that YOU DON&apos;T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THEM. Maybe someone used to Halo or even Call of Duty expects to perform the same action over and over again, but this game is NOT Halo or Call of Duty. For my playthrough, I adopted a full stealth strategy. Silenced Pistol, sniper rifle, and a rocket launcher if I needed a lot of bang. When I first started, though, I was popping caps left and right with a shotgun and flamethrower. But the thing about this game is that you&apos;re NOT relegated to any one experience. As I said, I adopted a stealth strategy. How do I deal with checkpoints? Either sneak around them in the brush, or shoot a guard from a distance, wait for all his buddies to come looking for me, then sneak through while they&apos;re busy searching. And the game ENCOURAGES this. Or, if I&apos;m not in the mood for sneaking, I can borrow a boat from the Dock at the bar and take the river route. Very few guard posts and they&apos;re less likely to chase you. So if you think you&apos;re having a hard time, CHANGE your strategy. You&apos;re not limited by the game, you&apos;re limited by yourself. As for the game itself, its quite beautiful, at least before you start blowing it up. The fire effects are pretty awesome but still have a ways to go. Best I&apos;ve ever seen, though. You can actually predict where the flame will go based on wind direction and terrain. What else can I say? The world is very immersive. AI is frustrating, but in a good way. Often I&apos;ll think I was perfectly hidden when someone will spot me becuase I poke a gun barrel around a corner. Often I&apos;ll kill a guard, think i&apos;m in the clear then find out he had a buddy just down the road who saw me kill him. And sometimes that buddy will shoot off a flare and call MORE of his buddies to finish me off. All in all, this game punishes your mistakes to be sure, but definitely rewards good performance. So if you play this game, don&apos;t think that you&apos;re limited to roads or checkpoints. Don&apos;t think you have to kill every enemy or do every mission. Make the game yours. Kill some buffalo or zebras. And most of all DON&apos;T get discouraged, where theres a will (and a lot of ammo) theres a way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=420678">Expand</a></span>

Maybe there could have been a bit more interactivity with the map and a few more side missions as well although I must give the Map Designers a big round of applause, I have lived in Africa for 9 years now and this game truly brings out the rugged, harsh, dangerous yet beautiful landscape that is, Africa.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1602256">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a huge non-linear game based in Africa where you, one of eight other characters is sent undercover to kill Jackel, someone arming both sides of a civil war there! It&apos;s very enjoyable and has the usual shooter elements that were done amazingly as the FarCry series has always done. The animations, physics, graphics and everything else is brilliant and looks almost real... That is if you get past the vehicles. They&apos;re fun to drive but two things make them to unbelievable. One, being that the break down waaay to easily and the second reason being that their physics is way off. Hitting a bush with a car in real life doesn&apos;t make the car completely stop and raise the back wheels into the air, a wall would do that! Other than the vehicle physics and strength this game is amazing and anyone who loves open world or shooters should defiantly take a look at this!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1740150">Expand</a></span>

The graphics and physics in the world are admirable. It looks and feels very realistic. The virtually completely open world style is unique but fails during the implementation. The story is a bit interesting and realistic feeling but your character has absolutely no personality, or choices within the world, such that i cannot imagine how it changes with the character selected beyond the pair of shoes that you view during the game. The checkpoints re-spawn quickly once you pass them so you fight the same battles over and over, and over. The story sends you randomly all over the world and several times to the same locations with fully re-spawned enemies, so there is a LOT of repetition. Five stars, for an overall ok game, a plus one for an acceptable field of view that made it playable for me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1766791">Expand</a></span>

The story itself is pretty good and the environment is wonderful but everything else is horrible, horrible done.  The design flaws are some of the worst I&apos;ve ever had to contend with and has completely turned me off of this series.
<br>
<br>The game advertises secondary quests and factions but they have absolutely no impact on the main game.  The best way to play this game is to just do the main quest.  While there are 2 factions everybody hates you all the time so working for a faction impacts only who gives you the mission.  Each time you walk out the door they remind you they hate you.  What is the use of having factions if everybody is your enemy.  The game has many design flaws that probably sounded good on paper but were horrible in practice.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s start with the guard posts scattered throughout the maps.  As you clean them out the map marks them as cleared and a counter lets you know how you&apos;re doing.  Unfortunately if you go a little ways away and come back they are completely repopulated.  Other than changing the icon on a map clearing out the posts serves no purpose whatsoever.  I got to the point where I just ran through the post and only stopped if I had to.
<br>
<br>The game requires that you micromanage your character.  Guns jam, you have to take medicine periodically, cars break down and if you get low on health you have to use first aid or bleed to death.  This all adds up to more focus on the character than combat.  This game is most definitely a FPS because stealth just doesn&apos;t work here.  As soon as you shoot anyone everyone knows where you&apos;re at and their accuracy is astonishing.  I had 1 person shooting me with a pistol at long range, across a ravine, throw a wood wall and still kept hitting me.
<br>
<br>Back to the health system.  When your health gets really low you have to bandage or your die.  No problem except the animation takes about 5 seconds and cannot be interrupted (except by enemy fire).  And oh by the way the enemies can continue to attack.  So if you&apos;re swarmed (which you often are by the end of the game) then you have no chance to recover so you reload.  That&apos;s bad.  Here&apos;s probably the most idiotic thing I&apos;ve ever seen in a game  it quick saves just before you start the long, uninterruptible animation.  That means you get quick saves of the game just before you either get lucky and survive or you die.  Whoever thought that was a good idea should never design a game again.
<br>
<br>There are so many enemies running around in cars that you end up fighting more people getting to a mission (because the fast travel system isn&apos;t that fast) than in the mission itself.  Even worse is that cars tend to not make any noise until they start shooting at you and if they are too close you cannot shoot back without getting out of the car.
<br>
<br>Overall this game was not fun to play.  I ran through most of the map just to get to a mission, stopping only when I had to.  During the missions I went straight to the goal because nothing else had any impact anyway.  Even the ending of the game where you had a choice to make had absolutely no impact on the ending.  I cannot possible recommend this game to anyone other than a hard core FPS person who has nothing else to play.  I remember when this game came out they advertised &quot;realistic fire&quot;.  Yes the fire looks awesome but if all I really wanted was to watch real fire I&apos;d become a fireman.  Clearly this game was sold based upon its name more than its design.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3147321">Expand</a></span>

<br>The only game left more unfinished by my friends might be Dead Island, which is a zombie version of this game.  Great graphics, great acting, great audio, good gameplay, but it just becomes totally tedious to play.  I understand the 5.6  10 user score, but the 85  100 critic score just reminds me why, like movie reviewers, professional critics all suck and should be summarily ignored.
<br>
<br>Not that it has anything to do with playability of the merits of this game, but I&apos;d like to understand why this game was even called &quot;Far Cry&quot;.  It&apos;s about as close in plot and story to Far Cry 1 as Bioshock is to Quake 4.

<br>
<br>The vehicles all feel the same, even in GTA3 a very old game now they managed to make you feel like you were driving different vehicles. Then, there&apos;s a hang glider, lol, pointless, no fun, gimmick.
<br>
<br>The missions are all very similar, drive 10 minutes to go kill someone, blow a truck or deliver some documents. I think the developers have done it on purpose, how come the mission is always on the other end of the map, it makes you spend 90% of the driving. If the driving part was fun it wouldn&apos;t be so bad, but it&apos;s not, it doesn&apos;t even feel like driving, it feels like walking really fast with shaky camera, I think it&apos;s because the vehicles have only two velocities, you&apos;re stopped or moving, they forgot the acceleration part of driving.
<br>
<br>Not sure if I consider the random missions a story, it makes little sense.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3173104">Expand</a></span>

<br>If not, skip a buggy, boring FPS sandbox that should be no more than a footnote in the development of this type of game design.
<br>
<br>BUG NOTES: For some players, the game will have &quot;jumping&quot; NPCs as their walking animations stutter. This is a game-breaking bug, because it also prevents critical mission dialog from finishing (instead it will loop from the beginning and cut off repeatedly). The reason is (for me at least) that game will start with V-Sync defaulted to &quot;OFF&quot; to get higher FPS. If you have a high end machine you may need to turn it on to fix the problem. Other users found that installing a different version of directX solved the problem. Not hard to fix, but I don&apos;t buy a game planning to troubleshoot it for the devs (as though they even cared to patch it at this point).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=5480992">Expand</a></span>

<br>Repetitive, boring, annoying. Enemies respawning almost instantly. I just can&apos;t finish it. Game makes me literally sick. I finished FC1 and I liked it even through It was pretty hard and annoying in some cases, but this. This is just terrible. Not worth it on sale, Rate 3 because some people might like it.</span>

However, the game&apos;s storyline is somewhere between nonsensical and nonexistent, none of the characters have much depth, the voice acting is mediocre at best, the missions are repetitive, and there are some problems with the control scheme. Some points to consider: (1) Perhaps what throws away the game&apos;s immersive qualities more than anything else is that even though you&apos;re supposedly a &quot;no-name scumbag&quot;, the game clearly revolves around you. Ostensibly you are just some guy caught in a civil war between two sides (UFLL and APR), but in fact the supposed two sides are indistinguishable (you can&apos;t tell if you are fighting UFLL or APR guys), there are no front lines, and you almost never see AIs fighting each other. Instead, they only fight you. The war does has two sides: you (and occasionally one of your &quot;buddies&quot;) against nearly everyone in the entire country. (2) Ostensibly you&apos;re in the country to kill the &quot;Jackal&quot; guy who keeps the war going, but for some reason you reach this goal by killing hundreds of random people that have nothing to do with your supposed objective. (3) The control scheme has issues. For example if you want to run for cover, you are only allowed to run straight forward (strafing disables running) and if you are reloading, the game forces you to finish reloading before you can run or switch weapons. (4) The bus stations that take you long distances have no staff. No ticket agent, no bus drivers, riding the bus is free, it&apos;s perfectly safe, and it gets you to your destination much faster than driving. Make sense? (5) Virtually everyone in the country is male and heavily armed. There are virtually no civilians. (6) There are magic boxes all over the map. Put your gun in a magic box and pull the same gun out of another box 20 miles away. Or how about the gun shop (which is normally unstaffed) where you buy the guns on a computer and the guns you bought magically appear in a warehouse next door. Make sense? The problem is that while the graphics are highly immersive, the gameplay mechanics are absurd enough to pull you out of the immersion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=421582">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The AI sucks big time. The enemy has x-ray vision making any kind of stealth play impossible. You spend time sneaking up on your target then kill him with a silenced weapon or your machete but be ready for instant mayhem. Everyone knows what you did and where you are. Run for your life. Shoot someone from a distance and the enemy knows exactly where you are. The enemy can see through dense foliage, walls and rocks. Run for your life. You can watch an enemy look and fire in the opposite direction from you but you will still get hit. It&apos;s quite hilarious!
<br>
<br>Forget about a story line, there isn&apos;t one. You just go on missions and kill everyone you see, or run for your life.There are no other options. Try to kill the Jackal? No way. It&apos;s a bogus story ploy. Try to help your friends that you&apos;ve collected through the game. No way. The developers have higher goals for you. Be careful they have a political agenda.
<br>

The protagonist must travel hundreds of miles chased by pea brained, buggy AI that will hunt you down no matter where you run to.  How is this realistic?  To make matters worse,  you encounter hundreds of the same monotonous check-points that vary only in the number of tires and fences that are commonly found around one..  On top of that, you have an incurable malaria that serves as a really a poor plot device.  Finding a cure for malaria should not drive the STORY!  The story should be driven by fun game-play and interesting missions.  The mission narrative doesn&apos;t really push the envelope either as it centers too much on petty clan warfare and local rivalry.  The developers attempted to change the names of the clans and characters to break the monotony, but the characters continually bring about the same plot elements I describe above-petty rivalries, etc..  Even the equipment is a letdown.  Vehicles blow up too easily and weapons constantly jam.  The only thing that really kept me going a 1/3 of the way through the game was the possibility of acquiring better weapons.  Unfortunately, the mechanics of wealth acquisition don&apos;t favor even a moderately fast ascension to power.  Acquiring wealth is slow, painful, and disheartening.  The primary currency for barter are diamonds that are scattered across the whole god-forsaken territory that you must trek across ever so painfully.  If you ever manage to complete the miserable story-line, Ubisoft should award you with a small prize.  Believe me, you deserve it for all of the torture you will assuredly have to endure.  The only reason why I gave this abomination of a game a 1 is because it serves as a good benchmark for video-cards.  My recommendation to those who wish to avert a deplorable gaming experience is to avoid playing Far Cry 2 altogether. In fact, the game itself, if you bought a physical copy, should be reserved for use as a coaster for soft drinks.  Alternatively, the dvd-rom can be used in a futurist art project.  Better yet, go use it to play frisbee with your dog in a park.  If by the unluckiest of chances, you bought a digital copy, you will undoubtedly be dismayed at having wasted however many dollars you spent on this treasure that, by it&apos;s digital nature, precludes it&apos;s more appropriate uses described above.   If this is the case for you, let me just a dedicate a moment of silence to you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=1490096">Expand</a></span>

<br>Getting from mission to mission is about as fun as the Park &apos;n Ride experience of commuting to the airport.  Except, however, that in the case of air travel you might just be going someplace fun.  In FC2, you&apos;re going to the next repetitive mission the writers painfully crafted on spare napkins while waiting for their order to come up at In-n-out.  This is lazy, mass-produced content that rivals the story-telling depth of PONG.

<br>You may enjoy Far Cry 2 if you enjoy these other things:
<br>
<br>1) Standing in line at Disneyland as opposed to the ride itself
<br>2) The subtleties of watching paint dry
<br>3) Chatting with DMV Employees
<br>4) Waiting for Uranium to decay
<br>5) The uniqueness of IKEA furniture</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3220149">Expand</a></span>

FC1 was great, FC3 was good, FC2 simply falls flat on its face.
<br>It has Great graphics, the African landscape was great but devoid of any fauna(bye bye realism) The shooting mechanic is mediocre but the stupid AI completely ruined it all. As for the Open World, here is a piece of advice to developers. Open World games are fun only when it is fun to explore. The map is horrendous, the vehicles are crap and break down with 3 shots (fck  authenticity) with arcade like physics(maybe to please casual gamers) and the first person driving is horrendous with your dashboard and your FAIL-ATTEMPT-TO-BE-UNIQUE map taking up 75% of your view. And those irritating checkpoints...made doing side quest a hell.
<br>Here is a scenerio. You travel to one edge of the map for a quest, to reach there you have to kill all the baddies in the checkpoints again, like 3-4 of them..around 10 mins travel time. Quest tells you to go to a place which takes 20 mins to reach, and again go through those checkposts  killing all those respawned enemies. If you spend 20 hrs on this game, 15 hrs will be spent traveling and re-killing everything you killed few moments ago.
<br>And plz lets not go into the &quot;malaria&quot; system. ughhh..
<br>I uninstalled it after 5 hours of play, just to get my money&apos;s worth(in vain) cuz it was simply unplayable..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=3946747">Expand</a></span>

If your buying this game expecting more of the same fun as the original far cry, buy crysis instead because this &quot;sequel&quot; is Far Cry in name only. the only similarity I could find was the fact that you start the game with a machete and a pistol. 2: There are some brilliant game mechanics (the health system and malaria gimmick were pretty cool, as well as the map system and the car repair thingy) however these great ideas are marred by the fact that the developers seem to have forgotten to put a game around these mechanics. It all looks very pretty and the graphics are nice, but when every mission is to travel to the other side of the samey landscape and kill someone for some reason it gets a bit old. Not to mention the journey to these areas is slowed considerably by random respawning jeeps full of baddies blocking your path. I was basically fighting the same enemies in the same landscape with the objective of fighting more of the same enemies slightly further away. so overall, great game mechanics, but it needs a more coherant and varied main mission. Calling this game Far Cry is like making a new Max Payne game only to take Max Payne out of New York, remove his trademark hair and oh wait.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/far-cry-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=82801">Expand</a></span>

Most of the play time is driving around since the game always puts the objective at the ass end of the world map. The gore and blood are ridiculous. Nothing about this game is special! The story is almost non existent. please save your money and dont buy it. it is a waste.</span>
