I grew up rocking NBA Street and NBA Street Vol. 2 back on the PS2 days and it gave me some of my favorite ever gaming memories. I remember how after hitting the court in real life, we always got together with my friends and then played ball on the console. Then on the PS3 I also loved the re-invention of the NBA Jam franchise. Now with NBA Playgrounds, you kinda get both, as the best way to describe this game is that it&apos;s a mix of NBA Street and NBA Jam!
<br>I always wondered how amazing an NBA Street game would be on the current gen consoles and PCs, and this game is as close to that as it gets. I love the easy to pick up but hard to master controls, the flashy dunks and tricks, the beautiful and funny graphics, the old-school Hip-Hop style soundtrack, the court designs and the fact that it has almost all the NBA legends, as well as the current star players. The roster is deep and you can upgrade all the players with the XPs you earn after each game. There are many different courts from all over the globe and you can unlock new skills and moves as you progress.
<br>It is a sports game, so sometimes it can feel cheap, like the CPU &quot;cheats&quot; against you but eventually you can beat it on any difficulty. I believe if you like basketball and you&apos;re a fan of the arcade style streetball games you will love this one. To me it&apos;s a must buy!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nba-playgrounds/user-reviews?user_review_id=7287981">Expand</a></span>

Meaning there are shots in the game that will go in no matter what even without the power shot and there are plays you play that make every single shot they take. With tremendous disappointment I am telling you the game is broken.</span>
