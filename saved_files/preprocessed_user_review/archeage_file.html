<br>
<br>The common staples for crafting (such as wood and cloth) cannot be planted in the F2P&apos;s public farms, so you are forced to create farms out in the world. This may come as a challenge to find secret locations, but players scour the far reaches of the world and atop the mountains outside of the map. They will sit there to either uproot (destroy) your crops or to steal them right after the timer shows when they&apos;re done growing. Crafting and everything else requires &quot;Labor Points&quot; AKA LP. LP is gained by playing over time (P2P can generate some while offline) and makes people try to find ways to idle but not get kicked, further filling up the server.
<br>
<br>The server instabilities can range wildly depending on your case. Some players are permanently banned from chat and get instantly kicked upon login for doing things like guild recruiting in previous sessions. Some players get kicked because their character&apos;s name looks suspicious. Others chain-disconnect for no reason, even while in queue to get into the game (there&apos;s no saving your spot in line.) If you do get disconnected, there is sometimes a 10-minute grace period to get back in, to include load times.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s talk about the queue system. People AFKing on the server are taking up server slots. Bots are taking up server slots. F2P players are waiting 12-24 hours to get in to play, with it sometimes resetting their spot in queue from random disconnects. P2P players get priority, but still need to wait 30 minutes to a few hours to get in, again with random disconnects mixed in there. The headstart that they promised was a few-day event which had these queues, of which it was a varied outcome of 100% of the server&apos;s land being taken, some people getting 0 hours of play time due to no fault of their own, and others not even able to log in due to the poor accounts system. The queues have caused people to lose their houses, their land, and their farms due to not being able to log in to pay their taxes. Land is a finite item on a server, of which is more valuable than gold.
<br>
<br>The accounts system is broken to the point of which people who have paid for a service have still not received their service. A large portion of players who are founders have yet received their founder items. Patrons who paid their monthly subscription have not received Patron status in-game, but are still billed for it. &quot;Patron&quot; status is a major issue, where it was given and taken away from random players, to include F2P players. So, F2P players were able to buy land illegally, P2P players lost their land, and everything reeks of incompetence on part of the developers.
<br>
<br>Additional issues exist throughout the game. Since this is a KR/RU port to EN/EU, there are already hacks right after release to include instant teleporting for trade runs. Inflation has already skyrocketed. None of the NPC voiceacting is in English, so I hope you&apos;re Korean. Class viability is a minor issue, since you&apos;ll be farmed in PvP starting around 30 by level 50&apos;s. There is no questing after around level 30. You are thrown out into the world to do farming, crafting, or grinding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4521358">Expand</a></span>

The labor system encourages people sit in the game AFK.
<br>
<br>Trion was told about this months ago, and even all their sympathizes were told this as well.  Get on their case and don&apos;t encourage them.  Nope wouldn&apos;t listen.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately offline labor regeneration is going to have to be equal to online if they want people to stop AFK&apos;ing in game, there is no way around it.  If they want to keep the labor system, they will just have to suffer the consequences with exploits.
<br>
<br>Then the issue of staying logged in the character select screen all day while your at work.  Why could the company not foresee this?
<br>
<br>Anyways, your money is better spent elsewhere.  This game is not F2P, it&apos;s basically a trial version until you drop cash.  The more cash you drop, the more dominating you&apos;ll be in game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4516178">Expand</a></span>

The game it&apos;s self is rather fun, when one can actually get in to play. However, every aspect of it&apos;s supposed uniqueness is not available to the masses. There are no houses or farms available, therefore the average person can not really craft or farm anything, the market will be filled with the products made by the few people and guilds that were lucky enough to log in and get their founders packs....along with the few who got far more than they should.
<br>
<br>Not only did the founders pack s not arrive but, they have also restricted them to just 6 so, if you delete a character for any reason, you will not receive a new pack. Why was this not told to players before hand? I have never seen such a thing before, I find the whole thing ridiculous.
<br>
<br>The founders pack I was not given for some time now seems worthless compared to the new packs which have far more useful stuff in them. This feels like a complete lack of loyalty  on Trion&apos;s behalf and a great big slap across my face. I have completely lost trust in this company.
<br>
<br>The very fact I paid for a founder&apos;s pack yet spent more time trying to log in, or re-logging in, than actually getting to play is yet another big slap in my face. What is even worse is now the free players get potions and goodies to help them  level fast and even a chance to get the house I couldn&apos;t, while I still wait to log in.
<br>There is a complete lack of voice from Trion, with regard to creating new servers or any chance of lessening the unreasonable ques we all have to suffer, from one extent to another. I don&apos;t like to pay to wait and I certainly refuse to pay at all any longer. When my months are over, there is no chance I will be subbing, for there is no point, since the only reason to sub seems to be to own property, and I have none now and no chance of getting any.
<br>
<br>My whole experience so far feels tainted, my opinion of Trion is that they are criminal. they made many promises but failed to fulfill those obligations, yet off no solution, only a big middle finger to those that they scammed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4510103">Expand</a></span>

I decided yesterday I wanted to support Trion and subscribed but even that system is broken and they won&apos;t give me the subscription I paid for.
<br>
<br>The game in itself is quite fun. I&apos;d give it an 8. But the cash grab Trion is doing, the amount of support they have given and info they have given about what they are doing to fix the issues have been nill. And that is enough to drop my rating to a 2.
<br>
<br>I CAN NOT recommend this game to anyone even though I like it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4508582">Expand</a></span>

This game had the potential to be the best MMO I ever played and I&apos;ve played these types of games for 17 years since the days of Ultima Online. The pirate aspect is amazing and really gets your heart pumping like no other MMO I&apos;ve ever seen. To spot the enemy approaching and knowing they are going to try and board you and take stuff you spent hours fabricating is what makes this so intense. The other positive aspect is running around the world looking for secret farms and then stealing from them...if you get caught and you eventually will, you are sent to court, and get this....the jury is real players! You get sentenced to jail if found guilty. My personal sentence after raiding several player owned illegal tree farms was 12 minutes in the brig. Classes are extremely fun and varied with over 100 different classes! Combat was fun as heck. So why won&apos;t I play this game? The developers suck! They urged us to buy a $150.00 founders pack months ago and then days before launch they give a much better $150 package as an option and long time supporters get screwed. Queues are usually 3000+ during primetime and over 5-8 hours long. I&apos;ve been waiting 5 hours as we speak and still have 900 in front of me and I&apos;m a paying patron. The developers decided that paying customers should be lumped together with those who don&apos;t support the game at all with their wallets. The cash store is exactly...IT IS PAY TO WIN...don&apos;t let anyone tell you different. You need labor points to do EVERYTHING in the game and they run out quickly. Want to craft? You need labor points. Want to farm? You need labor points. Want a house? Yada, yada, yada. You can use up your daily allotment of points in just one session of crafting and then you have to wait or buy some from the cash store. The primary means of income is from making packs and turning them in. You can only set a pack down safely in your player owned home and good luck with that. Safe homes were taken in the first few hours of the game and homes in PVP territory means you can lose your pack on the way there to another player 30 levels higher than you. So housing is a bust...the developers allowed some toons that managed to log on quickly to accumulate as many houses as they could as placeholders and the rest of the gaming community is screwed. Not the it matters...unless you&apos;re unemployed, I don&apos;t see you surviving the 7 hour queues....it&apos;s not like you can get things done quickly in game and there are only so many hours of playtime in a day. It sucks because housing plays such an integral part of making money in this game. You basically need to grow trees because wood is such a valuable commodity and you can only do that on your own farm or in a limited way on public farms which were filled to capacity from day one. The developers opened two more servers since yesterday and those are already hours long queued also. The bad thing is if you add too many servers, they become ghost towns when the hype goes away, especially when people get fed up and that is happening A LOT! Just read some archegae forums...99.9% negative maiing this one of the least succesfull launches in history from a players perspective, but quite successful for the developers as players purchased the $150 pack in great numbers with promises of a great playable game. It&apos;s not happening...we had months of beta and alpha to figure this out and the official launch was even worst than beta. Server merges will be impossible unless you want to lose your home which is what the majority of the player base wants out of this game and is a huge effort to build and maintain if you&apos;re building anything of quality. This game could have been great, but it&apos;s not. Maybe a few weeks down the road when all the unhappy players have gone on to greener pastures this game will be playable. If you can stomach the queues and play it for free, try it. Just don&apos;t use the cash shop or buy a patron package....it&apos;s just not worth it and the developers will screw you down the road. Use it as free to play game until the next hot game comes along because there are developers that can do much better overall.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4509718">Expand</a></span>

<br>Actually, I have to give them at least a 1 for managing to launch better than Diablo 3.

<br>Players have received 0 items for an entire week while new people paying are getting immediate service over people that supported the game since April. The company clearly gouged people and has shown they are more interested in milking the gaming community.
<br>
<br>lastly the game is very much Pay to Win or more aptly pay for super fast progression as you can buy your way to 50 and economy dominance through their credit system. Trion has proven to be the EA of the west.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4510229">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What makes this make interesting and worth the try is the features, of course if you were thinking of owning a house.. or a farm chances are you can&apos;t why? Well the game is very limited when it comes to land that&apos;s why the only people who can own property in the game are paying customers (patron status 15 bucks a month) that being said you can already assume that all the land in the game is gone, I was not kidding when I said the land was limited... about 30% of the patrons that got into the head start managed to get some land. So even if you become a patron..(15 bucks a month) there really won&apos;t be any benefit from it.
<br>
<br>There will be farming available for free members in public farms but these farms are over populated even by patrons.. and they only protect your stuff for 24 hours, so planting anything that requires more than that (and everything pretty much does) well most likely be stolen.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4508344">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is literally P2P right now, if you do not pay money you won&apos;t get placed into the priority queue and good freaking luck getting into the game. Combine this with what others are saying and it becomes a game that you spend 12+ hours to get into to be ganked by higher level players and do poorly compared to people who have paid money. Oh wait, even if you wait 12 hours, GOOD LUCK GETTING IN!

The screenshots and forum speculations gave me high hopes for this game and I hope that should I ever manage to get in and get a chance to play the game it will live up to some of those expectations. Trion&apos;s handling of the server queue, patron status (from forum notes), and the reports of AFK players running in place leads me to believe that only a game of the most extraordinary nature could survive under the management provided by Trion as they scramble to collect as much cash as they can from &quot;founders&quot;, subscribers to the patron status and micro-transactions.

When you have people who buy a package to play a game, then you need to cater to the people who are playing. The game is a good game to play... but if you can&apos;t play it, then it sucks. The Queue&apos;s are terrible and their response to handle the queue&apos;s are just as bad. They can&apos;t even make it playable. I get home from work to play the game and wait 2-3 hours for a queue and they want to lie to the public that it&apos;s not that long of a queue. Ridiculous! Can&apos;t play the game due to queue&apos;s because I need to log out as I finally get to get in. Another horrible thing, there is no stopping the other players from griefing the other players from getting land. All the land is taken! No spots available, even to the ones who paid. This is due to the horrible design in allowing people to place their plots in just the right places so that other people can&apos;t fit their plots in. Horrible game design on that part. For those who say it&apos;s all apart of the game, your right... I&apos;m just saying it&apos;s stupid. An I was stupid to think that Trion would actually do a good job of releasing this game. The release was a complete waste of money and time. Never playing another Trion game. Not worth it anymore.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4509492">Expand</a></span>

I purchased the $150 pack on one account and purchased several $50 packs because the game had so much potential and fantastic design concepts, but Trion ruined the game with this horrible botched launch. I will never purchase another Trion game.</span>

XLGames did an amazing job with it&apos;s development.
<br>
<br>The reason I give it a 4, is because XLGames trusted Trion with it&apos;s North American and European release. Trion did a terrible job. Queue times of up to 6 hours long to get into a server, crashes, terrible lag, broken subscription system, and absolutely no communication to either paid players or free to play players. They essentially tarnished XLGames&apos; name with their management of the release. They have potentially ruined the opinion of thousands of players when it comes to Archeage... when the game itself is quite impressive.
<br>
<br>I would be extremely delighted if XLGames decides to sue Trion for damages to their brand.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4508921">Expand</a></span>

<br>Housing is gone.  It&apos;s been gone since the first day of head start.  If you are planning on dropping a farm or a house, you&apos;ll be sorely upset upon your first login as most likely you&apos;ll be forced to drop your farms in temporary housing(only lasts 7 days).  I&apos;m one of the lucky ones that managed to get some properties planted early on Friday of headstart.  If you&apos;re wondering why i&apos;m complaining even though I have a house, 3 farms, and a thatched farmhouse down it&apos;s because of the 4-5 hour queues that prevent me from actually using them.

<br>Craft, farming, coin purses, housing, fishing, trading and even some quests require.
<br>Let me give you an example.
<br>You want to make first set of armors (much stronger than you get from quests), then you need 700 labor points.
<br>Labor Points will regain when you are
<br>Online: Paid player 10P/5mins, Free player 5P/5mins
<br>Offline: Paid player   5P/5mins, Free player none.
<br>
<br>It means
<br>Free players need to stay online more than 11hours to get first armors.
<br>Second armors require 1050 LP. Higher you go, more LP require.
<br>
<br>Want a house? LP require, how about a boat? Sorry, LP require.
<br>It is free to get in, but not free if you want to enjoy this game.
<br>
<br>Labor Points force you to pay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4510104">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Archeage
<br>
<br>A sandbox RPG where you can  pretty much do anything you want from building houses, boats, trading to making your own little empire with friends and guilds and going to war with the big name factions of the game.
<br>
<br>Gameplay : 8/10. Fluid controls, hit to connection is very good, typical of a PvP focused game. You pretty much have everything at your disposal as long as you&apos;re a paying customer. Farming, decorating your house you name it. It&apos;s really all about you in this game.
<br>
<br>Story: 6/10. I did not find the about the character very good. I played a Harani, each race has it&apos;s own story to tell maybe I was just unlucky. The overall Lore of the game though would be rated at an 8-9/10, very indepth.
<br>
<br>Music: 7/10. Okay I know some people might like the music too this game, but I came from FFXIV:ARR and the music there was absolutely amazing. In terms of adrenaline rush in pvp the music does get you pumping. Just not as much as fighting Titan in FFXIV.
<br>
<br>Graphics: 9/10. Fantastic graphics, running the game doesn&apos;t take much of a machine and compliments high end machines as well. DX9 and DX11 support, the lighting in DX11 is mesmerizing. Also when you see the Ocean for the first time in the game truly is a beauty to behold. The Water Graphics in the game Rival a fully modded Skyrim in my opinion which is great in itself.
<br>
<br>Replayability: 1/10. It&apos;s an MMO where one character can be anything you want. I don&apos;t see a reason to ever have to start over from the beginning unless you&apos;re twinking or making a bank alt so I&apos;ll add another rating for this.
<br>
<br>Longevity: 10/10. It&apos;s a Sandbox MMO where you can do everything you want with one character and go anywhere you want pretty much. It&apos;s an experience that I think anyone with the patience to grind out will enjoy.
<br>
<br>Overall: 8/10. This game is simply amazing, it has tons of potential and a bright future if the Devs play the cards right.
<br>
<br>Now that I got the game out of the way I&apos;d like to rate the Producers of this game for the EU and NA region: Trion.
<br>
<br>Some of you might know Trion from Rift, I personally was playing WoW at the time and seeing the &quot;You&apos;re not in Azeroth anymore&quot; banners posted all over the web made me laugh sometimes. Rift had a relatively successful life, not nearly as long as it&apos;s acclaimed Rival World of Warcraft, but it was relatively successful for an MMO this day and age.
<br>
<br>Now Rift aside I&apos;ll get to how poorly Trion has done with the Archeage Launch for the NA/EU region. Having no experience the the KR/RU versions of this game I don&apos;t have any clue if their launches were a mess or not because they have different Producers.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s get to the point, the Launch of this game was an utter mess. Launched with 8 servers for each region there was a back queue for about 4-5 hours. They released 1 additional server during launch and 1 server during the head start which was 4 days of queue timer for people that spent $50-$150 for the founders pack on the game.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m going to go ahead and tell the story from my experience. This company neglected all of their paying customers from the start of Head Start, went and blind sided the people that invested in them &quot;founders&quot; with more extravagant offers via the Starter packs and continues to try to sale on the Cash Shop when their subscriptions don&apos;t even give the people who paid for the benefits of being a subscriber.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, I fall under the category of someone who had paid for their service and haven&apos;t received it yet. It has been 24 hours from the review that I have received what I paid for and the company remains silent on the issue.
<br>
<br>Their customer support is abysmal . 6-7 hour wait times in live chats. Tickets going unanswered for days at a time and hardly any clarification on what they&apos;re going to do about the issues with the current state of the game. When I did finally get to the Representative (they were very kind I&apos;ll give them that) they didn&apos;t know how to fix the issue and had to push my problem onto someone else.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s the rating I&apos;d give Trion from an Archeage players perspective at this point.
<br>
<br>Launch Management: 0/10, I was able to get in during easily on the new server, but they didn&apos;t let any of the newer F2P players download the game UNTIL an hour before the servers even went live. So if you didn&apos;t have fast internet you were destined to sit in queue for hours on end.
<br>
<br>Customer support: 5/10, The only saving grace here was simply because the people are nice when they talk to you, which should be a common business practice in itself. They however had not nearly enough people on staff to help out with the volume of problems they were having. I didn&apos;t get out of my live chat until 10pm (PST) after initiating the queue 6-7 hours prior.
<br>
<br>TL;DR. Archeage is a great game managed by terrible producers. Either the Producers get their act together or this wonderful game will fall in fire.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4508283">Expand</a></span>

As far as the game goes if your here for a good storyline I suggest other games as this one only lasts until you get to the Two Crowns zone. After that it&apos;s mainly a bunch of side quests that lead you from one pvp zone to another. For those here for the Dungeons and Raids again I would suggest another game. The dungeons are poorly planned and NPCs have horrible and predictable mechanics. The raids on the next hand are too few and were barely covered in alpha/beta but more than likely the same as dungeons. As a game that focuses mainly on PVP and Trading it will get stale rather quickly for those that are only interested in doing either one at a casual or your own pace. From past experience with games that focused on one aspect over the other too much they tend to get boring and repetitive rather quickly. For those PVP fanatics or people who play games solely to dominate a market this may be the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4508518">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I will call bs on the 10 hour que days after launch.
<br>
<br>Dev&apos;s are unhelpful, obviously can&apos;t count, and in now way interact with their player base.
<br>
<br>I doubt this game will survive the massive load issues it has.</span>

I will split it into two, as this game deserves two different aspects:
<br>
<br>The game itself - An amazing game with a lot of potential, and even now it has some qualities that might not be completely innovative for the genre, but the developer truly invested and gave it thought.
<br>The graphics - Very well made for a MMO (especially a few years old, it is only newly published in EU and NA now). There are some quirks and glitches, especially when switching characters and the occasional choppy fps on heavier settings, but all in all I have very few complaints. 8/10
<br>
<br>Sound - Nothing special, some background music that changes when you go into combat mode, sounds are quite nice and ok. Nothing fancy, but not lacking in my opinion. 8/10
<br>
<br>Gameplay - The game itself does not have any &quot;unique&quot; new and unseen features, but it combines many that have not been combined before. The character progression is extremely varied and feels almost like a game by itself. You can choose 3 out of 10 skill sets, and then use skill points to unlock skills within them. You can easily change between the sets, and reset skill points to respec at any point you want. This leads to amazing flexibility, only limited by what items you have. That leaves you with amazing number of &quot;classes&quot; to go for, not all of them viable - but a lot are, and allows your creativity of what you REALLY want to play. The combat is very tradition target skill oriented, but nothing bad about it and it is done very smoothly (although if you lag you are at a disadvantage - but that is true for many MMO&apos;s).
<br>
<br>End game - The PVE content is not as awesome or amazing as you might find in other MMO&apos;s, but the other aspects are great. You can decide you want to be a trader and utilize special haulers or ships, you can be a pirate, you can glide on your enemies as they approach your shores. What you can really do is truly only limited by your dedication and imagination.
<br>
<br>That leads me to the sore spot that makes me give Archeage a low score - the publisher.
<br>Trion was given (or they bought, it doesn&apos;t matter much) a game of vast potential that can only grow with further patches and good community - and they have made every mistake in the book. Hell, they probably invented new ones.
<br>
<br>The alpha was quite good, the closed betas were also going fine (they are alpha and betas, so for testing purposes) and by the open beta it seemed like they mostly know what they are doing.
<br>When head start happened there were crashes, lag, bugs, and the thing that ruined the whole appeal of the game - queue. As head start progressed so did the queue. After 3-4pm you had to wait at least 30 minutes, if you only logged later at rush hours it was at least 2 hours. Many, and me among them, could hardly play the game during head start.
<br>At the end of the head start they released more servers (making the head start completely pointless), and then more on release (further mocking the founder community). As of today, after release, the queues stand on 2-4 hours, depending on server, during rush hours. On earlier times that used to be free of queue you still need to wait for 1 hour.
<br>
<br>Another horrible aspect - the publisher - Trion, has been ignoring the community all this time. Barely any announcements, no forum discussions - nothing.
<br>
<br>This, my fellow gamers, is an example of a very good MMO that will disappear very quickly, unless something will be done. The game in the current state is unplayable (unless you consider a 2-4 hour wait in the evening when you can actually play decent).
<br>When the publisher will get a grip, or players will leave the game to the point where there are no queues, or tolerable ones, I will change my score. This is a 8.5-9/10 game that is dropped to 2-3 simply because of horrible management. If you want to play follow the state and join when you can play, you won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4507647">Expand</a></span>

<br>Next problem: Since only select people could get into the game and play without the constant disconnecting the guilds and gaming communities had an advantage on the land grab, they just alt farmed up some starting currency and 90% of the land in the game was gone within the first 30 hours. Some players were able to gloat on how they had 20+ houses, reserved for their **** guildmates.
<br>
<br>Next Problem: Founder pack and daru chest duping, the guild&apos;s knew they could duplicate items from the get go, this helped them grab the land fast, and was Trion&apos;s responsibility.
<br>
<br>Low and behold, Trion fixed their servers stability and increased them a lot (3 on US and a few on EU) RIGHT before the F2P open beta launched.
<br>
<br>Oh right, and they opened new servers, so the F2P community could patron up and have a better chance at land than we did due to the server fix. No transfers were allowed, and if your character is lvl 10 or so, it takes 24 hours to delete him so you can start on a new server (2 characters MAX in the entire game without a character expansion)
<br>
<br>No explanations or **** were given by Trion, refunds were denied, still no word on compensation for the time wasted.
<br>
<br>I spent 150 usd, I received 15 hours of what was supposed to be a 96 hour headstart, now I&apos;m stuck with a house in a god damn pvp zone *As a healer* and no room for a med-large farm.
<br>
<br>Trion wasted my weekend, will I still play archeage? Yes, will I be going F2P? Yes if they don&apos;t compensate those who were sold a damaged good.
<br>
<br>0/10,
<br>
<br>Reason?
<br>
<br>If you can&apos;t play the game, how can you rate it well?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4506090">Expand</a></span>

That meant 4 days of play on the launch servers before others. No, it was plagued with problems, people got 2 at best, and then Trion added extra servers on launch that completely negated it anyway. Biggest scam I&apos;ve seen in any game. Be wary of this company.</span>

<br>Negative:
<br>-- A ridiculously long log-in queue, 4 hours for me so far, others have experienced 6-8 hours
<br>-- (in my opinion) A rediculously poor server plan, a lot of money was generated by the alpha stage buy-in.... but with millions of dollars, Trion failed to secure enough servers to handle the mass influx of players.  The MMORPG genre is a huge community of people (look at WoW), when releasing a game that looks as epic as ArcheAge... you should expect to be required to host a game for Millions of people, not half a million (best guess).
<br>-- 24 hours since installing Archeage: (2 hours trying to authenticate account) (1 hour of game play) (6 hours of maintance downtime) (7 hours total of ridiculous queue time with a fluctuating queue number)
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not holding my breath, but IF they fix their queue issues, I wil be a happier gamer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4508623">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Combat is tab-targeted.  Quests are uninspiring.  The attractiveness of the game is the open world &quot;sandbox&quot; - ish environment.  Most of these tasks are parsed by labor tokens that are earned while logged in (or offline for patrons)  Land and crafting have huge significance for this game and most of the land has already been snatched up by those with early access.
<br>
<br>As I mentioned - big launch problems.  Save yourself the frustration and pass on this one.  It might be worth visiting a few months from now but honestly, given my beta impressions, I&apos;m not really all that disappointed to wait.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4508509">Expand</a></span>

It is unfortunate that they have essentially scammed their original player base who purchased Founders packages during Alpha and Beta.  The promised early access period leading up to launch was riddled with bugs and long queue times on every server.  Only one of the days went by without serious issues, and they failed to deliver the item packages and &apos;Patron&apos; status to the people who paid.
<br>Now they&apos;ve launched and their pre-existing issues have only gotten worse.  Queues above an hour, more bugs with Patron status, and to top it all off they&apos;ve released new item packages which are better value but priced at the same tiers as the Founders packages.  It was an incredible slap in the face to the people who have spent money on the game&apos;s offerings only days and weeks before.  There has been no communication, mind you, about any of this or promises to fix things other than to acknowledge a few of the bugs.
<br>
<br>I can recommend playing this game because it is simply great.  I can&apos;t recommend giving this developer/publisher any of your money though.  They have only disappointed so far.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4506020">Expand</a></span>

<br>Housing is going to be a joke. As a patron on day one I&apos;ve not been able to do much more than level as all of the land was already gone before the game launched.

<br>Wow so the founders really got what they deserved in a headstart? No. Quite a few founders were given more resources than others, while others had an almost impossible time logging in. Which lead to people hording land they didn&apos;t earn by ANY means, that includes in game and out of game currency... some people were basically handed land because of trion handing out too many resources to the wrong people.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4507054">Expand</a></span>

<br>However, kill 10 rats quests and awfull handling by Trion makes this game a big no no. Long queues (8 hours + ), people playing for stuff and not getting it (dont spend any money, there is a big chance you&apos;ll just get robbed), no communication with community and complete lack of disrespect. They even got their founders (people that played during beta) scammed by adding &quot;starter packs&quot; better than founders.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4508804">Expand</a></span>

Hands down worst MMO I&apos;ve ever played.  Rift?  Not terrible, but the F2P model could be a lot better.  Trion&apos;s support?  Rude beyond belief.  You&apos;ll get banned for weeks/months for saying something &quot;rude&quot; (no cursing, just rude), support reps will insult you and threaten to ban you if you contact them again, and Trion is just about the most money hungry, big game publishing company there is.  I highly doubt this game will get any better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4510188">Expand</a></span>

<br>The real problem is you CAN&apos;T buy the auction licence with gold... so you&apos;re totally gimped and excluded from the economy... tried shouting my goods for hours undercutting the auction house and no one was interested.

<br>This game may not be pay to win but it surely is pay to play... at least a minimum... you can&apos;t have everything just playing... you can&apos;t even complete the scarecrow quest ffs. This + 5 hours queues and motivation to afk ingame is what breaks completely the experience and is what they should have changed to make it more appealing to a west audience. Maybe on korea a lot of people can&apos;t afk because they go to caf&#xE9;s but here we all have pcs... so give me a break and fix this **** refund all money or just scrap it all and re launch it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4509236">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I&apos;ll just address a few of the issues that this game has.
<br>
<br>First, the servers.  Both the Korean and Russian had 20 or more different servers due to how land is handled.  People can setup farms (paid players only) to grow materials or create crafting benches.  Trion however, set up only five servers for each region.  Five for NA, five for Europe.  This meant that there was a huge log in queue even before the game opened up to the F2P players.  Patron players are supposed to be placed in a priority queue, but when the game has only five servers full of Patrons, there will be a queue.  Many patrons sat in queue for upwards of 6 or even 12 hours, and were unable to play.  Many managed to log in, and then get randomly disconnected as well.
<br>
<br>Second, was the patron item bundles, which included gold and gilda stars.  Both are the in game currencies.  Everyone was to receive one pack to their account, which contained items as well as gold.  However, Trion somehow sent some people more than one pack.  Due to massive currency inflation, the game&apos;s economy was ruined before the official launch date.  There were people with multiple plots of land, which they were then reselling for more gold.
<br>
<br>Third was the issue of communication.  People sent in support tickets as some patrons did not get all the items out of their packs, such as the title or gold and so on.  Instead of someone reading their message, they were given a generic message stating that founders packs are being sent out and how to find them.
<br>
<br>Fourth, a fair bit of the content is still not localized or properly optimized.  People with top of the line GPUs complain about textures not loading, and the game is prone to memory leaks regardless of what settings you run it at or the specs you have.  Some content such as NPC dialog is still in Korean.
<br>
<br>Fifth, botting.  Bots can do everything, they can gather resources, maintain a farm, and even do trade runs for gold.  Spam bots are also rampant, because Trion relies on Hackshield (which is more than a decade old and doesn&apos;t stop much).  The way a spambot works is that when you block one, you block the name.  The spambot just needs to go and delete the character, which causes everyone who had the spambot blocked to unblock him, as that name is no longer claimed.  All the spambot does now is remake a character with the exact same name, and repeat.
<br>
<br>How Trion handled all this.
<br>
<br>Trion launched the headstart on the 12th, and then that was pretty much it.  Trion was absent the entire weekend from the 12th till the 15th.  On the 15th, response was limited, and Trion resumed operation on the 16th, the day the headstart ended and the game launched.
<br>
<br>Patron&apos;s who paid for the headstart were ignored.  The economy inflation was ignored.  Communication has been scarce.  And on the day of launch, three more servers were added to NA, bringing it up to a total of eight servers.  Which did nothing for the patron queue, and those who were trying to play the game for free were out of lucky, some have been in queue for 12 hours.
<br>
<br>Server queues are still rampant.  This is because they did not expect a need for so many servers, despite the Korean and Russian versions having 20+ servers.
<br>
<br>The economy is a wreck, those with gold bought up plots of land which they are reselling.  Trion is not interested in addressing this issue.
<br>
<br>Communication is still lackluster.  Trion will instead post happy pictures of their employees with junk food, but not respond to any complaints or issues people have.
<br>
<br>As for both optimization and localization, it&apos;s still &apos;in the works&apos;  Textures don&apos;t load, and dialog from NPCs is still in Korean, and there is no estimate of when it will be fixed.  Dialog will probably come first, as Trion&apos;s staff has not changed anything in terms of optimization since the start of 2014.
<br>
<br>Finally botting.  Trion will rely on hackshield which did nothing in both the alpha and beta.  Reporting a bot however, is grounds for a ban as Trion feels that there can&apos;t be so many bots, especially in the chat or in resource rich areas.  If a person reports too many bots, they can be banned.
<br>
<br>Thoughts
<br>
<br>Trion managed to take a decent F2P and make it pay to win.  However they also managed to make it very tedious and tiresome to play the game, even for patron players, maintaining a farm or gathering feel very tedious.  The economy being ruined on day one meant that trading and selling is not working.  During both alpha and beta, the players informed Trion of issues, which were ignored.

<br>In Closing
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a bit of a sandbox, but the sand is more akin to kitty litter.  Yes you can sculpt and make castles out of the &apos;sand&apos;, but it smells a bit funny and it&apos;s oddly clumping.  You can play with it, but please don&apos;t eat any of it, and wash your hands after touching it.  Then when you realize what you&apos;ve done, you&apos;ll be filled with regret.  Then you realize what those clumps are...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4506390">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I will keep this short and simple, great game, bad dev company. I do not recommend you support these money hungry devs. D3 is still by far the worst launch I have ever experienced, but this one comes so close to it. 4-Day head start I only played for 1 day and BAM.. launch happened thanks to the &quot;DDoS&quot; excuse and the 9hr que.
<br>
<br>Overall, 0/10. Just wait for Soul Blade or something else. I won&apos;t even get started in the P2W market they have. Not as bad as Warframe, but like I said, they are trying hard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4506019">Expand</a></span>

<br>With the numerous issues with the launch and money grab-ish shenanigans Trion has portrayed with this game. I cannot recommend this game to anyone.  I only wish I could of only got a refund on my $150 founders pack when i had the chance. :( . Never buying a trion game again</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4503846">Expand</a></span>

<br>Headstart was a debacle. It was as though Trion had never released a game before.

Add in problems that drop you out of the game or out of queue, and it is a recipe for aggravation.

<br>Headstart was a debacle. It was as though Trion had never released a game before. Now, at launch, queues are hours long before they don&apos;t have enough 1) servers; or 2) capacity on a given server. Add in problems that drop you out of the game or out of queue, and it is a recipe for aggravation.
<br>
<br>Early levels, if you can get in, are grindy, and the quests are uninspiring. There are problems with multiple people turning in quests to a quest giver, so there are lines in games with people waiting their turn to talk to the quest giver. Long lines. There was a problem with the mob tag mechanic, where only the first hit gave credit, so people had trouble finishing what they needed to (this may be fixed; when I get out of queue I&apos;ll find out). These are ten year old MMO mechanic problems that other games have worked out.
<br>
<br>Housing is a big draw, but a lot of the available on land on the servers is already gone.
<br>
<br>Some elements are closer to pay-to-win than I&apos;d like (you can Google search it, so I won&apos;t rehash that).
<br>
<br>If you can get in, and if you can stick it out through the uninspired low level play and boring quest implementation, you can get to some cool PVP, crafting, trading, running a ship, etc. There&apos;s an interesting justice system as well.
<br>
<br>As I said, the core is there to have a good game. Right now, it&apos;s a bit of a mess and not something you want to spend anything on. If you want to play, go f2p and do that until things level off and you can see what the state of the game is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4506063">Expand</a></span>

<br>If your bread and butter is theme park MMOs, avoid this title. There&apos;s a questline that will take you to 50, but it&apos;s only there to get you to 50 easily. The real meat and potatoes of this game is PVP, and an extensive player economy based on player crafting and farming. If you want to participate in the latter half, don&apos;t pretend this is a free to play game and then complain when you can&apos;t do it. If you participate in the former, enjoy a great free to play pvp game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4504317">Expand</a></span>

While all games experience mishaps, bugs, and cheaters at some point in their life, AA is so full of these problems that the game is barely playable in a long-term sense.
<br>
<br>The AA forums had a thread chronicling these problems--over thirty serious, debilitating problems--in just the first few months; and of course this thread was deleted. Innocent players are banned, while guilty players run impunity. Players are leaving in mass, and empty cities and trade runs have replaced the previously everyday server ques. Only the innocent and hopeful remain.
<br>
<br>Sadly, the developers seem to have no intention on addressing these problems, but instead continue to intentionally add to the chaos, by introducing item after item in the cash shop, and thus invalidating previous hard work by dedicated players.
<br>
<br>Like many others, I started out optimistic, then shifted to dealing and coping with the many many issues, and only too late accepted the truth. This game was a lie from the start, and the only smart move is to cut one&apos;s losses and move on as soon as you can.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4777631">Expand</a></span>

Welcome to the meta of unfair advantages in pvp, insane power scaling with absolutely no way to fight someone equal to you in terms of pure stats. It is absolutely pure who forked up the money, sold the items on the AH and bought the best weapons and best armor. Nothing else. I made it to 50, had a farm, Hell I was a guy that forked up the 150 dollars. I was one of those guys that wrecked everyone underneath him with his full craft, top tier gear and I tried once playing on an alt without any of that. Even cheating by giving my alt money from my main I had insane problems with making any progress whatsoever, and every day at level 50 felt like there was no game there. There just wasnt anything for me to do, or to progress even with a guild. The game is stomp people for fun at the end by waving your money in their face. Thats all you have to look forward to in this missed opportunity of a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4728627">Expand</a></span>

<br>ArcheAge is a FREE 2 PLAY (F2P) game, designed mostly for PVP. The game is made by Trion,the company who made RIFT. The game contains amazing graphics.(Cry-engine 3). ArcheAge allows players to do anything they&apos;d like, for example: claiming land, being a merchant, and especially being a fighter.
<br>*Side Note: No ArcheAge is not a p2w game (pay 2 win). it is a completely free game.
<br>
<br>ArcheAge is perhaps one of the worst games you can find out there when it comes to PVP. The system is very unbalanced, due to the amount of stuns players get (AKA CC?) resulting in users unable to fight back, meaning a guarantee lost. Forcing friends to group together in order to survive, in other words forming guilds.
<br>
<br>ArcheAge is a Sandbox genre game, meaning that you are free to do anything you&apos;d like. Such as killing other people, stealing merchant goods, fighting in war, etc. With the amount of places you can travel, making it the perfect sandbox game.
<br>
<br>ArcheAge contains thousands, if not millions of bots roaming around the server. Stealing land from other players (of course players who payed $15), making the Premium Service or Patron Status, not worth it. In fact the chances of even gaining a land spot is below 8%. Bots also advertise on the faction/nation chat every 3 minutes, meaning that players have to block them every 3 minutes which distracts players when playing the game.
<br>
<br>ArcheAge contains possibly one of the worst economy, prices inflate and deflate each day. Weapons can go up to 15 gold, and later in the next day it can become at least 50, or maybe 4.
<br>
<br>ArcheAge has many server issues, for example the Conquest of Auroria has crashed an estimate of 20000 players of each server. The Queue is also a problem, once very while players will be waiting in a 1-hour long line of players trying to log in.
<br>
<br>ArcheAge contains a bad chat system, in these public chats players are always talking over each other, meaning that those who try to ask for help have to wait a long time. Leading them to the customer support center, which is also not satisfying either.
<br>
<br>The customer support of ArcheAge should only be used as a last resource in my opinion. Workers of Trion often do little to no help at all for users.
<br>

I used the word stumbling, because it looks like they can&apos;t even pick themselves up once they have fallen, launch bugs were just the beginning with patron going out to F2P and P2P player which wasn&apos;t intended. They soon after rectified the issue by completely disabling patron, but it took 11 days until I received mine, but that&apos;s just the start of Trion&apos;s disaster. It doesn&apos;t get any better when we soon after Auroria release find out that Trion don&apos;t use private test servers to test patches before release and were all locked out for 14 hours of the latest expansion, those who disconnected 15 minutes after release were able to stay in granted they didn&apos;t disconnect. NA seen the worst of that as the issue was fixed by the time EU seen Auroria release, but many and I&apos;d say over 80% missed out on participating in crucial castle grabbing, which has a great impact on Archeage, due to been unable to log-in for 10 hours while the server was left online which is by far the biggest disappointment in Trion and another 4 while servers went offline for a hot fix.
<br>
<br>Moving onto the game play, Archeage isn&apos;t well known for its PvE content, it&apos;s lack of effort is abysmal, but it makes up for it in other areas like crafting which will keep you hooked for hours on end as it&apos;s a true grind, world boss as-well, being apart of the main guild in Enla and having Kraken on farm status was exciting it was solid!, until we came across another bug, a severe loot bug, which made the corpses of the defeated boss unable to loot and soon after disappear, it has happen on more occasions than not and resulted us in gaining nothing, a bug like this shouldn&apos;t exist at all as it&apos;s game breaking.
<br>
<br>The PvP is entertaining granted you are well equipped as it&apos;s a mix of paper, scissors and rock mechanics, with are very much impacted by your gear as I have solo&apos;d 4 people at once, it&apos;s fun personally, but come late game if you didn&apos;t grind the gear train then you can be assured you won&apos;t enjoy PvP. It&apos;s nice that they are focused highly on world PvP as it&apos;s usually missed on most modern day MMO&apos;s and in a game like this it beats doing one verse one arena as Archeage&apos;s main focus is built around world PvP, so you can say balance wasn&apos;t considered which once again in this game is fine; i&apos;m not one for normalization.
<br>
<br>What lets Archeage down though is it&apos;s rampant blatantly obvious rampant of bugs, hacks and exploits. There&apos;s a range from teleportation, no fall damage to gold generating hacks and APEX/ RNG chest exploits which have been around since launch and only become aware of by Trion with-in the last week, the economy is ruined beyond repair.
<br>
<br>Fortunately this has been the only Trion published game I have played, but it will most definitely be the last. Having stated all the issues with Trion&apos;s/XL games Archeage you are made feeling like you&apos;re dealing with Infestation&apos;s SS Hammer point all over again and it makes you glad were put in the hands of known companies like EA/Ubisoft.
<br>
<br>Leaving advice is it isn&apos;t worth your time or money.
<br>
<br>Graphics: 7/10
<br>Gameplay 4/10
<br>PvP: 9/10
<br>PvE 2/10
<br>Trion/XL games management 1/10
<br>
<br>TL:DR Hacks, exploits, bugs, bad management all round from Trion and XL games, great PvP and abysmal PvE.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4741550">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In a spam of almost 3 month, over 1000 hours, 50k gold I bought thru sites I was able to get the highest grade of weapons currently available thru crafting. Something that is almost impossible for anyone without patronage and the use of illegal sites that sells gold can get in that amount of time I got the best armor and 2H great axe, unless your ready to grind 3 months for only one piece of gear or weapon , don&apos;t brother, quest gear can be good and is aright but never  comes close to crafted items, You get the feel if  you aren&apos;t the monthly sub to need to pretty much only use certain classes although their endless amounts of classes unless you can top tier items which as I said is very taxing for f2p gamers, even with a sub for the game, you are climbing a mountain that XLgames only makes higher and higher for you to get what you want so you can freely and truly have the feeling that you can be anything you want to be in the game. Leveling is a joke. I hit the cap in less then a week. The grind begins when you hit max level with every skill you wish to pursue but it only turns to a chore by the fact that if you want to further develop a skill you need to send time attaining gold, problem is that the game is not even finished a third of the map wasn&apos;t done at launch, now part of it is up but only a part not all of it. Fishing is the only real way of making a profit without have to spend too much gold and time on packs and worrying about the economy which a first it sounds like a good idea have a changing economy based on the laws of supply and demand  but some time is wasted on these things unless you get a merchant ship which, good luck getting  without a army of people helping you, Or you buy the damn thing from someone that can. Even with all my gold  this was one part that was even hard for me, but I got one in the end took 2 weeks of endless runs for the necessary items to get this damn thing. I was very happy when I did get all on my own though, only reason this game is not lower then a 4 for me is cause of the naval combat and ships that the devs  actually took their time to make , sailing is fun and pirating the other continent is really fun, unless you have people from your continent pking other people of your faction which you can do in certain parts of the world that you will need to go thru in order to get most out of commerce.
<br>
<br>To end this, the critics reviews are completely trash this is PAY TO WIN game don&apos;t let no one tell you otherwise, If you were hoping for a game where you can have fun farmvilling, you might be ok if you want to spend a little cash, but if you want to make a good PVX character forget it as I have mentioned all the p2w gamers have the land and AH and crafted items which are hard nonetheless with everything you buy to get so your stuck with a few range, sleath, aoe magic battle skills that are effective in battle, overall this game is not one to waste your time and money, this game is very incomplete and even if you play the Korean version you will see that the developers in that game which has been around longer then the NA version has the same core issues they just left the thing as is and only have added more stuff you can buy add-on for ships and new ships and a few world bosses but they don&apos;t seem to care  about fixing anything. Only how they get a few more bucks off of you, so don&apos;t think they will fix the NA version either, in the story they quit at level 35, their is not conclusion at all they literally just quit the story not happens nothing at all , and the rest of the game is the same way. The only thing they managed to get right is the complex crafting systems which is the craziest I have seen in any mmo. This is Hyuna from the Callei server saying this is it for me , Black Desert is going in for closed beta, get yourself a Korean vpn so you can play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4808106">Expand</a></span>

Oh, and prepare to get ganked a bunch while trying to farm, as most areas aren&apos;t safe zones. PvP and farming don&apos;t mix.
<br>
<br>The PvP is lame as well, as you can &quot;go pirate&quot; and kill your own faction whenever you want. Then you just wait a minute and can un-flag yourself. Got too many crime points for killing your own faction? Drink a couple potions and those crime points are gone!
<br>
<br>You can&apos;t trust anyone, even those on your own faction. You can&apos;t farm or level in peace, as you are forced into PvP in any zone level 30 or higher.
<br>
<br>This game really only caters to the worst kind of PvPers. And you can&apos;t get any land to place your farms.

<br>I like the look of the characters, I like the look of the game.  That&apos;s why it gets a three.
<br>
<br>But; in the zone I started in, there are huge numbers of high lvl players fighting right next to three of the npcs needed for the starting quests.  In a starting city area, mind you.  The one time I was able to overcome the lag enough to target anything in the mob it said I had targeted a &apos;lvl40 practice dummy&apos;.
<br>
<br>What this meant was after the 4 minute process of logging into the game I had to wait another 3 to 10 minutes for actual npc characters to load.  Some of them became targetable before they appeared, but others didn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Any quest involving a cutscene in the towns just kicks you out of the game due to the serious amount of lag.  Once you get past the 4 minute login again, there is a better chance you will get to see the cutscene again.
<br>
<br>Of course, all this is moot anyway, since the game has been down for server maintenance for the last 16 hours.
<br>
<br>All in all, it&apos;s not something I see spending money on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/archeage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4782292">Expand</a></span>
