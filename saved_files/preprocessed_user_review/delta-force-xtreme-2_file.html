The maps are endless worlds that you can navigate through. The guns look and feel &quot;REAL&quot;. I have met many new gamers to play with. If youm think you are a good shooter, try this. I am getting better and having a blast. I&apos;m doing this review because I had to tell others.</span>

While it might not be COD5,Crysis or Fear2 in terms of graphics, old gamers like myself always come back to Nova for our multiplayer fix. Who will -ever- forget the original Delta Force games. Good old Novalogic has been around for so long now, that people sometimes forget what this series of games has given to all of us. Delta Force was the standard set 10 years ago that OFP, Battlefield 1942 along with many others have tried to copy and improve upon. .. While I own and play all the modern engine games, I always come home to Nova for my multiplayer fix. DFX2 is just what the doctor ordered during this drought of FPS games this summer, and I for one am loving every minute of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/delta-force-xtreme-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=425529">Expand</a></span>

The first &apos;warning sign&apos; which the user will notice as to the quality of the game is that there is no real support for widescreen resolutions, despite being a widescreen option in the graphics menu. This was initially surprising due to nearly every new release game supporting it for the past two years, however a look at the graphics engine quickly explained why this so. Put simply, the game looks like it came out five years ago even on the highest settings. Trees are cleanly cut in half when shot at while identical, badly textured enemies abound. This wouldn&apos;t be an issue were it for the gameplay itself being of decent quality, however it is not. The enemy AI is as basic as that of Doom, with the enemies either standing still and shooting (and missing) at the player or running in a straight line towards them, thus making them incredibly easy targets to pick off. There is no recoil in the weapons nor are they even any interesting. Hence, it is possible to merely run forward and shoot at any enemies one encounters without worrying about taking any damage; the one time I did was from an enemy only a meter or so away. The overall feeling is that of playing any generic FPS with cheats turned on; as a result the game has a complete inability to build or maintain any tension or intensity whatsoever. That said, I did have some minor fun with it occasionally, in a &apos;so bad it&apos;s good&apos; kind of way. However, the lack of any challenge in the game means that it gets incredibly boring quickly. Having reasonably enjoyed both the original DF and Black Hawk Down it seems as if this series has finally gone down the drain after circling it with Xtreme, with this one being so bad I was humoured by it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/delta-force-xtreme-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=83209">Expand</a></span>

Nova said &quot;Gotcha&quot; for this purchase. Early Nova games were classics.... this one is too.... classically BAD! Save the $... there are way better fps games out there right now (and more coming) to spend your hard earned cash on.</span>

Most people who haven&apos;t played any Novalogic games really don&apos;t understand this game. this isn&apos;t like Battlefield or World At War, it has it&apos;s perks unlike most games out there. For instance, most games out there don&apos;t let you exit city limits or villages (example&gt; Call of Duty ). We can fly choppers, drive tanks/apc&apos;s, motorbikes and boats. Most other game developers don&apos;t offer those perks. I have been a die-hard Nova Logic/Delta Force gamer and still appreciate the work they do for us followers of the games they develop. I suggest more people get out there and buy the game and enjoy the experience rather than judge the game by its&apos; graphics, they aren&apos;t that bad and it&apos;s a kick ass game!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/delta-force-xtreme-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=425533">Expand</a></span>

Plenty of Free game out there that offer plenty more than this one plus they don&apos;t hit you with hidden cost, Nova wont even let you post on the forums for this game unless you BUY a GOLD membership. All in all, with membership costs, this game will cost you 60 dollars, what a joke for a reworked old game that is worst than the first one they released.

Glad to see a lot of indie guys doing this already. If you have a good graphics card, don&apos;t bother unless the price comes down and you just want a great, nostalgic action shooter w/ a helluva lot of folks to frag. BOTTOM LINE: Until the price comes down you&apos;d be better off getting the original Ghost Recon from D2D. With all the add-ons it&apos;s only $15 and then you&apos;ve still got all the great MODs to play with and a great community.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/delta-force-xtreme-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=82906">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>COD4 lacked in my books, yah it was high def*rolls eyes* but after 15 minutes of play i knew were all the spawn points were and all the good hiding places were.
<br>
<br>i loved DF2 back in the day and still occasionally play it, more updated graphics would be a nice touch but not really necessary.
<br>
<br>me as a player, i would rather have an unlimited multiplayer experience rather than a strong single player experience(which in most cases gets boring after awhile)
<br>
<br>i would recommend this game and all other novalogic games to anyone who is new or old to FPS action.
<br>
<br>just because a game has thoughs shiny up to date 21st century graphics doesnt mean anything. in a way its kind of good that its not graphic hungry, anyone can play even on a notebook that wasnt ment to play games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/delta-force-xtreme-2/user-reviews?user_review_id=84684">Expand</a></span>

Oh and if you want to play on servers that have more than 16 slots you must pay for a &quot;gold&quot; subriction- monthly, that includes privately hosted servers so get your wallet out. Dont worry though, you&apos;ll be lucky to find 16 players online at the same time.
<br> This company is looking to milk it&apos;s few remaining fans (who are still dreaming of the old days of DF) for everything  they got before dissapearing of the face of the earth.
