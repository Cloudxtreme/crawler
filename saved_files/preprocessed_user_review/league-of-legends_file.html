<br>
<br>At this time (beginning of 2013) League of Legends is one of the most popular online games. It has millions of players all over the world, and it just seems to be more and more popular. However, in entirety, this game is not that awesome as everyone thinks, and I guess many of the players know this, but dont admit it.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s actually quite funny because this game consists of 50% &quot;one kind of person&quot;, because in each match I play, there&apos;s always someone who thinks he&apos;s best or is rude because someone else aint as good as he think he is and so on. Childstalk: each time he dies, its not his fault. Either it was a teammate who did wrong or it was because of lag. Silly.
<br>
<br>The game itself is great, but you might get tierd because of the players playing it, being so rude. It&apos;s not like any other DOTA-based game. (atleast not what I&apos;ve experienced)
<br>
<br>However, enough of this, now to the actual game.
<br>League of Legends is considered as a DoTA-clone, but it not as much of a clone, as most other DoTA cones. You get what I mean? Both HoN, DoTA 2 and RoI are more DoTA-clones while LoL being a bit less.
<br>Why? Well the feeling is far from what DoTA was. Not in a bad way though. You have the same map, you do the same thing, but it&apos;s still not an exact DoTA-clone.
<br>
<br>What are the differences? Well here they are!
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- It&apos;s easier because it&apos;s not as fast phased as it&apos;s concurents.
<br>- Easier to learn and play.
<br>- Bigger difference between spellcasters and non-spellcasters.
<br>-
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- Too many people are being rude (not the game&apos;s fault I guess)
<br>- Easier (Being easy can be a consequence for some.
<br>- Bad balanced champions. Some champions can be way more overpowered than others.
<br>
<br>Notes:
<br>What LoL have that differs from what any other DoTA Clone have, but is positive or negative deppending on your own opinion.
<br>LoL...
<br>- ...have smaller map
<br>- ...summonerspells, runes and masteries (like talents and gems in WoW)
<br>- ...much more fancy graphics
<br>
<br>I actually dont have the time to count everything up but if you are intressted in the game anyway, look it up and make sure you like it. Else you should not waste your time on it.
<br>
<br>At the launch of the game, I found it very enjoyable (I would have given it a 7/10), but now it&apos;s far from the same thing. If you&apos;re intrested and want to get into a DoTA based game. I recommend you to check this game out, (it&apos;s free!), but I would recommend you to try out the others first.
<br>
<br>4/10, because it&apos;s far from what I expected in the beginning.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=3087791">Expand</a></span>

You just play and have fun, true fun. But when you start new game, and all these issues comes back, and you haven&apos;t getting fun anymore you wanna stop this for god sake.  Another  think that developers almost every week make some change in balance, that comes in increasing and decreasing champions and items stats, some times changes is good some times it&apos;s can make your favorite champion just useless. All league players know such pains in ass who fall down so much that become just not a &quot;good&quot; choice to play at all. One more think is community, is not growth enough, and i mean not only by the age in my point of view, too many rage, crying, and morons you meet, some times not. I know that in almost every online game, but still. So game is worth a 10 from 10 point, but the issues of the League keep me from that score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=1768349">Expand</a></span>

Core gameplay elements were cut out, either for lack of effort or to dumb down the game such as attributes, creep denying or multiple unit control, while only a couple were added in that I don&apos;t even like, such as bushes or spell vampirism. Many early champions are cut+paste chimeras of old DotA heroes, such as Ashe or Amumu while newer heroes follow a rather straightforward formula of gap closers, auto attack buffs and defensive skill.
<br>
<br>The worst feature of the game is the carrot and stick MMO incentive system, where you must play to earn persistent stat bonuses, new champions and other such bonuses. The reward treadmill these offer help to mask the shortcomings of the game for more casual players who can feel a sense of progression not by becoming a better player, but by having stronger bonuses or champions.
<br>
<br>Ultimately, core weaknesses in the gameplay and grind system can make the game feel dull after a while, when playing I only play with friends and they&apos;ve turned to only playing ARAM in order to spice up the stale gameplay. I&apos;d say the game might be worth playing just to try out various champions, but with the hero rotation and unavailability of heroes to the average player it might be too difficult to. League isn&apos;t as weak an entry into the genre as say Rise of Immortals, but is overshadowed by more complete or compelling MOBAs such as Smite or DotA.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=3287730">Expand</a></span>

Most of the time they have played tons of more games than myself (100 wins against people with 1000&apos;s of wins). Also a solo player does not stand a chance because you will be matched against full premade teams (4-5 players) most of the time. Without friends to play with this is a game that should be skipped.</span>

Leveled 3 different accounts to 30 without losing a single game. Riot has made it obvious that they don&apos;t care about hero balance. HoN on the otherhand is pretty fun with friends while LoL is just full of trolls and BRs</span>

It crashes regularly in many and various ways. Sometimes you can queue for a game then have it crash right before the map loads. There is a &quot;reconnect&quot; button when you reload but it rarely works. The performance of the game is a joke. It consumes so much memory I had to turn the settings down to low to stop it from crashing my computer (which can normally run graphics intensive games at 1900X1200 on high settings - for example team fortress 2) Secondly, the game lacks even the most basic of features that are required. They only recently introduced a draft system which is a basic requirement for this genre of game. There is no built in voice chat so you have to use ventrillo, There are only two maps.<br><br>Thirdly, the pricing structure of this game is absurd. Sure you can technically play for free but you only have access to a random small selection of champions. If you decide to spend some money you can unlock a few more but even having spent 60-70 dollars you still do not own all the available champions. Add to this the fact that new champions are released every two weeks and you end up with a buggy, unfinished, imbalanced borderline scam of a game. Riot&apos;s business model seems doomed to failure as I can only imagine it revolves around housebound man children with too much disposable income who are notoriously fickle and will soon be moving on to the next shiny thing to waste their money on and children who beg their parents for mom&apos;s credit card to keep feeding their addiction to new champions and new skins.<br><br>In short the game looks fun and feels fun after a couple of games but it has no depth and even in it&apos;s shallow waters there is nothing but technical issues, balance issues, and a development team so incompetent they managed to make a game that is less reliable than any other pc release of the last 10 years.<br><br>Overall, this game is a waste of time and has left me regretting the small amount of money I spent on it for such little reward.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=1387599">Expand</a></span>

One of my idiot friends fell for this and has spent 5.8k usd on league so far... I might rate this up to a 5 if they included an all in one package, for one price, like smite did... However, the game is no longer about skill, its about &quot;counters.&quot; Problem is, if you don&apos;t grind using crappy champions or wont spend real money (on a garbage game might I add) you wont be able to counter said OP champions. I am sorry but this is just a piss poor design. Smite is the better option, hi-rez might be a team of inbred morons but at least they made a solid skill based game, compared to this garbage.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=1769181">Expand</a></span>

The game requires almost no skill to play. If you are really bad at DotA, then this is the game for you. Dying accounts for almost nothing in this game - you can die as much as you want and it barely affects which team will end up winning. That is good in the aspect that there is no such thing as &quot;feeding&quot; in this game, since dying doesn&apos;t do anything. But that also means you can&apos;t get &quot;fed&quot;, which is something I enjoyed about doing in DotA. Graphics are terrible. My friend and I played it for a whole week, then went back to DotA, since LoL is terrible. Now, we both play Heroes of Newerth.  The game is free, which it should be since it is so bad. I wouldn&apos;t expect anyone to pay for something like this. And the graphics in LoL is terrible, in case I haven&apos;t mentioned that yet. If you look for the word &quot;fail&quot; in the dictionary, you will see the League of Legends logo next to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=1365782">Expand</a></span>

<br>Cons:
<br>- Most of the community is salty as f*ck and arrogant
<br>- Bad game engine, you could do more things if they updated their game engine but I may be wrong, it&apos;s not much of my area.
<br>- They could update better some things and shouldn&apos;t make so many promises (teemo, warwick, yorick, e t c ), just do it man.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=6559765">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>LoL was the introduction to the LOMA/MOBA/ARTS genre for a huge amount of gamers, and for that it deserves at least a modicum of respect. It&apos;s a serviceable adaptation of DOTA with some quality of life improvements that were sorely needed back when DOTA was still a WC3 mod and Heroes of Newerth was still in development.
<br>
<br>However, in the current age of Dota 2 and HOTS, there is literally no reason to play this game. Dota offers a significantly deeper and more balanced experience, with a totally unlocked hero roster, in exchange for a barely steeper learning curve, while HOTS gives players that want a more casual alternative a faster, more exciting distillation.
<br>
<br>There are also seriously shady things about Riot&apos;s development of League -- for example, the fact that one of Riot&apos;s early employees had control of a major community forum for DOTA, including a subforum for hero ideas, that was shut down shortly after the development of League started. Surprise surprise, many of the hero ideas that were in that thread found themselves incarnated as League heroes a couple years later. It&apos;s very clear that Riot has no original ideas of their own, and instead is devoted to just wringing as much money out of the concepts of DOTA as possible.
<br>
<br>For me, the single fact that the hero roster is not available equally to all players kills the game (as it does HOTS). For proper balance in a Dota clone, you need the ability to pick from all the characters. But even if that weren&apos;t the case, there is literally no reason to play League instead of Dota. The only reason more people haven&apos;t made the switch is the sunk costs fallacy: once you&apos;ve invested money into League, or any game, it becomes a lot harder to justify abandoning it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=7586527">Expand</a></span>

<br>To say this community is the worst of any on line game is being  kind, and RIOT  has given up an policing it, Expect tot be banned if you speak at all,  but do expect racist, verbal abuse, and  large portion of the player base to be there purely to ruin your game, and the punishment system is run by the same players
<br>
<br>I am sorry to see what used to be a good game, unless you plan on never speaking or having someone level up your account for RLM this  game &apos;s community makes it unworthy of play</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=6177225">Expand</a></span>

This game evolves and adapts, as careful balancing from the developers attempts to ensure the highest level of competition at all levels. The skill cap for this game is high.

You play a game that everyone has experienced, talked about, or played. With over twenty-seven million players daily, League Of Legends made by Riot Games is the number one MOBA (Multiple Online Battle Arena) in today&#x2019;s time. This game suits any gender, race, or, ethnicity.  It&#x2019;s easy to learn, and every single game is guaranteed a fun time. Along with all those fantastic attachments, the game is free to play, and virtually any PC or Mac is able to run this beautiful game.
<br>
<br>League like most MOBA&#x2019;S attract to the five versus five gameplay on its main arena Summoner&#x2019;s Rift. It&#x2019;s brightly blue colored and designed with three lanes leading up to each-others base. Pick a lane to go and you&#x2019;ll battle against other players from all over the world with various skill levels and other characters. With the strategically placed bushes you can hide in it and pop out to scare and attack your enemies. There&#x2019;s also a jungle on each sides of the map for each team. These jungles are filled with NPC (Non&#x2013;Player Character) monsters in which you can go and farm up gold and get various buffs. There&#x2019;s always a contemplating feeling to risk going into the enemies jungle and stealing their buffs. The unconscious fears that an enemy lurks just moment&#x2019;s away makes your pulse race. This strategy, being more useful than killing the entire other team; you can kill their jungle and drain the other team from additional gold. This simple gameplay is fun; strategic and overall it never gets boring no matter how much you think it would.
<br>
<br>There are many objectives to this simple MOBA game. You can go destroy the large blue enemy turrets, or you can help increase your characters strengths by getting various dragons that help specific stats to your champion. Or you can slay the big purple worm monster, which is called Baron Nashor. He gives your champion and minions huge buffs in health, damage, and size. The buff makes the game easier to win, but don&#x2019;t be fooled, if you&#x2019;re not strong enough to take on Baron Nashor; you will be slain by him.
<br>
<br>From Jinx a psychopathic pig tailed rocket loving maniac, or Annie, a frightening little girl who&#x2019;s a pyromaniac that has various fire abilities; there are 117 characters to play as. These champions, as the League Of Legends community calls them, have so many memorable quotes and bright colors and each character has a personality that you will fall in love with. You will more than likely find a specific character that you will mainly play. These champions can be bought at two to eight dollars a piece, or there&#x2019;s an option to buy them with in game currency that&#x2019;s easy to acquire. The more you play, the more points you to get put towards characters. On top of all that, League Of Legends has a rotating champion pool in which every week there are ten free-to-play characters you can choose and try a few matches with. You really get a feel for most if not all the characters through this rotating character pool.
<br>
<br>For additional detail, you can buy skins for all the champions. They can get to be a little pricey, but they&#x2019;re definitely worth it. Some can be as two dollars, while others can range up to be twenty dollars. The pricier the skin the more additional particles, graphics, and spell move changes there are. My &#x201C;Spirit Guard Udyr&#x201D; skin changes the entire way he looks and how all of his spells sound, look, and he even has additional voice over quotes. Those skins don&#x2019;t change your gameplay experience or give your character additional buffs. Once you&#x2019;re sick of looking at the same old character game after game; you can pick skins from thirty dollars to as low as two dollars a piece. They aren&#x2019;t required and you can still play the game free of cost by downloading it on Leagueoflegends.com.
<br>
<br>Each match lasts thirty to forty minutes, which you may say that&#x2019;s a long time, but you&#x2019;re consumed by various objectives, team fights, and just in general playing the game; time flies, before you know it an hour has passed. Matches usually start slow and work their way up to fast paced, action packed, fest of non-stop battles against other champions. For the most hectic of all fights; all players on both teams fight each other all at the same time until the last man stands. The players that live through the team fight will more than likely storm the losers&#x2019; base, and take the victory.
<br>
<br>What keeps League Of Legends so refreshing is that it is split into seasons, like your favorite TV show, they throw a plot twist in it. Every eight months Riot Games changes almost everything about the game. They change items, the jungle; basically every season you have to re-learn the game and adapt yourself to whatever changes the company has made. It keeps players coming back every season to check what&#x2019;s new and see what improvements have been made.
<br>
<br>Overall, League Of Legends is a fast paced, hectic fest, and I will be playing this game for years to come.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=6505832">Expand</a></span>

I love this game because it is a complex game that adjusts to your skill level. The one negative about it is the people on the game can sometimes be degrading and some people get bothered by that. But, all in all great game!</span>

There are far too many people who blame others and lash out there frustration on them. It&apos;s a game for **** sake enjoy it.</span>

<br>Although the community isn&apos;t the greatest, that shouldn&apos;t be mixed with how you review the game or look on the game. The toxicity of the league community is definitely frustrating, although all games have people like that, and like most games league provides a mute button.
<br>With all the pay to win business, there isn&apos;t really much of it. The only things that you could buy are champions or runes, both of which you can get for free without the element of luck, gamers these days don&apos;t want to work for better gameplay, they expect to get it from the start, but where&apos;s the fun in that.
<br>The game like all MOBA&apos;s has a difficult learning curve, but if you choose to pick up this game, you would enjoy it, as long as you stick with it for a while all of the toxicity will be something you&apos;re used to. Don&apos;t go off all the reviews, due to DOTA and LOL&apos;s community war, some DOTA fans just want to diss League.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=7231698">Expand</a></span>

Riot do not give chances to people either, they just permanently ban your account even if you were just defending yourself against sexual harassment. The community is just shocking. I genuinely think riot need to fix their community and game and allow players to keep playing that they have permanently banned just to keep bad reviews from happening or to keep money coming. Since how bad they are people can just tell others to leave the game or to never play the game due to the community and people who run the company.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=7366483">Expand</a></span>

The matchmaking in this game is going down the pan and Riot staff don&apos;t want to listen or care about this. The community is mostly toxic and just fling abuse at each other. When you try reach out to Riot to complain about the problems you get ignored.
<br>
<br>I dunno how they think they can run a business the way that they do. The support staff do 0 to help just say we no how it feels. You cant get to speak to anyone else at Riot because you just get ignored. They don&apos;t do feedback or want to pass ideas on because they &quot;cant do that&quot;. All that Riot care about is making as much money as possible and not care about balancing the game, fixing matchmaking and balancing champs

<br>
<br>If you&apos;re a toxic player - listen up - this is not the game for you. Get mad, start to become overly critical of another player or your team who might be letting you down and you&apos;re likely to get trolled/ flamed and then reported to your entire team.  I have spent thousands of hours and at least a $1000 between multiple accounts, all of which today have been simply permanently banned over communications. There is no native in-game chat, so you&apos;re basically forced to communicate through text, if not through a 3rd party program, but unless you&apos;re able to coordinate pregame you&apos;re only able to text. Get mad and say the &apos;wrong&apos; words and your account will get banned. You cannot speak your mind about stupidity and just the overly excessive ban happy players will try to get your account banned all because of communications - bad or good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=7790580">Expand</a></span>

However I simply can not get past the general slowness of this game. The match times are inflated basically due to this. Walking is slow, combat is slow, everything moves at a snail&apos;s pace. You do get currency fairly quickly to buy new heroes if you are at least half decent, and there is plenty to choose from. However they all have a fairly generic feel with few exceptions. Also, after a little over 50 matches I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve gone more than 2 consecutive matches without trolls going off on some offensive rant on me or team mates. Seriously sometimes you feel like you&apos;re playing with the Taliban or ISIS or something. It&apos;s best just to ignore your team all together unless they&apos;re being friendly or you know them already.... unless you&apos;re the type of person who feeds on being trolled on and insulted for minor things. Graphics are pretty much a notch above farmville quality. Sound is okay but not memorable. Control response is fairly abysmal.
<br>
<br>Overall, I give this game a 4 out of 10. It&apos;s got a good concept, but its slowness, community, and lack of responsive controls is a turn off for me. I respect those who enjoy this MOBA, however it&apos;s just not for me and I guess I just don&apos;t &quot;get it&quot;  as to why it&apos;s so popular.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5297284">Expand</a></span>

The start of season 4 was okay, but as time went on, the balance just got worse and the game became even buggier. For weeks after a patch is released champions are constantly getting disabled for bugs entirely unrelated to any changes made. Riot is unwilling to create a new client to replace the ancient  adobe air client. The last mention of a new client was quite a while ago, and the person working on it has since quit from Riot Games. The largest and one of the most competitive games in the world, and they can&apos;t even be bothered to add a replay system. Their excuse for not adding a replay system is that &quot;it creates toxicity&quot;. Really...toxicity? I would entirely recommend playing a different moba like Strife, Smite, DotA 2, or any other moba that has developers that actually care about something other than money and publicity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5501815">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The community is crap too, full of angry arrogant selfish kiddoes ,who start swearing as soon as they make a mistake and die, oh and they want to insta report you for not playing according to their rulebook of how to play,what they checked on some web page and be aware if you want to chance anything up to your liking.
<br>
<br>Originally you could test this and that which made the game much more fun seeing how it turned out not anymore,due to these brainless kiddoes. Every game is more or less the same ,the game is boring and dull.
<br>
<br>Oh one more thing, sometimes they take your favourite champion(which isnt even close to being op) and redesign it so it is doesnt even resembles the original one, fe soraka who should be a healer ,yet she cant heal herself anymore, instead she uses her own health to heal others... what a **** desing no wonder nobody pick her anymore.
<br>
<br>This game maybe looks good and sounds good , you could enjoy it for a month or two , but then it became boring and frustrating. Go try out Smite or even the new Blizzard&apos;s one Heroes of somthing is much more fun , or dota 2 which I heared is much more balanced.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=4925170">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Do you have at least 3 friends you know you will be playing with regularly?
<br>Are you willing to invest hundreds of hours into a game that takes around 30 minutes to finish?
<br>Can you accept that in the best case (if you have experience in competitive games, can work well in a team and respond quickly to the actions of all other 9 players) you will win 55-60% of the games that you play?
<br>Are you able to cope with toxic behavior on a regular basis without engaging in pointless arguments?
<br>
<br>If the answer to any of the above questions is &quot;No&quot;, then please don&apos;t even start playing this game.
<br>
<br>As I mentioned above, if you are good at the game (and statistically half of the players are not good at the game) you will only win a little more than half of your games. The only way you can enjoy this game is by acknowledging the fact that in at least 30% of the games there will be nothing you could have done by the end of the game to help win it. This of course works both ways: In 30% of the games the scale will tip significantly in favor of one of the two teams. As a result 60% of the games will either be an easy win or almost certain loss, leaving only 40% where there is some challenge. This is when you can truly enjoy the game and for some players the adrenaline from those 40% make up for the other 60% of lackluster experience.
<br>
<br>It definitely does not help that because of the competitive nature of the game and the fact that every single person in the team must perform well in order to win the game, the game often ends up in a big argument between the players of the losing team (or sometimes even the winning team) which ultimately hinders their ability to work as a team and makes matters even worse. Even if you don&apos;t take part in those arguments you will be a witness to such behavior constantly, making those 60% even less enjoyable.
<br>
<br>Retrospectively, League of Legends is a game that needs to be played for hundreds of hours to be appreciated but is fun only 40% of the time. Whether you are willing to sacrifice so much of your time for the enjoyment of those 40% is something that you need to decide for yourself. I think a score should represent the enjoyment that one gets from a certain game.  LoL is not enjoyable every 6/10 games and enjoyable every 4/10 games, and as such I give it a 4/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=6054564">Expand</a></span>

Basically when I originally reviewed this game I summed it up by saying &quot;Its pretty good but dont bother unless you have 4 friends to play with&quot;. But now many things have changed for the worse to the point where its worth a new review.
<br>
<br>Firstly ive been playing this game since its creation and I can say without any doubt the current state is the most unbalanced the game has ever been in its history. The current state of balance is laughable at best.
<br>
<br>This leads nicely into the second point, there are 128 champs as of writing but only about 20 are actually viable for competitive play. This can easily be seen in game. With every game featuring mostly the same champs from the pool of 20 viable ones. The last 10 games I had for example I saw a Yasuo in all but 3 and in those 3 he was banned, a Mundo banned in 6 played in 3, Illaio banned in all but 1, Fiora banned in 5 played in 3. Oh and dont even think about picking one of the non viable champs unless you want to get flamed so much you set on fire.
<br>
<br>Leads me into my 3rd point, the game has never had a good community, its always been ban. It comes with the territory but as of writing the player base is appalling. Its simply now at the point where I mute everyone at the games start if im playing solo que. But I wouldn&apos;t recommend playing solo que anyway, Full team pre made only if you want to get the most out of this game.
<br>
<br>To sum it up I used to play 3-4 games a day and during the early period I actually put money into the game, Now I play 2 maybe 3 games a week with a full team. I have not spent a single dime on the game since those early days and I will not be spending any more on the game, until its fixed both technically and balancing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=4857603">Expand</a></span>

LoL had its best times in season 2, but since then continually got worse. I was deep into the pro scene and ranked at high platinum, so I do have some insight into the game.
<br>First off, this game is rather easy to get into if you compare it with other MOBA&apos;s. The reason why most MOBA players consider LoL rather &quot;easy&quot; is because the gameplay is very straightforward. It removed things like denying (killing your own creeps), destructible environment (trees), different shops etc. compared to its spiritual ancestor &quot;DotA&quot;. Which is not a bad thing at first. The problem however is, that the developers removed every other demanding tactical element of the game one after one:
<br>-New champions and reworked older champions become one trick ponys; almost no champion allows different playstyles anymore because there is one way of building/playing him that makes all alternatives pointless. Players call this &quot;meta&quot; and Riot (the developers) more and more enforce said meta, which I consider a bad thing, since it strongly limits your playstyle, forcing you into roles, itembuilds, etc.
<br>-The itempool is extremely limited at the moment. Compared to DotA, the items in LoL lack some form of uniqueness. Over the past seasons, the developers continually removed items that were out of line or too weak. Newer items were useless in most cases. There are items that simply do nearly the same thing, with one item being superior however. There are items that just fit certain roles and types of champions too perfectly. All this leads to a poor diversity in itembuilds: You will see ADC&apos;s build the same items in 9/10 cases, you will see midlaners build one of two itemcombos 10/10, you will see toplaners get the same 2 items in 9/10 cases. Junglers and supports get enforced on specific &quot;support&quot; and &quot;jungle&quot; items, as even the developers call them. And at least 30% of the items you will almost never see built by any semi-experienced player.
<br>This combined leads to overall very thin item diversity between all players that played enough games to understand at least a bit of the meta, and increasingly thin champion diversity the higher the level of play is. As an example, within a typical week of LCS, the eSports league of the game, you will see (from a pool of 120 champions) around 60-70 of them being not picked at all, 30-40 of them being picked 1 or 2 times, and around 20 being picked or banned almost every game. This differs between roles aswell, midlane and jungle have the most &quot;viable&quot; champs, while there are at the moment only 3-4  viable toplaners and marksmen. This is because of serious issues in balancing. The game designers fail at balancing at a reasonable level, which is why you will see certain champions being catapulted up and down in strength on every patch, which happens way too often. Why spend money on a skin for a certain champion when he can become completely unviable or reworked within the next month?
<br>Also, the developers flattened out the champion power overall compared to &quot;DotA&quot;. You wont see any gamebreaking abilites, extreme manacosts or 1vs5 hypercarrys when extremely fed. This is at first not a bad thing, as it leads to a higher need for teamwork, but it also has disadvantages: The game is sometimes too forgiving, and a vast portion of tactic in laning phase is removed, often reducing it to pure mechanical skill. Especially the current meta in pro play is extremely boring, super safe lanes that do nothing but farming gold from minion kills until the 20 min mark, and then the game breaking down in 2 or 3 importan teamfights. (for example the developers made it unworth to get objectives (epic monsters and towers) in early game, even when most of the community and pro players told them it was a bad idea)
<br>All this champion and item problems lead to the developers only being able to balance the game by numbers, which often results in said meta enforcing and poor diversity.
<br>Other aspects of the game:
<br>
<br>+ paying model is fair and functional
<br>+ runes add to strategy and diversity
<br>+ the eSports scene is big and accesible
<br>+ the game is especially fun with friends and has some different gamemodes for casual players
<br>+/- graphics look more and more stale, being mostly unupdated since 3 years, but the game runs very smooth as a result
<br>- the community is at least 50% immature flamers that all want you to get cancer on doing a mistake, report you if you play bad and all did your mom
<br>- the developers dont really care about the community, especially on the EUW shard. The forum has almost no developer communication at all.
<br>- the servers have frequent problems
<br>- more and more players consider the game to be on a downhill trend, also some retired pro players
<br>- event content is more and more often effortless
<br>- the banning system is poorly functional
<br>- the air client is outdated and unstable</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=3970024">Expand</a></span>

This game is a highly competitive one and requires putting time and effort into learning it. It demands more than a casual approach if you want to fully enjoy the game. League of Legends doesn&apos;t have a competitive scene with year round tournaments sponsored by big companies with attendance in the thousands in each event for nothing, and it doesn&apos;t get its praise from what the users describe as &quot;bad graphics&quot; or &quot;that one guy on your team who thinks he&apos;s better than everyone&quot;. Part of the challenge is prevailing despite this one team mate, often not limited to just ONE team mate.
<br>Not everyone is built for this game, as it requires many countless hours to learn and an even greater number of hours still to master. I highly recommend this game for people who are looking for a challenge and don&apos;t back down at the first sign of intimidation and frustration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=4436345">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Then I realized after playing for a while that all of the champions were pretty much the same damn thing with different colored lights coming out of their hands/swords/guns/etc. The only real difference is that some are stronger/weaker than others, so they&apos;re imbalanced, which shouldn&apos;t be the case in a game such as this.
<br>
<br>Also, the same two maps over and over again? Grinding the same map(s), with similar characters, over and over again, for weeks, in order to level up, in order to do the same thing again, endlessly, all with a bunch of whiny, immature brats?

<br>
<br>When champions have to be individually purchased how can the game be balanced? The playing field isn&apos;t level unless you want to drop a few hundred dollars or you play for 2-3 years straight to earn all of them.
<br>
<br>Whenever Riot releases a new champion it now costs even more regular IP to purchase, promoting the use of dollar purchase. How can a game be balanced when the business model is to make appealing champions for purchase? Of course these new heroes will be unbalanced!
<br>
<br>This is a small fraction of the problem, others include: community, matchmaking, terrible client, server latency, trolls, abusable report system, surrender option that ruins attitude of players, EXPENSIVE champions, balance issues, outdated graphics, boring champions (abilities are VERY repetitive and generic), AND WORST OF ALL they have ruined the genre with masteries/runes/and &quot;summoner spells&quot; that give players a free escape  1 ability on a long cooldown.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=3764005">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Its laggy! The EU West Server laggs horrible. There are days where u have to wait more than 90 minutes in the login queue
<br>-Its unballanced! Every new champ is overpowerd when its released and gets nerfed after a few days or weeks. So that everone buys him with real money
<br>-It kinda &quot;pay to win&quot; (not much, but a little bit). There are champion skins (which u need to buy with real money) that have animations on there spells which are neraly impossible to see. So an enemy cant dodge them.

<br>Unbalanced. Well, at first you think that all champions have strenghts, but with the time you realize that there are just 3 champions on every role that outperforms the entire champion pool and are totally broken, a bad player with an extremely op champ can easy win against an average player with a mediocre champ.
<br>
<br>The game is just fun when leveling and learning or playing with friends, when you try to play seriously and meet the community in rankeds and realize that the game is just bad, the gaming experience becomes horrible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=4264396">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m 27 years old and this is literally the most toxic game I have played, great potential but they have gone about it all wrong, I received a suspension for nothing and no proof providing, not even perma ban but I uninstalled and throwing in the towel not worth the lost time, money and frustration. Way more fun games out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5743772">Expand</a></span>

Then you come to the player aspect. I have NEVER been so disrespected SO often for NO REASON!! People ruin your games for fun, go into ranked with the soul purpose of leaving or feeding. Now, and this is my favorite. THIS GAME IS FULL OF CHEATERS/SCRIPTERS FROM THE GROUND UP!!! They only just recently added a report feature to bring up cheating. Some Champions have 5 or 10 skins, when other champions have an alternate that came out with the champion. They update features, without even considering that the updates they make might affect other aspects of the game for the worse, and trust me...they generally always affect the game for the worse. Instead of League of Legends, compared to heroes of the storm....this game is filth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=5998243">Expand</a></span>

This game has an amazing community, people never yell at you while they allow you to pick any champion you want despite it being picked 3 times already on the team. Champion design is amazing as well, I like how well developed female chars are and how deep their personality is. All in all, best game ever without any doubt.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=3298401">Expand</a></span>

Kallista is totally op, mostly because Riot broke their own champion design rules, giving Kallista incredible support and mobility. What&apos;s even worse, her ulti which saves a teammate or throws them close to an enemy can also cc. You cannot do anything against Kallista in lane because she just jumps around and makes favorable trades. She can easily dodge skillshots with her jump and there is no way to trade efficiently because of her pop skill. The sad thing is Kallista gets stronger in lane with levels.
<br>
<br>Thresh and Tahm are top support champs right now. Thresh is still completely broken. It makes tower diving and ganking much much easier, but he can still hook and zone and deal tons of damage... Tahm has a similar problem where they can just do too much, the cheap giant shield is ridiculous, he already teleports like tf onto someone and throws its teammate at them AND has the ability to slow and stun from range....
<br>
<br>Everyone complains about Darius and I figure it&apos;s just the numbers might just be a bit too high. His skillset is high reward and he has no gap closer. I don&apos;t play League of Wards rip League of Legends but it&apos;s damn boring right now, even the tournament games. Rip sona love how they nerfed you and introduced Thresh. Elise and Rexxar are still op too. You gotta love Riot&apos;s ability to give new champs an ever-better skillset</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=2927269">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I started playing, and yeah, it was okay. I got better, and had some fun because I had friends to play with, but once I started doing solo matchmaking, the game started to show it&apos;s true colors. Riot has to be by far the worst company in terms of game development that I have ever seen people take seriously. I got a DotA 2 beta key, saw what a real free to play game is, and going back to LoL to try and have fun like I did back then is near impossible. Just to list some of the reasons:
<br>[1]Riot&apos;s paywall: every character in the game costs a large amount of in-game currency, or about $10 in real money
<br>[2]Balance: it&apos;s non-existent. I see the same set of champions every match, not because people have fun playing them, but they&apos;re the easiest to stomp the enemy team with. Every major patch changes the balance, and Riot always has at least 1 champion that&apos;s not played very often, made overpowered so that people will buy them with real money.
<br>[3]Bugs: they&apos;re everywhere, the biggest LoL tournament in the world had a champion banned from being played because they found a game-breaking bug on him (Aatrox)
<br>[4]Bandwidth use: it uses Pando Media Booster, which is basically a torrent application that runs in the background. It eats up bandwidth like a starving rodent, and it has to be uninstalled or it will always run without you knowing.
<br>[5]It uses adobe air: That&apos;s right, the client runs adobe air. It&apos;s 2014, and a platform that should have died almost a decade ago is still used by these people. It looks bad, it runs slow, and it&apos;s some minor bugs that are still quite annoying.
<br>[6]EXTREMELY limited game engine: if you&apos;ve ever played an RTS, or DotA, you&apos;ll notice some of these issues right away. You can only move your hero, and no creeps or pets have abilities that are castable. And the game has no pause function, or voice chat system, which are really importand for communication and waiting for someone to reconnect (their servers have connection issues, and they blame them on Comcast for the American ones regularly)
<br>
<br>These are problems with the actual game, I&apos;m not even going to bother with talking about the community, or Riot&apos;s dealings with people in the past because that&apos;s not really related to how the game plays, mechanics wise. Avoid this game like the plague if you&apos;re looking for something that has anything good to speak of.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/league-of-legends/user-reviews?user_review_id=4093296">Expand</a></span>

It is really addicting and the game works pretty well multiplayer due to the small amount of players and easy spectating.
<br>the thing is, how do you actually get good at this game? most games it makes sense, you understand the underlying strategy and improve a few useless skills (reflexes, aim, memory). in LoL though you have to learn how to position yourself with a tiny window of view and clunky controls, memorize other champions skillset and counters, use reflexes to last hit, and multitask watching the minimap, creeps, and enemy team. its a **** of random **** the teamfights are also extremely confusing with it being almost impossible to tell what is going on until it is over. so why is it fun to play? it seems that because of the almost random mechanics caused by champion counters, snowballing, lag, random teams, and no one paying attention to itemsets, everyone can do extremely well or extremely bad, so everyone gets the chance to be a pentakilling 50/0 champ. and because of human nature people only remember how good they can be. making it fun to play for everyone, because everyone thinks they are good at it.
