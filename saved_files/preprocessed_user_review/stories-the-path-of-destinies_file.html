<br>a hack and slashy choose your own adventure book
<br>Stories The Path of Destinies tells the many stories of Reynardo, 25 to be exact
<br>The game introduces itself with the hack and slash gameplay tutorial..
<br>There&#x2019;s beautiful levels waiting to be explored with chests full of crafting materials and enemies ready to be picked for their xp.
<br>When you&#x2019;ve gathered enough materials for a weapon you can go to a workbench and craft it or upgrade it&#x2026;
<br>fairly simple stuff&#x2026;and as you defeat enemies you gain xp to level reynardo up..
<br>when you level up you can stop at an alter to learn a new skill such as dash, or increase your health, as well as collect gems to give your weapons and skills a boost&#x2026;
<br>The gameplay is super basic&#x2026;
<br>on its own nothing special at all..
<br>The magic in this game comes from the story telling&#x2026;
<br>your entire journey is being narrated.. and at the end of a level you get to make a choice.. after doing this 4 times, you go through the final level and receive an ending..
<br>but this isn&#x2019;t thee ending..
<br>you used your choices to find out the truth about an artifact or a character..
<br>The pages flip backwards and the story starts again..
<br>take your choice and strategically make other choices to uncover the truth about something else&#x2026;
<br>once you&#x2019;ve uncovered the 4 different truths with 24 possible different endings the book starts over one last time for you to take what you&#x2019;ve learned from these 4 truths and use this knowledge to take the right path towards the definitive ending
<br>I love this idea and love the fact that I can play through the story 24 times to hear new jokes, and hear how different choices play out..
<br>In fact I was almost certain the story telling and narration was good enough on its own for the gameplay to not even matter&#x2026;
<br>Luckily the variety of choices can change up sections of the levels you see&#x2026;
<br>the sword upgrades for example will unlock matching element doors that you couldn&#x2019;t go through before just to change your path up a bit&#x2026;
<br>But by time I got to my 4th story run out of 5 I was pretty much over the gameplay&#x2026;..
<br>It&#x2019;s far too repetitive to play for a possible 25 hours to see and hear all there is&#x2026;
<br>A fast forward summary option would&#x2019;ve been greatly appreciate for skipping a choice you&#x2019;ve already made in a certain sequence&#x2026;
<br>for example&#x2026; I&#x2019;d much rather not have to play the same 3 choices 2 times in a row just to see a different ending... and then do it all again this time changing the third choice.. And again changing the 3rd and 4th&#x2026;
<br>I&#x2019;ve heard it all&#x2026; give me the credit
<br>I loved the story telling and the idea of having to learn from your mistakes of past playthroughs...
<br>but ultimately there isn&#x2019;t enough in the gameplay department to keep me hooked long enough to see it all&#x2026;
<br>I give
<br>Stories: The Path of Destinies an 7.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stories-the-path-of-destinies/user-reviews?user_review_id=6293346">Expand</a></span>

<br>Why 5/10 then? Reeks of console. It&apos;s a PC port and it&apos;s terrible to play with mouse and keyboard.
<br>You can&apos;t even remap keys to make your life a bit easier.
<br>Fortunately I had this game with a bundle so didn&apos;t spent that much money.
<br>If you don&apos;t mind to handicap yourself with a controller then it might be fun.</span>

I liked the game as it has a choose your adventure like game, and it gives you freedom onto your choices, to let you play it out how you wish to. I honestly hate the movement speed and you start dashing all over the place just to try to get a move on, and having 5 islands max, each of them ending in the exact same way just gets boring really quickly. however, i honestly feel that the story makes up for that, and though the combat is mash square to win while making sure to counter everything, it&apos;s pretty fun to play. great for a relaxing time(which is actually hard to get nowadays, with most games being fps and for hardcore like gamers) and a good story, the controls are tight, the graphics are good for the ps4(though I would love to see the characters more, they&apos;re so tiny!) It honestly reminds me of SolaRobo with the art style, just a bit however, personally it&apos;s a good game, but not the best game I have ever played. If you want a more casual, laid-back game, that has a great story to pass your time, play this game. but don&apos;t binge play it, play it one or two of the paths at a time, or the levels will get really tedious, really quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/stories-the-path-of-destinies/user-reviews?user_review_id=6907938">Expand</a></span>
