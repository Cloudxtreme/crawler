<br>Most levels have been designed well and the game is really fun to play. Even for the veterans of the genre. However there are certain spots in some levels which require what I&apos;d call &quot;trained eye&quot; to pass. It isn&apos;t a fundamental fault in the game but some people might think that it&apos;s a fault in the level design. There&apos;s a slight learning curve associated with the game.
<br>
<br>The game lacks proper integration with the Steam. There are no achievements, no Steam cards, and no support for SteamOS/Linux and/or OS X. Also the graphics settings menu uses slightly obscure English which makes it bit difficult to adjust the graphics to look as good as possible and requires bit of trial and error. There is also no global Steam scoreboard which means you cannot compete with your friends in ladders.
<br>
<br>All in all REDUX is a really fun shoot em&apos; up. It doesn&apos;t offer anything new to the genre but rather plays it safe by making sure that all the basic fundamental things are executed as well as possible. If the developers had added proper Steam integration and ladders then it would be solid nine out of ten in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/redux-dark-matters/user-reviews?user_review_id=5204920">Expand</a></span>
