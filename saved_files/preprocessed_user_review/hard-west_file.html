It has very few flaws when it comes to programming, especially the AI.
<br>
<br>The combat system is a relatively blatant copy from the new X-COM - personally i still prefer games with systems that give me more freedom, but i guess for the commercial success it is better to make the system as easy to understand as it is here.
<br>
<br>Now to the negative parts:
<br>
<br>No saving, only checkpoints. I could live with &quot;no saving in combat&quot; to avoid &quot;save-scumming&quot; - but on the other hand i think that it is better to let the customer decide if he wants to &quot;play fair&quot; or not when it comes to single player games. But what really bothers me with the checkpoint system is that i can&apos;t test out things. Yes, if i get two options i love to see how both would end up - and honestly, i don&apos;t want to play all the way up to that scene of choice again. Please, dear companies, let us users save before making decisions. Offering a Checkpoint-Mode (No saving, but no permadeath) as middle-ground between free saving and &quot;Ironman&quot; (No saving and permadeath) is okay, but please don&apos;t force this upon the players.
<br>
<br>The next point is that there is no character development when it comes to numbers - yeah, sure, there is a lot character development when it comes to the story and the background of the characters, but there is no character or at least inventory development as there is in XCOM, Jagged Alliance or Silent Storm - and that is really something i miss in this game.
<br>
<br>Character/Inventory/Research development were always the most interesting things in the aforementioned titles - often i caught myself intentionally avoiding to drive the story forth so i could develop my characters first, research everything i wanted or manage my inventory to a point where i felt i was ready to move on in the story. In Hard West, sadly there is only the story as the only development you have.
<br>
<br>The chapters are so short that i honestly didn&apos;t care at all about my characters developing or what choices i made in the game, because i always knew that the chapters are way to short to make any of those things meaningful. This makes the game feel hollow - it even makes it hard to really keep me motivated to go on playing.
<br>
<br>I really hope that if there will be a sequel to this game, Gambitious tries to not chop it into several small, mostly independent parts, but keeps it as a whole and lets us transfer at least something of whatever we achieved in the last chapter into the next one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-west/user-reviews?user_review_id=5834489">Expand</a></span>

<br>-Difficulty is quite serious. For now, hard feels actually hard. Far harder than Dragonfall on very hard or Wasteland 2 on ranger in Arizona
<br>-AI seems decent. Enemies are good in flanking. Usually when enemies are leaving cover they do it to make more damages to the player(at least it looks so).
<br>-No hp sponges. 2-3 bullets and both enemies and players die
<br>-First mission after tutorial has a good encounter design. (defending a house)
<br>-There is a possibility to start the tutorial as a tutorial or as a normal mission. There is written a promise that it is short and to the point which is true. The best part: if player declines playing it as a tutorial then he must deal with a quite strong opponent on the start which is not attacking during tutorial:)
<br>-As most enemies and player can&apos;t stand more than 2 hits, positioning is vital. Fighting is deadly and fast. Enemy can quickly turn tables with a good shot.
<br>-Encounter design is fantastic. Had a rescue mission which looked as it was supposed to be done with minimal killing. Game respected my choice to kill everybody and after eliminating everyone on the map mission was successful without a need to complete an objective of opening the prison doors. Had an optional mission which starts the player surrounded and outgunned. It was thrilling and challenging. Maps are small, often reused, but different enemy placement makes encounters feel distinct.Big number of covers and hight places offers many approaches on how to tackle objectives.
<br>-Ricochet ability is fun.
<br>-Luck mechanic is really interesting. It works as a mana pool for abilities, but it protects from being hit. The more severe a hit chance is the more luck it takes to stop it. Luck is automatically used for that purposes. Being hit and losing hp replenish some of it.
<br>-There is some environment manipulation. Could open wells doors to improve its cover. Environment can be destroyed like windows.
<br>-Abilities are presented as cards which can be assigned to characters. Looks like 1 ability cannot be used by 2 different characters. You can take 5 of them on missions. Depending on which one you have chosen, you can get a passive buff on top of their standard uses. I suppose those bonuses are poker inspired.
<br>-Rotating camera is horrible. Don&apos;t understand why they can&apos;t bind it to the mouse. It&apos;s worse than Wasteland 2 camera. Also when the enemy from different hight attack, camera should change the height, now it is always on the same level when it was left during player turn.
<br>-Height seems to influence aim and range.
<br>-Enemies can do overwatch. It looks player cannot use it. I had many times when I was begging for overwatch.
<br>-The biggest surprise: CYOA. This part is good enough it would be acceptable if it was a game in itself. There are many C&amp;C moments which actually include consequences! Game autosaves, so I didn&apos;t retry anything but results were enough specific it seems highly unlikely both options led to the same outcome. In scenario I played the main goal was collecting gold, which was quite complex with many tools, ways to do it and hidden mines. Got even an optional mission.
<br>-Writing and story are really good. Love the character of the devil who is a mysterious, well dressed gentleman who appears and disappears on the whim tempting people.
<br>-Game has a nice aesthetic and art direction.
<br>-Looks like there are secondary objectives/consequences to missions (having to pay gold if hired merc dies)
<br>-Always had luck with bugs but so far haven&apos;t encountered any. Enemies think a little too much before turn. Game runs smooth, but I have a good pc.
<br>-There is an ironmode and a mode in which being low on hp gives debuffs, but there is more xp.(or skill points, whatever is used)
<br>Had a good feeling when buying it, but (as for now) it surpassed expectations. I recommend this.

It is very repetitive and the interactions except for the combat has no challenge to them at all: Even in hard difficulty, you may run low on food but you just click on &quot;search for food&quot; button and you got food now. You can easily have 1000$ and not be able to spend it because everything is too cheap.
<br>
<br>UI is hard to understand and you cannot zoom in to and out of the map. I do not understand this game. After 3 hours of pushing buttons I am giving it up.
<br>
<br>On the positive side the game goes with a story, with good music and a deep-voiced storyteller, and I want to keep on playing and see where the story goes. But unfortunately I can&apos;t. Because even though this is my fav genre, I am bored to death.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-west/user-reviews?user_review_id=5902685">Expand</a></span>

If you don&apos;t wont character development then don&apos;t do  it. Putting cards is just checking the box. And luck system?! What&apos;s the point of it? All the special abilities spend it and the only way to get it back is to be shot!?! Consequently I never used any of them. Not that I ever had the need since most of them are highly situational or gimmicky at best. Also having loosely connected  scenarios instead of a full campaign is also lazy, and aforementioned nice presentation can&apos;t hide it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-west/user-reviews?user_review_id=5828779">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is fine, but it becomes rather &apos;meh&apos; before too long. In fact it&apos;s so average that I thought about writing a longer review, but lost the will to do so mid-way. Kind of what happened when I was playing the game.</span>

But instead of that meticulous tactical western game, Hard West is a less demanding collection of unconnected wild west scenarios, all of them appropriately Oregon Trail-y dark and dismal.
<br>You get to play settlers trying to protect their families from bandits and other staple western scenarios. But you also get to play a mad scientistst and other peculiar people. And the game play is pretty good I thought. As you would expect, the combat is cover-based and there is a large variety of abilities and weapons for you to use. But because it is not one large campaign, the RPG part of the game suffers a bit. There is no direct looting either, so the battles are just battles. There is no need for inventory management during them, and you will be focused on either killing enemies or using and looting items on the map. The world maps are loaded with locations of various kinds. Some are shops, some are battles and some are quest related locations. During your travels you gather cards, which you can combine in your inventory for bonuses. It&apos;s weird but alright I guess. What I do miss a bit is a leveling process. But then again, since you&apos;re playing isolated scenarios this isn&apos;t really needed I suppose.
<br>The writing is good though and the game looks and sounds appropriately Wild West. So although it is a bit oddly designed in places, Hard west is a game it is easy to recommend to anyone who likes wild west games. It isn&apos;t perfect, and indeed is missing some staple features of most tactical turn based games. So it might not be for everyone.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>- Action packed with lots of things to do.
<br>- A good amount of scenarios to keep one entertained.
<br>- Nice graphic and sound design.
<br>- Classic tactical game play.
<br>- Good writing and narration. Grim and dark though, so steer clear if you like things happy and cheerful.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- No grand campaign, multiple smaller scenarios instead.
<br>- Poor performance, at least on my PC. Takes a lot of RAM to run and is occasionally slow to respond.
<br>- Weak RPG elements, lack of inventory and character control in places.
<br>- Lack of a zoom function.
<br>- Rather stupid and silly (also blind occasionally) enemies make things pretty easy.
<br>
<br>Pro and/or con, depending on one&apos;s tastes:
<br>- Rather....weird for a western game. In the second scenario I played a comet had made the entire community insane, and as a scientist it was my task to make them sane again with a sanity machine. Just weird all round. At one point during this mission, one of the Pinkerton agents who was assisting me turned into a demon. So that was weird too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hard-west/user-reviews?user_review_id=6875160">Expand</a></span>
