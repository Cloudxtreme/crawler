<br>
<br>The gameplay isnt something new. If you played Dishonored, you&apos;ll feel familiar with the game. One let down is that you can only either instantly kill your enemy or suck blood to get &quot;mana&quot; to use powers.
<br>The enemies arent really smart, they follow the same route, so you just have to wait until they turn and kill them.
<br>
<br>In the end, this game could be a success, but it isnt. I&apos;m not saying that this game totally suck, it has some good things, but you should not pay so much for a game when you have better options (Dishonored has better graphics, better mechanics and better story for instance)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3263780">Expand</a></span>

Upon beginning the game, I realised a few things. 1. This feels a lot like Hitman: Blood Money 2. This looks a lot like Walking Dead and 3. This game has managed to combine Hitman and Walking Dead, take all the life and fun from both of them and charge you $40 for it. This game has you playing as a stealthy assassin...vampire. Which is already a poor decision, the devs for this game should&apos;ve noticed the irreversible pussification of vampires at the hands of the Twilight franchise. As a blood-sucker, you wield, what was said to be an arsenal of powers, is actually about 6 or 7 different powers with 3 or so passive ones, that can aid you in your missions. They are fun to use for about 3 minutes, then they just get boring. This is a grand example of a game that has a brilliant concept and so much potential, but is so poorly executed. Game play is extremely boring and repetitive there&apos;s really no motivation for you to keep playing, story is unoriginal and uninteresting, voice acting has been painfully forced with all but one or two characters so far, enemies, rather than looking around for anything suspicious, will walk back and forth between programmed routes, which is more often than not, a bloody straight line, just waiting for you to use the same 2 or 3 animations to kill them. Other than their &apos;routes&apos;, enemies also can&apos;t spot you if you are more than 10 metres away from them, or even better, they cannot see you if you are right around the corner...hiding behind a clear glass wall. This game is unfinished. That&apos;s really all there is to it. What&apos;s worse is the price tag. 40 dollars?! Seriously!? That&apos;s insulting. It&apos;s frustrating that I&apos;m forced to live in a generation that creates games of this calibre and then prices them like that. My mistake was in buying it on release day, rather than wait for some reviews to come out. Hopefully, you won&apos;t make the same mistake I did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3262895">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Cons: 1.Obviously overpriced
<br>2.Standard graphic
<br>3. Not enough characters and places to make a good story
<br>4.Ridiculous gameplay mechanics, e.g. sometimes it&apos;s frustrating when you want to quickly kill an enemy near a corpse because the kill and drag enemy dead body button is same
<br>5.Every characters talked like they doesn&apos;t need to breathe because of the gapless dialogue
<br>6.Mediocre sounds
<br>7.There are PDAs to collect and few side quest but you don&apos;t have a journal to keep it in mind
<br>8.Limited save (only 2 on normal difficulty) regardless how big is the area
<br>
<br>Conclusion: though i&apos;m able to enjoy some parts of the game, it&apos;s not worth the price and not worth to be recommended unless you really want it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3289864">Expand</a></span>

<br>The animation and look of the game looks like an old xbox (original) game.

<br>The sneaking element doesn&apos;t make any sense. If you go behind the enemy and do an attack to instant kill them, it doesn&apos;t make noise for others to hear (Even though it makes a huge noise for the player).  However, grabbing them to drink their blood (which makes no noise when you do it) alerts nearby enemies).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3271871">Expand</a></span>

And its true, It has some good elements but there are so many mistakes and so many things copied from other games, trough game you will find yourself saying, i saw this in another game and this in that game etc. Not a total blow but still not good.</span>

Teleportation, distraction, domination, confusion and even using shadows to kill someone from a distance. The stealth is pretty well done, being comparable to other good sneakers before it like Thief, Splinter Cell and so on. It&apos;s let down a little bit in that department by enemies not being able to follow you past area borders, so you can be cheap and run back to the last area until the alarms die down if you screw up (which is tempting with the limited saves per area).
<br>
<br>The good parts are that stealth is done very well, if you like Max Payne&apos;s noir feel then the story feels quite decent too [see below for a couple of exceptions] and it looks quite pretty with its Borderlands style artwork and some nice lighting effects. When I first saw some of the trailers I was unsure about the combat mechanic of everything being an insta-kill, but they made it work.
<br>
<br>The game is let down by a few minor issues: it doesn&apos;t really take good advantage of some of the things you can do with the teleport ability like being able to bamf up or down levels in an area. Generally the levels are quite well designed, but given what they let you do, they could have done better in my opinion. Secondly their enemies tend to be quite tightly clustered, meaning it&apos;s quite difficult to play with stealth as your primary mechanic and end up having to kill people. I know, you&apos;re a vampire, you need blood and stuff, but when presented with a sneaker I feel like I should play it like a sneaker first and a vampire second.
<br>
<br>There were two pretty big annoyances in the story. One is the ending being a bit of a let-down, climactically with a super lame boss battle. At least it&apos;s short. The second comes right at the beginning when you&apos;re told that people who are killed by vampires but not given their sire&apos;s blood are destined to become mindless ghouls... then you spend the entire freaking game draining folks of their blood. Perhaps they&apos;re planning a followup game where you play the cleanup crew who has to take out the whole mess of ghouls you create.
<br>
<br>Anyhow, overall a good short game, probably a bit on the overpriced side. If you dig sneakers wait til it&apos;s on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3272555">Expand</a></span>

So we&apos;ll just skip to the bad.
<br>
<br>The voice acting, as has been said, feels like it goes from one sentence to the next with no pause inbetween.It feels like the skip button is pushed half a second before the sentence /should/ end.
<br>
<br>The gameplay is repetitive. You do the same 3 &quot;kill&quot; moves over and over, and worst of all, the ragdoll physics can go completely bonkers on 2 of them. I&apos;ve had it happen 4 times to me where I&apos;ll flip kick or just super-vampire-deck someone over a ledge, only for their body to be discovered and everyone within earshot is looking for me.
<br>
<br>My footsteps while running sound like I&apos;m wearing clogs. and are about 20x louder than anyone else. &quot;Preternaturally silent footsteps&quot; my @$$.
<br>
<br>They also mislabeled this game. It&apos;s not &quot;Stealth Action&quot;, It&apos;s just &quot;Stealth&quot;. Once you&apos;re discovered you&apos;re quickly riddled with bullets. You have a couple powers at your disposal but they really don&apos;t do anything for you when you only have 4 blood points to throw around and every room has a dozen or more enemies.
<br>
<br>I want to like this game. I REALLY do, but nothing stands out except the bad. I love vampire lore, I love stealth games, I&apos;m a huge fan of Vampire the Masquerade: Redemption and Bloodlines. I expected this to expand off of 2 excellent games or at the very least, take pointers from them. I guess I&apos;ll go back to waiting for a vampire game that will actually deliver. As it stands this is just a bad ripoff of Dishonored. Giving it a 3. I&apos;m sure the desperate among us for a vampire or stealth game will enjoy the game, but those of us that see past that will be sorely disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3264136">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay is the game&apos;s strong point..the vampire powers are the highlight...made even more interesting by the fact that you have to feed in order to use them.

Then when you&apos;ve got everything figured out, try not to mess it up.
<br>
<br>Thing is, the AI is just too good. It doesn&apos;t feel human. Enemies are too quick to respond when sighting you, and seem to have quite a wide field of vision (I figured pretty much 180&#xB0;, which is strange because supposedly you&apos;re less visible due to being a vampire).
<br>Therefore, when even a single guard finds you out, you&apos;re pretty much dead. Most stealth games simply have your pursuers forget you and go back to their routine, not DARK. The countdown during which they&apos;ll look for you is incredibly long, and I don&apos;t think I ever had guards drop their search for me in DARK (usually they kill me or there&apos;s only one guy looking for me and I manage to kill him). It would have made sense for once to have them forget about you, what with your vampire powers....
<br>
<br>You have some powers you can unlock but it doesn&apos;t feel like they&apos;re really helpful  either they don&apos;t last long enough, or they only target one enemy and most of the time you&apos;ll have to take care of a dozen. Maybe there&apos;s a certain skill development one can take to make the game easier, but it certainly doesn&apos;t feel like there is one.
<br>
<br>But as I said, DARK is not inherently bad. Everything else about the game can be quite enjoyable, we&apos;re going back to the roots of vampires  blood drinkers and outcasts of society. The only thing that needs to be fixed is the AI.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3278114">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Don&apos;t believe the negatives, most are upset that its not another cod or god of war.
<br>
<br>My version has outstanding A.I.  maybe the critics just don&apos;t have the rigs to handle this beast.</span>

That&apos;s a motivator to start hunting stonger and stronger vampires. The good thing is you can advance your skills at anytime if you&apos;ve got enough xp. The key is to choose correct skills first to make the game easier, be stealthy trough the level and collect PDAs on the way. These actions will give you extra xp and make the game actually very fun to play. I finished Dark in 2,5 days and would have liked to play it alot more. I hope they make sequal for this Great game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3430333">Expand</a></span>

<br>Worst animations I&apos;ve seen in a long time and I could forgive bad animations but these animations are just the product of lazy developers. You don&apos;t even have an animation to walk in each direction so when you do a 360 turn it looks insanely stupid. Like I said I could get past the animations if the game wasn&apos;t so boring and easy.</span>

<br>
<br>First of all, the game is terribly overpriced. Having to pay 45 euros for this is just awful, but it *might* be worth getting at 50% off. Now then; the story is pretty boring, there&apos;s no reason to care about the characters at all since they only serve to advance the story(and the dialogue is terrible, it feels forced and unnatural), many things are left unexplained, the animation quality isn&apos;t anything to write home about, the AI is pretty ridiculous and doesn&apos;t pose any real challenge since they ALWAYS follow the same pattern and if you get discovered you&apos;re pretty much dead, and sometimes you have only a split second to find cover before you&apos;re spotted and instakilled by some guy half a mile away. Targeting the teleportation skill is also tremendously frustrating, and you will often be ripping your hair out trying to place it properly.
<br>
<br>But it doesn&apos;t completely suck. The abilities are fun to play around with, even though you might not have any reason to use more than two or three of them. I like the art style and the levels look good, so you&apos;ll at least have something pretty to look at until that guard circles back into position. The gameplay isn&apos;t *really* bad, and while the AI is pretty predictable, you can have a bit of fun finding different routes to your objectives, or issuing various challenges to yourself to spice the game up a bit. The universe itself has some rather interesting sides, but they just aren&apos;t fleshed out enough and there might be a million reasons that they weren&apos;t, but the result is the same. You&apos;re left with a lot of unanswered questions and a lot of potential dropped right on the floor..</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3283720">Expand</a></span>

When I saw the cover art of Dark it immediately reminded me of Thief, the reviews however made me hesitant. After really wanting to like Remember Me and realizing that the game sucked, I didn&apos;t wanted to be disappointed again, yet I don&apos;t judge a book by its cover (or other reviews) and gave it a shot.
<br>
<br>I was pleasantly surprised. The game uses a cell shaded look, probably to hide the fact that the developers didn&apos;t have high-quality textures available. In the end the game gave a very even look without mushy and pixelated textures, so I guess they achieved their goal.
<br>
<br>This is a low budget title and for what it is, I found it to be impressive. The voice actors are generally okay, only some of them delivered a cringe worthy performance, but nothing too bad to make you turn off the game. The audio engine itself lacks the ability to dampen sound in relation of the player&apos;s distance to the sound emitting object, so if you talk to someone and move away the speech will not be muffled. Also, there&apos;s no positional audio. The latter isn&apos;t really needed, but the former is just a necessity for modern games.
<br>
<br>As people have already pointed out, the animations are not always up to par, mainly those for blood sucking, but most of them do look realistic enough to enjoy the game. I played the game on hard and tried to avoid alarms and found the game to be easy, yet enjoyable. Apparently people are split on the difficulty as is apparent from some reviews here. Some find it too hard, but then there&apos;s a reason for having a difficulty setting. Also, some people seemed to have struggled, because they couldn&apos;t adapt to the gameplay necessary to get the most out of the game.
<br>
<br>FMVs were crisp and not the pixelated mess I usually get to see from big titles. The story had me roll my eyes at the beginning, but after a while I kind of warmed up to it. The story isn&apos;t actually bad, just the way the lay it out feels kind of clumsy at times, but that&apos;s what to be expected from a budget title. I&apos;ve got the feeling that if the game would have had the kind of money in the back the big companies can spend, then this would have been the start of a new IP. May be it still is. After all, other games with similarly limited gameplay and storytelling (the first Call of Juarez comes to mind) managed to step it up tremendously in the sequel.
<br>
<br>I found the gameplay to be quite addictive. The first level didn&apos;t really click with me. Mostly, because I didn&apos;t really have a clue which situations to expect and which powers to upgrade, but by the second level I was really enjoying the game. I was powered up enough to do cool stunts and take out enemies effectively. Also, later on the game manages to keep things fresh by challenging the player with ever new situations forcing you to explore new tactics (if you want to keep it alarm-free that is).
<br>
<br>Also, the level design was pretty good. The levels are huge without loading zones. There are plenty of details, so the game doesn&apos;t feel empty. All in all, the game creates a believable world. There are shortcomings though. Apart from the superficial ones I mentioned, there some gripes with gameplay. In level 2 there&apos;s a section where while you&apos;re trying to take out a guard a cutscene will interfere. The game tries to incorporate sound by using littered floor as sound source which you should try to avoid. Thief implemented this a whole lot better. They could have left that feature out for all I care since it&apos;s barely game defining and only rarely encountered. Your attacks and actions create sounds too and those are traceable by the enemy. Too bad there&apos;s no indicator how much you&apos;re audible. At least they found a clever way to indicate visibility. Whenever an enemy starts to spot you, a circle appears that goes from green to red. If you manage to break line of sight before it&apos;s red you&apos;re safe. Simple but efficient. The game made several hints that shadows have an impact on visibility, but neither does it explain this feature, nor will you encounter many shadows. While the game uses light and shadows throughout, they don&apos;t seem to play a role and if they do, I didn&apos;t need to stick to the shadows to beat it.
<br>
<br>All in all I have to say I liked the game. It offers replay value: I can&apos;t wait for a second run through to beat it even more perfectly, now that I know what to expect. Ghosting through the levels will also be fun especially with the teleport power and so will be a violent playthrough where I can ignore stealth completely and take enemies head on.
<br>
<br>Is it a genre defining game? No.
<br>Was it fun to play? You bet!
<br>Did I feel I wasted my time? No!
<br>
<br>Even with more advanced stealth games around, there are still far too few to cater to the genre and this game sure does give fans of the genre some fun before Thief 4 comes around. As simple as it is, as enjoyable is it. You need a knack for patience and stealth though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3389788">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The worst thing about the entire game is that you don&apos;t feel like a vampire. Vampire Bloodlines remains the gold standard. Even the Elder Scrolls series did a better job handling vampirism, and it wasn&apos;t even a core part of the gameplay.
<br>
<br>I recommend this game only to masochists who love vampires. And maybe Twilight fans. They deserve some suffering.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3423745">Expand</a></span>

The ONLY thing decent about it are the graphics. Now mind you, I say the graphics. NOT the animation. The graphics would get a 6/10, where as the animation for this game would get a 1/10 without a doubt. You see half a foot of empty air between your mouth (which is closed like it always is when not in dialogue) and the enemy&apos;s neck you&apos;re feeding off of.  When walking forward, if you try to go left/forward or /right forward, there&apos;s no animation between going straight and the other two options, you just instantly switch from walking one direction to the other. This isn&apos;t 1995.
<br>
<br>Another horrible part of this game is the AI and pathfinding. Out of the first 10 enemies I encountered,  2 of them disappeared all together, yet were somehow still attacking me, then all of a sudden appeared infront/behind me again. They can&apos;t see you through glass walls, they get stuck A LOT on pretty much nothing as well.
<br>
<br>The gameplay itself is a VERY bad knock off version of dishonored. You don&apos;t feel powerful in this game. You feel broken. Turns out it matches the game very well, as this game can def be decribed as both broken and UNFINISHED. It&apos;s obvious they either gave up and shipped this crap product or wanted to meet some deadline and decided they&apos;d try and snag your 40 bucks without letting any review sites get their hands on it first.
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t say this enough. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! The other guy who put a 10/10 for this game is high out of his mind. It&apos;s garbage. I play most known games out there, and I wouldn&apos;t want to see anyone waste money on this.

It did not destroy the game play and still made you get the feeling of a dark environment. I also liked the story line because it gives you a different perspective of the vampire franchise and it was also the reason I kept playing all the time. I simply wanted to know what would happen to the main character. I also disagree a bit towards the other reviews considering the npc:s. Yes they are dumb, they do not for example look into a bush if you have killed tons of guys walking past it. Although if you set of the alarm they will come after you and walk around the place where they saw you or where they found a dead body of another guard so I would say yes they are dumb but they actually do change routes if you make the enemies hostile. It is not really like in Skyrim or Oblivion where you can shoot one of the npc:s friends that is right next to him and he goes all like. Did you hear something? xD. BUT! What I did not like was the saving system and that they obviously did not really have a system with hard, easy and normal. The only differences of these degrees of difficulty is the saves. Easy is that you can save whenever you want, while normal only gives you two saves per stage off the mission. It does not differ in game play at all which I think takes away the point of having a difficulty system from the start. Also that you are not able to save at all at the club is kind of a bummer for me when saving is so important in these kind of games (a least that is what I think). I also did not like that fact that it seemed like it was very lined up. It was like walking on lava. Step one step our of the line of what the path the developers have planned for you in order to make the mission and you need to do it all over...unless you played it on easy so you could save whenever you wanted. Also the mission seemed kind of repetitive and it got kind of boring doing the same thing over and over. I still recommend the game for everyone that likes stealth games and are good at them^^ Because that is probably what it will take to play it on normal and not get pissed every 2 minutes because you stepped out of line again. And if you play it on easy I more or less recommend it for everyone that likes vampires^^ Not the twilight vampires then :/...if you even can call them vampires...no offense^^ well I liked the game and a recommend it for stealth gamers and vampire lovers^^ Good game but could do so much better if more thought was put into it. And please next time you make a game give us more freedom and more saves!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3268016">Expand</a></span>

If you want a good stealth game just go buy Splinter Cell or Thief or even Hitman just don&apos;t let them steal 40$ from your pocket by buying this garbage. Its sad to I was looking forward to this game it was a good idea but executed terribly</span>

Of course, it has some flaws and doesn&apos;t look much polished in a way you could expect from an AAA game (which is not).
<br>But, in many ways, it tries to make things well :
<br>- The gameplay is pretty interesting and intuitive, while
<br>- The level design is overall well-suited to the powers and abilities you just unlocked in the previous area. It offers a good verticality as well (&quot;shadow leap&quot; ability)
<br>- Moreover, the Rpg-style Xp points system gives you several possibilities of achievement with pretty cool powers showing well balanced cooldowns and potentials.
<br>- The graphics are really not bad for a cel-shaded game, but the characters&apos; animations look rigid.
<br>- The storyline is pretty basic and uninteresting, but at least it lets you visit different places and stalk different preys.
<br>Overall, this game reminds me of &quot;Batman Arkham Asylum&quot; challenge maps,  where you try to blend into the background while spotting and then swooping on your preys in different arenas.
<br>
<br>it doesn&apos;t take long to reach the credits page, but overall the game was fun for me despite its flaws. I think it should be sold 15-20 </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3298377">Expand</a></span>

I got a lot of problem to play although I don&apos;t have any responsibilities. also, the way to make tactics is too short. If you already play &apos;Hitman&apos; or &apos;Dishonored&apos;, maybe you can punch your monitor. So my advice is two kinds.
<br>
<br>1. Find other sweet infiltration games.
<br>
<br>2. wear boxing gloves when you play this.</span>

<br>The game has a great premise but the execution lets it down a little. Maybe because of the budget constraints.
<br>
<br>All I see when I play the game is an awesome stealth RPG but sadly it never comes into fruition. Main issue is the lack of enough transversal options leaves you flatfooted or cornered very often. The general stealth gameplay is fun and the powers are useful. Use of powers is too clunky. Simple jump mantling is sorely missed. Would be great if you could move around the environment with the ease of say dishonored. Graphics are fine if unspectacular. Sound design is generally good. Voice acting is poor to avergage. Other than that the game is enjoyable, but it commits the cardinal sin of leaving you wanting much more, showing you it&apos;s potential but never realising it. The approach to stealth is great though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3272267">Expand</a></span>

But from a small developer, I thought they did quite well. I don&apos;t normally play stealth games, and was looking for a casual RPG when I ran across this. I though the story was decent compared to some of the crap that gets toted around in games. The character development could have been done a lot better, I really didn&apos;t feel much attachment to any of them. As far as RPG elements are concerned, some basic character building is there, but you wind up unlocking most of the powers by the end anyways, so it&apos;s just a timing thing. I would recommend it to others, I felt it had a lot of potential but was either limited by time or too small a budget to really hash it out. A bigger focus on character development and AI would really have made this a great game, but I&apos;m happy with my purchase.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3275461">Expand</a></span>

<br>Good: The game is fun to play.
<br>Good: I love all the abilities and normal difficulty feels pretty balanced.
<br>Good: I like how you are limited on your quick saves so it adds another challenge to the stealth style game. Nothing breaks the risk than having a quick save before every kill. Hard difficulty is even better as you only get auto saves and every mistake might mean killing 13 guys all over again.
<br>Good: The story mixed in with gameplay to remind you constantly what you were doing in these locations.
<br>
<br>Bad: Normal difficulty and Hard difficulty have the same enemies and they have the same patrol patterns. If you play pure stealth, then hard isn&apos;t much different than normal other than how fast they kill you.
<br>Bad: Really short. I beat the game on Normal and then Hard. One day of playing for each.
<br>Bad: Challenges might have been fun, but forcing  us to redo our abilities before each round is stupid. Just give us some abilities and make us deal with what you give us.
<br>Bad: Becoming a Vampire that can do it all removes the replay of this game. If picking different skills actually means I would not get to have others would limit our characters and cause us to play differently each time through. As it is no matter what by the last level you have capped out all abilities.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3285430">Expand</a></span>

But it is fun, when it starts at the outside area of a museum, you get yourself remembered of the great game Dishonored by having access to the magic teleportation power to wipe out enemies in a split second. I liked it.</span>

The controls were a little difficult at first but I got the hang of them pretty quick. The voice acting was also a bit abrasive at first as well but as the story progressed, I got more into it.
<br>
<br>The game actually does get considerably more interesting as you go on and things get a lot cooler as you unlock more powers. I also enjoyed the challenge of sneaking around, though I would have enjoyed the option of some combat. I suppose the creators wanted to keep us focused on sneaking instead of fighting. Other things I would have changed would be the boss fight at the end (this would require a combat mechanic), and the length of the game. It gets really cool near the end and then it ends... I can&apos;t help but feel that it could have used some Metal Gear feel in it.
<br>
<br>In any case, I&apos;m up for a replay. I enjoyed sneaking around and causing havoc from the shadows.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3275073">Expand</a></span>

I happen to like a challenge (most of the complaints below are from people who don&apos;t, btw)  so restarting a checkpoint 15 times before I got it just right was OK. As it happens, if you choose your abilities wisely, you can make it MUCH easier, so those poor peeps who hated on this really missed out on it getting easier with skillful progression. It never crashed, never had poor framerates, and I found it thoroughly enjoyable. If you liked the hard levels of thief and still found that to be a great game, you will probably like this. Also, one more note about checkpoints  in general, i HATE them. However, they give you 2 freebie anytime saves that you can use between those checkpoints. Don&apos;t be silly about when you use them, and you will get the hang of it. It isn&apos;t Dishonored, but that&apos;s actually a good thing, IMO. That game was incredibly easy, even on hard. This game, however, when you choose hard  it IS hard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3273340">Expand</a></span>

<br>The powers/ability&apos;s are neat some of them once leveled up make getting thru the levels alot easier other wise i recommend you play on easy, normal difficulty seems way to hard and incredibly frustrating.

<br>the controls are for lack of a better word lose... they really need tightening up it was incredibly frustrating trying to kill something from a corner crouching position.. oh and god forbid you run up on humans and try to hit them with your vampire awesomeness..... each levels really only about 10-15 minutes long.
<br>
<br>you&apos;ll likely spend many frustrated hours. this game could have been such a great game if they just put some polish and thought into it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dark/user-reviews?user_review_id=3340998">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>After playing it for a couple of minutes, you realize how little time the developers put into the game. It have the graphics of a fair 2008 game, and the programming of a 2003. Way after in my opinion.

<br>
<br>Dark is a stealth based RPG that promises a deep and engaging story with unique settings and abilities all of which is set in the dark and forboding world of vampires. Your abilities are fueled by the energy you consume from your victims and your objective is to use your powers to make your way through the areas and reach your goal.  Unfortunately there are more than a few problem this game has when attempting to make good on these promise of a deep and immersive world with challenging gameplay.

Honestly this is a game no one will even remember a year from now. It will not go down in the books. Avoid paying for this game and skip onto the next, If you want an immersive and fun RPG/FPS vampire game than play bloodlines.

<br>So you can simply just tank them all to continue with the story.

All in all I give it a 7/10 because the story is good, character development is good, combat system needs work.
