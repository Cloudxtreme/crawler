If the second game was more like Alien Breed 1.5, then the third game is pretty much like Alien Breed 1.5b. There have literally been no new additions to this third installment. The only things that are different are either very trivial or are more of an annoyance than a feat.
<br>
<br>Just as the previous installment, in this one some of the weapons have been changed around too. Once again, the first 3 weapons are the same, but for the last 2 now we&#x2019;ve got an Electric Link Gun and a Project X. They&apos;re not bad at all and can be useful a lot of the time, but despite that, I still found myself using the original 3 a lot more often, but it probably depends on the player.
<br>
<br>The game also tried to do a little bit of gimmicky stuff. In some areas the game takes a more over-the-shoulder perspective. Those parts are quite nice for eye-candy purposes as they break the norm and make you fight in a slightly different fashion. However, most of these parts tend to have fixed camera angles, and hence if you change direction, you often don&#x2019;t see where you&#x2019;re going. It&#x2019;s still a nice addition, but I just wish it didn&#x2019;t restrict you with fixed camera angles. Fixed camera parts were introduced in the second game, something I thought was one of the most annoying additions ever, and they still persist in this game.
<br>
<br>But what about the story? Well, it wasn&#x2019;t exactly among strong points of the series up to now and it&#x2019;s still not in this installment either, as the player still walks through the same dark, semi-exploding corridors, from one part of the ship to another, activating computers and other systems. I would, however, point out that the main villain takes up a bit of a spotlight in this installment and we get to find out a lot about him. In fact, I&#x2019;d even say he becomes more likeable than our musclehead of a hero.
<br>
<br>Overall, Alien Breed 3 is literally identical to the first two. In fact the quality of the entire series has gone down in my eyes simply because of the fact that each new part was the same as the last. Even Steam achievements are identical in all 3 games. If you want to get maximum enjoyment out of this series, then I&#x2019;d recommend you to play only one of the games and not all three. Any of them will do, though the first one is probably the best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-breed-3-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=3271308">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I think the gameplay is not challenging and rewarding enough : Aliens are kinda predictable, and you got no real incentive to kill them (except to move on) since they never drop anything of value like ammunition, grenades, medikits or &quot;armor fixes&quot;.

<br>But the really dealbreaker is still the camera. Usually, when you can rotate the camera, the controls are here so you don&apos;t really think about it. In Alien Breed 3: Descent, the game always reminds you how bad they are. Plus, sometimes, the camera sticks to an angle not really appropriate and you wonder why...

<br>Play Shadowground Survivor instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alien-breed-3-descent/user-reviews?user_review_id=5341095">Expand</a></span>
