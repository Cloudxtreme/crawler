<br>
<br>The biggest disappointment for me was the lack of a skirmish mode. Well there is a menu button which is called &quot;Skirmish&quot; but behind that are just 3 maps with missions attached to it, like a horde mode for example.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>+nice graphics
<br>+nice sound
<br>+difficult campaign
<br>+small but interesting map design
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-no skirmish mode
<br>-not very innovative/deep mechanics

After following the game for a while, finally playing it is resoundingly disappointing. There are some excellent ideas here, and the genre itself is woefully neglected, so this entry has a lot going for it in that sense. It&apos;s just that it doesn&apos;t really play well.
<br>Visually, the game is absolutely stunning. The environments are amazingly well crafted, and the ship designs are in a fine balance of lending off known tropes along with genuine creativity. The music too, is quite nice. The tracks don&apos;t really do much by themselves, but sometimes do invoke feelings of say, the new Battlestar Galactica series, which is awesome.
<br>Alas, between the beautiful designs and nebula&apos;s, it&apos;s hard to see what&apos;s going on. I had a lot of trouble navigating the camera, which works in unpredictable ways. But that&apos;s only part of the problem. Despite faction colouring, I kept trying to control allied or enemy ships, thinking they were mine. I also lost many a ship for the opposite reason. It seems like a simple thing, and perhaps a more adept gamer than I won&apos;t have this problem, but it was very jarring to me. That, and everything ever clips.
<br>Talking about jarring, the Unity 3D engine seem to have a lot of trouble with this game. Which the visual effects are excellent, framerate drops were very frequent, even when keeping the 30fps refresh cap. I don&apos;t think the devs themselves are really to blame on this, and it never gets to be a proper slide-show, but it&apos;s not what I expected with my gaming pc. (i-7 860 &amp; GTX 570 and the standard settings).
<br>The universe the game takes place in can be very intriguing though, and the story is functional but nonetheless enjoyable. The voice-acting is also superb, though it&apos;s hampered by a mediocre script.
<br>
<br>There is enough depth here for core gamers to enjoy. The resource system is simple and somewhat inelegant, but the units are well balanced and often just pretty bloody awesome. The bigger battles really do have this epic feel to them, and the campaign really pays off. My hopes are mostly for a few revisionary updates to streamline the UI and pace the progress of the missions a bit better. The promise is here, but the game design is just a bit too wonky at times to really make game excel.
<br>
<br>+ Beautiful.
<br>+ Captures the epic space battle really well at times.
<br>+ Decent story.
<br>
<br>- Clunky controls.
<br>- UI.
<br>- Bad pacing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ancient-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=4547156">Expand</a></span>

<br>First I expected a Homeworld-clone, but it is not true. It plays much more like Dawn of War, combined with the excellent Nexus: The Jupiter incident. It is an RTS with minimal resource management, and building. Basically you take strategic locations, and secure them, than you can build one defensive structure on them, that&apos;s it. Some of these locations will provide minor boosts to income, or unit cap. Income is time based, nothing new here. These are the mediocre part of the game: they function, but do not stand out.
<br>
<br>Unit cap is fairly low, but I liked it, at least I used, what I had. The unit pool, however was pretty weak. Units come in different sizes (small to extra large), but even they are replicating one another: you have two figthers against small and medium enemies, and they are almost a complete match, so what is the point of having them?
<br>
<br>The biggest complaint is the story, and the way, it is presented. It start out with an interesting premise, but the dull line delivery and the bad script often downgrade it. People die, but there are no weight behind it, you barely knew them anyway, you free some new characters, but they will only speak one line, and be forgotten all the way through, and the emotionless voice acting taints the overall experience. Too bad, since there was promise here.
<br>
<br>The music was impressive at first, then I got a nosebleed, from hearing the same track fifty times in a row, and turned it off. The other sound are okay. The absolute selling point is the looks. It is spectacular, and the ship design is really interesting. I prefer the more realistic looks, like in Nexus, but what we have here, is stunning - especially the scenery. The insides of ancient caves, old, ruined buildings and vast spaces are gorgeous.
<br>
<br>Too bad, they can block your view, and you have to manually fight your way through them, to sea the action! And they often highlight the inept pathfinding! I had some trouble with the AI, until I realised, there is none here. Wow. Too bad. The AI poses no challenge on it&apos;s own, the only way to lose, is facing overwhelming odds, or a timer, but the game was fairly easy for me on normal. Once you accept the rules, there is no impossible situation. I missed alternate missions, where you have to chose one out of several possibilities, so the game is linear, but you get secondary objectives to complete, plus you can maneuver a bit in the sectors.
<br>
<br>What I really liked about the battles, was the rock-paper-scissor system: on high difficulty, you actually have to chose the right unit for each job: carefuly watch the special abilities - there are several unit abilities, and some global ones as well, in limited number -, to effectively fight the enemy. That was the part, that got me going.
<br>
<br>All in all, a good game. Not great, by any means, but a good one. If you like rts, or real time tactics, give it a try.

<br>
<br>Visuals:The game looks great.The design of the ships is kinda refreshing.Thats the strongpoint of the game i think.
<br>
<br>Sound:The voiceacting is ok.The developer claims this monotone, emotioneless talking in the game is intentional.If this is true, i dont know about that decision.While this is ok between the mission and in the briefing, its not right in the mission.When you lose something important and nobody seems to care its not that engaging.What i miss are great weaponsounds and a good music.Everything is average or slightly below.
<br>
<br>Gameplay:A real shame is that there is not much tactical depth in the game.You click something, it explodes, or not.There is a system in the game that needs you to match up your units strengths with the enemys ships.Bomber vs. larger ships and so on.Thats all.Some units got one or more abilitys, but all in all thats not realy deep when it comes to tactic.Between missions you can upgrade your units, but here too, its too shallow.+1 armor for my fighters, who cares about that?They die in an instant anyway.
<br>
<br>Conclusion:Maybe that game is better later in the game.But i cant play the game thx to a bug in mission 2(and im not the only one).So, i can only review what ive seen up to that point.And what ive seen is visually beautiful, but thats just the outer shell.There is not much inside i think.I will not update my review when they decide to fix the game cause ill be busy with other games i think.Too bad, you lost a customer for good.I will buy no products from this company again.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/ancient-space/user-reviews?user_review_id=4567895">Expand</a></span>
