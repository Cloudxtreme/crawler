I honestly reset my expectations to expect something a very linear and probably quite corny. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by AW.  The game has some enhancement for the PC. Things like the crippling FOV you see on many console ports are not a problem here. The game is enjoyable and atmospheric. It is very linear but then due to the nature of the game this is to be expected, the linear nature of the game is not to the point where you dont feel in control and it plays very well. The location are is good although the game could bear some better textures it is generally very pretty.  I have seen many complaints here and on steam about poor performance but I play using a quadfire so have not experienced this problem.  However, I have encountered a stonking great bug in the final episodes of the game which prevent me from completing the game. Basically the script seems to have broken down. Required taken dont spawn and an event which is required for progression will not start.  A very disappointing end to a game I was enjoying immensely.  (Playtime approx 20-25 hours.)  Overall, I would say a bit short but due to the atmosphere, story and environment in general I would say this would have been a very good buy for the 20 Euro I paid on steam if it didnt have this cataclysmic bug in my save game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2148174">Expand</a></span>

It runs butter smooth on my 1&#xC2;&#xBD; year old $800 PC and mouse and keyboard controlling has been well implemented - actually forgot even to try it with my gamepad as I felt right at home with the mouse controlling the aiming and quickly switching between weaponry on my keyboard. The thumb buttons of my gaming mouse couldn&apos;t be keybound but I think it will be patched in no time. No biggie for me since there isn&apos;t that many keybindings needed anyways.<br><br>Only obvious giveaway that it is in fact a console port are the lower quality cut-scenes which I suppose are the very same from the Xbox 360 version - a bit weird having a much better looking actual gameplay than the cut-scenes.<br><br>So if I wouldn&apos;t know any better and apart from the cut-scenes I couldn&apos;t tell that it&apos;s a console port nor that it&apos;s a 2 year old game for that matter - very well job done indeed.<br><br>As for the game in general - if you like story-driven games and have the mindset for a rather scary survival-action gameplay  than this is definitely the game for you. AAA-class game and the price for the new PC version really is a bargain.<br><br>9/10 in comparison to other this gen. games. Apart from the cut-scenes and some few very minor flaws like the awkward car handling in the non-essential driving parts - my high expectations were fulfilled.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2144201">Expand</a></span>

I loved Max Payne 1&amp;2. I still love horror games. Sadly i was disappointed.<br>The game is well packed, nice graphics, cure for the details, amazing audio but it smells clich&#xC3;&#xA8; from the very beginning. The storyline is somewhat interesting but sure isn&apos;t original and the pace is broken by the action part of the game, totally separated from the narration. It&apos;s like watching a - often mediocre - cut scene, starting to merge with the story and the characters and then been thrown in the same level over and over, in the dark woods, craving for a source of light, some ammo and the next checkpoint, hoping to end it quickly to go back to the real part of the game. Yeah, it&apos;s like this. Reach a location, watch a brief scene, find yourself in the woods at night, follow an absolute linear path through enemies, find that the only difficulties in engaging them is the poor camera control and the low ammo resources, reach the next location, start over. And that&apos;s not all, since the devs should have come to realize that this sucked hard they added a lot of manuscript pages to pick up during the &quot;exploration&quot; (read: straight on walk), the sad thing is that this poor written pieces of paper contain spoilers about your next location and the next chunk of story, making it even less interesting to watch.<br>This game should have been a 9 for its atmospheres and its potential. Don&apos;t buy it unless its price falls under 10$.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2320055">Expand</a></span>

I admit, it is interesting and would make an excellent book or movie. The problem is that even the best novel can be turned into a bad computer game and that is essentially what has happened here.
<br>
<br>The story unfolds over the coarse of 20 hours as you run from one well lit area to the next, fighting waves of the exact same 4 monsters, using the exact same 4 weapons and the exact same strategy all the way to the end. The Enemy AI is rudimentary. The soundtrack is non-existent.  Alan Wake will occasionally narrate and explain a new revelation, or what he is feeling or what you need to do next.
<br>
<br>The game lacks tradition incentives to keep you playing. There are no choices, no dialogue trees, no weapon upgrades, no level-ups. Even Alan Wakes own survival is tied to the plot and thus never seems to be in question.  The game thrusts you into the action without spending sufficient time on character development and then tells you that you need to do X, Y and Z if you wish to save various people you don&apos;t care about.  This might work in a book or movie were we are simply spectators along for the ride, but it is asking a lot in a game where players must invest 20 hours of their own time to progress the story. I constantly found myself asking the question, &quot;Do I really care about these people? Do I even care what happens to Alan Wake? Why do I need a key to open this door when I have a shotgun in my hand?&quot; As a result, it is easy to lose interest. This is one of the few games I have played in my life that I have had to force myself to finish.  Somewhere along the way, Remedy lost that balance between making a game with a good story and a game that is still fun to play. People invest in computers and pay top dollar for games because they want more than books or movies can offer. My advice: Buy BioShock  or replay Indigo Prophecy. You can skip this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2489248">Expand</a></span>

There&apos;s some distractions in the shape of puzzles but even those are just rehashed over and over again. It just feels like you&apos;re watching a movie but you have to work your way through tedious and repetitive gameplay to actually get to the story. The repetitiveness of the gameplay aside most of what&apos;s happening is also very predictable. You just KNOW you&apos;re about to get attacked when you find more than a fair amount of ammo, and when you&apos;ve gone through part of the story where you don&apos;t have weapons and you finally find some again; guess how long it takes before you get to use them? More than anything I just feel frustrated playing this game, frustrated by being force-fed terrible, predictable and linear gameplay just to get to what seems like a good story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2146539">Expand</a></span>

The beginning was promising, only to become a tedious, boring variation of 16-second-cutscenes and 10 minutes of run-through-the-woods-while-taken-chase-you bit. Unnerving indeed. The story is nothing new, but fitting, the problem is that finding the manuscript pages is pretty much an ingame-spoiler that tells you exactly what is going to happen in the next cutscene. I was really hoping forward to an intelligently written, atmospheric horror game - that is probably why I didn&apos;t enjoy it much. You can say that this is my personal problem, but I don&apos;t think there&apos;s many people out there that are searching for something like this when there are better action- and horrorgames out there, while Alan Wake is a mediocre fusion of both. I&apos;m not even going to start on how terribly clunky console-ported controls feel at times because this seems to be standard in the industry as of now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2461797">Expand</a></span>

From a great open world survival-horror-adventure, game squeezed to boring linear light-em-shoot-em-up, with many game design flaws, including total lack of melee combat which existed in almost every survival horror since the old days, because ammo is always limited in this genre and whenever you out of ammo you should fight your way with fists, pipes, axes, and everything... or you could just run away, but in Alan Wake you can not do either. Seriously, Alan  cant even run like normal man, his run ability somewhere close to fat grandpa at the edge of heart attack - what was Remedy designers thinking when they limited run distance to about 10 meters? Dodging is barely works and sometime when you just want to run, Alan suddenly starts from dodge. Also enemies just the same everywhere, &quot;taken&quot; humans with shield of darkness, about 4 of them - white trash, cops, oversized, and special character,  they only reminds me zombie, and zombies cant scare anyone. Remedy should look at Silent Hill, Cold fear or Dead space, to get the idea of how to make scary creatures. Playing linear levels where all you can do is aim flashlight, shoot, barely run and dodge away from non scary humans, and where all the adventure element are &quot;go forward, press button to open gatedoor or pick up manuscript&quot; - not fun at all, just boring and repetitive. Also i don&apos;t even want to talk about Riding part of game, it even worse and buggier than it was in Alone in the dark 2008 (which is by the way much better and more imaginative game than Alan, and Alan kinda ripped off many things from it, including episodic format and darkness)
<br>The only thing that could keep anyone playing is the story, however its very cut and some time parts just don&apos;t tied well together, because of Remedy cut too much, you always feel that something else should be between this and that and it was cut without attempt to smooth this out. And this story is impressive for non educated people who never saw Twin Peaks, and other Lynch movies and never reed King books. For me - a King and Lynch fan this story looks as predictable rip-off from Lynch movies and King books, its about 50% Twin Peaks, 30% King, 10% of other rip-off and about 10% of something original. But its well-written rip-off so i still consider story as good story, but nothing super-awesome.
<br>No let me talk about PC port specifics: for a game that was once PC exclusive 1st DX10 game, return to PC in form like this is insult to all the PC users who waited this game so long! GFX is worse than in time it was announced 5 years ago, dx9 only, textures blurry low res, render distance of high detail LOD is low and transition is noticeable, shadows pixelated just like GTA 4, cut-scenes pre-rendered at 720p 30fps, with a lot of compression artifacts, washed out colors that dont match gameplay gamma, and this really breaking immersion... so in addition to dated 5 years old gfx, laziness of Remedy to bring at least high res textures and real-time cut-scenes to PC, this game is slow as hell! Performance optimization not even here! With gfx like this this game should run at 60fps on 5 years old pc, but it barely runs at about 25 fps on 1 year old PC. And the funny thing - Remedy not even ported this game to PC, they hired Nitro games - 5 (yep u can see it in credits) noob monkey-programmers + 3 testers. this shameful team ported Alan to PC, and Remedy didn&apos;t even cared to provide em high res textures and real-time cut-scenes, and no one bothered to enhance gameplay after all the criticism of x360 version. Its just exact copy with few minor extra settings. Which is real shame, especially comparing to what this game once was on PC several years ago.
<br>This is real insult to all the PC gamers and yet another wasted opportunity to return this game to its original glory that was lost during transition to xbox 360. I hope after Remedy recieved a lot of money from PC crowd and covered development cost in 48 hours, they could invest extra more to bring PC gamers an excuse for all the troubles as 6 simple things 1) Good patch with real optimization of CODE (not the cut of already poor gfx) +dx1011  2) High res texture pack 3) Real-time cut-scenes 4) Render distance sliders that actually affects render distance 5) Tweaks to gameplay, Quick saves, or at least checkpoints after every pickup, and re-usable Save heaven checkpoins + melee combat, at least ability to knock out enemy with flashlight or gun, improvements to run and dodge 6) Modding SDK. After this i would not feel myself insulted and cheated.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2153993">Expand</a></span>

Bought it for PC for the upgrade in graphics and FPS. Sadly, this is far from the truth. My rig is just 6 months old with (at the time) some of the best hardware available. It POWERS through every game I play at rock solid 60 fps on max settings. Now the problem ... Alan Wake even at medium sends my CPU/GPU into overdrive with choppy fps???. Why??? I have read the forums, made adjustments yadda yadda yadda with no improvement. Some people haven&apos;t had these issues with AW and good luck to them. Myself and &apos;mydixienormus&apos; (see his comments) do, so it&apos;s not an isolated problem my end. Such a shame cos like others I was really looking forward to this title. Maybe with future patches it will be addressed as I&apos;m sure I&apos;m not alone here. I&apos;m giving it a 5 out of 10 because as a game it&apos;s amazing, but with it&apos;s current performance I feel cheated and may as well have stuck with my Xbox edition. ----------------------------------------------------&gt; UPDATE 13/05/2012 ... Since the recent patches I went back to AW and admit it runs much, much better now. I still haven&apos;t completed it but wanted to change my score to justify its current state. It&apos;s a good game full of drama. Not really a &apos;horror&apos; game, but a heart stopper all the same. Score upped from a 5 to an 8.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2144354">Expand</a></span>

I need to address one thing first...
<br>
<br>This is not a scary game...it&apos;s not meant to be. It&apos;s a psychological action thriller (check the box art if you don&apos;t believe me...) Unfortunately people have rated this game based on &quot;scare factor&quot; and that&apos;s not fair. Although this game has the makings of &quot;horror&quot; game, it&apos;s not. That&apos;s like trying to call the movie &quot;Se7en&quot; a horror movie. It has the atmosphere and aesthetics of one but its a psychological thriller all the way through.
<br>
<br>Alan Wake puts you on the edge of your seat and keeps you coming back for more. The game plays out like a thriller/mystery TV show with &quot;Chapters&quot; and &quot;Previously On...&quot; segments. You play as a best selling author who is having difficulties writing his next book. He decides to take a vacation with his girlfriend up to a town called Bright Falls. Located in the pacific northwest, Bright Falls shares many similarities with the fictional town of Twin Peaks (the TV show from the 90&apos;s). It&apos;s a small, cozy, honest working mans town where everybody know everybody. When your just about settled into the cabin, your girlfriend goes missing. You must then try and track her down while avoiding the darkness that plagues the town and the evil that lurks within.
<br>
<br>The game has several key features. The atmosphere by far steals the show. You can tell a lot of attention to detail went into crafting this beautiful northwestern landscape. The lighting and particle effects are excellent as well. The sound design is well done and the narration from the main character adds to the tension and mystery.
<br>
<br>I do have a few gripes though... One being the character models and stiff animations. The character models look a little dated. I guess from a distance they don&apos;t look to bad but once you see them up close you can really notice the lack of detail. The characters seem to move around in the most simplistic ways possible. Also, the lip syncing is some of the worst I have seen in years. It&apos;s like watching a poorly dubbed kung fu movie. The driving mechanics, although short, are poorly done. You never feel like you have full control over the vehicle. Too far to the left or right and you swerve out of control and into a ditch.
<br>
<br>My last complaint would be the lack of replay-ability. Once you complete the game...that&apos;s it. Your not awarded any bonus missions or free roam. Sure you can go back and collect some coffee thermoses (no seriously there&apos;s like 100 to collect) but what is that going to get you? Seeing as how the game was first designed as an open world game (and still feels much like one at times) they could have left that in tact and let you roam around freely after you beat the game.
<br>
<br>All that set aside, the games pacing, characters and location are more than enough to draw you in. Like a good book, you wont want to put this one down once you&apos;ve started.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=3685301">Expand</a></span>

I really enjoyed this game, it certainly kept me hooked for the 9 hours it took to complete (DLC and expansion notwithstanding). The game is set out and presented as if it was a TV series, with many nods to well-known horror tropes. The majority of gameplay sees the player fighting off the Taken (shadow men) with a torch ...er, flashlight ... and pistol, collecting manuscript pages (which foreshadow later events), Thermos flasks (why?). and solving rudimentary puzzles. Overall this stuff is fairly casual and easy, which is fine, because in my head all it was there to do was to advance the plot. Good stuff all around then, but the ending left me kind of unsatisfied but with lots of room for a sequel (addressed in the episodic DLCs). Before I forget, extra points for this PC port, which frankly, I think we were lucky to have. Oh, and good writing!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2870736">Expand</a></span>

Shine a light and shoot. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. There is almost no enemy variety and no real sense of progression. After the first few Chapters, the only thing that kept me going was the story.</span>

The graphics are good, and I really like the unique stories, and the fact that you can dig deeper with the manuscripts. It has replay value for the collectibles, and I highly recommend it.</span>

In all honesty, I don&apos;t know how the game managed to get so far with such a mediocre gameplay. I guess the trick is in graphics which are still beautiful and create a fantastic atmosphere suitable for the Stephen King-esque storyline. The story is definitely a homage to King with the writer in distress, weird murderers and dreamlike locations near a very american mountain village. It&apos;s like cliche in a cliche. You&apos;re armed with a flashlight and a gun and must first use the light to sort of &quot;break down shields&quot; from enemies to be able to shoot them with your weapon. That&apos;s all there is to fighting mechanics. Use flashlight, shoot with a pistol. Run to the next area. Bad guys appear from the shadows. Use flashlight, shoot with a pistol. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. There are also collectibles for those people that bought this game with their last moneys and just HAVE to get everything out of it. The beginning of the game felt a bit like Resident Evil 4 which is a great game. You should play that instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=3264114">Expand</a></span>

Too bad the rest of the game can&apos;t match up to the well-written storytelling.
<br>
<br>The game kicks off interestingly where we meet our protagonist, who is struggling with writing crisis and a &quot;little bit&quot; of insanity. Soon we find ourselves fighting with shadowy creatures named &apos;The Taken&apos; controlled by a mysterious force.
<br>
<br>The fighting mechanics based on the power of light are unique. While this newish fighting scheme is fun at first it lacks deepness, so it becomes repetitive. Unfortunately nothing good can be said about the controls, which is one of the most discouraging features of the game: awkward movements, slow reaction times, super sensitive mouse controls
<br>
<br>One of the high points of the game is the voice acting. It phenomenally supports the great story, which pushes the player for resolution...that may or may not exists in the end. The end of the story will leave many with questions and bad taste, but the open nature of the conclusion is not necessarily a bad thing at all. However, the special chapters (The Signal and The Writer) will help put a proper end to this tale.
<br>
<br>After 6 chapters it is hard to think of any reasons why anyone, who is not a fan of Alan would start this game all over again. The replay value of the game is very low thanks to its linear nature. Other than some collectibles there&apos;s no point to return. Alan Wake is one of those games that would&apos;ve been enjoyable on a big screen rather than with a controller in a hand.
<br>
<br>Rating: 65/100; Replay Value: 1/5; To Beat: 14-16 hours (incl. the specials); Played on: normal.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=3433997">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game wasn&apos;t worth the small 7 hours that I spent on it. In summary, the story shows great promise but is ultimately a let-down at the end, the combat is pretty horrible, and the graphics just aren&apos;t quite there. Please do yourself a favor, if you&apos;re not really into the suspense-thriller genre, and really like your combat to be interesting, please give this game a pass. You really aren&apos;t missing anything. This is at its core, a short, 100% linear game, with a low amount of content. The developers of this game used long S-shaped paths with lots of waves of enemies to bring up the play time, and the combat just isn&apos;t enjoyable.
<br>
<br>Spoilers past this point.
<br>
<br>Firstly if you don&apos;t have a lot of patience, I would recommend enabling cheat codes by setting &quot;-developermenu&quot; in launch options in steam. This will allow you to refill your ammo when you run out.
<br>
<br>UI: The highly offset camera angle is a constant nuisance. You will literally zig-zag through this entire game with W-A and W-D combinations the entire time. Walking in a straight line is extremely difficult. The slow-motion enemy deaths are way overused, and there&apos;s an irritating, lengthy camera sweep every time an enemy approaches from behind during which you can&apos;t do anything but watch it run/fly towards you and get the first hit. The funniest thing is that they combined the &quot;sprint&quot; key with the &quot;dodge&quot; key, so literally every single time you want to start sprinting, you will first perform a &quot;front dodge&quot; maneuver, so it will look like Alan is going to fall over and then all of a sudden he&apos;s running at full blast. Lazy and comical. Vehicle physics are barely usable. All of the cars basically have bald tires and 500 horsepower because they&apos;re so tail-happy it&apos;s ridiculous.
<br>
<br>Combat: It is actually possible to run out of ammo and get stuck at certain points in the game. Your only way of dispatching enemies is with guns, and there&apos;s no option to run past them in 90% of zones. The combat in this game is boring, there is no avoiding it. Right-click on an enemy with your flashlight to drop their shields, then use a small handful of weapons (you literally only get like 3 guns the whole game) to take down their health. Rinse, wash, repeat. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the combat is OK in small doses. The problem is that you&apos;ll find yourself fighting past wave after wave after wave just to get to the next Dan Brown-style mini cliffhanger at the end of each episode.
<br>
<br>Story: Alan Wake does not end with a resolution to the storyline, which is a shame, because the story in this game was well thought out and is quite good at its core. Instead of trying to figure out an ending that ties everything together and makes everyone happy, it half-resolves a couple things and asks a few more questions. This is SO LAZY, and a HUGE pet peeve of mine. You spend the whole game fighting all this garbage just so the dude can get his wife back, and then, it doesn&apos;t happen. Many of the elements in this game are borrowed.
<br>
<br>Graphics: Textures and effects range from incredibly detailed to cheesy and overused. The characters&apos; faces are absolutely terrible for a 2011 game. Misshapen, not following the dialogue at all. None of the characters ever change clothes for the entire game. There&apos;s no visual or soft barrier for the environments, so once in a while, you&apos;ll jump down a small cliff and just die. Finally, there&apos;s this annoying blur effect that is used so often that it actually prevents you from properly seeing the graphics they did actually do right, things like smoke and lighting.
<br>
<br>Conclusion: 5/10 Good effort, but would not recommend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=4990595">Expand</a></span>

There are only a handful of different enemies and very few unique environments the player can interact with, which reduces the gameplay into a pretty tedious grind.
<br>A unique part of the gameplay is shining a torch (flashlight) on enemy prior to being able to damage them. However, you are rarely attacked by large numbers and are almost always provided with enough ammo and flares to easily keep out of trouble. Both player and enemies move slowly, and most combat takes place in an open environment, so backing away from enemies is an effective but boring tactic.
<br>
<br>The story is reasonably interesting, but it evolves slowly and is so &quot;cheesy&quot; it is hard to take seriously. All the characters in the game are extremely unlikable, and seem like they were designed by a child. This reduces motivation to progress through the game, as the only real reward for the gameplay is plot progression.
<br>
<br>Graphics and sound are generally impressive, but viewpoint is frustrating and not really suited for mouse control. The character controls are quite clumsy, and the dodging mechanic isn&apos;t really very useful (avoiding enemies is far more effective).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=4178164">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The story of the game is something you would expect from King or Coontz. You are a writer. A writer with a writers block - sounds familiar? You go on holiday with your wife and something starts happening. Strange darkness attacks you and you start living out a story written by you that you don&apos;t remember writing. Oh - and there is some lake that the native americans living in the area called gate to hell or something like that. At this point I really thought I&apos;m going to despise the story. But oddly enough after a rough start I really did like it and felt it wasn&apos;t all that bad.
<br>
<br>The strong part for the game are the visuals which are very nicely done. The scenery is pretty nice, and the lighting effects which are pretty important part of the story are very well made as well. Locations at the beginning tend to be bland - forest, forest and nothing interesting. But later on they do change and are quite nicely designed.
<br>
<br>The main part of the game is trying to find your wife and beat the darkness. You do this by following the story and fighting people possessed by the darkness. You kill them by shining your flash light on them long enough so they become vulnerable at which point you can safely unload your gun and finally kill them. And you pretty much do that all through the game with just a couple of guns - revolver, shotgun, hunting rifle and assorted helpers like flares or flash grenades. It does get repetitive after a while but not to a point that you hate the whole fighting. And I must admit that I did got scared once or twice - though mostly the game is not really that scary. But has a very consistent atmosphere and you generally feel quite nice when the sun rises.
<br>
<br>There are also a couple of elements involving driving a car - but these could have been surely skipped as they&apos;re pretty dreadful.
<br>
<br>Voice acting and animation is of very nice quality so watching cut scenes is quite pleasant.
<br>
<br>Overall after a week beginning the game provides good fun up till the very last part which seems a bit dull and you have to push through it. Luckily it&apos;s not long enough too leave a bad impression on the game. I had fun. I really enjoyed it. If you like story driven action games along the lines of resident evil or alone in the dark there is little fear you will not like this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=5955599">Expand</a></span>

A game that could be EASILY adapted for film or TV, Alan Wake is a game that is, in actuality, an interactive novel, and one that is just BEGGING for Star Trek&apos;s holodeck. Even in the intro sequence I found myself enjoying the game on a level that I have not enjoyed any other game before. Does that mean it&apos;s my favourite game? No. But even still it is a wonderful experience nonetheless. Even the fairly standard horror pacing and formula can&apos;t detract from this game, and so intricately tied to and interwoven with its plot the game really manages to tell a story while you battle shadow monsters with a Christmas light wearing sidekick (I am NOT making this up). While I am not a fan of the horror genre, and have never really read any Stephen King (to whom the tilts it&apos;s hat many times), the game was nevertheless thoroughly enjoyable. The only down-side to this interactive novel is that like a novel it is not immediately replayable. When you get to the last chapter, you don&apos;t feel any pressing need to start over again from the beginning, because what you have really enjoyed is not the thrill of the chase, being hunted by an insidious Lovecraftian shadow-demon, but the content of that story. But I think that is one negative we can all bear if games of this ilk were to become more common in the future. And really that actually makes the gameplay longer lasting easier to savour. Please Remedy, and ALL developers, give us more interactive novels, and less psychotically emotionless space marines killing freaking zombie demons from outer space.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2850032">Expand</a></span>

It was a nice touch that you simply can&apos;t shoot your enemies, but have to decide how to take on a pack. While the selections of weapons in the game was modest, you could use them to great effect. I fell in love with the way dodging works in this game, and it made defensive evasion - something that people often overlook in favor of brute force - a pleasant skill to practice.<br><br>This game was long, and it was good.

<br>Credit is due Remedy for making ALAN WAKE a story-driven game. It&#x2019;s a partial success, though not a complete one. They have entirely eschewed the typical RPG tropes of dialogue trees and progression choices in favour of a linear, non-interactive structure. The story is played out in a series of cut-scenes and simple A to B tasks. Basically you just have to battle your way from one place to the next. There&#x2019;s certainly a place for this type of game, and when it&#x2019;s done well  la Half-Life 2) it can be very rewarding. Unlike Half-Life 2, however, ALAN WAKE doesn&#x2019;t quite pull it off. Firstly, there isn&#x2019;t enough humour. There&#x2019;s some but it would have benefited from more. And the story isn&#x2019;t exactly original. But the main problem for me was the combat. I hated the way control is wrenched away from the player every time enemies approach. I get why they did it (there&#x2019;s no other way of knowing they&#x2019;re coming, apart from some audible warnings) but I often found myself disoriented when the camera had finished sweeping around and control had retuned. Several times the sweep lasted so long that by the time I had control again the enemies were right on me and it was impossible to avoid taking a hit. Frustrating to say the least. On the plus side the environments look very good and it&#x2019;s quite atmospheric (although not as creepy as I would have liked  Silent Hill still sets the bar for that). One other thing worth noting is that I found the special episode, The Writer, to be better than what had gone before. It&#x2019;s even more atmospheric and far more inventive. Overall this is a good game if not an outstanding one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=3375329">Expand</a></span>

The game controls well, instead of it playing like a traditional crosshair based third person game, you aim with the flashlight. The movement of the flashlight is not as 1:1 instant as a first person shooter, however it controls surprisingly smoothly considering. The story is fantastic, with each segment of the game like an episode of lost, with a &quot;on the last episode of alan wake&quot;. Each chapter/episode also ends on a really quirky and mysterious musical number. This game definitely has artistic lynchian undertones without being obscure or vague. The game is also visually stunning, the only downside is the occasional low resolution texture. Mechanically the game has the traditional horror elements, however it throws in enough twists to make it feel fresh again. Light plays a huge role in the dynamic of the entire game, with each source of light being a checkpoint of sorts and every enemy being immortal until you shine them with your torch.All of this leads to the game being quite hard, as you can be taken down in 1 or two hits, so you need to make serious use of the dodging mechanic and stay constantly aware of where each enemy is - if they get behind the player, you might be swamped and die within seconds. The combination of the light mechanics, the involving thriller/mystery plot, the episodic touches, and some serious tension make alan wake unmissable. Just make sure you have a powerful pc.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2144919">Expand</a></span>

Well, the problem is that Alan Wake suffers from two problems:

1) The action is terrible.

<br>Well, it starts off strong enough  you get into the action quickly (none of this &quot;oh I don&apos;t get to really play for an hour&quot; nonsense) and you get into the mystery of the piece pretty quickly. What&apos;s not to like?
<br>
<br>Well, the problem is that Alan Wake suffers from two problems:
<br>
<br>1) The action is terrible.
<br>
<br>2) The story isn&apos;t great.
<br>
<br>The first is obvious; in the intro, you learn how you burn the shadows off of enemies, then you shoot them to death. Okay, cool, so they expand on it right? No. The ENTIRE GAME&apos;S GAMEPLAY is exactly the same thing  burn the shadows off of enemies, then shoot them. There isn&apos;t even much variety in the way of enemies  there are normal enemies, that cut you; fast enemies, which are harder to hit; and large enemies, who deal more damage and take more damage to cut down. There are moving objects that lift themselves up and hurl themselves at you as well, which sounds a lot better than it actually is  the physics of it is awkward and the AI sucks, meaning they often &quot;get stuck&quot; on stuff.
<br>
<br>Thus the ENTIRE game&apos;s action consists of doing the same thing over and over and over again, to enemy after enemy after enemy, with little variation. Somewhere around episode 2 (of 6) it wears thin, and there&apos;s a lot more to go.
<br>
<br>The collectibles, likewise, leave something to be desired. Half of them are stupid, and the other half of them, while okay, suffer from the problem that searching for them messes up the gameplay and pacing; rather than trying to get out of the woods, instead you spend hours wandering around in the woods trying to find pages and thermoses and other nonsense. It sucks; the game plays a lot better when you aren&apos;t running around trying to find stuff because (let&apos;s face it) the gameplay wears thin anyway, it is even thinner stretched out like that. It doesn&apos;t help that Alan Wake can&apos;t run for very long, and has to slow down if you have him run for more than thirty feet or so  that dude is seriously out of shape.
<br>
<br>Okay, so the gameplay rather sucks (even if the basic premise sounds interesting). What about the story?
<br>
<br>Well... again, the story kind of sucks too. The problem is that you start off the game with a mystery, and all&apos;s well, right? Well...
<br>
<br>It becomes glaringly clear what the answer to the mystery is early on, and without that mystery, there&apos;s just... nothing really substantive. Sure, the characters run around, and Barry and Sarah are okay characters, but Alan Wake himself is a bit bland and really it all feels a bit pointless. The story isn&apos;t terrible, but it isn&apos;t amazing either, which means that it doesn&apos;t make up for the mediocre gameplay. There is a brief upswing in the story in episodes 4 and 5, where it feels more fun, but the end of the game is as bland as chapters 2 and 3 were, and feels very empty due to the loss of any other characters interacting with you.
<br>
<br>Overall I can&apos;t recommend this game, but I don&apos;t discourage you from buying it either; however, it is average, neither great nor terrible.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2966167">Expand</a></span>

Even one of the characters criticises it as &apos;heavy on the metaphors&apos; which it absolutely is - exhaustingly so. By the time you reach the end of the third chapter, you&apos;re willing the game to be over in the fourth, but still have several more to grind through, with the last couple feeling drawn out needlessly so. The &apos;climax&apos; of the game, simply feels like the writers ran out of ideas, so threw in all kinds of surreal environments and events, none of which last more than a minute or so. The enemies through-out have no variation and you&apos;re still fighting the same enemies at the end as you were at the very start of the game. The visuals in places look fantastic (mainly during daylight which you rarely get to see), whilst in others (and for the majority of the game) they&apos;re pretty dire. The weaving plot does hold your interest at times and you do find yourself getting a little pulled in to certain twists, but they&apos;re over before you know it and you&apos;re back to predictable. Combat would feel satisfying if it didn&apos;t become tedious first. I bought it on steam for less than a fiver and it feels like I paid its worth.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2705733">Expand</a></span>

I hear people complaining about the fps being around 60, but that should be more than enough for anyone. Game is a bit too straight forward but the all the pros make up for those little cons. I wish that this game came to stores for PC earlier and there wouldn&apos;t have been X360 version. Crosshair being just the flashlight is one of the nicest details of the game. This game is not a FPS so there is no need for focused/zoom mode for shooting and I don&apos;t know what people are thinking about when they are wishing something like that for this masterpiece. If you want to play some FPS game with much shooting go buy your piece of Battlefield or COD this game is thriller a bit like Resident Evil</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2443475">Expand</a></span>

As a survival horror it&apos;s okay to good (sorry I think Amnesia set a really high bar) while as a game it&apos;s fairly fun to play through (I actually wanted to finish it unlike so many other games that I just got super bored with). &#xC2;&#xA0;<br>Performance wise it runs like a charm on my aging GTX295 at 1920 x 1200 (yeah baby!) so nothing to complain about there (shame on bigger devs for failing in this department with so many of their ports that look like crap compared to this). &#xC2;&#xA0;<br>So what&apos;s not to like with this game? Well sadly (even though Remedy has done a bang up job at this PC version as so many other Devs seem to fail at when porting to PC) it still plays like a console game and I just can&apos;t help shake that 3rd person &quot;must play with console controller&quot; feel it has going for it (I&apos;d love for them to do an FPS style survival horror game made specifically for PC but I fear their console monetary rewards will prevent something like this...at least we got this one on PC finally too!).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2150731">Expand</a></span>

The story was great, and it kept me hooked till the very end. The action sequences were good, although there could&apos;ve been more open areas, and more different places. I recommend this masterpiece to everyone who likes the action thriller genre, and in generally to everyone.</span>

I gave it a 10 because of what it has, it has a good story, the background, and setting is amazing, on Steam, they have collector edition bundle for $35 dollars, I love it, I go to bed with a flashlight beside me (so to speak). I have entered a unending night, I love Alan wake, as soon as american nightmare comes on PC, I almost want a Xbox so I can play American Nightmare sooner... I would say that this is the 2nd best game I played, and a major time sink, but then again, if i am sinking, might as go down with the ship! I will encourage (and yell at you) to buy this game, it is not horror, it is not a thriller, it is the best game I have played that is a shooter. I also love, how it pays respect to the whole horror genre, I don&apos;t like horror as I said but man! I may reconsider just to enjoy this game more!  If i were you I would be at the checkout already. I would of paid double, or more for this game, I can say that with a Bible on my hand, under oath. Best game you can buy...If you like Uncharted, or third-person shooters this is a must! Also, I am planning on buying all the books, all of the guides, everything, just to help support this game, I  may even buy the clock! I would be a lot more of a critic on this game if I had not played it, NOTE: I am buying a Razer Xbox controller so I can have the best PC experience I can! A couple people will whine about how &quot;this thing is wrong, this tree has bad textures&quot; i took a chance on this game, and I will NEVER regret it! Love this game, and I can&apos;t say that about a lot, or maybe a few...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2162534">Expand</a></span>

This seems like neither. I thought with the insanely high reviews this was a no brainer when it went on sale for 15 bucks. Dear horror game coders: Clunky controls that make you feel OUT OF CONTROL do get the adrenaline pumping, but that is not fear. after playing Rage and Skyrim (first person is ALWAYS better) the controls on Alan Wake feel like I am gaming drunk off my butt. Again, crappy control of the character makes you feel out of control but that is just ANNOYING in an actual game. I just looked that the universal stats on Steam. 12% of people did not even finish the first acheivement. I did. Now I am in a town (that is not a big spoiler) I have no desire to watch a ton of cut scenes, I want to either play a game called alan wake or read a book called alan wake. Color me annoyed. I don&apos;t suck at horror games. Resident evil 1 was an all time fave. this is no RE 1. After dying like 10 times playing RE 1 I finally got to a safe area and I was so pumped for the game. I have the opposite reaction with this game. I like to explore in a gameworld, so it is annoying to start a game were you are running your a@@ off just to survive. Stop to see the graphics? nope, I can&apos;t I am too busy running. I quickly realized it was better to get hit by the bad guys while running than try and take a stand. I am sure there are upgrades and better weapons but I only give it a 50% shot that go any further. It actually made me want to go read a horror book instead of playing a &quot;game&quot;. Off to amazon to find something to read. peace out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2335259">Expand</a></span>

The action comes thick and fast, and the narration by the lead character makes you feel more attune to the world constructed by Remedy. As you go through the storyline, you meet a whole host of characters, ranging from mad to simply disagreeable, but all of them have a place to be and a purpose to serve. The story is well put together, with collectables strewn all over the town for those who want to look a little deeper.<br><br>If you want a game that hails from the greatest horror authors and makes the concepts work, buy Alan Wake. As a side note, it&apos;s one of the few games on 360 that has never received a patch. :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2195495">Expand</a></span>

Very well done, Remedy!</span>

It&apos;s so rare that you actually get your moneys worth out of many single player games these days. You buy it, get it  home, beat it in a few hours and you&apos;re done. This is not the case with Alan Wake, you will get several hours of gameplay for your money. The story is simply fantastic, and original, as is the gameplay itself. Your not going to just run and gun through it and survive. It&apos;s TV mini-series style presentation is also very well done. You really do feel like you are playing a supernatural TV series. The overall effect is an addictive game that you enjoy playing, that keeps you guessing as to what&apos;s going on and what&apos;s going to happen next. If you like suspenseful horror or supernatural entertainment , then you are going to like Alan Wake. Yes, this game is a console port, however the PC version is far better looking than its console counterpart. Seeing them side by side really drives this point home. If you are going to port a game to PC from an inferior console, this is how you do it. Higher resolutions, higher fidelity, and DX10 features that no console can touch. Kudos to the developer for a proper port. The game played fantastic on my gaming system. AMD 1090T at 4.1GHz, XFX DD Radeon 7950 BE, 16GB DDR3 1600. Running a live broadcast via X-Fire through the entire game. No problems from the game at all. Very happy with my purchase and the gaming experience. So not only do I highly recommend Alan Wake, I suggest you play it at night, in the dark, with the volume turned up and in its full HD+ splendor. This way you can properly enjoy the dark side of Bright Falls.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2149467">Expand</a></span>

I really hope to see an Alan Wake 2 soon with a bigger budget, given what the devs displayed here with a cut budget and little time, I have high hopes for what they can do in the future given the resources they need! Pick it up if you have the change, its totally worth it and do remember, it was originally released in 2010 with a bootstrap budget so don&apos;t expect 2012 big-budget graphics.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2307623">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a story of great potential that&apos;s never realized simply because the developers really needed to outline and storyboard their story a little better.  Alan Wake is a game that probably would have worked better as an adventure RPG style game, but in trying appeal to a larger market, tried to make an action game.
<br>**********
<br>
<br>Spoilers from here:
<br>THE GOOD.  I like the atmosphere.  I like the mystery.  I like the episodic format.  I like the initial idea of using light to force back the darkness.
<br>WHAT I THINK THIS GAME NEEDED.  Variety.  Oh, look!  I&apos;m back in the woods and HERE&apos;S ANOTHER SAWMILL!  This game had some lovely scenery, and I would have liked to have seen a bit more variety there.  As well, many of the enemies are just cut-and-past.  I almost think it would have been better if the enemies in this game weren&apos;t humanoid &quot;taken&quot; at all, but rather indistinct shadows.  I&apos;d have LOVED to see the great fog-effects of the engine used to create shadowy, swirling enemies that are just shadow and smoke and darkness.  Especially if you add fog to the woods, and you have to spot shadows in the fog.  That would creep me out.
<br>
<br>GAMEPLAY:  I think guns were a bad idea.  I know why they did it, but I would have liked to see simply light vs. darkness.  Flashlights, flares, flareguns, even candles and lanterns.  I think the light vs. darkness was a cool concept, but the guns just made it mundane.  Again, I know why they did it, but I think it marred the uniqueness of the concept.
<br>
<br>STORY:  I loved the mystery aspect.  I loved when they cast doubt on Alan Wake&apos;s sanity.  That was brilliant.  But they didn&apos;t develop it as much as they could have.  They could have contrasted Alan&apos;s sanity and insanity, waking and dreaming, sober and drunk with the light and darkness.  It COULD have been the story of Alan&apos;s own light and darkness.  The potential was there.  The elements were there.  But somebody wanted a game with more mass-market appeal and said &quot;Let&apos;s make it a shooter.&quot;  Note to developer:  the guy who made that decision should be mopping the floor, not making creative decisions.  A unique and memorable work of art requires RISK.
<br>
<br>The story had problems.  First, Alan is writing crime fiction.  The references to Stephen King and the homages to HP Lovecraft don&apos;t fit.    Either make him a horror writer, or stop kissing Stephen King&apos;s a**.   It just doesn&apos;t work.  Second, If the darkness wants Alan to write the ending and finish the story so that the darkness can escape, why are all the taken trying to kill him?  As soon as it becomes clear that Alan&apos;s trying to destroy the darkness, then I can understand the darkness trying to STOP him finishing the story, but up until EP6, Alan&apos;s under the impression that the darkness WANTS him to finish the story, and everything points in that direction.  So why are the taken trying to fight him instead of trying to lure him back to the cabin?  It just doesn&apos;t work.  Again, they only did it to add action to what was otherwise a 3d third person adventure game built around a tone of suspense.
<br>
<br>Finally, the ending:  Alan Wake writes the ending:  he can write anything he wants.  So why does he not escape?  Why does his wife escape but he&apos;s still writing at the end?  Why is the darkness not defeated?  He did what he was told to do:  he brought the light and filled the empty heart with it and drove out the darkness:  but the only thing that changed was that Alan and his wife traded places.  He&apos;s still at the mercy of the shadows.  Why?  Again, marketability.  They want to set up the inevitable sequel.  It&apos;s lazy writing and doesn&apos;t take any risks because it doesn&apos;t require the writers to figure out a cool way to let Alan win this time, but allow for the darkness to return again in another form.
<br>
<br>THE BOOK PAGES:  cool idea, but not terribly compelling.  Many simply told more or less what we were seeing anyway, just from another point of view.  It needed more time to write it up properly.  In a game like Doom3, the messages left all over the place led to caches (Alan Wake handled that VERY effectively and in a very unique and original way with the messages that only show up under the flashlight).  But I didn&apos;t feel a real NEED to read Alan Wake&apos;s messages.  I just didn&apos;t see anything there that was necessary.
<br>
<br>What this game needed most was consistency, more development, more focus on the ideas, and less playing-it-safe by company men looking to maximize the market potential of the game.  I bought the game at 90% off on steam, and I still don&apos;t think it was worth the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=3209587">Expand</a></span>

Yeah, it was difficult to read all positives reviews not having a possibility to play on my own. But at that very moment another terrific game came out, which story helped me to forget about other stories in games for a while. Being a fan of Stephen King and liking Twin Peaks it is easy to fall in love in the story of Alan Wake. Not only you get fun of reading another page of manuscript, listening to another radio show or watching episode on TV, but also you are taken by gameplay that is one of the most comfortable on XBOX360. That is one of the games that makes you think that you will replay it again long before the ending.
<br>I managed to complete all the achievements and played through the games three times. Thumbs up, Remedy! Unforgettable moment  house container, where Alan is, is rolled by and thrown from the cliff.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2955261">Expand</a></span>

<br>Very atmospheric, I would have liked to go through the game without any combat.
<br>
<br>Wait for it to be on sale if you need to see it. The graphics and mood are interesting, perhaps a bit self-indulgent and pretentious... also confusing because it&apos;s a dream within a nightmare or something like that.
<br>
<br>I would have preferred a first person view, the third person perspective has its limits.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=3912273">Expand</a></span>

You really feel compelled to play the game and get through to the ending, to find out what on earth has happened to Alan Wake&apos;s girlfriend. Has elements of Stephen King novels, Left for Dead and Twin Peaks. The story, atmosphere and setting of Bright Falls is haunting and immersive. However, the non-linear jumbled up and sometimes slightly confusing tale of a writer&apos;s descent into some kind of psychotic darkness, only barely masks the utterly linear gameplay elements. This is game that where you literally have no decisions to make, and ultimately is a bit like a survival horror shooter. The combat is a little tricky at first, but eventually it becomes quite easy to manage a torch and gun - but I did suffer a little fatigue with having to deal with the same types of enemies. Plowing through the chapters was easy and addictive, yet could have been more challenging or at least had some forks in the road where Alan could make some decisions about where to go or what to do. In conclusion then I highly recommend checking this game out - it fails at being an outstanding shooter experience, and the story might just seem a little too far-out to get fully onboard with - but it certainly hooked me in, and would love to see a proper sequel someday.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2435808">Expand</a></span>

The &quot;puzzles&quot; are more like roadbumps that slow you down than real puzzles because they are so easy. They just take time to do. I really liked the beginning of the game but I eventually got tired of the repetative combat encounters that I stopped playing it.</span>

It gets the player really involved and the atmosphere adds to spooky feeling which this game delivers very well! The combat is excellent! The slow motion effects don&apos;t make this game easy also there is limited ammo to carry based on how powerful they are which feels balanced. The graphics have only improved on the textures, but its effect is still really well presented. But, this game isn&apos;t perfect. Auto Aim is permanently on and you can&apos;t go straight on to Nightmare mode which means the game treats the player like a noob from the start. Also, you cannot max out the graphics settings which is not surprising because it is a console port. Overall, this game is a good example of the effort developers need to put into making a console port, but it is because it&apos;s a console port that limits the game on PC. This game is on Steam and I recommend getting this one purely on the experience and story.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2233001">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ll break it down for you.  The storyline was fantastic and fresh; well-written for a game of this type.  The setting was beautiful!  If not for all of the thrills, I would have loved to pitch a tent and camp in the mountains.  The characters were well developed enough for you to care for them, and make the story-telling worthwhile, but not as developed as I would have liked.  I enjoyed the episodic format and opportunities to enjoy the great soundtrack - with both new and old artists; I even bought a couple of  tracks on iTunes afterward.  The core gameplay concept is very unique, but at times difficult to master.<br><br>The weak points were predictable moments of attack from enemies, and repetitious attacks.  Some suspense-building instead of constant suspense would have been nice.  The control system was definitely designed for a joypad, so I recommend using a 360 controller or getting a 360 controller emulator for your existing joypad; play the game as it was designed to be played.  Also, there are unreasonable difficulty spikes that made me feel I had to cheat the battle system to get through a segment instead of enjoying close-calls and bare success.<br><br>It&apos;s clear that Alan Wake was not micro managed by Microsoft and was developed free from a heavy hand.  It feels very much like a game made by a small studio, so the weaknesses and strengths that go along with that show in the game.  I recommend you give it a try!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2268002">Expand</a></span>

In this day and age when more and more games provide true choice and shape the outcome according to the choice you make, boring games like this with the 90s gameplay have no place on any serious gamer&apos;s shelf. The first hour or so was fun but after that I was bored to tears.
<br>
<br>Onto the more positive aspects: the atmosphere is decent, graphics are good and the surroundings look pretty and realistic. Too bad every good aspect is spoiled by extreme repetitiveness and dull gameplay with no true innovation.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2507672">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>This game is all about getting from A to B and from B to C (repeat ad nauseam) in a linear path. You have to reach checkpoints in order to save, so you will have to repeat over and over again the sections you hate the most, video scenes included&#x2014;and, oh, you will hate them. Honestly, I was so tempted to abandon the game several times.
<br>
<br>You are encouraged to explore everything (for weapons, story and the unbelievable 100 useless thermos) but the reward is not up to the waste of time and literally infinite enemies that will assault you.
<br>
<br>Bottom line: the story is good. If you like mystery books or Stephen King then, absolutely, give it a go, you will not find anything like this. Otherwise use with caution. Perhaps wait for a good sale? I could recommend it to some people but, honestly, I doubt I would have played it had I known better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=4296464">Expand</a></span>

Gameplay itself is a little bit repetitive killing same type of enemies over and over again but this is not type of game where some pure skills are required. It&apos;s just to keep you &apos;&apos;awake&apos;&apos; letting you know that danger is around there stalking your next move. Storyline tho is quiet amazing, deffinitely better than 90% of movies i&apos;ve watched actually. Well, i need to add that Alan&apos;s pal Barry is one of the best characters ingame i&apos;ve seen in a long time. When you heard him for first time you can get an idea that he&apos;s some egoistic manager who&apos;s keep calling Alan just because of moneymaking policy but as story goes on he&apos;s becoming a real friend who will die for you. His voice acting and the way he act overall reminds me somehow on Joe Pesci. : ) Overall it&apos;s a very very good product which doesnt require some crazy skill and storyline with it&apos;s atmosphere will get you after first 20 seconds.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2248368">Expand</a></span>

Game is fun, graphics MUCH improved over the 360 version, the controls are tight, and a little easier than the 360 version, although they have made the difficulty levels harder for this release.

Most certainly in the top of the horror genre. I was waiting for this game for six years since I saw the first E3 trailer and finally, it&apos;s here and I love it! It provides an amazing story, great, thrilling combat system and absolutely stunning visual graphic style. The story is based on a main character writing stories about himself and then living it, battling the creatures of the darkness. As you progress, you get your actions narrated by Alan himself, reading the pages he wrote, which creates an amazing, eerie atmosphere. This game is brilliant.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2146287">Expand</a></span>

Feels a lot like the old Max Payne games because it is the same studio, but totally different atmosphere than Max Payne. This game makes extensive use of light and shadow and it will definitely frighten you.<br><br>Once you get the hang of the gameplay then it should be fairly easy to get through all but the toughest areas. The scenery is a joy to behold and is some of the best I&apos;ve seen in awhile. If there is one thing that remedy does well then it is developing the atmosphere to make you feel like you are really in the game, Alan Wake is no different, great atmosphere, great story, and I really felt myself wanting to play more to evolve the story.<br><br>I would have liked to see a bit more variety in the &quot;bad guys&quot;, but that goes the same for nearly every game. The way that the story presents the characters makes the whole thing very believable. Basically, it feels like you are playing a Stephen King novel, and that is a pretty high compliment. There is no sex or depravity like in King novels, but plenty of frightening scenes and lots of malevolent creatures.<br><br>Being your flashlight!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/alan-wake/user-reviews?user_review_id=2263158">Expand</a></span>
