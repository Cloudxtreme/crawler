Having to pay $30 for the addition of community mods that are available for free is a disgrace. 8/10 for the game itself which is a pretty good RTS , 0/10 for the low move from MS studios. Buy the Gold Edition for less than $10 and save yourselves the trouble.</span>

I should clarify that I picked this game up during a Steam sale and well after the initial launch, so I didn&apos;t experience some of the same issues others may have seen. It&apos;s a solid update that was over-priced and buggy - pick it up when it goes on sale and try to enjoy classic RTS gameplay!</span>

<br>I usually refrain from buying  old games that were released before 2007 as  most have been a terrible disapointment. Even though the graphics look old, out dated and haven&apos;t been improved much at all, the game is ok to play.
<br>
<br>I find the game mostly enjoyable to play even though it is an ugly game with graphics from 2000. And with AOM  Extended Edition, doesn&apos;t seem like much  has been added or changed/improved. It says improved graphics, but it doesn&apos;t look like it, all that seems to have improved is a bit of water texture, shadow and some lighting and it&apos;s still ugly old outdated textures.
<br>
<br>I like how there is a mythological aspect to the game, it makes it more interesting for me, to choose a god and have various powers you can evoke, though rather limited, powers such as call down a bolt of lightning to instant kill a enemy. And a devastating meteor that will destroy a small area. These powers are very limited though, only being able to use once per map, so should be used wisely.
<br>I also like that there are heroes and myth units, creatures like minotaurs and hydra that become stronger and grow another head after a kill.
<br>
<br>I get bored playing too much, usually after a couple of hours, as all it is, is fighting and nothing much else. And I feel happy when I complete a campaign scenario and then feel disapointed that there&apos;s another one to complete. So I probably don&apos;t like the campaign game much as it drags on and on.
<br>The campaign takes way too long to complete, usually I like lengthy games, but not when the story involved is rather boring and the scenario missions don&apos;t differ much as every one is mostly just build your base up, build army, attack and defeat. I just want it to hurry up and be over already. The campaign should be 15 to 20 scenarios at most, not 32. I prefer to play just random maps in short bursts.
<br>
<br>And it&apos;s frustrating when you get halfway through a scenario, only to have the game crash and you try and reload a recent save but the save file is stuffed and wont load so have to start the scenario from the beginning again.
<br>
<br>I liked the game over all and say it&apos;s worth getting and playing at a discounted price for $10 or less, but not for full price as it&apos;s just an old rehashed game which has out dated graphics and not many improvements. Nothing that modernises or makes it feel worthy of the so called Extended title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-mythology-extended-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6010093">Expand</a></span>

It is only the older Age of Mythology and all of the DLC with a higher resolution, but the game is exactly as described. I had fun playing the original and the same can be said about this one.</span>

<br>As for the changes themselves, the water does look pretty. But I probably wouldn&apos;t have even noticed changed it i hadn&apos;t already known. There is absolutely NO NEW CONTENT added, it is just a rehash. I would hope they would at least do something to the horrible path finding and unit commands but apparently they could not be bothered to do that much work.
<br>
<br>BIG DISAPPOINTMENT
<br>10/10 for the original game
<br>1/10 for getting people to pay twice for the exact same thing</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-mythology-extended-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4186880">Expand</a></span>

Everything goes fluently, there is not too much things to learn, it is easy and it comes with something new after longer moment of playing. I like it, I recommend it. Good strategy game, even today!</span>

<br>
<br>AoM:EE is simply an updated HD remake of the original Age of Mythology. Similar to what happened with Age of Empires II HD early this year. If you are not interested in a better graphics, then this game is probably not wroth your money.
<br>
<br>EVERY single detail in this game is 100% the same as those in the original AoM. Nothing has been changed. This is simply a package that contains: Age of Mythology, Age of Mythology: The Titans and the Golden Gift Campaign. The only details that have changed are purely aesthetic.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong though this game is excellent. The graphics are much better than the original one (since the original AoM was released in 2002, it&apos;s not that hard to make the graphics better). New features include: Improved Visuals, Time of Day, Improved water, Shadows, Bump / Specular maps, Global Lighting, Antialiasing &amp; Ambient Occlusion.
<br>
<br>Overall, if you enjoyed the original, you will enjoy this. If you have never played the original, this is a good game to buy (at least better than the original). You will find it much more pleasing.
<br>
<br>The only person I would not recommend this to, is one who has recently finished the original game and has a small budget</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-mythology-extended-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4192164">Expand</a></span>

When I tested it back then, I felt it&apos;s uniqueness and as I progressed further into the game, I loved it even more. Then the expansion came in... My god was it good: a new race, with three different titan gods and new minor gods for those, (apart from the unique units and game system of the new race), the ability to raise titans themselves, and a new campaign. I&apos;ve been playing it until very recently, but unfortunately the multiplayer stopped working for me, and the support I could get couldn&apos;t explain the issue, so it was me against the A.I, which was a little boring.
<br>
<br>Then I saw this announced and knowing what they initially did with age of empires II hd (which was barely functional on my then recently armed PC) I decided to take a look on the new features and I liked them: there was a little graphical improvement, optimization for the online system through steam, and a night-day cycle. The widescreen support followed by the steam matchmaking system and multiplayer should be enough to justify the remake, right? Well no when the game is 30$! Just like with AoE II HD, Microsoft seemed to be out on the hunt of cash again, so this time I wanted to know and seeing it had been already posted in several sites I downloaded it in order to see the technical issues it bore and if it was really a remake worth of being called a remake. Expecting the worse I booted it and... surprise! it run smooth as silk, had a bunch of new graphical options (FXAA, SSAO, High quality Shadows...), widescreen support, and the minimum changes were appealing (new terrain, and water textures, light rays, redone door textures to match the race they belonged to...) so... It&apos;s a nice remake... It runs nice... WHY ON EARTH DO YOU CHARGE IT FOR MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL GAME??! TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BUYING IT?! AoM cost me 20 bucks when I bought it in the same year of its release, in a stand of my town, with the official box, officially labeled, perfect conditions, perfectly sealed... and the expansion cost me 7.99 bucks! it says it in the cover!! why in the hell do you charge 30 bucks for a game that 12 years ago cost me 27.99, if it was 10 bucks It would be on my possession right now, if it were 15, i would be thinking about it and i&apos;d probably had bought it, but for 30 bucks? hell no!, maybe I&apos;ll buy it after it lowers down 10 bucks or less, or maybe I just wont buy it and keep playing the original, because you&apos;re starting to seriously piss me off after AoE II HD and &quot;the forgotten empires&quot;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-mythology-extended-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4191883">Expand</a></span>

<br>I do believe however, that this game is worth the price. The graphics in my opinion are noticeably better and the whole steam integration makes multiplayer a smooth experience with no extra account to log in to. There are also some decent mods already available in the steam workshop and some truly awesome ones are bound to drop by at some point.
<br>One of my all time favourite games receiving updated graphics and a streamlined multiplayer experience is worth the time and money in my opinion. The campaign is always a lot of fun too, even all these years after the release of the original game and the added steam achievements bring more fun to the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-mythology-extended-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4191933">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Some people experience bad performance and/or lag, but this is mostly related to either using unfitting hardware or playing with people who they have a bad connection to. The &quot;laggy animations&quot; are caused by the bad connections, because it seems like the framerate from the game is connected to the netcode. People who played p2p games like Battle for Middle Earth 1&amp;2 and C&amp;C Generals online might know this system (game &quot;lags&quot; at 22 frames/sec when a person with bad connection is ingame to avoid disconnection screens every few seconds).
<br>
<br>I have had no problems so far except for having some bad connection games with animation lag, and quickmatches are quite fun to play.
<br>
<br>I hope that the netcode will be improved with the next patches, and after that it&apos;ll be fine.
<br>As for people saying &quot;30$ is a ripoff&quot; - well, they&apos;re imo wrong. But that&apos;s personal opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-mythology-extended-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4186995">Expand</a></span>

I have computer science education and have near 20 year experiences playing RTS games and let me tell you why this is a low budget piece of junk. I have played so many RTS games and never have seen a game where the hardest level is unplayable to me. It is obvious the game designers have never played the Titan level because it is simply not playable. This is due to the low budget nature of this game and the developers have not enough time to test the game&apos;s balance. Normally within 5-10 minutes of the game, you are rushed with pre-built(not built within time frame of the game) large group of enemies, which is all but impossible to beat due to the short time frame. What is worse, sometimes this large group of enemy appears within about 5 minutes, in which time you have built less than 10 workers! To make things worse, the AI has infinite resources and every 5 minutes it sends you a large group of enemies, but on your side, you have finite resources which means even if you manage to beat the first few waves, you exhaust your resources within less than 30 minutes but AI has infinite resources, the waves the AI sends you are infinite. The whole thing is ill designed.
<br>
<br>Also, the games has appalling routing algorithm and units often get stuck on map. Also controlling the units are very clumsy, for example the &quot;attack move&quot; move which is the bread and butter of the RTS games does not seem to work. It either worked like normal move or gets the units stuck. From these details you can definitely tell this is a low budget rushed product. Age of Empire 3 from the same company is about the same type of low budget junk.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-mythology-extended-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=4883625">Expand</a></span>

People have trouble getting multiplayer to work, the game doesn&apos;t run anywhere near as smoothly as it should, horrendous optimisation and NO noticeable graphics improvement. Basically a scam. Only buy if you really love the game or haven&apos;t played it before, and at  very low price.</span>

An RTS that uses the same classic concepts as pretty much every other game in the genre, because they work well, AoM distinguishes itself by being heavy on the fighting and light on the building.
<br>
<br>If you want to create a great city, look elsewhere. Here the choice is mostly about which kind of barracks or other recruitment structure you want. You can&apos;t rotate any building, no ma&apos;am. You&apos;re not in charge of building roads either; these are already there and purely cosmetic.
<br>
<br>The game is not about economy and management. The only alternative to fighting is to watch the villagers ravage the land out of trees. Same as in Rapa Nui except that you&apos;ll never lack of food since fields thrive everywhere. In total, you&apos;ve got 3 resources, 2 of which deplete in a matter of virtual weeks. The 3rd one is gold, because of the famous Gold Age, just after the Stone Age, as most books from prehistory will remind you. And because, as you well know, you can&apos;t build a wood tower without gold.
<br>
<br>Anyway, if it&apos;s all about fighting, fighting must be great then, no ? Ahem. Well, if a misclick doesn&apos;t eradicate your troops, the incompetent path finding will. Or the AI. You&apos;d better micro manage if you don&apos;t want your fighters randomly running after harmless villagers or hammering houses instead of, you know, actually fighting. Believe it or not, you&apos;ll find more choices of tactical formations and AI scripts in the Baldur&apos;s Gate series.
<br>
<br>So what is good then ?, you ask, since I don&apos;t give a bad note. Certainly not the tutorial, which teaches you everything you would understand by yourself in 2 seconds but none of the specifics. Not the alarm system, which warns you when watch towers detect invaders, but still requires you to manually ring another bell to tell your villagers to hide instead of stoically suicide. Not the descriptions of spells, or of why they refuse to work. Not the keyboard mapping; it would be a very good mapping if it existed, but it doesn&apos;t. Not the interface, which doesn&apos;t have a pause button. Not the pause key, which isn&apos;t easy to find, specially when it doesn&apos;t exist on your keyboard. In short, if your keyboard is too small, you can be obliterated while sneezing or reading a building&apos;s description.
<br>
<br>All right, enough pointing at the flaws, the game still works decently and one can have fun with it. Specially a casual player: don&apos;t bother with most buildings, use your limited gold to build walls of fortified towers to defend your base, and do all your recruiting in temples using your unlimited food, you&apos;ll be just fine. Because what it&apos;s really all about is the beasties, the cyclops, crocodiles, flying horses, giants and whatnot. They sure have picked Ray Harryhausen as their main source of mythological vision, and that&apos;s an excellent choice. I&apos;ve got a soft spot for the hydra, personally.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-mythology-extended-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6685699">Expand</a></span>

<br>I remember first being introduced to this game at a friend&apos;s house. I instantly fell in love with the portrayal of the mythological creatures. Controlling Hydras, Chimeras, Gorgons, and Pegasuses made me feel as if I were in another world. I ended up staying awake playing hours after my friend had gone to bed.
<br>
<br>I got the game for myself as soon as possible and spent hours building up fantastical armies and crushing my opponent. Looking back, I did not engage in much strategy other than winning through overwhelming force as a drawn-out build up. I do not know if this is because the game lacks strategic depth or because I was not aware of it as a young teen. Regardless, it was fun but I do not think the gameplay itself was ever what was enjoyable for me.
<br>
<br>I would recommend this game if you are big into the aesthetic, setting, and mood of your games, and if you would enjoy controlling large armies of cool monster. Ff you are looking for engaging mechanics other games in the rts genre will most likely serve you better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/age-of-mythology-extended-edition/user-reviews?user_review_id=6851906">Expand</a></span>
