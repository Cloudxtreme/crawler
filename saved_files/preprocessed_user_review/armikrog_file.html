Also the music and voice acting are top notch. So you are getting something that looks and sounds like a spiritual sequel to Neverhood...
<br>
<br>But then, there&apos;s the awful UI and the retarded puzzle logic that ruined the fun for me. Mind you, not all puzzles are badly designed. It&apos;s just that those that are stand out as they are so lazy, so nonsensical and obvious artificial progress barriers (and maybe artificial obstacles to prolong the gameplay time while you are looking for a logical solution).
<br>
<br>I found a few puzzles that were fun, or at least interesting. I can only recall one and in hindsight that puzzle was pretty much forced on you and worked as a mini game that you could not skip. But it was fun, I guess, so there&apos;s that.
<br>
<br>And then there are the non-puzzles you will get stuck on because the game at its current state is ridden with bugs that fail to maintain consistency in its world state, and thus you may think that something is a puzzle or is still a puzzle, when in fact you just missed or mis-clicked on a waypoint exit or... it is normal that stuff can teleport. Why not?
<br>
<br>Oh, for the color blind people, beware: there is a puzzle where you have to set a color code. No way to skip it, no option for color names to show up.
<br>
<br>Then there are the technical glitches. At the time of this review it is possible to not have a game saved because the save menu offered next to zero feedback about when a save game is overwritten. It is possible to get stuck in a place and have to restore a save game. It is possible to restore a game and glitch out a specific puzzle, so that it is impossible to be solved. It is possible to find situations where something happens in the game world that should not happen or appears from one side as the original state and from the other side as it currently is. There are also issues with the voice over sound quality, and sometime the voices won&apos;t play at all. There are issues with the subtitles too. On occasion, a subtitle will show something entirely different from what is spoken, other times it won&apos;t show up at all, or show up with a huge delay.
<br>
<br>And there&apos;s the awful static mouse cursor that reacts to nothing. There is no context-sensitive mouse cursor in the game. You have the windows arror and just click somewhere -anywhere that could be something- and wait to see if something happens.That&apos;s not all though. The hotspots sometimes are not placed correctly over the objects or creatures you need to interact with, and, in addition, some objects become usable only after other actions have taken place with no indication whatsoever (you previously get nothing when you click on them). And there is no indication of the exits you have out of a room - when there are not as obvious as say a doorway.
<br>
<br>If you can get past this then the game is a typical if not a bit unpolished point and click adventure game. I mean it can work like that. It doesn&apos;t attempt to do anything new, there are no clever ideas in it or unique mechanics.
<br>
<br>The game just exists as a thing. A kickstarted project that could have been much more if more dedication was put to it... or at the very least more play-testing and polishing.
<br>
<br>In its current state it&apos;s best to skip it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/armikrog/user-reviews?user_review_id=5525527">Expand</a></span>

<br>Many puzzles are hard due to bad design of the game itself. What I mean is that often you don&apos;t know what&apos;s possible to interact with. Often you find out by accicent and lots of &quot;ooooh wtf I can do that?&quot; moments. Can&apos;t tell to much without spoiling it for new players.
<br>
<br>Also, video and sound is heavily compressed and very distorted at times.
<br>
<br>It seems like 95% of the budget and time was spent on modeling, which looks great, but that leaves very little left to the actual game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/armikrog/user-reviews?user_review_id=5529770">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I see a lot of people criticizing the length. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a problem, personally, except maybe in the context of having spent 25 dollars for about six hours of playtime. I think puzzle centric games can do short just fine, and I think Armikrong would have driven me crazy if its repetition had gone on for much longer. The game is broken into four sections and you must complete the same basic set of objectives in each. At the risk of repeating myself, it&apos;s a tad repetitious.
<br>
<br>The game&apos;s puzzles are largely uninspired. Infrequently do you have to really analyze your environment and think about how things can interact to find a solution. Mostly you find some symbol or pattern in one room, write it down, and use it in whatever contraption just a couple rooms down the road. It&apos;s mindless. There are also block pushing puzzles, sliding tile puzzles, and a music minigame that comes complete with the shrill sounds of a crying baby. They&apos;re all serviceable, but not especially unique or compelling. Neverhood had a music puzzle too, but you only had to do it once, and you didn&apos;t have to listen to a crying baby.
<br>
<br>It is occasionally frustrating to control, which surprised me. The character switching mechanic is underdeveloped and underutilized. Outside of a couple of short corridors and buttons, the feature is never used, in spite of the wealth of interesting puzzle possibilities it introduces. There are many bright, attention grabbing buttons that you initially can&apos;t push for no immediately obvious reason, but there&apos;s fortunately not any pixel hunting here, so it&apos;s not all that bad.
<br>
<br>The music, visuals, and voice acting are good. I like the environments and I&apos;ve been listening to the OST outside of the game. My only complaint is that they didn&apos;t do enough with any of them. With rare exception, our protagonists don&apos;t really have a chance to emote outside of the opening and closing cutscenes, neither with their voices nor their animations, which is a tremendous shame in a game where the art style is such a big selling point. I actually found it extremely jarring when their personalities resurfaced in the ending scenes after being mostly mute throughout the game. As for the music, the game fell silent often enough that I&apos;m not unconvinced that it just wasn&apos;t looping as intended, so most of my experience with it has actually not been in the game.
<br>
<br>The story is fine. It&apos;s very reminiscent of the tapes in Neverhood, in that the pieces you collect don&apos;t make a lot of sense until you&apos;re near the end. The story&apos;s reveal is a rather extreme take on that idea. The contents of the story function, which is all they really need to do, in spite of the pompous presentation. You won&apos;t be giving this one any thought once it&apos;s over, but it&apos;s at least some motivation, I suppose.
<br>
<br>Again, Armikrog is not terrible. It&apos;s not an entirely unsatisfactory experience. It&apos;s just that it&apos;s a little too plain, straightforward, and easy. It&apos;s a point and click you can largely autopilot through, which is a very strange thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/armikrog/user-reviews?user_review_id=5524918">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I cannot help but compare this game to &#x201C;The Neverhood&#x201D;, since it was advertised as a spiritual successor to it and I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s wrong in any way.
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>&#x2022; Some parts of the game are made of clay, which is a rare thing.
<br>&#x2022; Nice overall design, somehow rich visuals.
<br>&#x2022; Made me replay and realize the beauty of &#x201D;The Neverhood&#x201D; for the third time.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>&#x2022; Lots of technical issues revolving around:
<br>1) localization (some of them fixed as of 1.01, but you still cannot choose the language via options menu or launch parameter / config), 2) subtitles, 3) cursor, 4) controls, 5) sound, 6) music, 7) transparency masks.
<br>&#x2022; Lacks polish and feels like an unfinished low-cost product, which is unacceptable for an adventure game which lacks branching plot and has almost none to zero replay value.
<br>&#x2022; Easy, boring, uninspired puzzles, some of them are recycled three times.
<br>&#x2022; Not heavy, but noticeable recycling of the assets.
<br>&#x2022; Inconsistent background resolution.
<br>&#x2022; Inconsistent use of clay, there is clay animated in PS.
<br>&#x2022; Not enough quality claymation sequences.
<br>&#x2022; &#x201C;The Neverhood&#x201D;s humor is not included.
<br>&#x2022; The story is dull, has no closure. Ending sequence is so ugly, it&#x2019;s cringewothy.
<br>&#x2022; Generic music which hardly creates any mood. Truly disappointing work, Mr. Terry S Taylor. No lossless OST in the Deluxe package, low-bitrate MP3s only.
<br>&#x2022; The resolution of the assets could have been higher, last time I checked it was 2015.
<br>&#x2022; Protagonist&#x2019;s sidekick exists purely for gameplay purposes, there is no smart or funny dialogues between him and the protagonist.
<br>
<br>Even though the game has no game-breaking bugs and could be played through, the release version still feels like a deep beta, looks like the QA was either non-existent or made by deaf and blind people.
<br>I counted the total amount of unique screens in &#x201C;The Neverhood&#x201D; and even though it&#x2019;s roughly the same as in the &#x201C;Armikrog&#x201D;, &#x201C;The Neverhood&#x201D; was a small interconnected world made of clay, &#x201C;Armikrog&#x201D; is just a bunch of screens.
<br>
<br>Verdict: spiritless successor of &#x201C;The Neverhood&#x201D;, the world would have been better without it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/armikrog/user-reviews?user_review_id=5529925">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The biggest problem with the game is that it&apos;s so short that the moment you&apos;d properly immerse yourself in the world it&apos;s over. And the world of Armikrog isn&apos;t nearly as charming and engaging as the one in The Neverhood. There&apos;s not much to explore, you can only interact with things that are needed for progress - with only a very few exceptions. I didn&apos;t care about the characters, or even the story that much.
<br>
<br>Everything about this game feels a little superficial. Yes, the music is good (not great), the puzzles are good (they&apos;re logical but a bit too easy), the animations and the graphics are good, but for example the cut-scenes and voice-overs (there are very few of them) have bad quality, the music and sound effects regularly stop playing for no apparent reason.
<br>
<br>One would think that nearly 1 million dollars that they managed to raise on Kickstarter and over 2 years of development are enough to create something that is not &apos;just good&apos;. But maybe I&apos;m naive or ignorant when it comes to game development.
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;d say that Armikrog is a decent successor to The Neverhood, I just expected something more substantial after all these years. If you loved The Neverhood, you&apos;ve picked up this one already anyway. If you love point &amp; click games, you might want to wait for a discount, then it might worth a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/armikrog/user-reviews?user_review_id=5520850">Expand</a></span>

<br>I got a new little notebook out to draw/keep track of the things I&apos;d need to remember for puzzles I knew were around the corner.
<br>
<br>As the game progressed I had this inkling feeling that...the end was right in the next room. I hoped that it would roll in to the world evolving and finally getting to see the scope of the sets/planet.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately that inkling was right.
<br>I&apos;m going to track down my copy of the Neverhood now as Armikrog has gotten me riled up for some klaymation clicking.
<br>
<br>Thanks Doug and the team for the ride. I hope we get the next chapter one day!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/armikrog/user-reviews?user_review_id=5523110">Expand</a></span>

<br>3. Too expensive for what you get
<br>4. Music is not nearly as good. I will say there is no music because sometimes it just bugs. The original neverhood music is light years ahead.
<br>5. It feels like they asked too much money on Kickstarter and didn&apos;t deliver. Really 1 million for this? They hyped with intro animation and few shots and people felt nostalgic and gave them money.
<br>6. To solve last puzzle before that you get to one room that have the clue after some events you just can get back to that room anymore so only if you were smart to remember what was in the room otherwise you can not solve it.
<br>
<br>7. I am giving it a 0 just to lower the game score, it is not that bad game but what they promise and what they deliver is just two different things.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/armikrog/user-reviews?user_review_id=5524882">Expand</a></span>

It was something unique and beautiful. The newly released Armikorg, i assume as spiritual successor to neverhood did not feel the same way as NeverHood. Firstly, I believe living character silent was amazing, focusing on his facial expressions was an important feature that gave a really interesting feeling about Neverhood main characters. Sadly Tommy and beak beak may be kinda cute but they just dont feel that way. They are bland and pretty much normal characters. Story wise, the game is not that rich either and the culture of world is not explored through  the art style. This was an important part of neverhood that seems developers have forgotten. The world of neverhood was believable, weird and kinda creepy where Armikorg feels like an industrialized world filled with plenty of similar objects. Aside of a few mildy challenging puzzles, most of the puzzles are pretty much the same or even they are repeated with higher difficulties, which got me bored after a while and i was keep thinking when this game will end for good. Nothing improves in this aspect toward the end of game and sadly the game is shorts and ends pretty fast. The art style and overall effort of developers is praising but it just will not meat the standards of NeverHood in any terms. Finally, I believe Armikorg is a wasted opportunity. it is very far from beauty of NEverhood and it does not come close. I wish they would have just remake neverhood with all the budget they had .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/armikrog/user-reviews?user_review_id=6685923">Expand</a></span>

<br>I backed this game on Kickstarter a long time ago, and after playing this game.. i&apos;m starting to regret my decision.  Armikrog may look like a harmless stop and click game, but the game itself seems like one long demo.  The plot is non-existent, the puzzles are recycled, and the ending is one of the dumbest endings to a game i&apos;ve ever seen.  However there are some redeeming qualities that&apos;ll make you at least check this game out.  I liked the use of stop motion, the music is really catchy, and the puzzles as a whole are really challenging.  If you enjoyed Neverhood, you may enjoy this game, but for newcomers, you may want to steer clear of this one.
<br>
<br>Armikrog gets a 5/10.
<br>Also, I was joking about wanting my money back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/armikrog/user-reviews?user_review_id=5922069">Expand</a></span>
