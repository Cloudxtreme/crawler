<br>
<br>Negatives:
<br>-The abstract telling of the story leaves a lot to be desired.
<br>-The mini map sucks. It doesn&apos;t display exactly where you are. It&apos;s like there are invisible sectors and your icon will remain stagnant until you change sectors then the icon will remain stagnant in that sector. It makes trying to find the pink triangles (story!) needlessly annoying.
<br>-Upgrades are largely ineffectual. Double dash is the only thing I found useful.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6519163">Expand</a></span>

This game is exactly what I always wanted: an enigmatic story set in a beautiful post disaster world, dark but awe inducing at the same time. I thought the difficulty level would throw me off based on all the negative reviews I&apos;ve seen regarding this but instead I found it refreshing. You will die, it is by no means an easy game but with patience and some co-ordination you will persevere and it is by no means unfair.
<br>The soundtrack is top notch being both ominous uplifting at times, just like the world you&apos;re exploring. I only wish the main game was a bit longer(although there are tons of collectibles outside the main quest) because I am aching to go back for more however I will give it a 10/10 because I applaud the effort and vision to put this game out there and I cannot wait to see what else Heart Machine has in store.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6409404">Expand</a></span>

It was a long time coming, (waiting for this game), but the years of anticipation have been beyond worth it! Here is my review, as succinct as it can be.
<br>
<br>HLD throws you, the drifter, head first into a vibrant, mysterious world. You wake up from some slumber to find a post-apocalyptic land flooded with gorgeous, neon-painted landscapes and scenery, made possible by some freaking fantastic pixel artistry. You begin to wander the land, still totally unaware of who you are or why you&apos;re here, until you stumble upon the contrasting elements to this world&apos;s eye-grabbing visuals. A vile, destructive disease has poisoned your heart, and innocent land dwellers have been slaughtered by dreadful barbaric wars. If that weren&apos;t enough, some dark, sinister force seems intent on either killing you, maliciously toying with your soul, or both.
<br>
<br>And so begins your journey. From here, you&apos;ll talk to villagers through pictographs (no words are ever spoken) and hear their tragic accounts. You&apos;ll stop by the local upgrade shops with their neat cryptic language to get a sneak peek at your later, stronger self. When you head out in one of four cardinal directions, you&apos;ll begin to master your sword, your pistol, and - of course - your dash/drift. You&apos;ll encounter numerous enemies of varying size, race, and attacks, and with every death, you&apos;ll understand how to outsmart them on the next life.
<br>
<br>This game is intriguing, and so terribly satisfying. Finding secrets, beating bosses, buying upgrades, you feel awesome. The combat is challenging, but incredibly rewarding. When you clear out a large room and just barely survive, there&apos;s a sense of accomplishment that says: &quot;You earned this.&quot; And to top it all off, through the entire experience, a gorgeous soundtrack by one of gaming&apos;s best (Disasterpiece) immerses you in this universe of light, death, and hope.
<br>
<br>I cannot recommend this game enough. Major props to Heart Machine, you guys are brilliant.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6572859">Expand</a></span>

The soundtrack (Created by Disasterpeace, and which I loved so much that I went out and purchased it) is a gorgeous tapestry of chiptune textures that go beautifully with the pixel graphics. The character design is fantastic, and the color pallet is inspired. Gameplay is simple but well constructed for an easy to learn, hard to master experience.
<br>
<br>The story is told without any dialogue or text, meaning it is subtle, but makes for a game that can be interpreted in many ways. From my own personal interpretation, I feel that the developers were able to convey a pretty thoughtful message along with a visually stunning and fun game.
<br>
<br>This is a HARD game. I have rage quit this game (bosses only). If you get frustrated with dying 10 times in a row in a single area, then this game might not be for you. However, this constant dying is part of the game&apos;s mechanic. In the first playthrough, you have 5 hp, but in New Game+ (unlocked after beating the game on normal mode) you&apos;ve got only got 2. However, I found New Game+ to be approximately the same difficulty as when I played through the first time, because I had gotten so much better by playing it through once.
<br>
<br>Hyper Light Drifter is easily in my top 5 favorite games. I&apos;ve played it through on regular and New Game + multiple times and it never gets old. Can&apos;t wait to see what Heart Machine produces next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6714495">Expand</a></span>

Yeah, you might die a lot, but it has no cost at all, you re-spawn with all you had, close by, to try again. Kind of like Hotline Miami, just not that fast, and easier. I found myself hoping some final bosses were harder, since you can make a lot of mistakes and yet kill them.

<br>
<br>What people doesn&apos;t seem to understand is you can postpone the bosses for later in the game, when you have all the upgrades. There is no need at all to fight the bosses early in the game, when you are weak.
<br>
<br>All and all, nearly perfect game, tight controls, awesome art and music. Totally recommended.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6251365">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The gameplay is all about timing. if you try to buttonmash stuff, you will be wrecked in the next seconds. I really love this dashing skill, you can combine it so smooth with slashes and rip the enemies in pieces.
<br>
<br>It is so satisfying, when you slay a boss flawless.
<br>
<br>The Pixelart style is really hitting my sweet spot. I love this grunged, vast and beautiful colored sets. Really mysterious dungeons. Zelda Fans will love this.
<br>
<br>i just can recommend this game to skilled people. this game will frustrate you, if you aren&apos;t into harder games.
<br>
<br>but you will really enjoy the punishment. -promised
<br>
<br>Art style &amp; graphics: 10/10
<br>gameplay: 9/10
<br>
<br>the menu is kinda weird when you try to swap guns... -1 for that
<br>
<br>ca. 20-30h playtime, when you want to find all secrets</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6254385">Expand</a></span>

It requires some practice and patience, in order to get used to the control and skills, but once you are set, you can progress quite fast. The graphic language keeps you intrigued and kind of doubtful, but I don&apos;t think this is a negative feature. On the contrary,  guessing or discovering what must be done, gives you a great, puzzle-like feeling. I think it is obnoxious when you get literal and textual instructions, and the game very linearly tells you &quot;you have to do this&quot; and that&apos;s it. Instead, HDL gives hints and you sort of discover the path.
<br>I found that improving the boots&apos; skills had me defeating bosses soon enough. Afterwards, I improved skills randomly, having a more enjoyable game-play progressively.
<br>Bosses are very fun, and minions in general are excellent. You get the feeling that you improved on every session.
<br>The only one thing I dislike about HDL is that hidden things can be bothering to find. I&apos;ve had my character rubbing on every wall and throwing himself to the void, in order to see if there is something I can&apos;t see. The chances of success are high, so you must remain on the same room for a while, go back and forth, in order to get things done.
<br>I am glad i backed this game on Kickstarter.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6303366">Expand</a></span>

<br>People screaming left and right about the North boss and I beat it on my fourth try (it was super satisfying mind you).
<br>
<br>I think people just forget how hard games used to be. This is extremely forgiving considering you get a checkpoint in every single room. Die? No big deal, you lost about 30 seconds of progress.
<br>
<br>People are just babies.

A few of its influences are clear from the get-go, such as the top down Zelda games, and having played through it, even recent games such as Bloodborne came to mind. That said it is still its own thing, with its own strong identity. This is helped by the brilliant art direction and pixel art animation, which is hard to fault. Disasterpeace&#x2019;s soundtrack is moody, atmospheric and just plain gorgeous. The goal of the game is to activate the four pillars located in the Northern, Western, Eastern, and Southern areas.
<br>
<br>The game could best be described as action adventure, with a heavy emphasis on combat. You start the game with a sword and pistol, as well as the ability to dash. Using the combination of these three tools is key to progressing through the game. The combat can be fast at times, although in some trickier areas a slow approach may be advisable. The enemies are well varied, with some being particularly aggressive. Most of these feel challenging and yet fair, although a certain plant enemy did aggravate me especially with its hard-hitting attacks. Often you may need to switch up the way you face the larger enemies, and it helps the combat from becoming too repetitive.
<br>
<br>You will find various other weapons throughout the game, and also purchase new abilities or upgrades. In the main hub area you can find a selection of shops to do so, and deciding what to spend your currency on can be difficult in itself. Unlike many games such as the Zelda series, the currency is a rare resource, with 4 small &#x2018;blocks&#x2019; being used to make a big one. The big ones are then used to purchase new gear. These blocks are found hidden among the environment, or after defeating certain enemies and bosses. If you find an area or boss too difficult, you may want to search these out as the upgrades can help tremendously in the long run.
<br>
<br>Exploration is another big aspect of the game. From the outset, you have access to three of four main areas - each having a unique look and feel. These are linked to underground areas, which are filled with hidden paths and secrets. Finding the majority of these hidden paths isn&#x2019;t required to complete the game, but there are still some you may need to find to progress. This brings me to the map, which I feel could have done with a little improvement, since it can be a little dubious at times. A marker system, similar to the one found in Axiom Verge, could have been a great addition especially when looking for a particular item or place. Of all the areas, I found the eastern area to be particularly confusing when going back to search for secrets.
<br>
<br>The boss battles are by far the biggest challenge in the game. The bosses guard the pillars at the end of the areas, and, as in games such as Dark Souls, can be as frustrating to fight as they are rewarding to defeat. Each will test your skills, in both dodging and attacking. Again the variety here is great, with each presenting a different process to defeat them. And well done Heart Machine to making retrying so painless; if you die in an area you start the area again with exactly what you entered it with. This makes it easy to get straight back into the action, and I feel a lot of modern games could learn from this (although loading times can&#x2019;t be helped in games sometimes, but that&#x2019;s another discussion in itself.)
<br>
<br>Music and sound design are excellent; from the more ambient sound to the more upbeat tracks everything suits the design of the game. The sounds are great, such as the satisfying noise from your sword swings or the little beeps your companion makes, nothing felt out of place. Overall both music and sound only enriched the game experience.
<br>
<br>Having taken around 16 hours to complete Hyper Light Drifter I&#x2019;m extremely satisfied with the game, and yet I also want to go and play more, to discover all the hidden secrets I&#x2019;m yet to find. Far from an easy game, it may put a few people off, but bear with it and you&#x2019;ve got an excellent adventure. I found the game as compelling as it was addictive. While there have been a few bumps in the release, Alex Preston and his team has delivered a quality video game, one that I hope many others will play and enjoy. Their hard work and dedication should be recognized with such a well-crafted game.
<br>
<br>I can&#x2019;t wait for whatever is next.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6246078">Expand</a></span>

<br>The combat system is fast and fluid. The game will reward you if you have nice reflexes to dodge or parry incoming attacks and will punish you for every mistake you make. Exploring in this game is optional, but also truly rewarding. Boss fights are intense, but not impossible. If you are an explorer guy there are tons of secret paths and some puzzles to solve.
<br>The art is just fantastic. The music and the world design are a true masterpiece.
<br>I would give a 10 to the game, but for its current price (19$ with 10% discount) I think the game is a bit too short, even with the &quot;new game plus&quot;  option.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6243052">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>But the Downside is that it has no dialogue or text just pictures depicting the situation and the Difficulty is kinda hard with no option to turn it down.
<br>
<br>so if you wanna have a experience you&apos;ll never forget play this game</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6416729">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yeah, it is a hard game, but if you give it any effort the difficulty is not an issue. You are given the tools needed to get the job done the game just doesn&apos;t hold your hand. You will have to experiment, you will have to think, and you will have to die - a lot. That&apos;s perfectly fine in a game like this. There is no dialogue, an extremely detailed and beautiful environment, and an enchanting and atmospheric score. You are begged to soak it in and spend time getting to know the drifter and his world. If HLD was an easier game I would not be enjoying it so much. I even found myself wishing one of the bosses was more difficult, as I took him out on my second attempt with basically no upgrades. It was easy because I spent time experimenting with my kit and realized one of my weapons could be absolutely devastating - even to bosses - at close range(chunking about 1/5 of their massive health bars with a single shot).
<br>If the difficulty is scaring you away DON&apos;T LET IT. HLD has so much to offer. You&apos;ll get out of it what you put in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6232309">Expand</a></span>

<br>The negatives I have for this game are that it&apos;s a bit too short,and a bit too easy (I am not trying to show off I seriously can&apos;t see why everyone says this game is hard, I beat the last boss in 2 tries,not saying it&apos;s not at all difficult compared  to the baby pandering of AAA games but I was expecting more), and I believe if it was a bit more difficult it would be longer, there are 4 areas in this game, each one I could finish in about 1 hour, if it was more difficult it could be a 10 hour game but instead it was like 6 or so for me, it can take longer if you collect  all the extra stuff, but  here is another negative I have with the game, they are useless, there&apos;s no reason to collect them(expect one type of the collectables but even those not as much) other than being a completionist</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6235725">Expand</a></span>

The game as a whole is just fantastic. It hits the right notes for me and I absolutely love it. One more thing - the game is not as difficult as people say except when your are playing on K+M.

While it can be frustratingly difficult, it&apos;s never unfair. Some of the best pixel art visuals I&apos;ve ever seen in a game. The soundtrack is always at the forefront, but when you&apos;re just exploring, it sets the mood perfectly. Fun, exciting combat. An interesting and beautiful world that encourages exploring every nook and cranny. I would have loved a bit more exposition, but the wandering, voiceless drifter works. The world does make you want more though, a little more backstory about what happening. Overall, well worth $20, and one of the best games I&apos;ve played this year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6232977">Expand</a></span>

This is coming form someone who played the game on a laptop with no mouse so when I say the controls are good, I really mean it.
<br>Everyone keeps saying this game is too hard, but I&apos;ve beat maybe 6 games in my entire life (and lets not forget absolutely the worst possible gaming setup) and I got through it. I think it&apos;s difficulty adds to the flow by allowing you to go through the levels at your own pace, and I think it adds to the tone of the game. Also, it&apos;s short, so if it weren&apos;t as difficult as it is, it might risk being over too quickly. hat being said, it is true: Hyper Light Drifter is hard as balls.
<br>My other criticism starts out as praise. The story is told not through dialogue, but through the world, and that&apos;s cool, it&apos;s just from what I can tell, the story the world is telling doesn&apos;t entirely make sense. Not too much of a problem, though.
<br>Also, I feel like it may be a bit too short.
<br>Overall, could&apos;ve used a bit more time in development, but a beautiful and lovely game which I would recommend to anyone looking for a challenge.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6355829">Expand</a></span>

You play as the drifter, a swordsman with the power to dash (or perhaps, &#x201C;drift&#x201D;) a fair distance in a straight line, which is used for platforming (of sorts &#x2013; there is no jumping, but many gaps need to be cleared) as well as for dodging attacks and navigating over some hazards.
<br>
<br>It is a stylish game with solid pixel art and a decent variety of enemies and environments.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, it also is a game where some seemingly minor control issues cause some frustrating problems, and several bits of content feel like they are vastly more difficult than the rest of the game, making them take a long time to beat and stretching out the game&#x2019;s length far beyond what it should be.
<br>
<br>The core of the game is the dash, the sword, and a small repertoire of guns. You start out with just a basic attack with your sword, but over time you can buy the ability to charge up your sword attacks, make dash attacks, deflect projectiles, and even do a multi-dash ability where you chain together dashes one after another.
<br>
<br>The guns are okay on the whole, but sadly, it is unlikely that the player will use most of them; the starting pistol, the shotgun, and the rifle are the three best weapons, due to their speed, damage, and penetration respectively. The other three weapons all feel of pretty marginal value and to generally be outclassed; I only tried them out shortly before replacing them, and unfortunately the shotgun&#x2019;s high damage is just so useful for dispatching high-hit point enemies you&#x2019;re likely to use it most of the time after you get it.
<br>
<br>This multi-dash ability, however, is likely to be a source of great frustration to players. The timing on it is very precise and isn&#x2019;t very regular; each consecutive dash has to be done faster than the last one (well, up to a limit of a dozen dashes, after which point it reaches a limit, but that&#x2019;s mostly irrelevant in actual gameplay) and the timing is very specific. If you press too early, you can&#x2019;t press again and dash; you&#x2019;ll stop. If you press too late, there is lag on the end of the move that prevents you from doing another dash, even though there is no animation associated with said lag period.
<br>
<br>And this is extremely frustrating for the few sections of the game where this ability is required; players may spend an inordinate amount of time on six or so puzzles in the game which require the multi-dash. Half of them can be overcome by heavy use of healing kits if you are struggling, but the rest simply must be done correctly, or else the player must start them over.
<br>
<br>Over and over and over again.
<br>
<br>This can potentially absorb very large amounts of the player&#x2019;s time, and is not much fun. Indeed, I nearly uninstalled the game after the first multi-dash puzzle I encountered took me a very long time to complete.
<br>
<br>There are also some other weird aspects to the game. For one thing, the player does suffer hitstun from some attacks, and the invulnerability period on getting hit is quite short. This means that the player can be combed by certain enemies attacking them multiple times, or even a single enemy hitting them repeatedly in some cases. This can be kind of frustrating, though it is largely avoidable outside of the arenas, where the player is more likely to get cornered and swarmed, but it happens on occasion, including on the final boss, and it can be a little irksome when it happens.
<br>
<br>More annoying is the fact that sometimes inputs simply don&#x2019;t register for some reason, or an attack passes through an enemy for no apparent reason. While this is an infrequent occurrence, there were a few points at which I used a gun in close quarters and a bullet went right through an enemy, or where I attempted to use a bomb attack and the bomb attack never registered.
<br>
<br>This is most noticeable in the arena section of the game. A bit of content in the town unlocked after getting 12 keys, you find a series of rooms that send waves of enemies at the player. You must survive ten waves of ever increasing numbers of enemies to win. Doing this for ten rounds wouldn&#x2019;t be that bad, but instead you must do it for ten rounds *five times*, in five different arenas.
<br>
<br>This stuff felt like it was intended to fill out time, rather than to really improve the experience.
<br>
<br>That said, the game isn&#x2019;t all bad. The game includes four major areas, each with its own distinct tileset and set of enemies. There are eight bosses in the game, all of which feel distinct from each other and all of which are reasonably fun to fight against. Fighting against groups of enemies in varied environments is largely satisfying, and the game does a reasonable job of keeping things fresh for a good chunk of the game, though it does feel like all of the areas were maybe a few sets of rooms too long.
<br>
<br>Still, I can&apos;t recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=7400025">Expand</a></span>

Heart Machine knows how to make a great metroidvania. To make it easy to understand, I&apos;m simply going to break down the major aspects of the game and score them individually based on its effectiveness.
<br>
<br>Graphics: 8/10
<br>+ Great world design. The four areas of the game look unique.
<br>+ Varied enemy design. Each area has their own plethora of enemies which fit into the zone.
<br>- The map is practically useless. It&apos;s a small gripe, but the map is about as useful as the map in LoZ:aLttP. It shows the general location of the player character and important locations. It
<br>works somewhat, but It would&apos;ve been more useful for the map to clearly show where the
<br>player is and where things are. The underground map is especially difficult to understand.
<br>- The perspective of the game lies somewhere between overhead and third-person. In certain areas of the game where platforming or timing is key, you can easily find yourself
<br>dying because you weren&apos;t looking at the game from the correct perspective. (Are those
<br>cubes moving up and down, or are they moving forward and backward?!?)
<br>
<br>Gameplay: 8/10
<br>+ The combat is fast paced and easy to understand. You can swing your sword in quick
<br>succession 3 times. You can perform a dash move in quick succession 3 times (unless you
<br>get an upgrade).
<br>+ The best aspect of the gameplay is the exploration. There are a lot of collectibles hidden in
<br>exceptionally clever locations throughout the game world. It&apos;s very rewarding when you do
<br>find something which almost seemed like you shouldn&apos;t have been able to find.
<br>- The game difficulty is unbalanced at times. In one area in particular, you have to fight
<br>dozens of enemies. The game doesn&apos;t work well in this situation. You can fight enemies in
<br>a fun, difficult and rewarding way in small groups or against singular bosses. However, it
<br>becomes a grind to push passed arenas filled with enemies which attack in random order.
<br>Imagine a bullet hell where the bullets just randomly flew around the screen. That&apos;s what
<br>this arena was like.
<br>
<br>Story: 6/10
<br>-  It&apos;s hard to really pin down anything good with the overall plot. The game tries to keep
<br>things mysterious by not telling the player anything in words. All character dialogue is
<br>shown through images of past events. This does add some element of world building and
<br>lore, but it would&apos;ve been much more effective if the dialogue was just normal dialogue text.
<br>This issue also leeches into the gameplay. You can unlock special outfits which effect your
<br>abilities, but you can&apos;t know what they do unless you Google a guide. The game has ZERO
<br>text to explain anything. It has similar visual story telling to the Souls games, which is a
<br>great thing. They just... should&apos;ve taken a step back. They could&apos;ve told a much better story
<br>with real dialogue.
<br>
<br>Sound: 9/10
<br>+ The soundtrack is fantastic. It adds just the right amount of ambiance to every location in
<br>the game and fits perfectly with the aesthetic.
<br>
<br>Overall the game is very fun. It has just the right amount of content. The game is challenging, but USUALLY fair and rewarding. I have no idea what is going on in the world, but it is fun to explore it and try to figure out what happened. The sad thing is, it would&apos;ve been so easy to make the world interesting. There are 16 monoliths in the game. Each one has some kind of language written on them. They easily could&apos;ve gone the Metroid Prime route and added a library which added the lore from those monoliths into an easy to access menu. That alone could bring the story from a 6 to an 8 or 9 if done right.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=7688848">Expand</a></span>

<br>? An update to the game makes finding all the secrets generally easier, but with one of the worst maps I&apos;ve ever seen given to a player, the game has no respect for the player&apos;s time if you&apos;re interested in 100%&apos;ing it. Exacerbated by such a massive (and at times randomly organized) world, hard to remember where what is.
<br>- Some of the secrets require a gun you can only unlock in one area of the game, requiring stupid backtracking.
<br>- The combat generally feels good, but also inconsistent in execution -- some enemies (particularly flying ones to the north of the map) are nothing but annoying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6959610">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Hyper Light Drifter is an absolutely amazing game for anyone who wants a good challenge. I will go in depth with details down below.
<br>
<br>-Art style
<br>Simplistic yet effective. The game art is style is nothing too complex or very busy and difficult to see what exactly is going on. The colors are rich and vibrant and really captures the 16 bit look.
<br>
<br>-Controls/Mechanics
<br>My god, they are absolutely great. Dashing around the world feels very satisfying and the combat is excellent. It&#x2019;s one of those cases where it is easy to pick up, yet difficult to master. Throughout the game, you will encounter large waves of enemies and having such tight controls really makes you strategize on what techniques for survival will work best. You will never die from the controls acting up on you or the game being completely unfair to you, it is always your fault and learning from those mistakes is makes dying a satisfying learning experience.
<br>A complaint I have heard a lot about from HLD is the game&#x2019;s map and how vague it is. Sure it may not be the best map in the world and at first glance you may not find it all that useful and also very confusing. The more you play the game You just have to give yourself some time to get used to it and the overworld shouldn&#x2019;t be so difficult to navigate through.
<br>
<br>-Soundtrack
<br>It&#x2019;s not really something that is catchy and you will want to listen to it every now and then, but it does an outstanding job creating the feel of being isolated and lost in its huge world. Disasterpiece&#x2019;s work of art is truly a masterpiece.
<br>
<br>-Plot
<br>The way the plot is told is very debatable. Some will like it and some won&#x2019;t. The plot is told in a way where it only uses still images and no dialogue to display what happened during those events and leaves the player to determine what happened. At first I wasn&#x2019;t very fond of this style, but it eventually grew on me once I started to piece everything together. It will make more sense to you the more you progress through the game.
<br>
<br>I know this is a really minor thing about the game, but if I were to change one thing about the game, it would be adding a menu to keep track of all of the items you have collected especially gearbits (the currency in the game)
<br>
<br>Do I recommend this game?
<br>YES, GET IT NOW. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT
<br>10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=7565338">Expand</a></span>

<br>Normally when a story seems unclear to me I count it as a negative but not in this case. There&apos;s just enough presented to provide something which is unique and open to your own interpretation.
<br>I loved the combat, it becomes very addictive. The dash mechanic can be a little unpredictable at times but it adds so much to the gameplay.
<br>The boss fights are particularly enjoyable. Difficult enough to provide a challenge but never overwhelming or too frustrating.
<br>The only downside is that it can be difficult to find modules at times so you may wander around feeling a little lost and it&apos;s also a little short (7 and a half hours on my first playthrough, 5 and half for new game plus).
<br>If you enjoy games like dark souls and furi as well as anime by hiyao miyazaki (I think elements like the giant warriors from nausicaa and as well as **** from princess mononoke had some influence on the game) then i&apos;d highly recommend picking it up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/hyper-light-drifter/user-reviews?user_review_id=6918962">Expand</a></span>

But the real gem of this game was it&apos;s artstyle, and the way that the art was used to convey the story. It&apos;s hard to think of another game where such a rich story was portrayed without the use of any words whatsoever.</span>
