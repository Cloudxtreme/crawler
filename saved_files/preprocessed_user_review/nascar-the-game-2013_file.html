<br>
<br>50 lap race on Bristol, 47 run under caution while I was involved in maybe 3 wrecks. I had pole position on Texas, and did 15 restarts in a row trying to get a first lap without a caution but it never happened. The AI would wreck each other before the first corner every single time. Also, if you&apos;re lucky enough to get through the first few laps and let the field spread out a bit, the AI will wreck you for no reason.

<br>Save yourself some money and steer clear of this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nascar-the-game-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3402715">Expand</a></span>

<br>First of all, AI is terrible and it crashes all the time.
<br>Secondly the physics are so unrealistic and forgiving  Making a 180mph turn in Atlanta/Chartlotte with full throttle? Sure, why not... still without spinning the car. Of course I&apos;m talking about &quot;realistic&quot; mode with all aids turned off.
<br>
<br>There are only two cool things about it when we compare &quot;NASCAR: The Game 2013&quot; to NASCAR Racing 2003 season  Career mode and proper rules like: GWC finish, double-file restarts and so on.

But I do LOVE racing games, I&apos;m pretty damn good at them too.
<br>
<br>PROs: Having never played a NASCAR game that was actually based on real NASCAR I&apos;ve got to say that playing with a controller and less control in that big mob of cars trying not to crash at 170 mph is quite frankly one of the coolest experiences I&apos;ve ever had in a racing game and truly had me on the edge of my seat. The racing experience is rather solid. A career mode is always a good thing and even though it&apos;s not fully fleshed out (as far as I can tell I just finished Daytona).
<br>
<br>Critiques: I&apos;m putting these here because they may not be cons for everyone. I see a lot of reviews on here about how the AI crashes too much. I played my Daytona at 200 laps and almost every caution was my fault. I was in some pretty rough crashes and was able to continue, perhaps if big crashes like this happen you should be out of the race if that&apos;s your thing.
<br>
<br>Cons: It seems as if the game is unfinished almost like the Developers didn&apos;t get a chance to add everything they wanted. (wouldn&apos;t be the first time a publisher pushed a game out before it was ready.) There have been one or two freezes that were kind of bad. I think that being a rookie driver in NASCAR should be more difficult, I&apos;ve seen how much trouble Danica Patrick has had making the transition on sportscenter. I&apos;m playing on Hard difficulty and I finished 4th in Daytona simply by making my pit stop times add up correctly and being one of the guys who doesn&apos;t pit on lap 195, this could have been because I messed with the gas thing a bit. I&apos;ll know the next race. Let me create a driver with a portrait and do interviews and stuff in between races, these kinds of things add to the experience and allow you to make up your own story, having driver rivalries and stuff like that would also be cool.
<br>
<br>Overall Impressions: It&apos;s a solid racing game, with a better career mode than most (it has one). It had me a more tense than most racing games I&apos;ve playing in a while. I had to actually work to get position despite the aforementioned ease in tricking the AI with pit stops. AI causing crashes there were only 2 in the 200 laps I ran last race, the other 7 were because I tried to move over or my car went a little too high.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nascar-the-game-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3337987">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In terms of gameplay I&apos;ve seen many instances where I can secure the pole by a hefty margin, but when put into the actual race every single car will out-accelerate my car, even off the start.  It makes it feel like the game has shifty biases to try and make it feel like it is more challenging, when really it&apos;s just frustrating.
<br>
<br>I rate at a 3 hoping that multiplayer without AIs will have some saving graces, but how terrible the AI is makes single-player unplayable for me.
<br>
<br>I would love a refund on this game if I could get one, and I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve felt that way about a game ever before.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nascar-the-game-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3319920">Expand</a></span>

Most people doesn&apos;t even know how nascar works, they don&apos;t know how to drive, and they whine about game because they can&apos;t play it. Most crashes are caused by inconsequence of player, of course Ai causes crashes too sometimes (but not every lap, like some users here pointed out, which is complete bullcrap). They do make mistakes, and that&apos;s why this game is good. On steam forums there were numorous threads about AI not making cautions or crashes. Okay, so devs fixed it, and now, they are complain that there is too many? What the hell people? Otherwise game is good, graphics are solid, Career mode lacks though, it&apos;s a abit flat, and you cannot use your own skin, but hey, you can still use your skins for quick races, multiplayer. Game has really nifty eye candy modelling, they are sure improved from console counterparts, and even if it&apos;s console port, this game is very nicely optimised, has variety of options to adjust, not like most console ports today. OH yeah, multiplayer. It&apos;s good, has some lag issues there and there, but it&apos;s playable, hell, it&apos;s freaking fun. I also want to point out that most reviews here are to bash Nascar because of left turns. Don&apos;t listen to them. Nascar is all about door-2-door racing, bumper-2-bumper, and this game catches the beauty of this sport. It has good stimulating physics engine which gives you feeling of the car, very good sound, nice in-car view which adds a lot of depth to races (some games lacks interior view like GRID 2 for stupid reasons), and crapload of other stuff. I am giving this one a solid 8, this game is fun, heed the mockers, heed the haters. This game is really good provides very nice racing experience, that every nascar fan (or even just racing fan) would love.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nascar-the-game-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3358031">Expand</a></span>

Many drivers can recall countless hours spent fine-tuning their setups on NASCAR &#x2018;99 for the original PlayStation, signing their first multimillion dollar sponsor on the legendary NASCAR Thunder 2004, or turning their daydreams into reality by purchasing a Nextel Cup team in NASCAR 07. While the occasional challenger appeared, offering innovating new career modes and racing series, EA&#x2019;s long-running NASCAR franchise experienced both immense highs and devastating lows, going from critically acclaimed to universally hated in less than a decade. Incredibly detailed career modes were steadily phased out, extra tracks and game modes suddenly went missing, and by the final game in the series, NASCAR 09, even the four makes involved in the 2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup season did not appear in-game, in favor of a generic set of brand markings for all cars.
<br>
<br>If, like me, you&#x2019;re not well-versed in NASCAR, you&#x2019;re probably thinking there&#x2019;s not much track variety at all, however if you only look at the shape of the tracks, you&#x2019;re right. They&#x2019;re mostly oval shaped tracks, though there is one track in the game that looks like a &#x2018;normal&#x2019; race-track. While the tracks are all the same general shape, the size, banks, corners and pit area are all different. Some tracks are large and wide, allowing you to pull far ahead, driving solo. Some tracks are small and narrow, forcing you to stick with the pack. Some tracks are a mixture. It isn&#x2019;t until you get out there and drive  or in this case play the game  that you realize how different these tracks really are.
<br>
<br>In NASCAR 2013 there are plenty of customization options to choose from. You can paint your car and stick it with sponsors of your choice. There is a lot of freedom in the design as you can make your own sticker using simple-shaped decals and turn it into one layer. Doing this allows you room to create detailed images and decals for use in recreating real-life stock cars or even creating your very own design  Not that you&#x2019;re likely to run out with 1200 layers available. Visual customization isn&#x2019;t the only customization available. During season mode you can unlock new sponsors for your car and also upgrade the parts using your race winnings.
<br>
<br>There are many different ways to get first place. One is Drafting. Drafting can be driving behind a car to reduce drag, then shooting out from behind it to overtake it  this is the type most people are familiar with  but it can also mean &#x2018;docking&#x2019; your car with another to allow both of you to gain speed. &#x2018;Docking&#x2019; is a bit riskier as it can raise engine temperatures, but can have a larger pay-off if you do it correctly. On the other side of &#x2018;Docking&#x2019;, there&#x2019;s Blocking. Blocking is simple and just involves positioning your car in a way that stops you being overtaken, but trying to keep this up can easily cause a crash and a caution  this could cause loss of position. Interestingly, while crashing brings up a caution flag, you can use this to your advantage and gain some positions by bringing the whole pack closer to first place and gaining positions on driver who decide to pit under a caution. Finding a balance between all of these techniques can be fun and cause for experimentation.
<br>
<br>In my experience of multiplayer, coming into this as a rookie, I was destroyed. In the races I participated in online, everyone was much faster than me from the starting line, almost as if their cars were more powerful. I think the reason for this is single-player upgrades carrying over to multi-player. In multi-player, the only race option is a normal race. This was a little bit disappointing. There is plenty of control over the parameters of the race, which somewhat makes up for the lack of other modes.
<br>
<br>NASCAR 2013 does enough to redeem itself from the negative pre-conceptions of the sport, but only if you give it the chance to. While there are a few minor bugs to be found, they don&#x2019;t detract from the well-polished and fun core experience. NASCAR 2013 is full of little touches that neatly tie the package together. From the ambient garage in the menus to your character&#x2019;s feet moving in first-person view, there are lots of little touches that just tie the game together well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nascar-the-game-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3322541">Expand</a></span>

I bought this on sale just when 2014 was released, so for 4.99 $ i wasn&apos;t ruined. Well I love Nascar and been playing a lot of seasons on NR2003 and been playing on Iracing... but I miss careers So I hoped for a bit of joy....... wrong very wrong... The game is just undrivable, I have tried for hours finding a good wheel g25 setup without success to have a good feeling, but i insisted and tried to get used to bad driving. So I went to my first Race, Daytona. I use 0 assists and was able to qualify as 1st! Great so the race started... Euh no Pace Car, no green flag adrenaline? The computer have control and release you on the line and then comes the worst You are in pole but your car seems sooooooo slow that they all catch you and don&apos;t seem to care  a lot you are there so they bump you all sides and you crash. So you star 43th from pole....
<br>
<br>Ok my race is set to 50% of real time so 100 laps I managed to do 60 laps in a row and was 1st again! (that would never happen in real life) after a pitstop (well there is none the computer controls it again, and it&apos;s horrible) but then by passing a slow car he hits me and create an accident (pretty bad to my car) but no problem my car restarts 15th! 15th? why? you don&apos;t know because while you are crashing it suddenly cuts the action and you are in restart line. In the restarts they crashed me 3 times. I did repairs and restarted 43th again. 2 laps from the end i am 2nd again! (yeah jimmy looks like trash compared to my driving skill :) ) an what happened again another idiot ai crashed me again, and restarted 41st I was able to finish 38 in the 2 last laps. I was disgusted by the way things went. But I went to phoenix, and there my car barely can brake and handling get&apos;s absolutely impossible. So stop i give up keep your crap and I will replay 2003 with mods. 10 years and not one freaking descent Nascar game I am amazed.

<br>Oh and by the way where are the Truck? where are the Bush series? at least in Nascar 2009 they had that and was playable even if it was to arcade. And then they hope to sell you some dlc&apos;s with paints... really? how about making a playable game, pitting, pace car, no auto start, Trucks and bush series.... nope Paints at 5,99, it says all about the devs! and 2014 is what a patch from 2013 at full price... Great great attitude!
<br>
<br>The only positive thing is the career mode with sponsors an so on but not being able to go far enough to enjoy it. The game is an overall frustration.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nascar-the-game-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3979058">Expand</a></span>

If you have the right equipment, it can actually be an extremely enjoyable experience.
<br>
<br>Using a controller can be quite frustrating, so I personally recommend a Logitech Driving Force GT wheel. The force feedback is absolutely atrocious in this game, so I also recommend using the centering spring in the wheel instead and turning all in-game feedback settings off.
<br>
<br>The online multiplayer is extremely buggy much like the console version. But the single player is very polished in comparison to the console version. The AI is more responsive, but they do still randomly brake check on super speedways in the lower difficulties. The car upgrade system is very basic and kind of pointless in my opinion. It is also virtually impossible to finish well in the harder difficulties in career mode until you have a vast majority of the upgrades.
<br>
<br>The paint booth feature is a strong point for this game, you can get very in depth with your paint schemes and even recreate old obsolete schemes from your favorite drivers if you want to take the time to do so.
<br>
<br>Overall, the game is solid and much better than its predecessor and console counterpart. It includes all sprint cup tracks and regular drivers and offers a fun NASCAR experience for PC. That is something that we have not been able to say in over 10 years.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nascar-the-game-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3321405">Expand</a></span>

It is so colossally crap it&apos;s almost beyond belief. My car actually stops turning whenever I&apos;m leading the pack. It literally just starts going in a straight line through the turn. What a pathetic game. The dev team ought to be ashamed of themselves. The AI crashes EVERY chance they get. In fact, if you&apos;re trying to get away from a crash, the AI just drive directly into you with ZERO braking. And if cars crash, there&apos;s a 99% chance your car will get turned around and around while other cars drive into you without even trying to brake. 50% of the time it crashes after a race. It crashes EVERY time after Texas. It now crashes after EVERY race where I get first place, which means it never saves the position and I have to try and get any position other than first.

<br>A MONTH after the first MP race weekend..

<br>The gameplay is just about getting a better car and hit the accelerator, if you choose any other difficulty than the hardest it won&apos;t be a hard game, but the hardest mode is just impossible to compete at the start of the career.
<br>The racing usually goes into a dull car train, no crashes, no cars trying maneuvers, just driving around a track at max speed, really boring.
<br>The crash physics are astonishing bad both realistically and graphically, I mean, if you cant make a good racing game, at least give us some eye candy. I chosen full damage options, even then I stop my car in the middle of the track, I get a car to slam into me at 300km/h and the damage on my car was a partially damaged frontal suspension... seriously? seriously?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/nascar-the-game-2013/user-reviews?user_review_id=3833069">Expand</a></span>
