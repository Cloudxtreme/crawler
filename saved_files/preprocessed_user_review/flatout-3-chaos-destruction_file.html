Made by the same team that made the horrible port Wii port of Flatout and not the original dev house Bugbear. Graphically, this is very close to Wii level. They try to mask it by using very heavy bloom &amp; motion blur but all for naught. The car models are poor and do not break in a fashion that was expected from a PC version of Flatout. As far as gameplay is concerned there aren&apos;t many redeeming qualities. The player car gets destroyed much easier than the CPU cars, the environments are nowhere near as creative as the previous games and the car handling is HORRIBLE. The cars feel the same, no matter what car you choose. Oh, there&apos;s no career mode either. As an added insult to the fans on earlier Flatout games and their great handling of car physics, these cars bounce around like crazy after hitting obstacles. There&apos;s nothing that reminds me of reality when it comes to the physics in this game.<br><br>All in all, this is a very poor attempt at using a well know name for a quick cash grab. If you want a REAL Flatout experience with polished graphics, sounds and gameplay, you&apos;d do well to buy Flatout: Ultimate Carnage or Flatout 2 instead.<br><br>This game&apos;s a joke. A bad one at that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/flatout-3-chaos-destruction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2019519">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The FlatOut series is one of these games where vehicular slaughter is a daily entertainment. Unfortunately Empire Interactive has been resolved and rights to publish the game were given for Strategy First that made the worst mistake ever. They gave right to the game development for Team 6. Knowing how good games they make, I was already scared before I started playing their game.
<br>
<br>Gameplay is presented with great difference from previous titles. And it&apos;s difficult to call it an improvement. There&apos;s no career and instead we have 9 events that has almost nothing to do with chaos and destruction. Many are copies of each other, for instance destruction derby, that changes only the amount of opponents between events. Other are hybrids, like offroad races, monstertruck challenges or speed races where the only tactic is raping the acceleration key on your keyboard. Amount of cars and tracks is not impressive either. Customization has nothing to do with cars other than changing the colour of our vehicle to more  one. Many tracks are mirrored or with changed weather conditions/time of the day.
<br>
<br>Graphics are failure over failures, even in this gaming generation, and the word &quot;failure&quot; is a very mild statement here. Textures are of a very low quality and they don&apos;t resemble even a 1% of reality. Rather everything in this game looks like a vomit combined with excrement. And strength of these ugly graphics is increased by the highest amount of blur I have ever seen in any video game. In normal racing games a hint of that effect is used to give a felling of speed for the player, but here the blur is so intense that is more obstructive than vision through 3 lenses thick glasses. Lighting leaves a lot to discussion.
<br>
<br>Sound is in some ways can be survived, but it does not save the game. The music is average and not many suit to the climate of racing games. This is very typical to Team 6 as they almost never find any good music. Same thing can be said about FX that is mediocre and cheap. I&apos;m always wondering if these were made with kitchen equipment.
<br>
<br>Physics Engine is so  up that Newton rolls in his grave. Every vehicle handles like a butter-coated paper box on ice. Drifting or taking corners is a challenge and handbrake is a joke. It&apos;s hard to get to the finish line without even a single crash. But Flatout is all about crashes right? Well, no. There is no enjoyment from destruction in this game. Damage model and hitbox are rather funny. Wrecking opponents car is more a matter of luck than skill. Stunt Man returns in this game, but it has been completely destroyed. Flight control is difficult and unresponsive and catapulting our driver through the windshield often fails.
<br>
<br>And now the cherry on top of the cake. Artificial intelligence. Most likely all opponents were born in the cement mixer, because they find a sense of life in randomly driving around and crashing each other until wreckage  nothing else. And they can do this even without us. In races they still show the knowledge on the same level as sidewalk. They don&apos;t care how they are driving. They are hardly trying to get back on track after crash and their speeding has no relationship with any thinking.
<br>
<br>The game has pseudo-patch, but the way it changes the game only shows Team6&apos;s lack of effort. No music in menu, dissapearing car models, removal of the HUD and worse game performance are a price for extra racing track and even worse AI of opponents.
<br>
<br>The game is a game, but the behavior of Team 6 is very off-limits. In reply to numerous criticisms onto a game, The Ronnie Nellis made an attempt to shame Rich Stanton on Eurogamers saying to him: &#x201C;It is clear he copy pasted the review from other reviewers, probably that German guy at Gamestar. If he would have played the game as he said he did, he would have had Update4. No way the game is too fast or has bloom enabled, since this has all be fixed long time ago. I&#x2019;m calling the Eurogamer guy a liar.&#x201D; He also critcised players for having cracked copies. This game on Steam costs 30 EURO, this is too much for such a crap. Additionaly, Steam does not provide cash refunds. Flatout fans feel disappointed and fooled. Team 6 thinks that they are good and the rest of the world is bad at making games.
<br>
<br>Overall, Flatout 3 is a crime against both gamers and fans of series. Everything in it sucks and the behavior of the developers leaves a lot to think about. It&apos;s like Team6 threw  into us gamers and said: &quot;This is your next FlatOut  And that why this crap deserves lowest possible scores.

I was a fan of all of the previous flatout games, but this is trash with my reasons for calling this below. 1. The physics of the car feels like youre driving on ice, and the cars dont respond as expected at all.<br>2.The menu system is horrible.<br>3.It looks like they picked random models online ad gave tem names and a random bio.<br>4.The game is no-longer made by bugbear interactive, this is probably why its completely different. Its still Published by the same company however.<br>5.This game doesnt feel like a member of the flatout series at all, i wish they would have released it as something else.<br><br>Things they got right?:<br>1. Integrated music player, its nice having your own music.<br><br><br>I really wanted to like this and i was genuinely excited to see it appear, but now i&apos;m just pissed off one ofm y favourite racing game series has been ruined complely.<br>Stick to flatout 1 &amp; 2, they are FAR superior games!!!<br><br>I&apos;m also glad i picked this game up as a part of a steam bundle sale on the entire flatout series, otherwise i&apos;d definitely be asking for my money back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/flatout-3-chaos-destruction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2105921">Expand</a></span>

The physics are soooooo broken even the first flatout had awesome physics. The cars feel too light almost as if you could fly, and battling with oponents in this game is a bad ideia because you end up flying away while they stay the same. Car Damage is also unrealistic, reminds me of the older need for speeds. This should have been called &quot;Bumper Cars chaos and destruction&quot; because that&apos;s what it looks like, and even playing with bumper cars or riding them is a lot better than this.<br>I strongly recomend to wait for &quot;Ridge Racer Unbounded&quot; which is being developed by the ones who made Flatout 1, 2 and ultimate Carnage (Bugbear) and it promises better graphics, better gameplay and the most important, better Physics.<br><br>Overral: This game should have never been released.

Buggy amateur work from a shovelware developer. Even the old Flatout 1 from 2004 has better graphics. It basically feels like your driving a shoebox on a railway, even if they lower the price to 5 bucks you stay clear from it at all times.</span>

What the hell are you guys doing? This game poped up from total nothingness and it shouldn&apos;t be arount anyhow! Bugbear must take back this franchise and work with passion and care, like they did with Flatout 1, 2 and the not that awesome Ultimate Carnage.<br><br>One last thing: Stop with the absurd non carismathic carachters, please!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/flatout-3-chaos-destruction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2105273">Expand</a></span>

When trying to turn, you car flies all over the place. And if you do try to brake at turns, the AI opponents completely run past you like they can handle perfectly. This makes it extremely difficult to win races, even on the easy setting. The various modes in the game are completely pointless - they make it seem like it&apos;s completely different, but in fact, it&apos;s just races with a night setting or races with monster trucks. The game is far too fast-paced to get into - they make it feel like it&apos;s some sort of simulation game instead of a fun, crazy racer. I could go on but I&apos;m sure you understand by now that this is a horrible game, and an insult to the first two games which were great. Team 6 should be ashamed as this is one of the worst games, if not the worst, released this year.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/flatout-3-chaos-destruction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2077486">Expand</a></span>

Keyboard and controller support is swapped, hence not allowing for any keys to be remapped. Then there is a &apos;The game did not find your Windows performance index...&apos; message and sets everything to low at screen resolution. This can be adjusted manually, but the annoying message remains. Plus it doesn&apos;t make a difference anyway. No career mode. No damage model.

I have played the FlatOut series from the beginnig and I know perfectly how it all feels, rides and crashes! Bugbear knew what it all was about. Team6 Studios have literally took this game for them and rubbed it in the dirt. It deserves a 1 just because there is a game. I am ashamed, truly.</span>

Instead of a fun racing game with an almost rpg buildup (like the other Flatouts are), you get this arcade &apos;un-controllable superspeed&apos; game that spits in your eyes as soon as it starts up.

There&apos;s a lot of problems that I&apos;m listing so I&apos;m going to really apologize for the length of this. But before you buy this game FLATOUT FANS PLEASE PLEASE READ THIS, HOLD YOUR WALLETS FOR A MOMENT AND THINK!! ......... There are few good points here and there but mostly bad points. The 2 good points about this game (which is why I&apos;m giving it at least 2 points) is that at least the graphics are pretty decent and there are more variety of vehicles but truthfully thats about it!! ........ I own and have played all the original Flatout games, but this one is far from the originals that were made by Bugbear. The problems with this game is that you do not have your own garage and cannot do custom upgrades as you win money. You can choose more automatic PRESET upgrades as you progress in the game or keep your car stock. Sorry but thats not like Flatout at all and I personally dont like it!! .......... Another Issue is that it is virtually impossible to even get through the first race on challenge mode because your car wants to go anywhere but straight (even with turning down the steering sensitivity all the way) you car will spin out from absolutely nowhere and for absolutely no reason AT ALL!! Therefor NEVER even so much as getting in the 7/8 position. Your car will NEVER stay straight because the steering is WAY WAY WAY TOO OVER SENSITIVE!! Its like driving a corvette with a supercharged big block that pulls over 800HP and driving on sheer ice with bald tires!! While the laws of physics OVERLY apply to YOU, and DO NOT apply to your AI opponents!! Leaving you FOREVER in LAST PLACE!! ......... I truly just about s**t myself playing nightshift mode!! FORGET even playing that one!! In this mode its just you and one AI opponent. In this mode it does not matter how you set up your car or what car you drive, the AI opponent&apos;s car handles 10 times better than yours and goes 10 times faster than yours. You have absolutely a snow balls chance in HELL of beating that one!! You AI opponent can take a square 90 degree turn at full speed and is off the map in seconds flat, you on the other hand CANNOT and you&apos;re WAY behind in seconds flat!!! ....... Once again the laws of physics only apply to YOU and DO NOT APPLY to your AI opponents!! Sorry but thats BULLS**T!!! .......... Lastly when it comes to the way the cars wreck, the physics by far ARE NOT THE SAME!! When bugbear made the game, if you got hit in the tail, not only would the body bend but the tail lights also broke. In this games case lets say for example: You have round tail lights, and you get hit on the tail. Your tail light will take the shape of whatever the damage is (maybe oval shape) but the lens wont break and also takes the oval shape. NOT REALISTIC!!! Bugbear made the damage and other physics more realistic!! This game is FAR from realistic and MANY things will happen in this game that does not make ANY SENSE in SO MANY WAYS POSSIBLE!!! .......... The whole time while playing this game, my facial expression was ........ O_o .........or........(O)_(O) WTF!!.......... It really is not the original Flatout!! It just looks like it, thats all! Its still in some ways fun to play on certain modes and tracks but most of it is pretty sadistic and will piss you off horribly, and make you want to quit the game enraged!! I can only play this game for about 15-30 minutes before I end the game in utter disappointment because I cant get ANYWHERE in some of the races and leaves me very confused!! .......... I have always been very good and a pro at most race games and I even beat ALL of the Gran Turismo&apos;s on PS3 (which is one of the most advanced and customized racing games on today&apos;s market) and I honestly cant even get 7/8 place in this game ........... So truthfully that says alot right there!! ......... I&apos;m glad I got this game at a discount because I truly dont even feel it was worth even the discounted price I paid. I am truly and utterly disappointed!! .......... Once again I&apos;m sorry for the length of this but FLATOUT FANS, consider yourselves WARNED!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/flatout-3-chaos-destruction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2068011">Expand</a></span>

My standards were too high. The overall look of the game doesn&apos;t resemble the older titles at all; there&apos;s a very cheap feel to the look and sound of the game that I can&apos;t quite describe. It&apos;s an odd aura of &quot;Why did I spend money on this?&quot;<br><br>Starting with the truly awful &quot;menu music,&quot; which may well be the only music in the game (not sure if that&apos;s a good thing or a bad thing), the main menu gives you about 8 different modes to play with. None of them are fun.<br><br>There are generic races and a variety of &quot;special&quot; races which pose no challenge whatsoever, as there are no penalties for driving off of the track. The tracks themselves are completely uninspired and boring, not to mention downright ugly.<br><br>The derby events come down to driving around in a circle with wonky physics which occasional make your car flip out of control for no apparent reason, while your cars percentage of health pops up in the top left corner. Demotion derbys are usually kind of fun, but the awful car physics make it dreadfully boring.<br><br>I truly cannot believe that they&apos;re charging $29.99 for this game. What&apos;s worse is there are probably people out there that are giving them that money. If you&apos;re considering it, please don&apos;t. If you see it on sale, don&apos;t buy it. I don&apos;t care how cheap it is, trust me, it&apos;s not worth your money.<br><br>I truly hope that this is a nail in the coffin for this once-great series.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/flatout-3-chaos-destruction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2150739">Expand</a></span>

Unfortunately the gameplay in the new game is waaaay to fast, its like all cars are on permaboost and boost is unmanageable. There was no way that I could see to select multiple car options for multiplayer from the get go. My assumption is you may have to unlock them? The environments were a little too cluttered for racing making it a stream of constant environment crashes, rather than with other players which is where the fun is. I have about 75 hours playing Flatout 2, about 1.5 playing this.

AND they got rid of the career mode!! i have never seen a worse sequel to any game in over 30 years of gaming! team 6 should all be rounded up and shot!</span>

<br>Even the loading bar is broken, yeah it has the most cars and all that but the cars don&apos;t work properly and when you crash all that happens is sparks fly off, where is the destruction. I don&apos;t care that you can break fences etc if I can&apos;t even break bits of my car like in the previous Flatout&apos;s, if a game from 2005 can why can&apos;t this. Luckily I got it in the Steam sale in the Flatout Collection so I didn&apos;t waste my money but I deleted pretty soon after playing it. This game is seriously a game you must avoid.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/flatout-3-chaos-destruction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2560416">Expand</a></span>

There is no music at start, no HUD, no cars in selection screen and the biggest failure in this patches... even DUMBER AI!!! How they can break one of the best racing game for PC? This is a reason why I gave this game a 0/10 but this game even deserve a 0, it deserves -100/10 to destroy a great franchise and piss fans with those ridiculous patches.

It was so different from FO2:UC, a game i played really a lot on X360. The most obvious difference is that the developers have made FO3 insanely much faster, more difficult, and going over the top with way too extreme destruction and crashes. But since i paid for it, i decided to at least play for one hour. At first, i had a really hard time not shutting the game down. But I kept playing, and after 20 minutes or so i really started to appreciate what the developers have done. I don&apos;t know why the developers decided to make it this different, meanwhile part 1 and 2 were so much alike, but i started to really like it.
<br>
<br>So i kept playing and playing. One hour became 3-4 hours every day, as from the beginning till now. I still enjoy the game, and find new cool things. The variety of game modes and possibilities remind me of sandbox games. Every week there seems to be a major upgrade of the game, including new stuff to play but also cool new features and bug fixes. I really enjoy the game. There is still room for improvement (more off road maps, better tweaking of the wrecking mode, smoother frame rate, some more effects, some more polishing?) but i really appreciate the developers making the new features like the &quot;classic&quot; mode which switches entirely to FO2:UC physics again, which is fun to play some times, but not all the time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/flatout-3-chaos-destruction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2079311">Expand</a></span>

FlatOut only gets either ten, or zero? Because only the singleplayer is good, and the multiplay is as bad as the singleplayer is good. The multiplayer mode you can forget:  It&apos;s poorly programmed by someone who clearly has no idea on how to build a multiplayer game. All functionality or features that you are used to are now removed or planted full of bugs. You want to chat? Does not work. You want to kick someone? Not possible. You want to race? You hit walls you don&apos;t see, lag is bad even on lan. Forget multiplay and you have a nice singleplayer game. They should split price in half.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/flatout-3-chaos-destruction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2316451">Expand</a></span>

First of all, i played this game using a 360 gamepad.<br>I jumped right into the game and did a couple of normal races. At first, it took me quite some time to get familier with the mechanics(and get used to the amazing amounts of speed), but as soon as i got the knack of it, these races were very enjoyable.<br>The graphic style is nice, nothing to extraordinary, but very acceptable.<br><br>Following the couple of races i&apos;ve done, i decided to check out Stuntman mode. Now this was a real treat. I always enjoyed the stuntman mode of UC, and therefor spent alot of time playing this gamemode. I came to conclude that i enjoyed the stuntman mode more than i did in UC.<br><br>Next i checked out the menu again, and was astonished by the amount of gamemodes that they had built in, simply amazing. To write something about every single game mode would simply take me too much time, so i&apos;ll say a little something about the other game modes that i enjoyed most while playing.<br><br>Offroad is a very nice gamemode, lot&apos;s of destruction going on, ramming other cars and total chaos all around you. Some of the cars do feel a little bit &quot;bouncy&quot;, but nothing that you won&apos;t get used to after playing one or two races.<br><br>Speed is a gamemode that literrally involves loads of speed. Yet again, the handling is something that requires some getting used to, but once that is done, this too is a good game mode.<br><br>And the last gamemode i&apos;m going to talk about is Big Battle. This is a classic derby mode, with 24 players total going head on and this is the gamemode i enjoyed the most. The mechanics just feel right, the cars feel as though they have weight to them but still manage to pump out loads of speed to ram the other players with maximum velocity.<br><br>Overall i very much enjoyed Flatout 3. I do think that the learning curve for the mechanics is a bit too steep for most players that just dive into this game, thinking that it will be as easy as the previous flatout games, but it isn&apos;t. It requires some getting used to, but once you do there is an awesome game waiting for you. With loads of customization available in each game mode, varying from different cars, to different car settings and different difficulties. So in short, put some time into getting used to the mechanics and you have yourself a very good racing game, with loads of content to be raced.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/flatout-3-chaos-destruction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2033652">Expand</a></span>

Racing, Destruction Derby, Stunts and Monster Trucks missions in one game for a small price, great!. No regrets at all I bought this game.

So much modes and cars and I think the game is more challenging because of the higher speed. Also the special cars are just awesome, I mean, how cool is it you can drive around in a london bus! :D</span>

The developers added much contect like race cars and monster trucks, and I really like it that you can also for example race in a normal track with a monstertruck. (or with normal cars in monstertruck tracks, which really makes them easy :) One of the best things is that the developers still patch the game, it already has 4 patches by now which fixed most problems and they listen to the community, for example they added more modes like classic mode that makes the cars slower like in flatout 2. Of course there are also things I don&apos;t like. One of them is that there is no career mode, instead you have challenge mode. Unfortunately you can&apos;t upgrade cars in this mode and I finished the 50 challenges way faster then flatout 2&apos;s career mode. Another thing that really sucks is that there is no one in multiplayer.. I really hope that after 4 patches more people will enjoy the game so that I can do multiplayer matches. Oh and I think the opponents are too easy most of the time, especially in speed mode.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/flatout-3-chaos-destruction/user-reviews?user_review_id=2088477">Expand</a></span>

I bought the complete pack on steam about six months ago and enjoyed FlatOut 2 and UC for many many hours. They were magnificent racing games that looked very well on my PC and were a lot of fun to play. I already read the reviews about Flatout 3, so I knew what I was up for, but since this game was in the complete pack I decided to download it and give it a fair chance. It was a complete waste of my time and bandwidth. Apparantly, this game was patched many times, but they still didn&apos;t fix the menu&apos;s. It looks ridiculous. The graphics look like they are from 10 years ago. Even FlatOut 1 looks better. The gameplay is bad. You have no feeling whatsoever with the cars. And it all just looks so uninspired and boring. It&apos;s not even a bad game in a fun way (like Big Rigs). It&apos;s just embarrassing. I usually think that everyone should give a game a fair chance. Because if I don&apos;t like it, you might, or someone else. Here I make an exception to that rule. I can not imagine anyone liking this game. I don&apos;t understand the positive reviews on this site. Seriously. Stay away from this game. Don&apos;t buy it. Don&apos;t even download it. There are so many better and cheaper games to buy, that will run smoother and have a bigger entertainment value. Forget this game exists. Forget.

That was enough to make me scared of FlatOut burial, and I was totally right. This... &quot;game&quot; not only shows true identity of Team6, it also breaks hearts of gamers very hardly. Entire game is like swiss cheese; full of holes. The only thing that game can be praised for is holding a Guinness record for most blur in computer games history. Team6 staff keep defending themselves from getting raped by angered gamers armed with barbed wires, but resistance is futile and these morons will definitely pay sooner or later. Strategy First did noting wrong here; it was set up by Team6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/flatout-3-chaos-destruction/user-reviews?user_review_id=3512403">Expand</a></span>

It is extremely cartoony and boring.  The awesome flatout physics are gone and are replaced with physics like Mario cart.  All the characters with their own traits are gone two!.  Same with the stunt mode which was so fun during parties.  Also, Flatout UC had an awesome soundtrack that actually affected the way you drive.  Lets say you drove on a track listening to an upbeat song you would take all the ramps and drift round corners.  While with a dark song you would drive very seriously and drive on the a pecks.  Though in FO 3, it is all the same annoying trash techno music!
