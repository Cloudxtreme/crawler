Youll even recognize some of the voice actors in it. Its got the same oldschool graphics and the point and click system best for adventure games. Great story, voice acting, game length, and puzzles can be hard at times. I reccomend to any fans of ADV games.</span>

Typically in adventure games, the hero does it &quot;just for a lark&quot; (the vast majority) or because they&apos;re a bit nosey, even though they&apos;re putting their life at serious risk (Broken Sword, Gabriel Knight). Don&apos;t get me wrong, I&apos;m not knocking those games, but there&apos;s a real sense of forced participation on the part of the main characters. Why does Gabriel Knight end up risking his life repeatedly to fight against an evil voodoo entity? Why, because he&apos;s researching a new book. Why does George Stobart go against an international conspiracy capable of assassinating VIPs? Because... he... does?
<br>==============================================
<br>==============================================
<br>It&apos;s the various motivations, and how nuances and morally ambiguous they can be, that put this game ahead of the pack. You never need just accept that they&apos;re in a room taping a sponge to a broom to distract the guard so they can go in and steal his cake so they can bribe the fat man guarding the keys to the scooter, just because that&apos;s how they roll. No, in this game it all flows through and makes sense, so the puzzles hang together better and blend into the setting rather than feeling horribly tacked-on (like in the otherwise fantastic The Longest Journey). And the other thing is the puzzles actually make sense. How do you log into the top secret computer? Well you hack into a regular PC, check the emails, get just enough info to get someone&apos;s username on the super computer, reset their password on it, then check the new password in their email account on the regular PC. None of that &quot;tie a cat to a pogo stick and use it to catch a passing pigeon, which you then glue a microphone to so you can have it fly outside the window and record the man talking about his password&quot;.
<br>==============================================
<br>==============================================
<br>The story is fantastic, the characters are believable and well-written, the music and artwork is wonderful, and there are some tough choices and genuinely shocking twists.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resonance/user-reviews?user_review_id=2495791">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Don&apos;t be fooled by the 1990s graphics style. This is one true gem of an adventure game. Everything gels perfectly together: the evocative storyline, the believable characters, the smooth dialogue and the puzzles. Ahhhh, those magnificent puzzles. Logical, clever, imaginative and well woven into the story - they just hit the sweet spot. Sometimes challenging, but never unfair and always solvable.
<br>
<br>The production value and the quality of this game is top notch. The interface is both innovative (featuring some really brand new ideas) and highly intuitive. The voice acting is among the best I&apos;ve heard in a long time.
<br>
<br>All this coming from a very small independent studio, who obviously know what they are doing and who put all their love into the development. Congratulations, XII Games! And special kudos to Vince Twelve.
<br>
<br>More than a surprise hit, this is a veritable classic on a par with genre leaders like Sam &amp; Max (original), Blade Runner, Monkey Island, Grim Fandango and Gabriel Knight.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resonance/user-reviews?user_review_id=5055981">Expand</a></span>

<br>And of course whats a good point-n-click adventure game without some puzzles? Resonance has some excellent ones; not too hard not too easy and nearly all based on logical real world solutions so even if you cheat and peek at the solution you&apos;ll go, &quot;Why of course! Why didn&apos;t I think of that.&quot; Also, the puzzles fit seamlessly right into the story rather than feeling like arbitrary sideshows (except one  the puzzle box), which is great. Some are true puzzles like decryption, cracking into safes, or keycodes while others offer up more traditional problem solving tasks. Looking back I can&apos;t find a single one that I hated. A testament to the fact that the puzzles don&apos;t rely on finding hidden paths, excessive backtracking, or copious amounts of pixel hunting. Okay, maybe a smidgen of backtracking on one or two puzzles, but the areas are few and quite compact (plus you have instant travel) that we are talking 5-10 seconds worth of backtracking. In the world of point-n-clicks this can be considered non-existent.
<br>
<br>One extra thing worth noting is Resonance takes a risk by altering the standard point-n-click gameplay ever so slightly. Instead of talking to a NPC and having a preset set of keywords Resonance adds a dynamic keyword system of sorts. You can drag any item into your inventory and then re-drag it onto a NPC later on to ask them about it (they call it Short-Term memory.) Kind of neat little feature and well implemented. Its not some drastic gameplay altering change, but it does gives Resonance its own little uniqueness in a point-n-click genre that is pretty set in stone in its ways.
<br>
<br>All in all Resonance offers up about ~11hrs of gameplay if you don&apos;t cheat and I&apos;d say worth a 9/10. Only thing that should scare anyone away from this gem is if you just can&apos;t stand the old-school pixelated art-style of the 80&apos;s/90&apos;s adventures cause Resonance has it and there isn&apos;t anything you can do about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resonance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3779164">Expand</a></span>

The character animations are good, each character has their own set of expressions. Some animations like walking around are jumpy like old 16 bit games. The biggest negative to this game is the graphics resolution, about the same as an old fashioned Sierra title from the early 90&apos;s. Since some of the puzzles and game mechanics rely on visual cues, this detracts from the overall playing experience. What is most impressive about this game is that it provides a good experience in spite of this primitive graphics resolution.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resonance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3148984">Expand</a></span>

I have a hard time thinking about a story line that was more complex with twists and turns in a video game than Resonance.  I really liked that you could grab subjects/objects as the topic of a conversation than being presented with fixed options as in most graphic adventure games.  The biggest issues I had with was the graphics (retro, so forgivable) and the automated dialogue for greetings with other characters that plagues pretty much all graphic adventure point and click games.  I would say almost every puzzle was related to the actual story at hand, except for a couple that seemed to be out of place.  If you are a fan of point of click graphic adventure games like the old Lucas Art Films games (e.g. Grim Fandango), then I think you should get this!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resonance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3911829">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve been playing adventure games since the early 80&apos;s, I started with the early Sierra games and Infocom text adventures. Graphics and sound usually don&apos;t matter much to me. But the graphics in Resonance are so bad they interfere with gameplay. For small items I often can&apos;t see an item, and I certainly can&apos;t tell what the item is. I thought the pixel hunt for interactive objects on a screen style of gameplay was dead and buried. The interface is clumsy as well.
<br>With all the great games Daedalic has been publishing lately I don&apos;t want to waste any more time with games that might have been impressive if they were released 20 years ago.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resonance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3839819">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In addition to this, the game wouldn&apos;t let me proceed past a particular point in the storyline, despite finishing all the goals (at around 208 points). This is very poor and disappointing game design, it&apos;s hard to believe it&apos;s developed by the team who made &quot;Gemini Rue&quot;.
<br>
<br>However, I will give it 4/10 for decent graphics and voice acting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resonance/user-reviews?user_review_id=2617545">Expand</a></span>

Made by a single developer, this game comes across as the type of thing one would find in a developer&apos;s portfolio for a job interview, not a released game. The voice acting is stilted and not evocative in any way. To it&apos;s credit, the story is somewhat interesting and there is some humor in it. The best news is that there is a demo freely available from the distributor&apos;s website. I strongly advise anyone thinking of buying this game to download it and try it out. If you like what you see in the demo, it&apos;s probably worth the money.

It&apos;s a bit like reading a book, you watch as events unfold but you can&apos;t do much about it. That linearity could be viewed as a complaint i guess, bit i was fine with it. The voice acting is rock solid, humorous and even touching at times. The puzzles are of good difficulty and you always get help by talking to the other characters, witch really helps to keep the game fast paced. It is by no means a super special something you never heard before kind of story, but it has plenty of twists that will keep you glued to your screen, it certainly did for me. Awesome stuff, it really made me reconsider this genre, i may revisit all the other games in this genre i have, perhaps wrongly, discarded.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resonance/user-reviews?user_review_id=2554806">Expand</a></span>

The plot starts off really slowly and fails to be engaging, taking ideas from the settings that remind me of the worst B-movies, yet it flies off around 2/3 of the game and manages to link all the elements of the first half in a pretty satisfying way; I wouldn&apos;t say everything makes perfect sense and the reasoning of the characters may set you off for their illogical reactions, but all you need to know is explained. The ending doesn&apos;t really live up to the pathos that was built up a bit before, but it&apos;s still satisfying and provides closure. About the puzzles, I actually found it to be extremely logic, but too much straightforward; if you follow the plot with attention it&apos;s pretty unlikely you&apos;d be stuck up, mostly because they require you to put together simple clues that were given a bit before; I sadly found the characters&apos; conversation to be not subtle at all and basically spoiling most of the actual solutions. The voice acting was bittersweet; a couple of characters were extremely impressive, while the other were utterly terrible; I really hope Wadjeteye will get enough budget to get a more professional cast in the future releases.
<br>The middle part opened up, which was a nice surprise in this kind of game, yet I was surprised by the overall length, which does feel short for a game that was in development for five years. Yet I&apos;m nitpicking; the game is worth the price and is a great gem in the indie substrate; you&apos;ll find a great price/value ratio in this game; despite some little flaw, some small original idea and the care that was given to this project will probably make you happy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resonance/user-reviews?user_review_id=2501838">Expand</a></span>

<br>Its an old school point-click adventure with a very solid and interesting story, cool characters, nice dialogues, an interesting interactive and inventory system (still a bit clunky in some occasions), and well...
<br>overall i recommend any gamer interested in those adventures to pick this one, anyway i feel to point out also that the game has some flaws.
<br>The most annoying aspect is about the music, that in most occasions is 20 seconds (terrible) sample looping endlessly which cant be turned off if not switching off all the game sounds.
<br>Sometimes spending 15 mins in a room trying to figure out what to do with this music loop even out of sync at times gets me mad and made me switch off the sound.
<br>Another aspect which can be personal taste, is the fact imo the game is a bit too much hardcore at times in therm of illogic things to do or try/error situations.
<br>Overall compared to the real old adventures average difficulty, like Lucas ones, this one is a bit more accessible luckily, but in some occasions its defo frustrating.
<br>In most occasions it will be logic how to go on, it will be cool and satisfying, puzzles and situations in general are rewarding without asking too much time and it will rarely be required the tedious try-to-combine-random-things-hoping-it works that was a bit too much standard especially back in the 80&apos;s and early 90&apos;s...
<br>Still there are 3-4 situations where its really hard if not impossible to figure out how to go on in this game and i think this aspect should have been lifted a bit, as beside it was quite normal back in the days to be stuck in those kind of games, still i feel actually this aspect of hardcore try/error-pixelhunt is no more fun/satisfying as gameplay.
<br>Sometimes it happens to figure out that you are trying to do the right thing but the game doesnt allow you yet cause you need first to talk to npc A or show item X to person Y to make the action you wanna do possible.
<br>Anyway its my personal opinion, this game as old/school point and click adventure is really cool including the plus and minus that were present usually in those kind of games, just i personally think that it could be more modern and appealing to have a game like this not easier to complete in therm of puzzles, but more logic with less try/error hard steps, as its very satisfying to go on in those kind of games on alone, but the need to read a guide to pass some specific points strip away a bit of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resonance/user-reviews?user_review_id=2783869">Expand</a></span>

I finished it in two days cause the story and the way that is explained and told to you is done in a perfect way. The puzzle are tough yeah, but not impossible (if you&apos;re looking for &quot;impossible puzzles&quot; play Grim Fandango) you just have to you use your brain to get around difficulties! The short/long memory system is innovating and a very, very nice way to dialogue between characters and NPC.
<br>
<br>In my opinion, this is way better than grim fandango and also slightly better than Moment of Silence. My advice? BUY IT in order to support indies, you wont be disappointed!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resonance/user-reviews?user_review_id=2570429">Expand</a></span>

They start out being introduced one-by-one but later on you get to play them simultaneously. The story is the big strength, spiced with some interesting character interplay/dialogue and twists. The puzzles start out simple but get more complex as the plot evolves. Resonance introduces a memory system which enhances what you can talk about in dialogues, similar to what you have as an inventory - an inventory of the mind, if you will. Although the puzzles are overall very well done, there were a few frustrating ones relying on exactly the memory aspect that in my opinion spoiled this element which is so vital to the game. The story is pretty good with clever surprises and sometimes the development is influenced by your choices. In principal, I was satisfied with the ending although the cut-scenes to all different endings seem somewhat over-the-top and a little non-credible. Resonance is worth the money if you like adventures heavy with puzzles.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resonance/user-reviews?user_review_id=2802527">Expand</a></span>

The way the game let me talk to other characters about someone behind their back, but refuse to do so when they&apos;re in the room was an amusing find, I think the developers really put thought into the dialogue and reactions the characters would have to different situations, characters and items (except the detective). The story was gripping and kept me guessing. I finished this game in one sitting and I enjoyed it immensely. That said, I wish they made better use of the memory mechanic, it&apos;s a neat idea, but it was rarely used in actual puzzle solving.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resonance/user-reviews?user_review_id=3225104">Expand</a></span>

Usually the only chore with this genre is that sometimes there is no rhyme or reason to the puzzles, and one ends up clicking and combining everything possible in order to proceed.
<br>
<br>This game has a similar problem with a twist. Most of the time it is clear WHAT should be done, and the actions make sense as such, but the user interface is so horrid it regularly is nigh impossible to figure out HOW to do it. In general, the game&apos;s UI makes doing anything at all as hard as possible, and not in an entertaining manner.
<br>
<br>Just an example: there is a thing you need to read to gain crucial information, and it is made clear you can&apos;t take the thing with you. In most games, simply reading the thing would unlock dialogue options related to it. Not here; you have to figure out that you CAN drag-and-drop the thing into a special inventory (&quot;short term memory&quot;), where it becomes a conversation item, that can then be used in dialogues elsewhere. Anything can be dragged into this inventory, but only a few items can be stored there at one time; as it is often not clear which STM items are important and where they should be used, this quickly becomes very annoying. (To muddy the waters even further, there&apos;s also a third separate inventory, for &quot;long term memories&quot;. They also need to be used like items.)
<br>
<br>There are not enough saving graces either. Having several playable characters is an intriguing idea and one plot twist and a couple of puzzles utilize it nicely, but it also multiplies the irksomeness of the overly convoluted inventory system. (And that&apos;s a major issue, because most of the gameplay in this genre consists of inventory management.) The story is OK, but not very original. Graphics are very retro and get the job done, but are nothing to write home about. The characters are clich&#xE9;d and lack depth. Dialogues are vapid. Atypically for a Wadjet Eye Games product, even voice acting and music are stale. And the vexing trial-and-error games in the end ensure the whole thing ends on a sour note.
<br>
<br>I crawled my way through, but playing this game felt like working a never-ending shift in an office where someone regularly hides your mouse and keyboard.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/resonance/user-reviews?user_review_id=7407626">Expand</a></span>
