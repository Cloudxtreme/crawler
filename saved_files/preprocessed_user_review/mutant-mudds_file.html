<br>This is one of those, except made in the 21st century.
<br>
<br>The game has solid level design and a large number of short, reasonably clever levels. You must navigate through the environment with nothing but a slow-firing, short-ranged gun and the ablity to jump + hover (though later on, you can unlock some abilities which you can equip one of at any given time which make you somewhat better at platforming). There are 20 levels in the main game, plus 20 bonus mini-levels hidden in those levels, plus an additional 20 post-game levels and 20 bonus post-game mini-levels. The levels only take a few minutes to beat, generally speaking, but some of the later ones are fairly challenging and might require you to keep trying time and again until you beat them. Every level has a single checkpoint in it, which is mostly adequete for the task, though a couple of late-game levels are long enough that dying right before the checkpoint/end of the level is wasting a minute or two of time.
<br>
<br>That being said, there is literally nothing else there; the graphics are okay but nothing to write home about, and the story is a more bare-bones excuse plot than Super Mario Brothers - it is very vague and uninspiring, and I really had no strong feeling about how what I was doing was actually helping in any way, or even what it was I was purportedly trying to accomplish. Consequently, the game has a real feeling of pointlessness around it.
<br>
<br>Still, the game isn&apos;t bad; it just isn&apos;t great. If you are interested in doing some random platforming, it isn&apos;t a bad choice, but honestly, you can do better, and there&apos;s no reason to go out of your way to play this particular game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mutant-mudds/user-reviews?user_review_id=5867003">Expand</a></span>
