It was a toss back to the original Pirates! that I played endlessly on my Commodore 64. I&apos;ve spent many hours so far playing the game and have only completed 2 scenarios, yes the game is repetative, but then so was Pirates! The biggest drawback I see is that you can only have one (1) ship in combat no matter how many are in your fleet, and then you go against how ever many are in the other fleet. Personally I&apos;ve gone 1 on 4, that add a touch of challenge, but also frustration in the fact that I had 6 or more ships in my fleet. All in all a good game with plenty of replay value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pirate-hunter/user-reviews?user_review_id=678053">Expand</a></span>
