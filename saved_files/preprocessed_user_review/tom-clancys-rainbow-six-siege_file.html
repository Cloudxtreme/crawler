I&apos;d suggest you join a clan because pubbing alone is not a viable option. Other than that, it gets a 9/10. I love everything about it, but if it had more maps, it would have a solid 10.

But definitely not worth your $60 right now. Issues include laggy servers; buggy netcode; limbs poking through walls (leading to stupid deaths with many cheating accusations); not receiving any renown (credits used to unlock characters) or XP after matches; the annoying (standard now) ubisoft payment plan, $60 for an incomplete game, then charge for credits to buy extra items and boosters to help unlock characters or items. There are so many little and large issues that I can&apos;t recommend anyone to buy it at the moment. It&apos;s a REALLY fun game, when it works. But it&apos;s really infuriating with some of the issues that the developers failed to iron out after the closed, or open beta stages of development.
<br>
<br>Also, f**k ubisoft. You get around 300 renown/match, and you usually don&apos;t even get any XP or Renown from matches, due to a really annoying bug, and the ops (characters) start at 500, going up in increments of 500 up to around 2500 (I think.) It takes absolutely forever to unlock all 20 ops at this rate.
<br>
<br>Anyways, the gameplay is great. If they fixed the netcode, and the annoying little bugs, I&apos;m sure it could be a contender for CS:GO.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5849458">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m not sure who took over when Tom Clancy passed away but they are doing an awful job trying to cash in on the legendary writers name. Tom always wanted his name to represent quality and that is why Rainbow Six was always known as a special forces simulator. Every time I played it since childhood I had a blast. Rainbow six is the sole reason that fueled my interest in military life and eventually led me to serve my country.
<br>
<br>-The is probably the biggest disappointment of the year for me and probably any fan of the franchise. No single player?! What? Rainbow six always had an amazing single player experience, multiplayer was just an addition. This is by far the biggest negative the game has.
<br>
<br>-The game plays like a mix of call of duty and battlefield, this is not a good thing because Rainbow six was always unique in it&apos;s own style. It was the arma or flashpoint of special forces. Not a generic shooter.
<br>
<br>-The AI is stupid. I haven&apos;t seen such useless AI in years, I didn&apos;t even think it was possible for developers take so many steps backwards in coding the AI, but rainbow six siege just proves it.
<br>At one moment I was on one side of the room looking at an open door, I see an AI run up and hide beside the door entrance with his arm sticking out in my view. I just pistol his arm till he died. Then a second AI ran up and I did the same.
<br>
<br>-The game is a borefest. Like I said it feels like a generic shooter mixed with call of duty. I already played black ops 3 and it was crap, why would I want to play another call of duty type game this year.
<br>
<br>-Absolutely no incentive to work as a team. In Rainbow six it was a blast working as a team.
<br>
<br>-The levels are boring. Anyone remember Rainbox six vegas? It looked amazing at the time, the attention to detail was phenomenal. Remember looking out the window from the casino beyond the city scape and seeing little cars driving on the road in the distance? Well In siege you won&apos;t find that. The maps are boring and bland.
<br>
<br>-Destructibility is nothing new, just generally under utilized by game developers because they are lazy. Anyone remember red faction?
<br>
<br>-The rifle and pistol sounds, very unrealistic. As someone who has spent a lot of time at the range I can tell you this game actually has worse sounds than call of duty.
<br>
<br>All in all, I feel bad that Tom Clancy&apos;s name is smeared in this trash game. Please don&apos;t buy this just to show them we want a real rainbow six game and not call of duty.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5849403">Expand</a></span>

In doing so all they have established is that they can make games that are flawed by technical faults that heavily detract from an otherwise enjoyable experience.
<br>You assume the role as one of 33 playable operators, each with a unique and distinguished special ability, and play alongside four other players in 5v5 multiplayer attack versus defend game modes. Round are respawn-free, meaning if you die, you&apos;re out until the next round.
<br>Multiplayer is where this game is significantly flawed, which on further inspection is a big concern considering that this game is a multiplayer game.
<br>A reporting functionality does exist, something that is a must have for every multiplayer game, but despite this, it never seems to actually do anything. This is partially due to the consistent influx of hackers that swarm multiplayer games throughout the year, and also down to the fact that users reporting other players don&apos;t receive any form of communication on what action was eventually taken on the reported player, if any was taken at all!
<br>The matchmaking system is inherently flawed, and new players can expect themselves to be paired up with other new players against a team full of people that should be competing for thousands of dollars in the competitive pro league.
<br>The game is also riddled with bugs and glitches; some of which are addressed, but most of which are described as &apos;identified by the development team&apos; and no more. So much so that they even skipped a whole DLC to provide a &apos;season long&apos; (3 months) period of updates exclusively aimed at fixing issues, which was aptly named &apos;Operation Health&apos;. Many players (including myself) will tell you that although this season fixed many bugs, for every bug that was fixed, another 10+ were introduced.
<br>It is evident by all of these attempts that Ubisoft are trying to fix this game to a point where it would excel at being a great tactical multiplayer shooter, but seasoned game design veterans like themselves should know that simply trying is not enough to meet today&apos;s industry expectation.
<br>As with most Ubisoft games, they try to emphasize the highly accurate and realistic visual graphics. What actually happened at launch was a terrible mess of broken lighting in nearly every inch of your screen, and textures that simply didn&apos;t live up to the expectations that Ubisoft themselves set during their E3 demo.
<br>As time has gone on, they have got much better, and the next update promises to improve the overall graphical quality of the game, so I have no real basis to fault them on in the graphics department writing today in 2017. Had I been writing this review a year ago, we may have seen a different story being presented.
<br>Player progression is an aspect of R6: Siege that I often find being misinterpreted by reviewers who haven&apos;t explored the game far enough to understand how player progression actually works. Ubisoft offers two versions of the game, the starter edition, and the standard edition. This pricing model allows gamers who aren&apos;t completely sold on the game to purchase a cheaper version where they don&apos;t instantly start with a large collection of operators (classes) to play with. They can then choose to unlock these operators with in-game currency, which cannot be purchased with real life money. This is a great move by Ubisoft which allows all players, independent of financial capacity, to experience all of the different operators in the game.
<br>Gameplay mechanics are where Rainbow Six: Siege properly excels. Players can use RC drones with built in cameras to scope out areas of the map before engaging, and many operators have different traps and gadgets to apply a multitude of effects (both positive and negative) to players who happen to stumble across them, ranging from concussion mines to toxic smoke canisters. These mechanics provide a fun and unique playing experience with a map that is dynamically changing throughout the round, promoting players to think on their feet and adapt to the present situation. This plays well into the re-playability of the game; you are almost guaranteed to never have a match that plays out in a predictable scenario that you have experienced before.
<br>Options menus are where most PC games fall very short of the mark, but R6: Siege is an exception to this. The game features a highly extensive yet immensely intuitive settings screen, and good news for some gamers, the game features out-of-the-box ultrawide 21:9 aspect ratio support. The &apos;Ultra HD texture pack&apos; that they offer, which is more than 20 gigabytes in size, doesn&apos;t seem to offer any form of improvement to the graphics unless you&apos;re using a fancy Dell 8K monitor, but heavily decreases the frame rate of the game, so unless you want to be the very best, you&apos;ll probably want to pass on that option.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=7588637">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Defenders can block doors and use remote explosives but don&apos;t get shields, flashbangs or decent DMRs; attackers are not allowed to use the heartbeat sensor or block the doorways behind them. There are no destructible light sources or thermal scopes. Even though there are cameras in the game, motion detection alarms are not an option. It&apos;s as if Ubisoft were trying to make Counter-Strike with mutually exclusive classes instead of a proper next gen squad tactical game with customizable loadouts.
<br>
<br>While the maps are decent, they also have an element of luck to them, with some positions being easy to defend and some downright atrocious for any mode, and the position itself being random and not changeable (can&apos;t move the hostage/container/bombs). Getting the short end of the stick is never fun.
<br>
<br>And mechanically it&apos;s not very fun either. Instead of deployables being placeable via their projected model like in many other games, R6S forces the operator to shuffle back and forth until they magically raise their hands into the &apos;can deploy&apos; position. It&apos;s not realistic, it&apos;s deliberately crippled control. Of course, barbed wire, bear traps and whatnot can not be placed on stairs, no, sir. Only on flat surfaces with at least a meter of free space behind them (for the operative to stand when deploying). All the traps, even the mechanical ones, have IFF, e.g. the barbed wire doesn&apos;t slow down allies. MAGIC!
<br>
<br>When the game works, it feels good. Yet, most of the time it just feels like &quot;Game1 and Game2 did this so much better&quot; and makes me wish for far more freedom in choosing loadouts and doing things.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=6086801">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s a simple multiplayer game with no real single player mode.
<br>I played for about 10 hours and I feel already bored by the game.
<br>While I think Battlefield could be more tactical, R6 is just too limited for me.
<br>Despite the various operators (20) and maps (15) for now, the gameplay is quite repetitive.

You may be thinking that Counterstrike offers this too, but the experiences are very different.
<br>
<br>Rainbow Six Siege provides a very interesting dynamic between the two teams: the defenders hold a position of extreme control over the attackers, who spend their time slowly wresting control from the defenders, either through direct confrontation or taking their resources apart.
<br>
<br>The difference between the two teams is striking: the defenders have access to fixed position CCTV that offers a huge amount of visibility in a fixed-- and easily destroyed position-- whilst the attackers have access to drones, which offer mobile visibility but from the level of a small rodent, affording the attackers less direct information but the ability to see any part of the area. The defenders are given time to set traps, put up barricades and attempt to funnel the movements of the attackers into specific chokepoints, whilst the attackers are given flashbangs, explosives and longer range weapons to shoot into the buildings.
<br>
<br>This set up creates a lot of tension, as defenders feel like homeowners experiencing a break in whilst the attacking team feel like unwelcome invaders in a hostile world, which has helped to create one of the most intense multiplayer experiences I&apos;ve had in a while.
<br>
<br>The slower, more methodical pace required by both sides and reliance on information and teamwork creates a solid experience, but one which requires a few friends and a teamspeak/discord server. Playing which a matchmade team just does not work as well, as many will be averse to using the microphone and so information is not distributed to the team fast enough.
<br>
<br>Graphically, the game is serviceable: weapons tear up scenery, explosions and smoke pop off all around you and lights reflect across the floor as you make your way through the match. This is great, but the graphics can sometimes feel a little flat, which can make distinguishing between the many different operators relatively difficult.
<br>
<br>The audio design is where the game comes into it&apos;s own. You will quickly find yourself relying on the various sounds heard throughout the level, from the zipping noise of a rappel to the heavy footed running of an enemy above you locating the objective. All of these instill a sense in more experience players and create some very tense moments: in a recent game I was sprinting toward a hostage when the floor below and wall to the side of me erupted into a hell of bullets as two enemies had picked up my footsteps.
<br>
<br>The destructible environments of the game are top-notch. Walls blow apart, barricades are destroyed and hastily rebuilt and bullets fly through soft surfaces, creating another level to the map design and engagements felt throughout.
<br>
<br>Though the game is not perfect due to difficulties playing when friends are not around and the graphics can make things less clear than they could be, I would still recommend picking this game up in any sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=6912377">Expand</a></span>

It combines strategy and first person shooting, and in order to perform well you must have good reflexes and knowledge of the maps and all it&apos;s locations. Overall i have to give it a low score just because they had to delay part of a dlc to fix bugs and they have HORRIBLE servers (Down at least once a month for hours with no explanation from Ubisoft other than them saying they are investigating it.)
<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>Requires your brain
<br>Requires reflexes
<br>DLC contains characters obtainable through normal in-game currency, (It may require a lot, but hey, the characters are still obtainable) which doesn&apos;t ruin gameplay for people who don&apos;t like to invest loads of money into a game
<br>Excellent graphics
<br>Anti-Cheating system
<br>Fits almost any play-style in an FPS (Pretty much all but sniper, which there is only one Operator with this)
<br>All operators have a unique gadget/ability, and are balanced
<br>Everything that affects gameplay available without buying DLC.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Horrible servers (They are down at least once a month, with no explanation from Ubisoft other than them telling us they are investigating)
<br>Had to delay 2 Operators and cancel 1 map to fix the huge amount of bugs (While they should be doing this, they shouldn&apos;t have had this many bugs in the first place for over a year)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=7399335">Expand</a></span>

I would rate this much higher than an 8 if it wasn&apos;t for some bugs and server issues. (Seriously they should let us host our own servers).
<br>
<br>But the gameplay and map designs are solid. Kudos Ubi, you made a game I am willing to buy from you.</span>

<br>BUT
<br>Everything is completely ruined by an awful, i repeat, HORRENDOUSLY AWFUL, tech-side state of the game and its servers. And im not alone here. Seriously, have this game went through multiple test stages, or they just say so? I dont know how they cold have missed all of these issues. And they are found amongst the majority of players, and you can find those in pretty much any negative review for this game:
<br>- awful netcode with random delays and discrepancies between what you see and what you actually get, even with 40 hours to actually understand whats going on, and experience everything, that developers **** up.
<br>
<br>In short - dont buy it now. Read reviews later down the update line, 2-3 updates/patches in. See if most of these problems are fixed, and if they are - then go for it, you&apos;ll have a lot of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5942028">Expand</a></span>

The maps are destructible, forcing creativity in both defensive and offensive roles; the unique abilities of each operator only serve to enhance the experience, serving up a metagame not unlike what you&apos;d find in the MOBA genre - although with more meaty action. Essentially, if the older Rainbow Six games, CS: GO and Dota were all merged into one, that would be Siege.
<br>
<br>There are customisable loadouts, attachments to add to your weapons, completely altering their statistics (recoil, flash hiders, angled grips giving you quicker ADS transitions etc.). If you like competitive multiplayer games, you&apos;re doing yourself a disservice by not trying it out. In my opinion, this is now the only competitive shooter worth playing. Period. The maps, too, are full of detail with so many avenues to explore and ways to breach your objective.
<br>
<br>I&apos;d advise playing with friends, however, or at least using a mic as this game is heavily team-oriented and you will certainly suffer playing online without one.
<br>
<br>--
<br>
<br>That said, it&apos;s not perfect. There are a few issues such as semi-auto shotguns having too much range, a couple silly operator buffs such as Pulse&apos;s heartbeat scanner - but all in all, this game is fantastic. Surprisingly, the devs have given it patch after patch - something you definitely don&apos;t expect from Ubisoft, considering their post-release support generally leaves much to be desired. So for this reason, I have no doubt everything will be sorted (Pulse and semi-autos get nerfed this month so the perfect game will then become godlike).
<br>

<br>
<br>To all the players comparing this game with Vegas: This is NOT Vegas. Just because it doesn&apos;t have the same features of one game doesn&apos;t make it a terrible game. Siege wasn&apos;t designed with 3rd person in mind. 3rd person would grant campers a huge advantage. In Siege, one must rely on their senses to determine enemy position, i.e. footsteps in the next room, someone walking through barbed wire, etc. These minute features are what make this game such a fantastic tactical squad-based shooter. You have to strategize with your team, accurately execute plans to complete the objective or fail together.
<br>
<br>This isn&apos;t for the COD player looking for quick-kill gratification. You won&apos;t find anyone sprinting across the map with guns blazing. That&apos;ll only get you killed. In fact, sprinting creates so much noise you&apos;ll quickly find yourself watching your corpse get teabagged via killcam.
<br>
<br>My one and only gripe with the game as of release are the bugs. Hopefully Ubisoft can fix these soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5853944">Expand</a></span>

<br>Is this what we expect for $60? It functions like Insurgency&apos;s autistic cousin. It tries to cover up it&apos;s horrible graphics with the most extreme case of Motion Blur I&apos;ve ever seen. The AI will shoot you through walls with 100% accuracy (then instantly troll you with a killcam). Guns have no recoil/uniqueness. You can only destroy objects/walls marked as destructable (not some Red Faction contender as lauded). Servers plainly don&apos;t work. No single player. 40% of the unique content requires microtransactions AT LAUNCH, feels like Game of War. R6 bucks my a $$.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer had the potential to be a fun $20 game on it&apos;s own, but it&apos;s lack of competition modes other than Attack/Defend make it absurdly over priced.
<br>
<br>A total bust. Thanks for the refund Steam.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5930511">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is very much like any other traditional Rainbow 6. The explosive environments add so much challenge and tacticle planning. The only thing that keeps this game from getting a 10/10 is that they didn&apos;t include local co-op and a tps cover system this time. If you like games like Socom, Unit13, Ghost Recon, Swat, Counter Strike, or anything related to armed forces/ espionage, this is a dream come true.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5850555">Expand</a></span>

Cons? Ye, there are few of them. Hitboxes, lack of single player campaign. But... I dont mind. Love the game so far.</span>

It is a great concept, but the coding of the game falls flat on its face when trying to deliver the experience. Every game begins with a match of RC Pro AM remote control car derby if your offense, or run around doing the same old BS if your defense. The netcode is from the 90&apos;s and bullets don&apos;t always register a hit, which is a HUGE issue considering that most of the time it is 1 shot 1 kill. Graphics are pretty heavily outdated, and in game actions are painfully ugly. Why can one side pick up barbwire, but the other can&apos;t? Who smashes barb wire with the butt of a gun? Who disarms a bomb with a butt of a gun? All these things make the game feel incomplete, rushed, and just pretty darn fake which takes you out of the immersion that it was designed to be. Lastly, content to price is far far FAR off! Wait until after Christmas, then pick it up for $19.99. But even then be careful, people may of stopped playing making matches almost impossible to find.... If they decide to even fix their online servers which go down constantly without any notice.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5873873">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>+ Refreshing asymmetrical gameplay. (Operators, Reinforcing/Breaching)
<br>+ Tense action, each kill is rewarding, you never know where the attackers will hit or how the defender will fortify.
<br>+ Rewards tactics over quick aiming, brings back communication to gaming, people are playing as a team.
<br>+ Procedural destruction is the very first time we have a next gen feature that really impacts gameplay.
<br>+ Buttery smooth 60fps with all this destruction
<br>+ Free maps DLC for the next year!
<br>+ Dedicated post-launch support from the dev team
<br>+ Microtransactions are just a shortcut, not pay to win, you can unlock everything you want by simply gaining XP.
<br>+ Although not a single player focused game, plenty of options to have fun (Situations, TerroHunt, TerroHuntClassic)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5854456">Expand</a></span>

We get ports, and everyone knows how well Ubisoft makes them.  Look at Hawx.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not spending 60 dollars on a game with such limited content, no dedicated servers, and a MP only focus.  It&apos;s pure laziness on the developers side, and like Activision it is a stab at the PC community to force us to play the way they want us to play.  In the words Jay Wilson, &quot;You are having fun incorrectly.&quot;
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve waited over a decade for a true sequel to the original R6 series.  Takedown: Red Saber could have been that had it not played like abandonware from day one.
<br>
<br>If Ubisoft really cared about the Tom Clancy series they would have taken a look at GroundBranch.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5865409">Expand</a></span>

I expect this game to get polarized reviews, either people will love it, or hate it because experience can differ heavily. When you have a team that works together with mics and coordinates, its one of the best games I&apos;ve played in the last couple years - however when you have a lone wolf that insists on doing their own thing or a team that doesn&apos;t really coordinate it can be very frustrating. Overall my experience has been really positive (PC), people seem to be getting into the spirit of the game and while there are a couple bugs, there isn&apos;t anything too major that detracts from the overall experience. Although there are still micro-transactions, I give props to Ubi for free DLC maps and operators. Overall I think this is a strong shooter that will get better in the coming months.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5850864">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>-The graphics are a definite upgrade from the previous games. It looks pretty damn good. But that&apos;s about the only thing that went into next gen from this game!!!! Now on to the cons:
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-As i said numerous times now, this is an incredibly dumbed down version of the previous Rainbow six games. Remember when you had to find out where the enemy was and you had to check every door to make sure you don&apos;t get ambushed..... Well **** that **** in this game you just gotta send a little beacon thingy and it tells every enemy position to you. For Christ&apos;s sake if i wanna find out where the enemy is without effort i might as well cheat.
<br>-Another thing is the guns. Yeah they all look and sound great but hey just don&apos;t feel powerful. Remember in the previous games (especially in the first 3 Rainbow six games) when you got a new gun it really packed a punch. Here they just feel like pee shooters.
<br>
<br>Okay i think that&apos;s enough ranting for me. I am just disappointed that i never got what i was promised. I was hoping for some fun and strategic gameplay but instead i got Rainbow six for 12 year olds. It is sad really.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5901257">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>There is a lot of potential with this game, but their sheer greed has ensured that this game will die on the vine. Welcome to the no-fly list Ubisoft, you will never get another dollar from me, I promise you.</span>

<br>I think the game is really well-made, and the developers put a lot of thought to he competitiveness of the gameplay. Of course, there are things I question should be in the game, such as the online market for pay2get stuff (like $29 season pass that unlocks characters, Currency Booster, and EXP booster), but I don&apos;t foresee these items giving mid-level players much of an advantage.
<br>
<br>I should note that the tutorial is horrid. And the Scenario mode&apos;s gameplay is too punishing to casually learn the game as a tutorial. For instance, I didn&apos;t really understand how to remotely ignite explosive charges or understand the uses of drone/ extra drone for a few rounds into the game. So, I hope Ubisoft enhances the tutorial, because it&apos;ll deter a lot of new players.
<br>
<br>Oh and another thing: There&apos;re way too many non-English speaking players on the game. Can we somehow limit the matchmaking by regions?
<br>
<br>Lastly, I think game will have a hard-time retaining casual-players. There is not gameplay that really stands out to me, and doesn&apos;t give players the flexibility to be creative. I would&apos;ve like to see a feature where users could create their own maps, and a server list for custom games/scenarios where I could play a round with 10 v 10 or 15 v 15 or with Multiple objectives.
<br>
<br>Overall I think the game is well made and really fun. I&apos;m looking forward to any improvements Ubisoft will make to it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5867414">Expand</a></span>

<br>To the Rainbow Six veterans. I am a fan of the series since Raven Shield. Of course, the series has evolved, an Siege has not that much in common with Raven Shield anymore. But It is a very good game on it&apos;s own and maybe should not be compared to it&apos;s predecessors (i know it&apos;s called &quot;rainbow six&quot;, but obviously for marketing reasons). But if you liked R6 for tactical gameplay and it&apos;s great atmosphere you will like Siege, too, that&apos;s for sure.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5857326">Expand</a></span>

<br>The matchmaking simply does not work. There is no server browser. There are 10 maps (that play exactly the same whether you play at day or night, since the core of the gameplay is focused on the INSIDE of the buildings) - 20 characters to chose from, that can&apos;t go through any progress, as there simply is no progression ingame. That&apos;s it. Roughly 3 modifications that are basically all the same and once you have unlocked everything (took me 20 hours for all modifications + all operators) then you&apos;re done with the game basically.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5948578">Expand</a></span>

<br>Unfortunately, the hit detection is bad, the ping compensation is the worst i&apos;ve seen in a FPS, the MM is regularly failing, and the anti-cheat is not working.
<br>Ubisoft does not communicate with the community, and they probably won&apos;t improve much the game since the engine is not made for FPS games.

<br>
<br>It has practically no single player, so be warned. There is a series of offline tutorials called &quot;Situations&quot; which take about a hour to complete.
<br>
<br>There&apos;s been a lot of controversy about micro-transactions, but not really worth the fuss. I bought the standard version, and after 1st day I already had 10 of the 20 operators unlocked. All the Season Pass does, is giving this a bit faster. There is no pay-to-win in this game. And there is absolutely no reason to buy the expensive editions, standard has it all.
<br>
<br>All of the future DLC maps and operators will be free (there will be 4 maps and 8 new operators in 2016).
<br>
<br>THE GOOD
<br>
<br>The MP is intense, addicting, punishing, extremely tactical. It&apos;s mostly slow paced, but when the action breaks out, it&apos;s sharp and brutal. The game feels fresh, which is not common thing for a shooter.
<br>
<br>Without VOIP there isn&apos;t much point in this game though. It requires communication and planning. It&apos;s not for people who are not willing to instantly talk with strangers, or have 4 friends to squad up with. Fortunately 95% of players on PC have a microphone, and are willing to use it with random people too. You can&apos;t coordinate a breach (every wall and ceiling taken down in a timed blast, and whole team busting in) without VOIP. For one thing. VOIP really is mandatory, unlike in some other games.
<br>
<br>10 MP maps doesn&apos;t sound like much, but they are extremely detailed. There is so much to learn, various routes and intricacies. Everything that looks like it can be taken down, shredded to pieces with gunfire or blown holes into with C4, can be. Almost anything that looks like you can rappel it up/down, can be. No set rappel points.
<br>
<br>Still I have to admit, would have wished for a bit more maps at launch. Then would have given it a 10.
<br>
<br>THE BAD &amp; AND THE UGLY
<br>
<br>It would be a perfect hardcore shooter, but unfortunately there is hit reg problems. Which is not excusable for this sort of game, with no respawns, aiming at competitive gaming.
<br>
<br>If they fix that, my score will remain at 9. I&apos;m trusting that they will, since it was specifically promoted as e-Sports game by Ubisoft. If this is not fixed, I will come back and change my rating into a 6. It&apos;s not a huge issue for casual play because it doesn&apos;t happen all the time, but the game is not ready yet for e-sports.
<br>
<br>CONCLUSION
<br>
<br>Definitely can be recommended, if classic tactical shooters like SWAT 4 light your fire. This is pretty much like multiplayer-only SWAT 4. But it&apos;s not instant gratification shooter like Battlefield or COD. Running around trying Rambo stuff will get you killed in 5 seconds.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t buy from Steam, there is plenty of cheaper places, for example G2A.com. I got mine for &#x20AC;35.50. People who are suspicious about G2A, no worries. I&apos;ve bought 6 CD-keys from there and they all worked perfectly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5850470">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I was not expecting much with this game as I was dissapointed by the last 3 rainbow games, but this game is a ton of fun and a wonderful surprise. It rewards teamwork and communication, grab a few friends and get ready for some great fun!

Shooting an enemy to the head five times, seeing blood and then the guy turns areound, shoots back and kills you? That&apos;s routine. Just like other guys shooting air while they can&apos;t even see you, because you are hidden behind a wall (impenetrable) after you peaked and suddenly you are dead from their fire. Trying to hit someone with single shots while they are running is also a lottery. Either you are lucky and hit the spot where the game things the guys is, or the guy just runs away (while you clearly hit him in the back with your sniper rifle). That&apos;s the biggest problem the game has. There is also problem with clipping. When you lie down near a wall, quite often there is an enemy on the other side who can see your legs or head clipping through the wall. The worst thing about this is that they can just kill you while you can&apos;t do anything about it. I am not going to mention some smaller problems, because they are not important.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5858787">Expand</a></span>

This game is by no means perfect with some flaws as expected but Ubisoft have produced a title that fans of the classic genre will certainly enjoy.
<br>
<br>Siege is largely a multiplayer team-based game which centers on casual or competitive 5v5 matches on a variety of maps with hostage defence and bomb defusal being the primary objectives. Matches are best of 5 alternating rounds in which you and four others team up in attack and defence. There are only 10 or so maps available but each vary in size and style and as the objective point changes location in each round; everything feels fresh and both sides must work hard on offense and defence. You can also team up with 4 friends against the AI and play out MP scenarios although the dreadfully coded AI leaves a lot to be desired.
<br>
<br>The structure of the game surrounds earning XP called Reown points - these can be spent on unlocking operators who each have their own special equipment and loadouts to be used in the field. There are around 16 operators to unlock in the basegame and all differ and can only be selected by one player in each team in the lobby. Reown can also be used to unlock attachments, camo&apos;s and other additional customisation elements. Some attack operators can blast through walls, hammer down barricades, bypass traps whereas the defensive operators can use their equipment to counter the opposition with strategically placed traps and positioning. Everything feels well-balanced and the level of customisation is fantastic.
<br>
<br>The disappointing aspects of Siege is that there isn&apos;t really a worthwhile single player option - you can solo some scenarios as a lone wolf but these aren&apos;t very satisfying and can be extremely difficult even on normal difficulty. Other issues surround the poor netcode and typical Ubisoft server reliability. The visuals feel somewhat dated and the mechanics are a bit clunky but despite this; there is plenty of fun to be had without the woes getting in the way. The general controls may lack fluency but at least you feel like you&apos;re in control of a tactical operator and not some arcadey Call of Duty character.
<br>
<br>Overall; Rainbow Six: Siege rejuvenates the vintage genre and is a worthy successor to the classic games in the series. It demands tactics and teamwork and each match is never the same. The game does have a few issues and perhaps isn&apos;t as polished as we would have hoped but nevertheless, it&apos;s a good purchase especially if you have dedicated friends to play with. If you are looking for a single player experience, this game is not for you but even if you are a solo player just wanting to jump in casually; it&apos;s a easy game to get into and tremendous fun throughout.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5856921">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The realism is there where 1 or 2 shots will kill but the netcode and/or hit detection is fuzzy as hell. Watching replays it&apos;s infuriating when even the replay shows the bullet &quot;hits&quot; not actually hitting you.
<br>
<br>The graphics are mediocre and are below what  AAA titles provide these days.
<br>
<br>All and all the game would be great at about half the price it is currently. The game could be heading towards pre-mature obscurity with a dwindling playerbase. Hopefully they fix the price so more players can come in.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5867407">Expand</a></span>

Like, I actually find the joke &quot;Why is EA the worst company in the US? Because Ubisoft is in Europe&quot; funny. I have also no &quot;Rainbow Six fandom&quot; to speak of, nor do I even remotely enjoy Counter Strike. Now, with all that out of the way let me get to the review.
<br>
<br>I started playing in the Open Beta. I was hooked. I normally don&apos;t buy games, this one I actually ended up buying. The game offers so many moments you can remember the next day, clutch saves, lucky snipes and the lot. You feel like you&apos;re actually doing something, instead of mindlessly shooting everything that moves.
<br>
<br>The game feels very balanced, and the developers are actually listening to the community. They have laid out a roadmap of what&apos;s to come in 2016, new operators, new maps and it&apos;s going to be completely free. Coming from a LoL player that is still playing because of how competitive the game is, I feel like this is going to be in similar fashion.
<br>
<br>Some people I see are whining about how you have to unlock Operators and all that, which is absolute **** There are 20 operators in the game. After doing the tutorials and situations, which are singleplayer content, I ended up with 7800 Renown. Which allows me to unlock 2 Operators from each of the 5 CTU&apos;S for a total of 10. So with about 2.5 hours of playtime, I unlocked half of the Operators. I think that is beyond fair, in fact I&apos;m quite shocked. I feel like I am at no disadvantage whatsoever.
<br>
<br>The game feels great. You can get it for 30$ and in my honest opinion, that&apos;s a good deal. I can&apos;t wait to get back into it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5851148">Expand</a></span>

<br>2 - The player ping is sometimes a bit high when the game match-makes for you.
<br>3 - The graphics could definitely be better.
<br>There, those are the cons as I see them, on to the positives:
<br>The game is real good ol&apos; fun! Tactical FPS at its best. If you liked the classic Rainbow 6, Rogue Spear series you will feel right at home. The feel when moving around in the game is actually quite similar to the classic RB6 titles. Also, the new mechanics with breakable walls etc, have been implemented really well. They add to the experience instead of becoming gimmicky and unnecessary. There is really not much more to say, try it out and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll have fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5859299">Expand</a></span>

And for me it has nothing to do with famous classical Rainbow Six series. Let me explain some details about it. My personal opinion about single-player (I understood, that the game is probably targeting the multiplayer), what I don&apos;t like in this game:
<br>- the atmosphere completely lost. I didn&apos;t feel like I am on a dangerous and important missions anymore. The mission in a plane gave me chills of nostalgia at first time I see it. But then, it came to nothing. The game is absolutely empty;
<br>- terrorists stay on their points and wait while you find them like dummies in the SWAT playground. Great, that&apos;s what I expect of Rainbow Six series;
<br>- terrorists shout about their actions loud, just I can kill them easily: &quot;Reloading!&quot;, &quot;Move to intercept&quot;. One of them shouted: &quot;Hostile spotted!&quot;, just before shooting at me, and that gave me time to kill him first. Thanks!
<br>- one player campaign is dull, uninteresting and remind me of some bad B-movie;
<br>
<br>And more, and more. Just don&apos;t want to talk about this game anymore.

<br>
<br>It is no coincidence that the ability to select game modes is hidden under different UI than any other FPS would ever have utilized. The Developers are clearly trying to stretch what little content they have as far as possible. This is shameful.
<br>
<br>What game is there is certainly nice. The guns are nothing particularly amazing, but passable. The explosives are enough to illicit some tactical play. Nothing here hasn&apos;t been done before, better, Elsewhere. For a game with so little, Ubisoft then has the nerve to put in a cash shop, for boosters and skins. In case you weren&apos;t getting all of the limited content fast enough, and so they can churn out more recycled garbage.
<br>
<br>The AI feels no different than it did in Rainbow Six Vegas 2.
<br>
<br>Rainbow Six Vegas 2 Released in 2008 with:
<br>12 maps, 4 DLC maps
<br>A Full Campaign.
<br>Extensive character Customization
<br>
<br>The Maps themselves do not feel NEARLY as exciting as those in Vegas 2. We were going through neon sign graveyards, Bright, loud casinos, of various makes, a whole construction zone for CQB training, Oil refineries, Trainyards....I had the most fun on a shooter I&apos;d had up until that point. I was hoping to recover some of that, but the wind is right out of my sales.
<br>
<br>In Closing, This game is a major disappointment to any Vegas fan who expected more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5853179">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are ok. Great optimization on PC. The sound is astounding and a very important key to victory. Anyway, I am enjoying so much this game, not because it&apos;s perfect, it is not. But like I said, the fps market was having a lack of games like this.</span>

After a year and a half the game is only what was shown at E3 2014, no improvements whatsoever, why it took so long to finish is beyond me.
<br>
<br>There is no story mode, only multiplayer, and no option to have AI teammates. The game is extremely limited. I was expecting it to be a modern version of rainbow six vegas 2, but instead you cannot select the mode, map or any details of terrorist hunts, it just cycles between different modes and maps. I prefer terrorists hunts and miss the day where you could play just that and pick your map and vary the amount of enemies, but no longer.
<br>
<br>Likewise the pvp aspect also goes between different game modes. They completely eliminate the ability to make your own choices in this game. And for any mode you no longer have your own character, you only purchase specific characters which are limited to a few weapons. So you can spend currency upgrading a weapon but might not be able to use that weapon unless you&apos;re the first to select that character.
<br>
<br>There are a lot of glitches in the game too, which with no changes to the game in a year I don&apos;t see how they havent fixed these big mistakes. Including seeing an enemy AI through a doorway and shooting them 15 times and it doesnt register any of the shots. Also for costing $60 MSRP (which im regretting the $30 I paid for it) the game acts much more like a free to play with all of the micro transactions to unlock guns and weapon skins.)
<br>
<br>Connection issues: Assume this is a start up problem but while matchmaking only 1/4 searches finds matches, usually youll connect and then the host will leave and it kicks you out or it just stops searching after 8 seconds and brings you back to menu.
<br>
<br>The only good I see from this game is that when selecting graphics options it explains exactly what all options does, which would be really good for any non-pc expert.
<br>
<br>TL;DR  This game is a huge disappointment, and Ubisoft has proven once again to be a terrible dev company.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5850840">Expand</a></span>

The last couple of years have been over crowded with COD clones and every developer seems to be copying COD. For what its worth Modern Warfare 1 was the best in my honest opinion. Anyway back to Rainbow Six. I played the original games on PC years ago and this was a pleasant surprise. Though it doesn&apos;t have single player elements to it, its all multiplayer. In my books thats not good. You need to be able to play a story mode. there has to be more to each level than just attacking and protecting, even if there was just a cut scene that you can watch.
<br>At first the games design is all based around attacking and defending, then unlocks, each particular attacker and defender have certain abilities. All the content that people complain about not being there is in fact there in the form of cutscenes for each character that you unlock. And well the 11 maps and then thats it. But the gameplay is very good. So good you will come back to it again and again. They say future updates will release more maps and characters to unlock, which in turn will just increase the longevity. Thats is true . Bit I can&apos;t help feeling disappointed towards the lack of single player missions. Even the single player situations for some reason don&apos;t run at the same frames per second in multiplayer than it does in the single player missions. Leaving controls and movement feeling laggy. Plus the AI is atrocious. Its just shoot the moving target and so on. No fun there. Anyway all in all, this game is fun for the basic element that it focuses on. The graphics are good when you are playing multiplayer and most importantly if you have a team that communicates its worth the purchase. Because each round will last a lot long if you work together rather than going lone soldier. 8/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5853808">Expand</a></span>

Ubisoft sold RSS as a new style of RS game - one focused on just multiplayer. On that front this game delivers. It&apos;s unlike and FPS out there and very compelling. It does require tactics, logic and teamwork when playing other human teams. The AI is not perfect, but much better than I expected.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t find the content limited - there are 20 maps I think and 3 modes (hostage, bomb, kill all) when playing Terrorist Hunt. There are many Operators to choose from and there is no grinding. You can get more than 6000 points just by completing the single player training Scenarios. This can unlock and fully equip 3-4 operators.
<br>
<br>There is no pay to win element at all. Micro transaction are limited to skins and boosters.
<br>
<br>This is a straightforward focused team based FPS that stands on it&apos;s own. I&apos;m glad I bought it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5857220">Expand</a></span>

They don&apos;t show exactly where the person aimed. Watch if you get final kill, it will be off. Match making is slow sometimes but not as bad as beta, I always find a game. Great FPS with destruction. TTK is kind of weird but it&apos;s good fun. Takes some adjusting from say battlefield</span>

<br>But at it&apos;s core Rainbow Six is still very much alive in this title. There aren&apos;t many games on the console market that focuses so deeply on team tactics. All that planing before a mission, giving your red team, and blue team their planed routes and go codes, that&apos;s all there. The same amount of finesse and planing goes in to how you assault your objective just like any other rainbow six game. Of course, this applies if you have a good team, but I&apos;ve ran in to more players willing to listen and work as team with strangers more-so in rainbow six siege, than any other game on the market. So if you don&apos;t have a group of guys to play with, it&apos;s not very hard to meet like minded players who whined up on your friend list after a few games. I&apos;ve added at least 20 and started a community of PS4 called, You Gotta Be Tacticool.
<br>
<br>I do have to admit though. The controls can be a bit funky at first, but I suggest adjusting your stick dead zones (if you&apos;re playing on consoles), turn up your sensitivity,  and turn off aim assist if you&apos;re playing terrorist hunt, and you should be golden. My setting for my dead zones are turned all the way down to five, and my sensitivities are set to five and that&apos;s my sweet spot.
<br>
<br>Now if you do want to play single player, there is the classic terrorist hunt, and the new situations. Situations are basically a weak ass set of &quot;campaign&quot; missions that teach you how to play the game. But honestly, Multiplayer is where this game really shines.
<br>
<br>I love the team work, and the how easily the dynamics of a map can change. The destructible surfaces really make this game interesting, and if your team is really on par. You can spank just about any defending team. Just last night I played a rank match that went 9 rounds because each of our teams were so spot on with attacking. It was one of the best games I&apos;ve played so far, and the most exciting. Of course we won since we were the last to attack and took the match point.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m giving this game a 9 out of 10 only because they&apos;re are a lack of maps and instead of adding to level designs, they are creating additional operators. I don&apos;t have any complaints about game modes because they suit the theme of the game incredibly well.
<br>
<br>So, if this game had more content, it would have defiantly received a 10/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5864926">Expand</a></span>

<br>-I played beta, liked the gameplay so bought the game knowing it doesn&apos;t have campaing
<br>Pros:
<br>-sound are amazing, sometimes you literally have to depend on the sounds of footsteps to get your kills
<br>-well paced combat, not boring if you die and have to watch, but you are not pressured to rush it either
<br>-no running through bullets knifing enemy... 1 headshot enemy is dead
<br>-tactical gameplay, breakable surfaces,if you play with microphone then you can do wonders
<br>-if you get a kill it&apos;ll feel 100 times more satisfying than it feels in COD or Battlefied...
<br>-doesnt feel money grabbing at the moment
<br>Cons:
<br>-some server issues
<br>-some glitches
<br>-a bit too expensive, 40$ would be more appropriate
<br>-maps could be a bit more diverse</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5865292">Expand</a></span>

I think super mario 64 had more impressive AI than this. normal/hard are way too easy, and Realistic turns every enemy into an aimbot machine. 0/10.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, it&apos;s a fun game and there is some level of thought that needs to be put into the game. But for god&apos;s sake, don&apos;t go into matchmaking without at least 2 friends. You will get your ass kicked all day long.
<br>
<br>Another thing is how people say this game has the best community known to man. That&apos;s completely not true. I&apos;ve seen my fair share of trolls who will instantly kill you when the round stars, and blast music through their mic just to annoy you. That&apos;s in 11 hours of play time.(not counting the beta, which had the same amount of content as the full version, LOL.)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=6004460">Expand</a></span>

<br>Ubisoft cannot just ride on the name of a franchise by creating a game that is not true to the franchise.

Then the game is really worth it.
<br>I don&#x2019;t play first person shooter games for long. I have played a lot of them, but I tend to play 2 dozen games and never return. The only one that tend to keep me playing is battlefield. In a way, Rainbow Six: Siege is like that. A lot of the structures are destructible, 11 maps, and 3 game modes. There are plenty of customization of weapons. Granted, I felt like the customization wasn&#x2019;t really customization, but rather huge upgrade. Obviously scope is better than iron sight; was that a good example? Here is another, if you upgrade the grip of the weapon, there is less recoil, no downside. Obviously, that&#x2019;s just up grade. There should be some sort of downside to certain upgrades, but the game clearly fails at that.
<br>Why do I like this game? It&#x2019;s pretty tactical. Through vote, you decide a tactical location where to spawn, whether you are playing the attacker or the defender. You have 10 different specializations to choose for both attack and defense. Each specialization brings some sort of tactical idea in mind. But there is clear imbalance, why choose a medic when everyone dies within 2 shots.
<br>Where does the game start to fail? There is no story mode. Team killing might not be for everyone. Uplay really sucks. There is no in game chat between friends, you have to minimize the game to get talk with your friends. I have an expensive and well received headset but apparently the game can&#x2019;t seem to locate it despite it working with every game I ever had. Matchmaking isn&#x2019;t the best; I&#x2019;ve had some games where it feels like it&#x2019;s a complete landslides. Now, does this mean the game sucks? No, I still find it very enjoyable playing with or without my friends, but there is clearly some faults that can and should be fixed.
<br>Again ill repeat, find a website that sells the keys like g2a and get the game for half the price. It&#x2019;s definitely worth it for $30-40. Otherwise, console players, I suggest you get it at discount.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5849400">Expand</a></span>

Attackers try and locate a container by scaling the building breaking through barriers and precise plan breaches.

I had low expectations given that Ubisoft were the publisher, but so far this game has proved those expectations wrong. I can go on and on about the great features, but I won&apos;t. My 9/10 says it all.
<br>
<br>What I will do is detail it&apos;s failings, as they are much fewer.
<br>
<br>It has buggy audio, for one the in game mic is difficult to turn off: by that I mean you turn it off, and after a few games it&apos;s back to constant, so you switch it to push to talk; gets you through a few games, then it&apos;s back on, so you disable, etc, etc. It&apos;s relatively simple stuff that I can&apos;t understand why they&apos;ve put off to this point. The actual environmental audio is also bugged. It can go sometimes, leaving you only hearing a few if the in game sounds, but this only happens in maybe 1/20 games. Again, really needs patching. They&apos;ve clearly put a lot of work into how the audio travels down hallways etc, it&apos;s impressive, but sometimes it can bug and give you the wrong impression of where someone is. This I imagine will not be patched anytime soon.
<br>
<br>Other than that, there are only minor in game bugs, nothing so far that I can see being a deal breaker for anybody. I played through the Alpha and the Beta and have seen a lot of bugs get patched in the short time since them so I have high hopes that these too will be resolved soon.
<br>
<br>As I said, I&apos;m only detailing the few shortcomings I could find, otherwise this is one of the best games I have come across in a very long time.

<br>
<br>Variety of choice, decision making and communication. These are the elements that make this game great. EG.
<br>You can hear someone running in the room above, running carelessly down the corridor. You might place a breaching charge on the ceiling and explode your way into the room, or you could start shooting through the ceiling hoping you hit somthing, or you could drop a little drone and race up there to view through the onboard camera, marking anyone found for your team.
<br>
<br>The environments are nearly completly destructable and can be used to shoot through, smash through,  detonate or re-enforce as you see fit. Every game plays out differently due to player choice of character and decisions made on the fly and in response to team mates or opposition..
<br>
<br>Even playing with complete beginners can be fun due to thier hilarious and often clueless decision making, accidentally slipping off roofs, having to run away from their own badly thrown grenades and just plain panicking. My own personal worst was planting a C4 charge, then panicking in response to an enemy entering the room immediately detonating it, without moving away. Wrong trigger! Dead team mates can cycle through point of view for the live players making it even more embarassing if you&apos;re the last man on your team standing at the time.
<br>
<br>Slowly as you come to understand the multitude of guns, armour, and gadgets available, you can begin to plan for each encounter more effectively. It&apos;s a game that really lends itself to team chat. Nice to see a game that brings people together in a game requiring thought, planning, teamwork and communication in order to succeed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5858719">Expand</a></span>
