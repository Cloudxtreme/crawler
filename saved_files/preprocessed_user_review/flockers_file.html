<br>This time the challenge is more focused on navigating the level with moving objects, switches and devices that change gravity among the obstacles you will encounter and these add an extra level to the puzzles beyond just getting from one end of a level to the other.
<br>Unlike Lemmings there is no way to issue commands whilst paused so you have to make sure you time everything right  - timing plays a big role in the puzzles in Flockers, release your sheep a little too early and watch all your carefully constructed plan fall apart as your entire army of sheep gets wiped out in a splatter of blood by a swinging saw blade.
<br>Apart from reaching the exit, there are extra items to collect in each level that go towards getting a higher score so the levels do have replay value (there are online leaderboards and a star rating similar to what you would find in something like angry birds) but although it seems there is really only 1 correct way to complete a level you will find yourself wanting to go back and get that high score and collect all the extra bits or do it in a faster time.
<br>
<br>You have a very limited set of abilities available to you and this is one area I would have liked to see a bit more variety along with additional ways of completing levels.
<br>Flockers does not do anything particularly new, if you have played Lemmings before then you will have a good idea of what to expect but I can&apos;t really find anything particularly wrong with the game.
<br>Don&apos;t take it too seriously and don&apos;t expect the next evolution of puzzle platformer and you will find this to be an unremarkable but perfectly enjoyable game with a great art style that will be familiar to anybody who has played worms before.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/flockers/user-reviews?user_review_id=4693986">Expand</a></span>
