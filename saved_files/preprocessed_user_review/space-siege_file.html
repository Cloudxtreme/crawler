What&apos;s good: later on the game becomes challenging, it is actually quite pretty and the physics are ludicrous yet enjoyable A fair variety of weapons and &quot;talents&quot; The story is better than some people give it credit for, it&apos;s classic cheese. Robot best friend :D What&apos;s bad: That camera gets repetative Some &quot;talent paths&quot; are awful, kind of limiting your options The endings are mish-mash and don&apos;t really represent that well the choices you took Despite it&apos;s flaws this is enjoyable old school hack and slash, but in space, and with guns. Also: I had no real problems with the controls, maybe everyone else who&apos;s complainign is just shit at the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=424275">Expand</a></span>

They don&apos;t really give a true, honest reason behind half of it. it&apos;s like they played the game for 20 minutes and said &quot;Yeah, this sucks.&quot; Well, let me be one of the first to say, no, this game does not suck. The graphics are pretty decent for the time, remember kiddies, this game was released a few years ago. I mean, with the carnage, the ragdoll effects. The graphics aren&apos;t that bad, I think the negative reviewers simply got this game in hopes of playing a Mass Effect-style Action RPG. Which this is not. This is essentially a straight out, third-person action RPG, much like the old point and click games, such as Diablo. And it&apos;s made by a company who has been successful in the past with the Dungeon Siege Series, though, those games themselves are pretty under-rated and generally obscure these days. Now, onto plot, and gameplay. As I said, the gameplay is pretty simple point and click, and is an aquired taste by nostalgic gamers, such as myself. The skills and such, are numerous and hard to juggle, but once you have a decent strategy in mind, and most of them unlocked, it gets simpler to control. My only qualm is the control of your side-kick, a robot, named HR-V, which can honestly be compared to the control of pets on the popular MMORPGs, though using the F-keys is a bit annoying.<br><br>Otherwise, the combat, and the gameplay are pretty good. And I can only hope that Gas Powered Games use what they learned here, in future games, and better themselves.<br><br>The graphics, as I stated prior, are pretty decent for the time. Bloody. Gorey. With the Ragdoll effect for items, and most dead bodies that aren&apos;t the human corpses lying around in the backdrop. The backgrounds and such could use some work, but they fit the theme. I mean, if you&apos;re surviving on a ship, you don&apos;t want to see catacombs, or whatnot. Though the lack of blinky lights, and such leave a somewhat wanting feeling, but again, the game takes place 7.5 weeks after the main enemy attacks, so the ship wouldn&apos;t be rusted, or falling apart, either.<br><br>As for the storyline, it&apos;s a general run of the mill type thing you see in most sci-fi movies that take place on a ship, though for reviewing sake, I won&apos;t spoil anything. Though, if you&apos;re like me, you will find it at least amusing at the most, even if it&apos;s not groundbreaking, or filled with so many thrilling twists. It&apos;s a good story, nonetheless. A nice take on the general theme, in my opinion.<br><br>As for combat, and such? Like I said, it&apos;s point and click. The skills are numerous, and hard to juggle, but it&apos;s easy to get the handle on for casual gamers.<br><br>In closing, this game isn&apos;t horrible. It&apos;s not amazing, but it&apos;s not horrible either. It&apos;s on par with what they were trying to do, and actually quite enjoyable if you play it for longer then twenty minutes. The cybernetic implants were an interesting way to go in terms of a &apos;moral&apos; slider, and the quick way you can swap between a gun and a laser-sword is always fun when you get surrounded by a horde of evil space-crabs. And the music and voice acting are actually quite good, for a game that&apos;s so under-rated. All I can say, is don&apos;t judge it by appearance, give it a try and really explore the features before shrugging it off. And you might be surprised.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=1613922">Expand</a></span>

You don&apos;t care to listen to mission descriptions and the story. You just right click on any adversary until he&apos;s dead and keep on crawling through uninteresting, bland halls and corridors. For an action game, the controls are HORRIBLY bad. While they work in games like Dungeon Siege, which require sometimes some strategy to win, in Space Siege combat and gameplay does not fit to this kind of control scheme. It&apos;s simply annoying! Space Siege does not even look good or interesting, so that you can show off with your new power hardware. Space Siege is a complete failure. It does not achieve anything in any part of it. The RPG part is useless, the action part suffers from bad controls and the visuals are boring, even if you have a decent machine for maximum settings. I don&apos;t know, what this game was supposed to be, but compared to the Dungeon Siege games, its just forgettable crap!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=416062">Expand</a></span>

The original Dungeon Siege was great. Then Gas Powered Games spent the next half decade using the Dungeon Siege franchise as a cash cow, recycling the engine into ever more mediocre sequels while they worked on the project they really wanted to do, Supreme Commander. Now that Sup Com&apos;s done they&apos;ve quickly churned out yet another &quot;Siege&quot; branded cash-in game to generate enough money for their next project ... Dungeon Siege was repetitive but fun anyway. There were lots of different monsters, lots of loot, and lots of interesting scenery. You always wanted to keep going to see the next town, get some more fun weapons, or try a different way of playing. But in Space Siege everywhere looks the same. The fun of getting loot and leveling up has been replaced with a bland &quot;upgrade&quot; system. So here we have a Siege game with all of the repetition but none of the fun. This one isn&apos;t even worth renting, let alone buying.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=416061">Expand</a></span>

SG and SGS (both can buy through Steam as well) are so fluid and quick and fun to play. This game could be the same but you can&apos;t run and shoot at the same time. Basically you run run run, STOP shooooooooooooot while the baddies are shooooooting at you and running at you. If I could run and shoot at the same time I would have given this game 8/10. Oh also it doesn&apos;t have waypoints/minimap so you can&apos;t see where you need to go for objectives so you run around in circles getting lost a lot. Buy shadowgrounds and shadowgrounds survivor - MUCH better games</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=416265">Expand</a></span>

After reading the reviews, I came close to walking away from the purchase but decided in the end to give it a chance and I am happy I did. This is a fun game, with plenty of action and environments to explore. The combat action is very fast, but nothing that cannot be mastered and I found the game both entertaining as well as engrossing. I do agree with some of the reviewers that said the controls could have been handled a little better, but they do work. One of my favorite parts of the game is the flexibility of the upgrade system that allows you to spend the points you have gathered during your adventure to improve weapons, armor as well as your robot sidekick. I do not get why so many folks gave this game such low marks, when it deserved better. While I agree is might not be on the same scale as ME2, for what it provides it is still fun to play. I would recommend this game for any gamer that is simply looking for a change of pace.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=1790916">Expand</a></span>

The interface is easy and manipulating the character a breeze. There are many ways to win this game, hence the interesting re-playability. There are two upgrade paths: Human and Cybernetic. However, you can mix both and thus the possibilities are exponential. Granted, winning the game is much more difficult if you stick with the Human upgrade path but the cut scene in the end is also much more interesting... The game play is well balanced and, with a little strategy, it is easy to survive all missions safe for the &quot;boss&quot; sections where you will probably need more than one try to succeed. From my point of view though, it only raised my interest as I got a lot of satisfaction in finally nabbing the right strategy (That will greatly vary depending on the upgrade path you have chosen as I said before). Granted the story line is not the best ever and somewhat predictable but, in this genre, it is pretty well secondary. As for not being able to look at the ceiling or the floor... why would I care? This is not like the first person shooter we&apos;ve been accustomed to in the last five years or so with nothing much beside &quot;awesome graphics&quot;. This is a game for those that are old enough to remember the Crusader series: OK the guy had a weird red costume and the background story was lame but that was true mayhem and absolute fun. Same here. Definitely a keeper.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=2142013">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>This game is loads of fun. The cybernetics customization is cool and abilities are awesome. It is a little bit repetitive with the missions but its not that bad. the graphics are pretty good and the controls are point and click. The plot is kind of a classic one but it is cool because it has some mystery mixed in with it. A good game with lots of customization and ways to spend money. 8 out of 10</span>

However, all I can say is that the game feels as mediocre as they get. Generic combat, generic corridors, generic enemies, generic humans vs aliens story.
<br>
<br>Most of the gameplay is an isometric shooter. Point at an enemy with your mouse and shoot. Seems like controls are simple enough. However, the enemies shoot back at you, and your only way to avoid getting shot is to roll dodge, and you have to aim it with the mouse in the direction you want to roll. So somehow you have to manage to shoot and roll dodge at the same time with just 1 mouse. And then we also get the annoying camera rotation, which is inverted. When I want to rotate left, it rotates right, and vice versa. Maybe there&apos;s a way to change this, but I didn&apos;t see it.
<br>
<br>You get a robot companion too, but it&apos;s just a regular sidekick really who acts as an extra gun in battle. You can give him a few basic commands, like attack, defend, and heal, and you can upgrade his stats just as you can upgrade your own, but there&apos;s nothing much else to it. You can probably play the whole game without ever using it.
<br>
<br>You can also get cyber implants and use skill points to improve your abilities, but it&apos;s all presented in a very generic and uninteresting way. Nearly every skill is a passive which just improves your damage or a critical chance by a couple of % and that&apos;s it. Not to mention, half of the abilities require you to have a specific cyber implant, and from what I&apos;ve played so far, I&apos;ve only found the one for the eye, so there are plenty of abilities in my upgrades menu that I can&apos;t use yet, and no idea when I will.
<br>
<br>The fact that enemies all look and act alike, makes every single battle feel the same. Throw a couple of grenades into the group and fire away till naught&apos;s left. Rinse and repeat. But then fighting enemies isn&apos;t so bad when you consider that 95% of the time you&apos;re walking and backtracking with nothing happening.
<br>
<br>You might enjoy this game if you&apos;re into dungeon crawlers with no story and simply need to play every single one out there, but otherwise I wouldn&apos;t really recommend it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/space-siege/user-reviews?user_review_id=5376508">Expand</a></span>
