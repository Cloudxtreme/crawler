There were a fet good appandages but i got bored very fast and so i cannot agree with the positiv scores all around here. So i want to write what destroys a game that could have been a good one, but failed in many points. At first the Graphic: All things are looking sterile and every place seems to have the (almost) the same fittings. The same amphoras are almost everywhere and it all looks to clean and shiny. But furthermore.. The Monsters: I hate the monsters in this game and that&apos;s why: They look different but are countless in numbers, are dumb like bread and have all the same skills. The skeleton mage hast the same skill like the goblin mage and the demon mage and so on and on.. there seems to be no really difference apart from the level. And you can nuke them away with a single...<br><br>-&gt; Skill of yours. So thats the next problem.. you have dozens of skills but you need only one or two on the highest level to simply nuke all enemys away. It works (almost) everywhere and thats no fun at all. But.. in contradiction therefore if you took points into a wrong skill the enemys can defeat you easily and it was impossible to get through the game till the developer made a patch for that problem. Now you can reskill your char for quiet a bit money and that is a system which is ok in a MMORPG but not in a Single-Player Game were you eventually spent all your money before and cant get anymore cause the all enemys on your level are defeatet already. But the biggest drawback in this game is the story. Thats the mainpoint i did not like. At first i have to tell that there are many many good apandages but they are all destroyed by the speed you are pulled through the story. This speed feels like you are handcuffed in a rollercoaster without the possibility to realy enjoy the ride. There is no time for character depths neither yours nor the enemy. You only get some little ruins of story if you met one of them or get some of the many books you can find all around the game but its still very very less information and nothing that could create some action. You get the feeling you did not really know why you kill dozens of stupid enemys and bosses and whats it all about.<br>That happens very early in the game. Its like you are there and whoaaa.. you have to kill the last dragens because of some things really far ago and then... whooaa.. you are a dragonknight instead which seems to change nothing at all (ok you have a few new enemys to kill which were your friends before- but thats accented my point of view cause it destroys the possibility of charackter depth once more)<br><br>Ok you could say.. : &quot;Yes, the game has no charakter depth and very funny stupid monsters which re-enact all over ( like diablo monsters?)<br><br>but i say: The skill system is really bad, so the game cant get a point..<br>you probably could say: Ok, the story is really really bad but look at games like gothic and so on.. that games storys are bad too. and they are fun anyway..<br><br>Yes, but Divinity 2 sucks in that point too, cause there is no interesting world around you, you could explore.. the world is really, really small and sterile..<br><br>Last but not Least: The dragon form: It is no fun at all to fly around as a dragon at getting attacked by roughly 100 turrets that don&apos;t get one hit on you. The big number of that turrets seems to be really absurd and points on the weak AI of the game. But thats not all. You cannot destroy anything else besides this turrets or enemy dragons (or flys-whatever) cause the engine sucks at that point. The area is static and indestructable even small doors can withstand your dragon power and all the enemy on the ground get invisible when you are in this form, so you cannot attack them, but still change to human to see them appear again which is (also again) very very laughable. Whats the point beeing a dragon if you cannot use your power anyway? It really sucks and looks like the games long back in the past of computer gaming. i wouldn&apos;t care if divinity2 was an indie game but it isn&apos;t<br>instead it is a game i payd plenty of money for and all i get is a really bad state of quality (even worse than my english and thats very bad)<br>So i got to the point i stopped playing the game cause i get to bored to play furthermore. I get stucked in one of that billion monster fights and asked myself what my charakter had for a reason to do that. But then i knew what i had to do. Changing my charakter into a dragon and fly anway from this game that was only a waste of time. Cause thats what dragons do.. searching for a real challenge and they could not find it in Divinity 2 (and they also like to destroy things others then turrets and probably goblin hoods or demon flys) At the end there is not much to say. If you are new to Action-RP-Games you could probably like this game but i recommend others like baldurs gate 1+2, gothic and even oblivion (still the Monster system there sucks)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1739720">Expand</a></span>

After hearing good things about the DKS, I tried it one more time, and it clicked. It takes a while to get used to the slightly over-the-top fantasy world and the game&apos;s special sense of humour; moreover, the combat system in the starting areas appears deceptively simple. It definitely pays not to give up early, as the game only gets better as it progresses (the &quot;Flames of Vengeance&quot; part is especially great).  Overall, a very fun game and the best action RPG I have played in ages. It&apos;s got good quests, excellent exploration, surprisingly good writing and voice acting, and interesting mechanics (mindreading). I recommend playing on &quot;nightmare&quot; (which is nowhere as difficult as the name would suggest), otherwise the game might become too easy relatively soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1502602">Expand</a></span>

Very wise decision -- this game far exceeded my expectations. In a sentence, I&apos;d say the gameplay is roughly similar to Fallout3/NV set in a medieval fantasy world, which isn&apos;t surprising given they share the Gamebryo engine. What is surprising is that the game is remarkably well-textured, well-scripted, well-voiced and overall well-executed and never crashed one single time throughout 40+ hours of gameplay. (So, FO:NV, you have no excuse why you can&apos;t run longer than 30 minutes at a time without barfing)<br><br>The game is a somewhat slow boil to get fully going, but that actually made me enjoy it quite a bit more. DKS2 builds anticipation in the player to get to the next set of milestones, and it&apos;s handled in a natural manner. It takes ~15-20 hours of gameplay to earn your wings, so to speak, while feeling that you&apos;re really working for it instead of just going through the motions or filler quests. Some of the side quests are somewhat filler, but they weren&apos;t much different (good or bad) from similar games. The core main quests were pretty awesome from beginning to end, and always advanced the plot accordingly. It truly feels like you are pursuing a destiny and not just point-click-shoot. It&apos;s immersive enough that I could lose hours of time, and that hasn&apos;t happened for a long time. The boss battles were mostly hard for my archer, including 2 battles where I died 15+ times -- to finally beat the boss reminded me of days back on the NES when you had tears of joy for finally beating a hard part. The game does get easier about 2/3 through, where you&apos;re not exactly invincible but not in mortal danger either.<br><br>As a huge FO3/FO:NV fan, I compare the open world and texturing to it, and find DKS superior enough that I didn&apos;t believe they were on the same engine until I looked it up. DKS is a mostly open world as well (you do move between major portions of the world as the story advances) and plays out superbly in 3-dimensions with the addition of flight. My only minor gripe is on the NPC animations when they are talking. They all talk with their arms flailing and strange head rolls/tilts. It&apos;s just a bit disconcerting and silly at times.<br><br>The dialogue was also well-written and voice actors did a good job overall as well. There were humorous dialog choices, including some that will reference decisions and characters from 20-30 gameplay hours ago. It was a pleasant, unexpected touch.<br><br>The Flames of Vengeance expansion add-on wasn&apos;t as epic, but I suppose that&apos;s to be expected for an add-on. It was longer than a lot of DLC, adding on a solid 15 hours (doing all side quests), but the map and scope were more limited and it felt more repetitive. Also, in the FoV add-on, you get showered with top-of-the-line equipment and upgrades non-stop. Want a skill point? Here, take 3! It greatly reduced the challenge of the add-on. Independently, I&apos;d only give FoV a 7 or 8, but they did a nice job tying it in with the main plot line instead of just being a random &quot;now, let&apos;s do something crazy different&quot; like most add-ons/DLC out there. I would probably score this game a highly respectable 9, but I give it a 10 just because it&apos;s so much better than most well-publicized games out there that I want to make sure it gets some love.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1709534">Expand</a></span>

The jumping animation is so much fun that you will be jumping everywhere with a silly grin on your face. The RPG system and combat are also a pleasure, encouraging you to master a handful of skills across classes making sure that the gameplay flows in a nice way while giving you interesting options for character building.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1496089">Expand</a></span>

Interesting story, highly customisable characters, decent replayabilty and the &apos;special&apos; ability is implemented very well. It looks great too and doesn&apos;t hold your hand either. I was leaning towards an 8 but I&apos;ll give it 9 because, as already noted by other reviewers, it is not only different but unique and I&apos;m disillusioned with the mass produced drivel that is currently being churned out. Try it and watch out for this developer in the future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1804502">Expand</a></span>

All my issues previously were fixed, and the game was awesome!  I devoted almost 80 hours into both the Ego Dragonis remix and Flames of Vengance add-on and it was a few weeks well spent!   My only issue was gear replacements should have been spread out more.  I went 10-15 levels before replacing my armor because nothing really was worth it...and then suddenly I had to choose between 3 sets...would have been nicer to space them out and get upgrades here and there, but that did not detract from the game.  Well worth it particularly if you can find it on sale like I did on Steam for 50% off...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1695004">Expand</a></span>

Great fun from beginning to end and a lot of the game flies in the face of the modern paradigm of RPGs which is more than fine by me. For example, enemies are tougher by geographical area so they can be as challenging as you want them to be. Also, some quests are hard to find and the game has quirky humour and some obscure references (Pink Floyd anyone?). Again, all very welcome in my eyes. The second half of the game could easily have been a let down but certainly wasn&apos;t and you can customise your abilities in many ways. Very passable storyline, some memorable characters (together with personalities), good gear, a variety of enemies, solid combat, great landscapes, this game has an awful lot going for it. Here&apos;s to the next one, which, with a bit of effort could score even higher from me. I notice that this game currently has a higher average than Skyrim which restores my faith in the gaming community in general. I&apos;m off to see how I get on as a mage. Have fun with this - I&apos;m sure you will.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=2266703">Expand</a></span>

I was very happily surprised fun fast combat nice voice acting and interesting story, allot of content so many side quests. i would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes role-playing games.</span>

The game is VERY creative and open if you can get through the first hour or 2.  I realize that the item drops contain very detailed information (much like Titan Quest) and I really get into putting together top notch gear combinations.  The gameplay is very smooth and fluid.  The world is open and large, very navigatable.  When in dragon form, it is very different, but also somewhat addicting.  The skill system is also one of its strong points.  There are 5 (?) different class sections that contain different skills from each class.  The nice thing is that you can learn skills from any class you want.  You can TRULY customize how your character plays and that simple fact takes this game very far.  When I play a computer game, the story is important yes, but moreover, the sounds, the visuals, and the gameplay are more important.  Im running at 24&quot; BenQ at 1920x1200 native HD and 5.1 Surround.  This game is great to play as the sun is setting, at lower light levels and sounds turned up.  You really can get immersed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1704728">Expand</a></span>

It has a few flaws that stand out and may put people off the game completely. However, the flaws are largely superficial, and hold no REAL bearing on how the game stand on it&apos;s own two feet.
<br>
<br>The main problems I have encountered have been graphical bugs here and there (a clipping texture or framerate dropping), and the combat system (a little lackluster). But the graphical bugs you learn to accept, and the combat, for all it&apos;s simplicity, did grow on me. I found myself fighting groups of goblins in a pack, with mages throwing fireballs at my face quite exhilarating after a little while.
<br>
<br>Aside from those main points, the game really does hold out well. Like I said at the very beginning, don&apos;t go into this expecting Skyrim. Go into it thinking Morrowind. Or Oblivion. Everyone had fun with those right? But the bugs were there and they were glaring at times. But in the end, it didn&apos;t detract from the game as a whole. Divinity II has the same feel for me. A large expansive world to explore, diverse characters to speak to and perform quest for. Really quite an interesting story to unfold, revolving around dragon slaying. And some really quite nice class customizing going on as well.
<br>
<br>A large focus is spent on upgrading your gear in the game, and it employs some nice touches from other RPG&apos;s out there, such as randomized effects on weapons and armor, or spells.
<br>
<br>Aside from a few graphics bugs here and there, the game is actually rather pretty. I would sooner recommend the PC version over the 360 though, simply for some better anti-aliasing on textures and nice HDR effect to make use of that the 360 version, unfortunately, suffers for a little bit.
<br>
<br>All in all, though, Divinity II: DKS is a nice solid RPG for fans of the genre, and it will certainly keep you occupied for nice amount of time too. Once you shake off the rocky start with combat and look past some of the more peculiar bugs that occur, this game should give you nice solid chunk of RPG to chew on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=4198459">Expand</a></span>

The graphics weren&apos;t great, but they weren&apos;t bad either. The visuals were not trying to be the best they could be but still try to look decent. My major peeve is the game felt small despite all the sub quests and such, there&apos;s only one respectable town and it&apos;s a village and it gets destroyed halfway through the game. I feel if they added some more towns, locations, and a more open world, this game could of easily been a classic GOTY material game that could of even toppled Fable. It&apos;s writing was unbeatable, it&apos;s music was fabulous, and you&apos;ll never forget a single character you meet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=2185282">Expand</a></span>

The story is interesting in itself, with memorable characters and engaging plot twists, fights are nice and require agility, a bit of planning and strategic thinking, and the world is lush and pretty. But not too pretty, mind you :) I didn&apos;t expect much of this one, and I was very pleasantly surprised. There are a lot of (meaningful!) dialogues, quests are good, and you can transform to a dragon. It is even more fun that it sounds, because you can practically freely fly around the map then - but still looking out for some things that can hurt you. I thorougly enjoyed this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=2424202">Expand</a></span>

While the combat can be hectic, the wide variety of skills leaves open plenty of options to make your character the way you want them.  It lacks some of the polish of big-budget RPGs, but is packed with things to do in every nook and cranny.  Unlike games which seem almost embarrassed to be fantasy games, as if they feel they have to make up for being fantastical with a serious mood, DKS just takes fantasy and runs with it.  It&apos;s packed full of dry humor and subtle references, and I would recommend it to just about anyone looking for a action-RPG that doesn&apos;t hold their hand.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1436753">Expand</a></span>

Still it was &#xC2;&#xA3;14.99 and I was flush with cash, so I went for it..<br><br>Its not something I regret, most often in RPGs you will be given a gimmick, that while it sounds cool has little practical effect beyond a few abilities. Such as being a Demigod in a popular Black Isle MMO, this never really threaded into the gameplay, but sure it was the whole reason behind the plot.<br><br>In DKS it is regrettably similar, you won&apos;t just be chomping people as an enormous flying lizard, or at all for the most part, it is similar to a flying mount. But it is very cool, and really makes you feel powerful when you do use it.<br><br>The plot itself is quite intresting, to a degree. It feels quite Dragon Agey to some degree at first, you are a Slayer looking to put an end to a Dragon, but that goes awry rather quickly and the real plot is revealed. There is alot of fine humor in the game, and the single thing that stands out is that it is not a party based game, where PC is guarded and supported by companions and only represents a small portion of the fighting power, yet takes full credit. You will be doing the fighting with your own hands or spells, and barring the slightly bumpy start really get the feeling you are an ancient, godlike being. Able to toast people, cast spells, shoot arrows, stab, read minds and whatever else you fancy.<br><br>Its hard to credit the game with being non linear, what it can be credited with is being really, really good, and i&apos;d heartily recommend it. Especially when it languishes in the shadow of the comparatively poorer Dragon Age II. This is how action RPG should be done, in this game you can and must dodge attacks using your characters great agility, rather than have your feet glued to the ground.<br><br>Amazing game, I enjoyed it far far more than I expected.<br><br>Another bonus I am really anal about is that you have some character customization options, such as gender, voice and hair, which can really break an RPG for me. I like a bit of, or a lot of choice.<br><br>Being able to choose deliciously evil or snarky dialogue in nearly every conversation was something I liked, and I got to pick my own words.

Graphically it is a feast even on the lower settings, pity monsters do not re spawn after you whack them the country side gets empty after awhile. The story line is good if a little loose in places but their is plenty of back story and side plots.Combat is fun and varied even the lower monster can gang up and whoop you good! The world is big but not Oblivion big. The manual is not particularly helpful and even the load up screens recommend checking the forum for hints. Character creation is okay but you have to pick a class and stick to it, planned leveling is important. All in all a lot of fun to be had.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1447095">Expand</a></span>

I was pleasantly surprised when I&apos;ve learned that this game was not one of them. I was so pulled in by the story that many times I&apos;ve lost the track of time. When Divinity 2: DKS was released, I was overjoyed and again without any track of time. Without any doubt I can say that the developers of Divinity 2 just reached perfection with their game. Improved graphics and a brilliant story, what more could a gamer ask for? Indeed, the game still has it&apos;s flaws but those are far outweighed by the features. I believe that many RPG developers have much to learn from this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1490699">Expand</a></span>

A very interesting sense of humor, that pulls in the player and creates the feeling that something is accomplished . The Player Character is someone with impact, that is something that is becoming rare in modern RPG&apos;s where a cutscene defines the impact, instead of the players decision.There is lots of love in the detail, many interesting NPC&apos;s and player abilities that are actually fun. Combat is action heavy, a very rare case where the combat is doing exactly what I expect it to do-in this specific case to entertain me. The included expansion Flames of Vengeance is more character oriented, evolving around the player, and His decisions  and is a welcome addition that adds more focus to the initial game.<br>Overall lots of quests, funny dialogues with great voice overs ,great  music  and beautiful  visuals that are just a expansion of the interesting atmosphere.<br>A 8 as score only because  I liked  better the more difficult and even unpolished approach of Ego Draconis, namely some specific locations that are combat wise made simpler in DKS.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1570324">Expand</a></span>

The open-world, the gigantic sandbox they let you run around in, is just beautiful. The NPCs really make this game shine, though, the range of interaction and degree of characterization help immensely to connect and care for them. Which means when they die (As they do on occasion), it comes as quite a blow. I cannot, however, reccomend this game enough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1599668">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are great and on par with Two Worlds II and the atmosphere and music are perfection. I find myself smiling a lot while playing this game, whether it is the ability to read minds or simply trying to find everything on the maps. The player is encouraged to explore, while not getting utterly lost in the direction similar in games like Dragon Age or Oblivion. While the geamplay is linear, your options at the end of each quest is not. You have choices and either choice rewards you with experience; good, bad, or neutral. I&apos;ve had a blast with this game and the cinematics are incredible at times. I would definitely say it was worth the $40 I paid for it. Games I like that are similar to this are Two Worlds, Fable, and Dark Messiah Might and Magic, although this game clearly surpasses each of these. The only reason it does not get a 10 is that I do not believe anygame could acheive this rating of perfection. So, 9 is the highest I would give anything.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1488278">Expand</a></span>

Since I stared playing Divinity 2 the first thing that really made it stand out to me was that while it had a serious storyline it didn&apos;t take itself too seriously and maintained the idea that it was a game without breaking any kind of flow. While the biggest drawback was the combat for me, where huge groups of enemies resulted in me just continuously back flipping away and shooting off exploding arrows or that the enemy has devastating heat seeking poison/exploding arrows it still maintains to be fun regardless of small frustrations. While it looks nice and it has a lot going for it, it does lack some sort of polish that would have made it even better, it is still worth getting and playing through. I can&apos;t think of any abilities in other recent games as satisfying as being able to jump off a cliff and turn into a dragon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1498537">Expand</a></span>

Having picked this up, I can only assume that the issues were fixed, as this is a thoroughly enjoyable game 25 hours in, and I have yet to play the expansion element, which I have heard is even better. The game is absolutely pack with things to do - I loved Fallout 3 and Oblivion, but the areas were so dauntingly large, with vast areas of nothing to do.. This has more of a Fable sense of scale, but with actually interesting quests with a more sophisticated and mature (not too mature) sense of humour.<br><br>As for criticisms, whilst the graphics are mostly very attractive and the art direction is of a high quality, there are some texture drop-in issues. The character facial models you can choose from are a truly special kind of ugly, which is odd as the NPCs are often more attractive. Fortunately the in game armor is attractive, so you can cover your ugly mug with something impressive looking within a few hours. There is a slightly odd control issue - you map items to buttons by holding the button down for an extended amount of time - this is easy to do in the heat of combat. No gamebreaker though, it only happens occasionally.<br><br>In summary, great graphics, great voice work, interesting quests, and a ton of interesting game mechanics (not gone into for the sake of avoiding spoilers, though the in game tips do give a lot away before you experience it) - its a little rough around the edges, but having just finished the big budget, high  hype Fable 3, and I have enjoyed this a great deal more!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1448930">Expand</a></span>

Couple this with a wide-open world, non-linear quests, great writing, tough but fair puzzles, excellent sound. interesting story and lore.

As simple (or even ugly) as the characters can look the environments are amazing and lighting is some of the best of any game.

<br>The review is based after about 20 hours of game play.  I still have plenty to see but the game runs smoothly on my older rig.  I have the visuals about maxed and the game looks really very good compared to the choppy and less detailed view of the vanilla version.  The gameplay is fun, deep and more action oriented instead of stat oriented.  You have a character to build in anyway you want and can mix and match skills to have a warrior/mage etc.   The game is challenging but in no way a Dark Souls challenge.   You just have to play smart and the story is there to keep you interested.  All in all if you love rpgs this is one to pick up.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=3972445">Expand</a></span>

I must say at first I was quite impressed with the striking visuals, fleshed-out characters and deep world.  However, after the first ten hours or so, I began to start feeling like I was playing an MMO -- I had amassed a huge quest log (complete with question marks floating over characters&apos; heads) containing many mundane tasks (&quot;Collect Goblin Hearts&quot; or &quot;Kill these 6 monsters&quot;).  I kind of get bored when I have so many &quot;quests&quot; going on that I don&apos;t remember what they are, who I got them from, or why on Rivelon I should care.  I guess this is RPG bread and butter, but I couldn&apos;t shake that WoW-flavored malaise.<br><br>That&apos;s not to say there aren&apos;t cool highlights.  The combat is often quite fun for an RPG, with cover and maneuvering playing important roles in tough fights.  Claiming your dragon powers lead to many hours of fun exploration (coupled with quite a bit of easy and repetitive aerial combat - just strafe in circles and fire away).  Conquering the Battle Tower opens an interesting &quot;home upgrade&quot; system, which is ultimately not too customizable or rewarding.<br><br>However, to me the biggest flaw in the game is the equipment.  In a game where finding good loot is paramount, the game seriously falls on it&apos;s face.  Almost every piece of weaponry, armor, jewelry, etc, provides 6 or 7 benefits - making comparison nearly impossible.  The items are randomly generated, Diablo style, so seeing names like &quot;Supportive Bronze Ridged Ring of the Warrior Gods&quot; and &quot;Overlord&apos;s Ornate Amethyst Ring of Eternal Burning&quot; is common (Complete with color-coded rarity levels).  By the way, those two rings I named each have seven benefits and are nearly identical in function.  The overall effect of this is that I simply cannot be bothered to care what I&apos;m equipped with after a while.  After 10 minutes trying to compare the stats of a new warhammer and a shortsword, while on pause in the heat of battle, I often just randomly picked one.  Or more often picked whichever looked cooler.<br><br>All in all, it&apos;s worth a look if you&apos;re a big RPG nerd craving countless missions and statistical analysis.  Others should probably steer to something a little more &apos;fun&apos;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1501075">Expand</a></span>

The developers strove for perfection in every aspect of this game and when it comes graphics, story, voice acting, and immersion they succeeded. The story is by far the most engrossing, original, and compelling story in a major RPG in a decade. The voice acting is awesome. The graphics and the action focus in combat make for true immersion. The problem, however, is that they couldn&apos;t sustain perfection in all aspects of the game and the result is at times wincing. My biggest gripe is the sheer complexity of the game.  In Divinity 2 I found myself simply overwhelmed with choices: where to go, what to do, what to wear, what enhancement to put on what I&apos;m wearing. To be truthful I found myself at times simply saying to myself, &quot;oh the hell with it!&quot; and going to the option screen and turning the difficulty slider down to &quot;casual&quot; to get through a rough fight rather than dealing with the sheer plethora of gems, charms, enchants, skills, and gear. The randomly generated loot is a particular annoyance. The AI for summoned creatures is horrible.  More than anything else I was struck by the fact that it seemed like the developers took an excellent old-school RPG and mated it with some of the worst aspects of the World of Warcraft. Nevertheless, if you like RPGs you owe it to yourself to play this game. Outside The Witcher it&apos;s the best RPG I have played in the last five years. As much as I want to give this a 10 I just can&apos;t. I&apos;m rating this game an eight but it&apos;s a &quot;tough love&quot; eight. I strongly think that if the developers had resisted some of their more grandiose ambitions I would be rating this the best RPG ever made. But they bit of more than they could chew, as the saying goes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=1765258">Expand</a></span>

Loot is randomized and often quite satisfying. The game&apos;s design is a little scattershot, veering from interesting to poor in equal turn. Combat is simplistic, however the amount of interchangeable skills counterbalances this. Art direction is also inconsistent, with some sights being breathtaking and others being generic. The music is sweet - however it&apos;s also disconnecting and times, and never feels empowering. A strong game that has some extreme lows and extreme highs in rapid succession. Recommended to those who want something a little different in tone, and are willing to put up with some major pacing issues.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=2160409">Expand</a></span>

Now regret this purchase, and would not touch anything else made by Larian with a barge pole. The  game feels lazy and half finished, the inspired concept of turning into a Dragon accounts for a tiny fraction of time spent in game culminating in a final mission thats a god awful escort quest- I can only suspect that the folks who made this stopped playing actual games a long long time ago.
<br>
<br>The game is also pretty useless at explaining the lore of the setting, producing memorable characters, or just explaining what the hell is going on. Boring, confused, rambling nonsense is how I would sum up this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=3423672">Expand</a></span>

But it all comes to the most boring combat i have ever seen in a game. It is like a hack n slash gameplay with mobs too low in numbers and too high in life to kill in a few blows. Boring to its very core. A few hours in the game and i deleted it from my pc. Don&#xB4;t waste your time or money in such a bad game.</span>

The game has one of the best written dialogues even compared to more famed RPGs out there. The story itself isn&apos;t bad, although it could use a bit better delivery. The graphics isn&apos;t great, with dated textures and uninspiring design. Special effects animations are also scarce and unimpressive. The performance is significantly improved over Ego Draconis, but the highest graphics settings still require a high-end computer. Combat could&apos;ve been smoother and slower; often everything&apos;s happening too fast and unsatisfying. Side-quests are various and non-monotonic, although more focus would be great. Loot and crafting (gems, enchantments, alchemy) are diverse and well-randomized, but don&apos;t expect something as satisfying as Diablo II or Dragon Age. Overall the game is still entertaining, but it lacks the sense of satisfaction that keeps players addicted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=2427400">Expand</a></span>

I will say right off the bat that this review comes from the mind of a person who approaches video games with the perspective of a literary scholar - if you&apos;re just looking for a few hours of something to do, Divinity 2 is fine for that. However, if you&apos;re looking for something more interesting, you might want to take heed.
<br>First of all, don&apos;t let the ads and reviews fool you: The dragon mechanic IS kind of cool, but ultimately it feels very lacking. In the Ego Draconis content there&apos;s only one area you really feel like you&apos;re flying freely around, and there are &apos;anti-dragon zones&apos; that prevent you from entering on pain of near-instant death. There aren&apos;t even tooltips or anything warning you, just just figure out that entering the wavy bubble shields as a dragon means you die and have to reload, which can be a really bitter lesson. Also, throw away any ideas you have of raining fiery death from above. You can&apos;t target most ground units as a dragon, only certain structures. Dragon armor has some use, but only gives bonuses to dragon abilities, not any kind of protection. The dragon function really only feels as good as it&apos;s advertised in the very last sequence of Flames of Vengeance (I should also note that said sequence is the only time you can use dragon form in the entire package), and even then, it wasn&apos;t all I expected. All in all, don&apos;t expect the dragon form to be as awesome as others might seem to make it.
<br>With that out of the way, another huge problem here is how pointless the whole thing feels after a bit of content. The loading screen tips say &quot;consequences are irreversible&quot; for your decisions, but I never felt like my decisions really had any impact. A non-spoiler hypothetical example - not from the game - would be having to decide between saving your best friend or you significant other, but either way the one who &quot;dies&quot; is revealed to have actually survived to come back later. At first you think this was just a little twist, but then you find that every single decision is just the same. Not only that, but there&apos;s no real free-roam feeling. All the side-quests are built in to help you level and progress - failing to do them will pit your level 9 character against groups of level 12 enemies, I found - so they feel like a part of the main game, not like they&apos;re additional things you can consider doing. So ultimately all your hard-earned gear, skills, spells, and abilities go towards the main story of the game and nothing else. Once the game ends, it ends, and everything you just did is no longer relevant. That&apos;s not a feeling I like to have - I like the feeling I have in KOTOR II, where my choices can really impact the game and even my companions need to have good gear or I&apos;m the one who&apos;s boned. Even though there&apos;s limited free-roam in KOTOR II, it still felt like I didn&apos;t have to do almost every quest to level properly (in fact, my first few runthroughs, I didn&apos;t do many side-quests).
<br>And then there&apos;s the STORY. The entire cast is extremely forgettable - Commander Rhodes, your former Dragon Slayer mentor, is seen three times in the entirety of Ego Draconis, and never for very long. You learn through hearsay that she&apos;s apparently the best of the Dragon Slayers - I never would&apos;ve known. She&apos;s made out to be some critical, important player in the story, but you hardly ever see her, and in Flames of Vengeance, whatever kind of character arc she had doesn&apos;t even get any kind of proper closure. Names and characters like Lord Lovis, the cursed Dragon Knight whose soul haunts his tower in penance for his crimes, and Talana, last of the Dragon Knights, are introduced, but just those descriptions I get are the extent of their character. You now know about as much of them as I do. Play the game and learn just a teensy bit more and then never hear of them or from them ever again. Everything in the game feels extremely disposable, like I could&apos;ve gone without doing or hearing or learning of it, yet that&apos;s the whole game. Nothing about the story seemed to matter eventually - after the beginning, it felt like characters were introduced only to exit stage left the moment the scene ended and never return. Even in Flames of Vengeance, which apparently was meant to bring &quot;closure&quot;, nothing of the sort really comes. Even the ending feels incomplete.
<br>This game is not what it&apos;s made out to be. It&apos;s not AWFUL - it&apos;s worth the buy if it&apos;s on sale for a decent price - and I wouldn&apos;t call it bad, even. But it&apos;s extremely rough-hewn and half-baked, and all the features advertised are blown out of proportion to the point where it almost felt like a different game than advertised. Get it if it&apos;s on sale and you need something to do and nothing else is available, but just keep in mind the whole mythos of the badass Dragon Knight is a bunch of dragon ****</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=4895493">Expand</a></span>

<br>It has beautiful visuals and music, simple but fun gameplay, nice lite humor and specific great atmosphere. Like in other Larian titles there is some retro feel in it all and like other its a gameplay not story oriented.
<br>Its really an action rpg with platformer elements more than h&amp;s.
<br>Its what a real action rpg should be like- fun, simple and  easy going but also challenging.
<br>Its not a game for everyone but you should try it- you will either love it or hate it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/divinity-ii-the-dragon-knight-saga/user-reviews?user_review_id=5860903">Expand</a></span>
