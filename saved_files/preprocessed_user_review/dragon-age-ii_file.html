Dragon Age II is nothing more than a half-hearted attempt to cash in on the incredible success that was Dragon Age: Origins. That said, the game has both positive and negative features that one must take into account.<br><br>First the negative: Dragon Age II takes place mostly in a single environment, the city of Kirkwall. Kirkwall is neither attractive nor welcoming in ways Bioware both wanted (art style, ambiance) and ways they most probably did not want (repetitiveness).  The set pieces in this game repeat themselves at an unacceptable rate. The combat is more tuned to consoles than to PC gaming, and as a PC gamer, I found this entry in the Dragon Age saga rather boring in terms of combat. While there is blood and gore, it is at a ludicrous level, obviously meant to appeal to the ultra-violence/God of War crowd. What makes combat worse is the fact that enemies spawn in waves, often in absurd quantities, and the player will often have to engage in combat for no reason at all, as mindless thugs will spawn in the streets frequently. If you are a fan of Mass Effect, Dragon Age: Origins, or Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, you will be horribly disappointed by the game&apos;s background, writing, and pace as well. Dragon Age II is repetitive in the nature of its quests. There is little gray area to be seen in this game, and such themes as slavery, and &quot;blood magic&quot; (slitting one&apos;s wrists to conjure evil spirits or kill people) obviously denote evil, and place a decidedly moralistic overtone on the game. There is also nowhere near enough loot and new equipment to keep the scavenging aspect all-too-crucial to a role playing game interesting. Finally, the whole game is told retrospectively through the narrative of a secondary character, and the plot ends with a massive, pointless cliffhanger. Rather than write a good game with a sense of closure at the end (e.g. DA:O or KOTOR), Bioware has chosen to go the &quot;Halo 2 route&quot; and try to keep us guessing. If only I cared. Now for the good. The combat in this game is, I suppose, rather entertaining for Console players. Despite their repetitiveness, the set pieces are quite pretty. Also, the protagonist, Hawke, actually has a voice, and his dialogue works much like that of Commander Shepard in Mass Effect. Indeed, the lending of a voice to the protagonist actually strengthens this game&apos;s otherwise mainly weak narrative. Hawke is a very human character, who is well-acted and who responds believable to situations both grave and light well. On the topic of response, the lip-synch and character design in this game are also fantastic. Each of the game&apos;s secondary characters has a unique design, makes them the only visually appealing part of the game. If you wish to know, the secondary characters all have well-written back stories as well, which are actually more interesting than the game&apos;s main plot. Other than that, the game is fairly lengthy (my play through lasted about 24 hours) and technically reasonable, meaning that it doesn&apos;t crash and lag as much as a game like Fallout: New Vegas.<br><br>In conclusion, Dragon Age II is a decent game. In my opinion, it is nowhere near as bad as other reviewers say it is. Perhaps, they are overreacting because they expected a game closer to the original. Honestly, I was as well. That said, I was able to enjoy this game by putting it aside from Bioware&apos;s other work. Such a title is far below their standards; however, it is still a serviceable game and a fairly good adventure yarn. My suggestion is don&apos;t bother with the PC version: wait a few months and buy it half-price or rent it for  a console. Despite Dragon Age II&apos;s myriad flaws, it is still a serviceable game, just not one that is worth sixty dollars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1518995">Expand</a></span>

<br>As far as story goes, Acts 1 and 2 were good enough and pretty enjoyable. When it came to Act 3 (the final), however, the fact that the player&apos;s choice is an illusion is made all too clear as one is railroaded down an unchanging series of events. This wouldn&apos;t be too bad save for the fact that it almost seems that Act 3 is unfinished, and that the two &apos;endings&apos; are actually just one ending, stretched to fit two different alignment choices at the end. Because of this, one ending seems blatantly preferable to the other as it&apos;s the only one that makes sense. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>PROS
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>* Combat (Characters felt powerful)
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>* Voice Acting (Though voiced protagonist likely limited the storyline)
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>* Act 1, Act 2 are fun enough, if not fleshed out enough to shine
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>* Companions interact with each other in cut scenes and through banter
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>* The story telling method: a reflective narrative that adapts to the player&apos;s decisions (however minor they are)
<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>/////CONS/////
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>* Character felt less like a &apos;champion&apos; and more like a footnote in history
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>* Act 3 and its terribly assembled plot/ No satisfying ending
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>* Recycled environments (you will memorize loot spots, etc.)
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>* The game actually feels rushed, spotty, and hollow at points - I don&apos;t think anyone would say that this game would not have benefited from more development time. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>* Ridiculous Boss HP - makes some fights more grind than challenge
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>* Economy and crafting are limited and limiting
<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>* No background humor, the world and lore are lacking personality (Just copy/pasted from Origins where it isn&apos;t bland)
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>* Quests are extremely repetitive
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>* Loot is overly simplistic and &quot;Junk&quot; is a terrible, terrible concept
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>Overall, this game isn&apos;t the worst thing in the world, but it falls short in many places. I hope the inevitable sequel can benefit by avoiding the mistakes of Dragon Age II.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1556546">Expand</a></span>

I struggled to find any semblance of a RPG here. This is BioWare&apos;s hero, not mine. I felt as if they were playing the game for me for long periods. Good job too in some respects otherwise I would never have finished it and got at least some value for money. If this game wasn&apos;t rushed to hell then Bioware/EA need to start firing people - starting yesterday. Combat bereft of tactics, cave deja vu, camera angles, boring quests - I won&apos;t go on repeating what others have said. There were some good moments and this is not a 0/10 game, but neither is it a 10/10. It&apos;s definitely not worth paying full price for it - maybe when it&apos;s half price you will feel that spending your money was not in vain. My main motivation for signing up and writing this was after reading the Escapists review for this game which is absolutely shameful. Either the reviewer has an IQ slightly above Isabella&apos;s chest measurement or it&apos;s the other, obvious, less savoury possibility.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1518639">Expand</a></span>

Because if you were expecting any of the greatness of Origins in this game, then dissapointment is all you&apos;ll find.<br>It really is a comletely different game that happens to have a dragon age theme. This is not an rpg, but an action game. one of the worst aspects is the dialogue which is as unrealistic and incoherent as it can be. That&apos;s tragic given that what made Origins a masterpiece is the fact the conversations/dialogue brought the characters to life. You could actually connnect to the characters as if they were real people. you could role play. I found myself hating my own character is dragon age 2. not to mention that what you pick on the screen and what your character actually says are two different things. also the fact that your main character speaks for himself doesn&apos;t allow you to role play. If you really want a role playing experience get Dragon Age Origins instead. The ultimate edition is 29 dollars on Steam and the game is far better than Dragon Age 2. Orgins is 100 times better for half the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1731344">Expand</a></span>

This game is following the ever so trendy genre of a cliffhanger so they can milk the series as much as possible. They are taking a page out of Kotick&apos;s book and are wanting to get the most bang for their buck, which makes sense economically, but doesn&apos;t make sense when playing the game. Sure the original game had some moments that could be explored in the future but it gave closer to the storyline that it set out to tell. This sequel leaves too much out there and is pretty much if anything a bridge to a next game and isn&apos;t a real game itself. DA 2 would have a lot of these issues fixed if it wasn&apos;t rushed out. I am again sure it was good for a business stand point but for the player it just feels like a let down from the best RPG makers out there. I remember when games were actually made for the PC instead of us having to deal with an inferior console port. They limited the camera angle on DA2 so you are pigeon holed into playing as the consolers. This might just be an issue for me but eventually I got over it. The reason they said for this is because they didn&apos;t want to spend the money on making textures for the drop down camera. When all they really had to do was black out the screen in parts where they needed textures. Lastly I would except a lot more of Bioware from a game. A lot of the storytelling elements just don&apos;t make any sense. I am not going to go into any of them and if you want you can go to their forums and read what others are saying. Overall an average game and I have no idea how a score of 8 can be average. Corrupt game reviewers not wanting to give the game a score that it deserves is pathetic.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1540827">Expand</a></span>

The first few hours of the game were fun, I enjoyed the smooth feel of combat and enjoyed Varric&apos;s humour very much. However the charm of DA2 wears off after you find yourself completing meaningless quests in the same area you had visited a couple of hours before. Bioware constantly recycle quest environments and have put little effort into making the game as challenging as DA:O. In fact, every fight in the game is the same: You kill one wave of enemies and another instantly appears out of thin air. I am very disappointed in this game and it was no surprise to learn Bioware plans to create Dragon Age 3 by using the best parts of Origins and the best parts of DA2. I&apos;ll admit, combat is a major improvement for DA2, but the characters (except Varric) develop weakly. The story could have been soo much better (especially with regards to the Templar v Mages conflict) but it was just poorly executed. If you loved DA:O then heed this warning: The game has clearly been aimed at an audience difference from fans of the original. Do you remember the epic scene of King Cailan at the beginning of DA:O? Do you remember how mad you were at Loghain? You will NEVER feel that affectively connected with any characters in this game. This is a terrible, terrible piece of unimaginative work from Bioware.<br><br>I cannot stress enough how bad it is that they reused the SAME areas over and over again for quests and how enemies materialise out of thin air. If you play on the hardest difficulty the enemies do not get smarter either, they are REALLY stupid.<br><br>If you are about 15-16 or under, are a casual gamer who enjoys a quick 30 minute dip at a game each session, or if you like a quick action-orientated game then I could recommend this title to you. If you prefer detailed storyline, intricate characters, epic storytelling then DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. I don&apos;t know how it is getting such rave reviews, but I&apos;d imagine this is coming from its target audience (which is good I guess, considering that is what it was aimed at) but if you loved DA:O NEVER let this game EVER touch your Xbox or PC, EVER! It&apos;s quite funny to see how the XboX users found this generally positive than PC users (suggesting a consolified marketplace now).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1894198">Expand</a></span>

With Drageon Age 2 I believe a worrying tendency emerges I have to adress: short development periods (18 month for DA2), incomplete game world and story, simplistic gameplay to broaden the audience, demanding full prize while preparing DLCs that shall fill in the remaining gaps. Bioware was once regarded as &quot;the bringer of rain&quot; after a drought in the genre of RPGs (for the PC). But now they could play the opposite role: if they are the most prominent agents of the genre (besides Bethesda) and their games are setting trends, then other companies will follow their example, if they haven&apos;t already. To be more detailed I&apos;ll point out aspects that annoyed me the most: Game World:<br>- The most insolent re-use in an state-of-the-art RPG I&apos;ve seen so far: dozens of times you walk through levels which are IDENTICAL, and I mean identical. Every corner, texture, modell, architecture, lighting etc. are exactly the same, just with another label (for example &quot;cave xyz&quot; instead of &quot;cave abc&quot;).<br>- The main game world consists of just 15 to 20 small or very small locations in a city (small means an area which takes 20 seconds to 60 seconds to cross, very small means a simple flat)<br>- There are no (more or less) diversified regions like snowy mountains, deserts, jungle, forest, real dungeons, castles, other towns etc., just this one city and three outer regions that are not noteworthy<br>- The few existing places look sterile and somehow empty although there are a few people standing around, but they are just copies doing nothing. There are no animals, no interesting props, no interesting architecture, no waving foliage, no sounds of wind, loud chatter etc.<br>- Most of the levels are extremely tubular: just one way, no possibility for exploration. If you use such level design, you should use it for thrilling script events like in COD to propell the storytelling, but that&apos;s not the case for DA2. A proper game world would have been to expensive...<br><br>Gameplay:<br>- 90% of gameplay consists of running and killing: go to place X, kill everyone, talk to person Y to have a reason for killing and then go to place Z and kill everyone. Most of the time there are no alternative ways to solve problems (the only exceptions are found in dialogues with companions). But hey: that&apos;s what&apos;s the world about, ain&apos;t  it?<br>- There are no possible interactions with the environment, just run, fight, talk, (rudimental) barter. No environmental riddles, no forging, no eating, no sleeping, etc. Would be to complex, eh?<br><br>Items and Inventory:<br>- Companions can&apos;t be equipped with armor, just with a weapon, a ring, a belt and an amulet. Would be to complex...<br>- In the inventory and shops items look absolutely uninteresting and the same: each type of item has the SAME grey and white icon, for example the same symbol for a sword. The only difference are the values of the item. To much effort giving them a distinguishable look?<br>- Most of the time the few items you can purchase outvalue the few items you find in your travels<br>- There are no real item sets or unique items<br>- Why does a plate armor take exactly the same space / weight in inventory (= 1 Slot) as a ring or an amulet (= 1 Slot)? Too much to think about?<br><br>Combat:<br>- Remember, you have to fight and fight and fight, and sometimes to fight, but don&apos;t worry: there isn&apos;t much to do, sit back and watch, no tactics needed (you could raise the difficulty but that just means opponents don&apos;t take as much damage and hit you harder).<br>- No overview allowed: forget Dragon Age Origins or Baldur&apos;s Gate, not immersive enough, has to be a close look over the should like Mass Effect 2 or say COD!? Another &quot;advantage&quot;: the game world seems to be larger than it is.<br>- In many fights there are up to four or five waves of the same opponents like in good old arcade gaming. That&apos;s a challenge RPG-players really like. - If a fight ends successfully health, mana and stamina of all your companions are restored instantly. No need for rest, healing etc.... Waste of time, there are more interesting fights waiting 10 yards ahead.<br>- Ammunition is for prigs: arrows and bolts are created the moment they are shoot, no buying needed.<br><br>Dramaturgy:<br>- The backgrounds and dialogues preceding and following missions are of high quality, BUT what about a larger conflict, to what end am I killing hordes of idiots? Is there any greater inner or outer threat than a killer whom the player seeks to kill? The Qunari are a threat, for twenty minutes of gameplay. Templar and Magicians don&apos;t like each other and there&apos;s a fight, but that&apos;s it. No threat and no thread. Calling Hawke &quot;Champion&quot; is an exaggeration to cover that he hasn&apos;t achieved much. The whole game is &quot;unepic&quot; and seems to be a chapter of an epic game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1541119">Expand</a></span>

No more strategic battle, no armors for companions in inventory, no crafting (NPCs make it for you), no dialogue skills like persuasion or intimidation (you can ask a companion to interfere in conversation, but it&apos;s an automatic succes). This game is a waste, and I&apos;m worried about Mass Effect 3.</span>

DA:O was supposedly the spiritual successor to Baldur&apos;s Gate and while it fell short of that lofty goal, it did manage to be a great step in the right direction and a great first entry for a new RPG franchise. A sequel merely needed to build upon that success by giving the fans more of the same with a new story to sink their teeth into. Sadly DA2 fails to do this. Many of the great features of the original have been removed. The origins choice and playthrough at the start where a race/class is chosen and it affects the character entirely, has been removed. Full dialogue options have been removed in favour of a simple good/bad/neutral choice. Combat has been made very simple and less tactical. The overhead camera has been removed.<br><br>It has the better graphics that we would expect from a sequel but the substance and the depth and richness that would have been needed to cement this is as a great RPG franchise have been forgotten in favour of flashier animations, extra voice acting and simpler gameplay to appeal to a mass market.<br><br>This is bad enough but the game was also rushed. The environments are recyled to a very noticeable extent that ruins immersion and the gameplay feels linear in comparison to better rpgs.<br><br>I do not know if it is possible in the modern gaming market to produce something with love and care like BG was but Bioware, if you are listening - please go back to your roots and make a TRUE baldur&apos;s gate successor! Or at the very least make sure that Dragon Age 3 is more like it&apos;s origins.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1525028">Expand</a></span>

For fans returning to the series be prepared for a shock because this is nothing like the Dragon Age Origins game you know and love.<br><br>There are quiet a few detrimental cutbacks that cripple the enjoyment of the game. The first is the storyline which is in three sequential acts and made up of many uninteresting sidequests, there is no longer any main goal or purpose to the story which paints Hawke as less of a hero and more of a skilled warrior that people dump their problems on .<br><br>The next flaw is that your adventure will most of the time will be spent in one city: Kirkwall. There is no spirit of adventure in Dragon Age 2 as you will see the same environments over and over again, which leads to the next point of the recycling of maps. I have never seen an rpg company worth its salt recycle maps to this extent, you will encounter the exact same maps with maybe a few doors locked or if in a cave a boulder in the way of some routes to change it up, but essentially it is the same map you saw maybe ten minutes ago. The next flaw is interaction, in Dragon Age 2 you no longer have the flexibility to say what you want as you had in Origins. You have three choices main choices most of the time which are peaceful, funny and aggressive, this leads to the same problems which were sometimes present in Mass Effect where you pick an option and your character says something you didn&apos;t want.<br><br>Another major flaw which really kills it for me is the lack of customisation, you have a few options to customise your character and you can change up his equipment, however party member clothes cannot be changed unless upgraded in a sequential and rigid fashion as well as having some equipment only a specific character can equip.  There are quite a few other flaws but I would be typing the list out all day. In summary this is a very disappointing sequel from Bioware, I wouldn&apos;t even expect this standard from some other rpg developers. If you&apos;re on the fence about buying Dragon Age 2 save your money there are so many better rpgs out there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1535604">Expand</a></span>

Play on Nightmare mode as a mage and then try to get through intro, try it just try it.  They&apos;ve nerfed healing to the point where its Fecking useless.  They put in a cool down on healing potions so can&apos;t use them when you need to use them now there is a shared timer.  The AI is horrible, you turn off tactics and your fecking tanks run out of cover to get hit by crossbowmen.<br><br>I truly hate Bioware now for this game.  The positive non game player reviews of this game is crap, they damn well aren&apos;t from fans.  If I have anything to tell Bioware it is this:<br><br>1st) Fix TACTICS, give a switch to turn it OFF or ON without having to individually turn off a tactic per player<br>2nd) When I don&apos;t give a character an order, they should damn well stay put and not rush into a fire of ranged fire<br>3rd) Give me the DLC that I paid for at the beginning of the game, don&apos;t make me run all over the place trying to find it<br>4th) Do actual play testing.  I am your market, you took a fan boy who buys all of your products and turned   him into someone who will NEVER PREORDER FROM BIOWARE AGAIN IN ONE GAME.  Did you actually have people play the intro and see what they thought<br>5th) Play test all of the difficulty levels ALL.  Nightmare should be beatable by someone who is highly familiar with Bioware and understand the basics, but OH F no, you guys couldn&apos;t do that could you.<br><br>You get a 0 from me on this game.  Read the reviews here from other posters and release a patch to fix the troubles or you are going to have an Elemental on your hands and destroy your Brand Name.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1518644">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>The game is a major disappointment compared to the original. Dragon Age I felt at least somewhat close to the Baldur&apos;s Gate it claimed to be the spiritual successor to. On the other hand, DA2 imitates Baldur&apos;s Gate: Dark Alliance, the ugly action RPG stepchild. Note: action RPGs suck when you have a party of four PCs with braindead AI. Just awful. I&apos;m done with Bioware.</span>

Unless you&apos;re on hard mode, there is nothing to discuss as far as combat goes, you may as well be watching a film.<br>For which matter, the story is far, far below Bioware&apos;s standards. Ploddingly written with a conversation wheel that not only dumbs down decisions to their smallest parts with &quot;GOOD BAD SILLY&quot;~esque replies, but are poorly written as they are. Voice acting is a nice touch, however, though it&apos;s frequently done without emotion. I&apos;d like to write more on the game, but after a mere few hours with it I honestly have no drive to play it any more. That didn&apos;t happen until Orzammar with DA:O.<br>Graphics are an utter trainwreck. I&apos;m not even going to go into this. Game outright bugs out, runs horribly or doesn&apos;t run at all, despite looking awful WITH an optional HD fix. Utterly pathetic showing on PC.<br>If you want the game, do not buy it now. Wait for a sale or a GOTY version with a reduced pricetag. Putting out a game that&apos;s blatantly this unfinished and rushed in a year that has many, many blockbuster titles that look stellar is quite frankly a ludicrious move, and Bioware have proven in the past that they are better than this tripe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1492205">Expand</a></span>

<br>Combat is a pseudo hack and slash RPG in betweener which just seems to be the worst of both worlds.
<br>
<br>The dialog system has been vastly reduced. In Dragon Age: Origins all the choices had significant effects on the game world and at times were very difficult to make depending on your morals and values which you wanted to instill or try and play out. In Dragon Age II its reduced to Generic Good, Generic Bad and la Troll answer (i.e. &quot;I want to Be a Dragon&quot; this is a real dialog option near the beginning of the game). There are even icons to signify if its good,  bad  and trolololol. Taking out any ounce of decision making on the player part apart from I want to be Good/Bad/Neutral.
<br>
<br>The story is ok, but there are heaps of unnecessary arbitrary quests scattered mostly constists of kill x gather y or variations of which had little to no impact on the overall story where as Dragon Age: Origins almost everything had impact.
<br>
<br>Graphics are acceptable. Characters are done quite well but everything else is blegh.
<br>
<br>Music is not done well, it fits but doesn&apos;t stand out.
<br>
<br>I don&apos;t recommend this game at all. Its simply shovelware. Play the original Dragon Age. It is a masterpiece. This sequel is not good enough at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1524693">Expand</a></span>

This game is a linear shooter, barely an RPG and only very distantly related to the first game, Dragon Age Origins, a very strong traditional CRPG.  It basically feels like a completely separate team was told to build a console shooter based in the Dragon Age universe.  At its core DA2 a very simple refined shooter:  1) you run from nondescript environment to the next, 2) spamming AOE attacks to deal with the same waves of enemies, and 3) running circles around tedious boss fights.  This is not however an RPG by any stretch:  1) the story is almost non-existent (I&apos;m in Act 2 and no clue), 2) there is no character development, 3) the skill trees are there, but given how streamlined combat is, there is no strategy involved, 4) only the main character inventory can be changed (other than weapons) limited.  In summary:  Overall:  4 (Gameplay:  5, Story:  3, Graphics/Sound: 6, Fun: 2).  Replay value:  0</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1541982">Expand</a></span>

This game has no strong points whatsoever. Graphics is bland, environment is the same everywhere, at first interior of some houses looks nice but it becomes tedious cos you run through the same looking rooms over and over again (~20 or so times, not kidding). Dialogues are dumb and options you chose rarely change outcome. Quests are the worst I have ever seen in a RPG. Even free to play MMORPGs have better quests than DA2. Battles are nice till you notice that mobs spawn like in some arcade game... You won&apos;t have to control your companions so tactics is pretty much gone. They had to stick with Hawke and ditch other 3 party members from the game entirely. Action game fans would have loved that even more! So yeah very bad game, Sadly It has way more weak points than I&apos;ve mentioned in this review...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1539528">Expand</a></span>

A rush job and not much more. How some supposed professional reviewers are giving this game scores in the 80s or 90s is beyond me. I spent several hours doing tedious quests in order to fund an expedition to get......some more money. I think. Whilst doing said quests I was interrupted on a far too regular basis by hordes of easily despatched nobodies whose time would have been better employed raging against whoever dared call this an RPG. My character, his mind numbed by such repetitive combat, was then bamboozled by  several  overpowering outbreaks of deja vu, before being seduced by a rather bizarrely rendered elf who had pipe cleaners where her arms should have been. My character shrugged all this off, after all he had free will didn&apos;t he? He didn&apos;t have to do this. But some guy and some woman kept telling him how his life was planned out from the start and what will be, will be. Somehow he made some friends and they wanted to come along for the ride for no particular reason at all (maybe they thought I would be able to get them out of Kirkwall or perhaps even get them some new armour - sorry about that). Let&apos;s plod on. Or maybe let&apos;s not eh? This game fails to deliver on many things. It&apos;s biggest fans will be people who aren&apos;t legally old enough to play it. That&apos;s your choice Bioware. Fair enough.

I am extremely disappointed in the final result.  I prefer to play the Infinity Engine RPGs and DA:O on the highest difficulties because of the challenge.  The combat mechanics really haven&apos;t changed that much from DA:O, but the nightmare difficulty in DA2 is flat out broken.  The encounters are the driest and most uncreative things I have experienced in an RPG in a long time.  *Every* fight ends up with the initial group of enemies plus two to four waves of additional NPCs that materialize from nowhere.  The fights become less an ability of tactics and more of an endurance battle where you are whittled down and praying that another wave of enemies isn&apos;t coming.  Another major problem is the lack of an isometric camera.  In the Infinity Engine games and DA:O, the camera was placed overhead which allowed easy command of your characters.  In DA2, you do not have access to such a feature and targeting becomes an arduous event.  It is apparent that this is a console game first and the PC version was merely an afterthought.  The storyline is also disappointing.  The game starts out in an unnamed mountain with characters we know nothing about and within fifteen minutes, something happens to a major NPC.  I am guessing that Bioware wants us to feel sympathy during the event, but there is no way to have any sort of connection with the characters because you do not know them.  The story is also supposed to take place during a ten year period, but there are jumps in time spanning several years and you never see any of the characters age, therefore you are left confused.  Sadly, Dragon Age 2 is a product of Bioware being bought by a corporate giant and being forced to rush out a game and appeal to a specific demographic.  The days of wonderful fantasy RPGs are long gone for this developer.  I am in greatly disappointed that the creators of the finest RPG of all time has fallen from grace in a mere decade.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1516001">Expand</a></span>

The previous game was a marvelous and a near-perfect take of what a next-gen RPG could be, probably not too great on the consoles, but its as true as an RPG gets on the PC. Fans of Origins have to lower their expectations or rather set it accordingly, because to be honest, it&apos;s just that different.<br><br>I don&apos;t really like to compare games to other games and franchise, but I do compare them when it comes to sequels, because the purpose of a sequel is to surpass the previous one, and in this case Dragon Age 2 fails to please. It just feels like a different, less impressive franchise. The improvements are only a little bit on the graphics, I really do enjoy the faster pace of the battle, and the span of 10 years the story takes. That said, the rest is just regression, as Bioware erased away the defining feature of the previous game such as; customizable party member&apos;s equipment, multiple races to play, multiple endings, unique builds that you can come up with (such as dual-wielding arcane mage and warrior with bow), varying areas, and that is not all, unfortunately. I give it an honest score of 4, as it is less than a half of what Origins were. To be noted that this is not a rant of rage, its just a lament of a dissatisfied loyal fan of RPGs and Bioware itself as a great video game studio.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1543771">Expand</a></span>

Striped down to nothing more than a casual action RPG.<br><br>For shame I say.</span>

While at first the faster game play while in a battle was refreshing by the end of the game each battle felt hollow, in comparison with Origins each battle requires much less thought or strategy and I would often find myself simply pressing the same combination of number keys at the start of a battle, using a health potion if needed then repeating the same actions until the game decides weather it would send an additional 8 enemies into the fray after the first group had been dispatched or allow me to continue a quest. The game seemed content to throw a large army at the player simply for walking along a path between quest points and to do so at every possible opportunity, one stretch of road I remember would have taken the players group a mire 30 seconds to traverse unopposed but instead it took the better part of 10 minutes because the group was set upon by a band of undead, short distance up the road another pack of undead would attack and after they had been dispatched a third group of miscellaneous rouges decided there number was being served. I expect a game to throw a large group at the player once in awhile but must a quest involving the retrieval of a herbal plant or an unimportant crystal require the attention of a horde large enough to sack a moderately size town Every Time? The enemies the game presented me with end up not acting the part of a band of rebels or thugs intent on kidnap or slaughter of innocents but as pebbles in the bottom of my shoe, striped of character in my mind by the sheer tedium of having to fight the same groups of 7 or 14 enemies every turn of the corner to finally reach a bag containing ultimately worthless and trivial items. Dragon Age 2 shares more in common with an MMORPG than it does it&apos;s predecessor in that you will be spending a large amount of time doing fetch quests like returning a lost piece of clothing or freeing some damsel in distress until you reach some arbitrarily decided point where the main plot is allowed to resume. Dragon Age 2 greatest weakness is in the way it treats the story, while Origins had a somewhat cliche but warm over arching storyline, giving vaguely defined goal that slowly solidifies as you make progress, Dragon Age 2 there was very little to grip my attention or engage my curiosity, the game leads the player forward by glimpses of coming glory told from a future vantage point where the actions the player had taken or had suffered were judged and debated for there merits and sucked all mystery and opportunity of total surprise out the window, you were constantly made aware of what you would become and the story completely skipped so many of the small but vital aspects of storytelling. For those of you that have played DA2 Demo, I felt that the Hawke responded in a cold and matter of fact way to your siblings death no matter which conversation option you pick, that there was lack of effort from some of the voice actors and that sense that the event lacks in gravity never left my mind through the game, Bioware seems to have forgotten how to create realist characters that actually give the impression of life, all the companions conform to one trait of there character at all times, for example one companion will join you as an outcast of their people due to their one core trait and at the end of the game and personal quest line they carry and react the same way they had upon first meeting the player, caring for their people but never says anything if in the course of their quest line you end up killing their people or not, they just feel like a cardboard cutout and unfortunately this is not isolated. As for the main plot itself, I went from one major plot to the next without feeling any real need to do the involved quests because it is hard to feel that my main characters attempt to save up the money to Buy A House (Act 1; Hawke attempts to get on the property ladder.) is worthwhile after running fetch quests for pennies nigh on 4 hours. To boot the ending to the game had me questioning weather or not my characters moral choices had anyway bearing whatsoever on anything at all, aside that it all lead up to what was in essence a promotion for Dragon Age 3. Before this game had I asked myself what was the worse Bioware game I had ever played, I would probably not answer that question very well, And unless Dragon Age 2 is the beginning of a downward spiral, I can answer that question without thinking. fans of Origins story and lore should stay well clear of this game, and to anyone one else I&apos;d say wait for a drop in the price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1507660">Expand</a></span>

True, I wasn&apos;t impressed with Mass Effect 2, but the changes in that game (stripped down inventory, character interaction, ammo, etc) still worked because Mass Effect was a new game and the changes felt right to what they were trying to create. Unfortunately, this same ideology does not apply to a game that is supposed to be primarily an RPG. Rpgs are a very hard creature to pin down. Somehanics then a lot of games become rpgs. More relevantly, according to Bioware, this includes  games such as Call of Duty and Assassin&apos;s Creed, which by the way, are not rpgs in any sense of the word and unfortunately were used as models for DA2.  My defense for this position is that you have no freedom in those games to create a character who is your own. The ending has been decided for you, who your character is has been decided for you, where they&apos;ve come from has been decided, and where they&apos;re going has been decided. An rpg must allow for freedom in the universe and DA2 fails horribly at that.<br><br>My biggest problem with DA2 without thinking about it as an rpg is that combat is terrible. Yes, they &quot;streamlined&quot; it and it moves faster. But you know what the sped up version of tactical combat is? It&apos;s hack and slash. And the game becomes a hack and slash not because of the way combat is mechanically implemented, but because each battle in DA2 begins with maybe 4 or 8 people appearing out of thin air, and then when you&apos;ve killed a certain number of them another 4 to 8 pop out of thin air. What this means is that there&apos;s no planning or positioning involved in combat as no matter what you do, there&apos;s just going to be more people popping up out of nowhere to deal with. Aggro doesn&apos;t work as well as it should, there&apos;s very little healing (and it all has huge 40-120 second cooldowns), and the best option for winning a fight is to spam aoe spells until everything is dead. The story isn&apos;t compelling. A huge part of the game is just you running around trying to get as much money as possible. This doesn&apos;t go away throughout any part of the game. In additon, the choices in the game aren&apos;t anywhere near as important as they were in any previous bioware titles. But the worst part about it is that there&apos;s no freedom to really choose. This an RPG, which means there must be a certain level of freedom. Well, when you&apos;ve decided who my character is and what they&apos;re doing and how the story ends (there&apos;s only one ending) I don&apos;t really have much choice.<br><br>This game is not an rpg. It is an action adventure game. If the Dragon Age series was supposed to be an adventure game this game would be better, but unfortunately it is supposed to be the spiritual successor to BG2. and the sequel to Dragon Age Origins (hence why there is a 2 after the title). The fact that it fails to be an rpg is heartbreaking and leaves you out in the cold asking, how did things get like this?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1510536">Expand</a></span>

This game actually pissed me off to the point that I&apos;m going to say something.  I am actually angry I paid 60 bucks for this game.  I have never complained about spending money on a game... even bad ones... ever.... and I bought NFL Head Coach!  Who thought it was a good idea to make a sequel to a game by REMOVING content from it?  Am I crazy?  The story is fine, and just like Mass effect 2, I will finish the thing and just chalk it up to an expensive day at the movies, which this has basically been.  I will not however play the game again.  Once I know what happens in DA2, I will go back to Origins and start a new game, or maybe dig Neverwinter Nights out of a closet.<br>A couple of bullets:<br>+ I am not an RPG purist.  The new talent trees is fine, I could care less about the DPS of a dual wield warrior vs Dual wield Rogue.  The new COMBAT however, is ridiculous.  Why does everyone turn to red jello?  Why do I feel like im fighting waves of Foot Soldiers from the Teenage Mutant Ninja turtles arcade game?  I thought the final battle of ME2 was stupid, but there isnt a single fight in this whole game that wasnt retarded.  Why are people repelling from the rooftops?  Why am I fighting random gangs of people every time I walk around at night?  Who are these people? why are they angry? Why do they insist on fighting me if they are all dead after two swings of the sword?<br>+Why is every environment I walk through identical to the last one?  I actually read a forum post where a Dev said they removed the overhead view to allow for more detailed environments... ALL THREE OF THEM!  WHAT A LOVELY WAREHOUSE! WHAT A LOVELY STREET! WHAT A LOVELY CAVE!  I swear to god, on my last run through the same exact cave in the mountain I swear I saw Hawk yawn.<br>+Why have three conversation options if they all have the same result?  Why talk at all? chances are the person im talking to will be red pudding after one hit with the boom stick.<br>+Why cant I choose my race? why cant I dress my team in the stuff I want?  Better Question, WHY AM I PICKING UP LOOT THAT NO ONE CAN USE?!?!  Just have everyone drop coin! why am I carrying junk?!!?<br>+These things wouldnt bother me if the game title didnt have a &quot;2&quot; at the end of it.  Why would you remove content from a game in the sequel?  Why would you limit the options and level of involvement in a game THAT HAD IT IN THE FIRST INSTALLMENT.  I heard the Dev&apos;s were streamlining the game because it sold well on consoles and they were appealing to that group.  Did the console people ask for less of a game?  Did anyone ever consider that the console people bought DAO because it had a lot of immersive elements that other games didnt have?  again<br><br>I PAID MORE MONEY FOR LESS GAME.  I would have posted this review on Biowares social site, but I dont want to have my accounts locked and game accounts voided for daring to criticize my betters.<br><br>the three points I gave this game are out of loyalty to the Bioware I once knew.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1519036">Expand</a></span>

The game manages to deliver a thoroughly mediocre and disappointing experience to both RPG and casual gaming fans alike.<br><br>The combat could possibly be the largest flaw with the game, however it is but one of many large flaws. Many skills and abilities present in DA: O which made the game an overly tactical, challenging and rewarding experience have been removed in favor of more &apos;exciting and fast paced&apos; combat. In Dragon Age 2&apos;s case &apos;exciting and fast paced&apos; equates into the mindless ability bashing. Combat now relies heavily upon &apos;wave&apos; mechanics. Where instead of individual mobs of enemies the player will be bombarded by wave after wave of enemy turning an epic skirmish into a tedious exercise of endurance. Most side quests are trivial and generic which furthermore offer no further insight into the game world and hold little other responsibility other than keeping the player distracted for a few extra hours collecting X number of items..<br><br>The visuals have undergone an upheaval, yet surprisingly manages to look worse than its predecessor.<br>The combat now resembles something out of a Devil May Cry game, rather than the style set in DA:O. The visceral and realistic style of Origins now replaced  with an over sensationalized gratuitous flood of warrior aerobatics and bloody explosions. Many Caves, mountains, roads used again and again presumably due to constraints imposed by the soulless suits over in EA pushing for a speedy release and a fast cash-in. Dragon Age: Origins was a modern day throwback to classic RPG games: It incorporated engaging Tactical gameplay ,  interesting characters and appropriate use of dialog selection and an immersive fantasy setting imbued with a touch of gritty realism to provide a satisfying fantasy experience. Because of this the game was critically acclaimed and sold very well.<br>Now let&#xE2;</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1521480">Expand</a></span>

Period. Normally I never write on public forums but the way DA series is being treated after such a great game like DA:O saddens me. Origins had it owns short comings but hey BIOWARE should have improved on them rather stripping Origins completely and making DA2 a hack &amp; slash game with few rpg elements.<br>Why I am disappointed, - Re-used maps, I mean same place over and over again ? what happened to exploration ? -Communication System - hello this is rpg right ? so why is the interaction with npc so restricted ? how do I build relationships with them or actually feel anything, right now I dont feel or give a damn if any of the the companions live or die<br>-Weapons,Crafting,Loot - You can not equip companions the way you want, damn restricted, the loot you get after killing seems meaningless ... Crafting .... well there isnt any !<br>- Voice Over : Some may like it , some may not but this Hawke is not me or atleast certainly not my warden. I dont feel connected with this guy<br>-Companions - well, the characters arent deep either, I mean really they are shallow, I feel like I am playing an action or adventure game not an RPG<br><br>Combat System : Well I must say it is more fluid and I liked it but they took it TOO FAR, this is not suppose to feel like HACK &amp; SLASH game. They have almost killed the tactical aspects of the battles, which I hate it. It is not a shooter with swords... come on ! The combat is a mixed bag, you like some you dont like some things. I will take it with a pinch of salt<br><br>Verdict --- If you loved DA:O for what it was with its shortcomings - then you will hate DA2</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1524282">Expand</a></span>

Graphics, well, I can&apos;t complain too much about it because my graphic card doesn&apos;t allow me to experience high or medium quality settings. Characters...there&apos;s only one worth mentioning and that is Varric because it seems they only finished him and that the others were in work by the time game was out. Main character is finally voiced and it doesn&apos;t seem so dumb like in Origins, but I expected more. I really wanted to like this game, especially because it is from Bioware. But call of money and greed from EA made this game the biggest flop this year. I will give it a 4, only because it gave me 35 hours of gameplay and because the main character isn&apos;t so dumb. I really hope this won&apos;t happen again, this rushing and placing a half-finished product on the market with Mass Effect 3.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1537535">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s like an interactive movie with some random things to do in between scenes.  There is no challenge at all.  Endless waves of cartoonish enemies that simply pop up out of nowhere.

That&apos;s not an opinion, the game released in a ridiculously short amount of time, and Bioware staff have commented on the rush (look for articles on Kotaku and elsewhere about this).  To put this in perspective though, a little bit about the first game:<br><br>Dragon Age: Origins was Bioware&apos;s atttempt to create a new fantasy IP which they could control.  Meant to be a spiritual successor to Baldur&apos;s Gate (a Forgotten Realms property, Dungeons and Dragons/alignments/classes/etc.), they stated upfront their desire to have a grittier, darker, and less fantastical fantasy.  They spoke influence by George R.R. Martin&apos;s series (A Song of Ice and Fire), and said they didn&apos;t want it to be the sort of the world where things can be explained away in a &quot;a wizard did it&quot; sort of fashion (avoid death not being permanent, have magic grounded as far as what it makes possible.. and relatively more rare).<br><br>The game they released was solid, and went on to be very popular.  Bioware has typically been known for strong stories, and the tale in DA:O succeeded greatly on a few levels.  The titular origins allowed players to start their PC among any of three races, with a possible three different classes.  The origins stories were all different, and served to personalize the world for the player - tell what being a &quot;city elf&quot; or a &quot;dwarven noble&quot; is about.  The story itself was reasonably flexible about where and what order you did things, with every area having at least one major choice that would have &quot;some&quot; impact on later events. The characters were both well-voiced and written.<br><br>The game was iffy in some aspects too.  The origin stories, while fantastic, often were poorly followed-up on in the remaining story.  For instance, a betrayal of your family might amount to little when you return home later, making being &quot;blase&quot; your only &quot;choice&quot; about something like... murder, when the game regularly lets you kill people for very petty reasons. In the end, they just weren&apos;t as integrated as they could&apos;ve been.  The combat attempted to replicate the feel of commanding multiple units in a similar fashion to Baldur&apos;s Gate on the PC, however this wasn&apos;t practical for non PC players.  So, the combat on consoles wound up more bastardized with awkward bits like repeated pathing errors and a seemingly slow pace for something that had an &quot;action-type&quot; camera.  It was a still a good game, the dark atmosphere was well-done, and the world was realized.<br><br>DA:2 would ideally have fixed and expanded on the first game (isn&apos;t that what we all hope for in a sequel?). Indeed, there seems to have been attempt to rectify the combat, but the result was not to make it more tactical or responsive - rather, they attempted to speed things up and make it more Action RPG, more &quot;extreme&quot;.  Difficulty in the 2nd title seems to be more about throwing massive numbers of troops at you, rather than better scripted encounters (ergo: rushed in both planning and balancing).  The pathing frustration is removed, but the resulting combat is mindless and dull.<br><br>The earlier complexity of the origins has been dropped altogether, the player is given exactly one &quot;origin&quot;: you will always be a human member of a specific family; with your class playing little role in your background.  To be clear, they went from 6 possible starting stories to 1. You can change your gender and class.<br><br>Aside from the origins, the world and story are just generally more shallow and less-developed.  The darker more detailed graphics of the first title have been traded for a more cartoonish style this time around, which gels poorly with the gritty world they attempt to convey.  The Darkspawn (a series bogeyman) manage to look LESS menacing, dropping pointed teeth for flat ones, and getting a more even skintone.  The story-telling is more trite and less-engaging. The magic and abilities have been made more ridiculous and over the top; a far cry from the &quot;realism&quot; that was seemingly championed in the first title.  The ability to customize your companions has been dramatically restricted.  You no longer outfit them.  They removed the ability to talk to your companions at any time, inquiring about their past.. it only happens at set points now. You revisit the same areas over and over again, with the same map even.  The maps wind up being pointless as what is currently the &quot;visitable&quot; area in the &quot;new&quot; area is never marked off.. you always see the same map.  Your character simply lacks the agency they seemed to in previous game.  In opting for a voiced Main Character, they seemed to have restricted your conversation options, relatively.<br><br>This game isn&apos;t the worst game ever, but it&apos;s horribly shoddy for a huge budget studio known for great RPGs.  It&apos;s a slap in the face to the lore and world created the first time as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1515514">Expand</a></span>

While you get to explore a whole country, with lots of different scenarios, and do all sorts of different missions on the first game, here you will only visit half a dozen places and only do missions that feel like side quests. There are 2 things that I thought were improvements, the main character with a voice is one, and the new combat system, but the combat itself wasn&apos;t very well explored. It is too predictable, and there is no variation with the enemies.  The main plot is very week, it gets interesting in the last 2-3 hours of the game, .. but the rest is simply there to fill some space (so about 30 hours of filling) The developers obviously rushed this project, and the game just looks like it was made by lazy people. Rings that are just called &quot;ring&quot; but with different specs, &quot;belt&quot;, etc.<br><br>overall the experience isn&apos;t terribly bad, but it&apos;s not up to DA:O standards and not up to bioware&apos;s reputation.... I find it hard to believe that bioware thought this was a good game to release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1538439">Expand</a></span>

I thought Dragon Age: Origins came close enough to being its spiritual successor as advertised, and I enjoyed that game for what it was, but Dragon Age 2 is as far from being a successor to the  Baldur&apos;s Gate series as possible. It was just painful to play for so many reasons. Graphically, they somehow managed to make it appear even worse than its predecessor (not saying DA:O was bad graphically, but it certainly was groundbreaking in that aspect). The combat is now a mindless button masher, obviously tailored to please console players, because it ends up just being frustrating on the PC, only aggravated by the clunky camera. The formulaic dialogue and the cliche story are so inept in this one that it makes me want to stab furniture. Apparently BioWare were just looking for a quick cash-in. I&apos;m definitely not buying Dragon Age 3 when it comes out (and it will, because their greediness knows no bounds).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1506933">Expand</a></span>

There is no depth in deploying tactics, hell, tactics?  What are those?  The game has been made significantly easier (from an already easy franchise) so to cater to the lowest common denominator.

Locations are absolutely dead - a labyrinths with couple of boxes containing trash and some useless neutral npc&apos;s. Additional quests are awful - &apos;go there, kill somebody, come back&apos;, repeat couple of hundred times or until uninstall the game. Battles become schizophrenic because of respawn - killing last enemy from previous wave - a new wave appears just from air. There&apos;s also still a lot of bugs. This game is the biggest disappointment of the year. Possible target audiens - kids 8-12 years old for not to overstrain their fragile brains.<br>I&apos;ve bought DAO, but i already regret a lot of times about downloading this cracked &quot;game&quot; from torrents.

Gaming should be about options. If you wanted to make a game that was more &quot;Accessible&quot; that is fine, create toggle switches. Let those of us who actually enjoy the details have them, let people who don&apos;t want to worry about it turn those options off. Seriously this feels like a step backward in so many areas it is hugely disappointing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1513894">Expand</a></span>

The main quest is short, devoid of story and back-story, and to make matters worse I suddenly am having intercourse with two females at the same time. I don&apos;t even know them; I don&apos;t even remember hitting on them.<br>The combat is ridiculously easy, even on Nightmare difficulty. Bosses can be kited (as in, you can run around in circles over and over again and they will never catch you) as your friends continually shoot them, essentially making every boss nonexistent. For combat, all you have to do is rack up as much damage output as physically possible and nuke EVERYTHING. And by everything, I mean waves and waves of random people who are attacking me for reason unknown. I&apos;ll just be running a little errand for some guy in exchange for money, and SUDDENLY 50 people will charge out of nowhere to prevent me from delivering an old man his medicine (I made up that scenario as to prevent spoilers).<br>I am not usually one to care about graphics (especially considering I still play 8-bit games), but in all seriousness this game makes me feel like I am playing on a Nintendo 64. And that&apos;s not saying the N64 was bad, it&apos;s just very old. Every character seems to be colored in a poorly textured splash of blood at all times, and it&apos;s just not realistic. Speaking of realism, every character seems to have 100 pound swords that they swing around like baseball bats, which seems a little lame. I&apos;m going to stop here; as I write I am continually lowering the score I am giving this game, and so I should stop before it gets down to 1 for the sake of Bioware.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1506995">Expand</a></span>

Tactical camera is missing, enemies respawn in waves making player positioning essentially worthless for most fights, dungeon maps are recycled, player companions can not equip any armor you find which makes acquiring new gear mostly a case of selling gear to vendors, the non combat trade skills have been removed (granted many were pointless but I would have preferred something different rather than complete removal), the Mass Effect style dialogue wheel is stupid, forcing the player into one role takes away quite a bit from the experience of the first, higher difficulty settings result in a kite fest rather than actual strategy, DLC content marketed AT LAUNCH and extra items given out for crap like &quot;LIKING DRAGON AGE IN FACEBOOK&quot; which makes a pirated copy of this game more convenient than just buying that game on STEAM since you won&apos;t have to jump through hoops to get the extras you want. I&apos;m not sure if I could have been any more disappointed by this game.  Terrible! I was hoping for another game similar to Baldur&apos;s Gate and I ended up with what feels like a crappy console port.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1501906">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s falsely-advertised and very dumbed down in order to appeal to a younger audience.<br><br>There&apos;s little good to be said. And there&apos;s a lot of bad things to known. Sadly, truth hurts.<br><br>The most noticeable change lies in combat. It&apos;s faster, grittier, more responsive and... not very tactical. I kept using the very same tactic throughout the game the whole. &apos;Cause it was the fastest way to slay my foes. It involved having one melee unit (in this case a warrior specialized in two-handed combat) and 3 ranged units (one, preferably a healer). It&apos;s simple. I would let the A.I. control the warrior, he jumped into the fray and did whatever he wanted - Gathering the attention of my enemies. At the same time I would have all my 3 units selected at all times. And order to them to focus fire on the same target and when it dies, move onto the next target. Most often combat lasted less than a minute using this method - It was very dull.<br><br>But what about the story? I can tell you it&apos;s great, though disappointing. It&apos;s a lot like the one in Mass Effect 2. Dragon Age 2 lacks a real [visible] plot. Instead you&apos;ll follow Hawke and company for years in the city of Kirkwall. While playing, it will feel like a giant side quest, that contains side quests. It&apos;s not too bad, as there&apos;s a lot of good moments in the game, some that comes completely unexpected, depending on your relationship to your companions. The ending is however very disappointing and makes the game seem like a pro-logue.<br><br>The visuals are mostly dull. There&apos;s very little to be seen and the animation is stiff and awkward, which is strange seeing how we&apos;ve had, and it still is, outstanding animation in games that was released in the early 2000s. And there&apos;s a total of 3-4 dungeons in the game that you will be visiting, over and over and over again (in side quests). AND THE BLOOD IS STILL AWKWARDLY APPLIED TO YOUR CHARACTERS FACES.<br><br>To summarize the whole game. It traded in the strategic and tactical thinking that Dragon Age: Origins had for a hack&apos;n KITE and some slash game. Story is hidden and it will feel like a side quest, but you&apos;ll go &quot;ah&quot; when it&apos;s all revealed and probably disappointed. The interactions between you and your companions are better than ever. But even that won&apos;t save the game from it&apos;s flaws.<br><br>5/10. Bioware made the same mistakes in Mass Effect 2. Which you&apos;d think they learned anything from. But it couldn&apos;t be further from truth. They are forsaking the RPG players tactical play, characters customization and much more in order to appeal to none-RPG players.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-ii/user-reviews?user_review_id=1505422">Expand</a></span>
