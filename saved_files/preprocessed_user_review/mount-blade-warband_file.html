The answer to that are your personal preferences, since there are a lot of great things in the game, but also things that will anger you till you tilt, especially because you will - at that point - know that the game has a huge potential which seems to be not used. The PROs include The best fighting system there is. You are in control of your attacks and blocks, the direction, the timing, the distance and the speed. The fights are intense.<br>Amazing battles sizes not only in the singleplayer, but also on the multiplayer. No not only 64 as falsely proclaimed in many reviews, there are servers that offer room for up to 222 players. The Singleplayer mode is in Vanilla limited to 150, but by using the MBW Battle Resizer the only limitation is your hardware. I play with a battle size of 700.<br>The SP world. Kingdoms rise and fall with or without your doing. This war-torn country of Calradia does not need a player to function :-D.<br>The multiplayer. You will hate it for crushing you (I have no clue how so many people can be so good). You will love it for the excitement, the rush of adrenaline when being faced by a group of enemies, the joy of making a kill - finally, and the tactical thinking.<br>A great community. It is a must for anybody buying this game, to use the forum. Otherwise you will never get the full potential out of this game. The Mods are the true jewels here. More on that later.<br>The developers put a lot of effort into fixing bugs and improving the game. Since the release in March there have been 6(!) official patches i know of, that fixed bugs, rebalanced weapons, added new game features, etc. . The game was playable from the beginning, it just got better.<br><br>The CONs<br>The singleplayer lacks a tutorial. The game is very complex and especially the character creation is too complex for newbies. Later on you will be happy for the amount of choices tho. A mission to start off with was added, which helps a little on getting into the game.<br>No big questline. You can roleplay the squat out of this game, but you will have to create your story yourself.<br>At some point the game becomes repetative. Its after getting started, gaining power and before starting your own kingdom. Overall the Vanilla Singleplayer is missing something to keep it interesting.<br>Sieges are the biggest flaw in Vanilla SP. The AI sucks here and the possible choices - really opposing the general game theme - are basically nonexistent. It is a pity that the multiplayer siege options werent implemented into the SP.<br><br>The conclusion:<br><br>The Vanilla game has highs and lows. 30 Bucks is acceptable for it, but its not a great deal.<br><br>HOWEVER Mount and Blade: Warband is a long term investment. This is due to the huge modding community of the game (Forum!). You dont like the graphics? Get Polished Landscapes. You dont like the Battlesize? Get a Resizer. You dont like time period? Download a total conversion, which plays in the Renaissance or WW2. There are even mods solely dedicated to the Multiplayer. F.E. You dont like to always have to choose from the same troops and equipment? You want to customize your character? You want to change your skills? Get the CRPG mod and play it on their servers, which hold up to 120 spots for players. This ever growing amount of mods add amazing things to the Multiplayer and the Singleplayer and thats why the game is in my opinion worth the buy. You will get not only 1 game, but you will get a growing number of games. Therefore a tip of my hat to Taleworlds and their modding community.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=1380683">Expand</a></span>

In the Kingdom of Calradia there is 6 factions, each representing an area of the Medieval world (Italians, Arabs, etc) .You start as a individual with a backstory decided by you and a character who&apos;s stats and looks(to the nose and eyebrow size) are decided by you. Beginning as the leader of a small warrior band, your military grows in size as you seize control of towns and castles and train your peasant recruits into elite warriors that can tear through enemies like medieval tanks. Eventually you will be able to conquer Caldaria alongside your Noble King or start your own Kingdom and conquer the land yourself. Little touches like interactive companions with very interesting backstories and have complex relationships with your other companions increases the feel of immersion. The Multi-player is simply epic, especially with the Napoleonic DLC. The game has developed a community of &quot;regiments&quot; that partake in historical linebattles. These linebattles are heavily strategic and exciting as you are always given a single life. Melee combat is simple to learn but hard to master. You direct your weapon to body parts with the mouse and block with the mouse. Engagements are exciting and there is a huge variety of modes, from large battles, duels to even great sieges. The game&apos;s servers have high player limits, 64-200 leading to epic battles. A gem and considering the price, a MUST HAVE.   The game&apos;s modding community is incredibly powerful allowing for an endless stream of new content.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=2335422">Expand</a></span>

The unmodded single player is one of the most addictive and rewarding experiences I&apos;ve yet encountered in any video game. the multiplayer however is worthless... that is without the right mods (all mod content is free in case you were wondering) CRPG is the current mod of choice to turn this game&apos;s lack luster multiplayer into a something comparable to a medieval call of duty. Custom classes and equipment etc. Now what you should know are the most impressive points of this game:
<br>A blend of RPG and strategy that fill both roles flawlessly. Something that many games have tried and nearly always failed.
<br>
<br>Exelent customization options for your character and troops. RPG style skils to aid you in combat or support your army, somewhat comparable to an elder scrolls game. Additionally each soldier in your army levels up and is upgraded to whatever you choose for the soldier to be. Lead a small force of elite knights and prevail using superior quality of soldiers. Or Recruit dozens of conscripts and send them in droves to swarm and overwhelm your opposing force. Or completely fill out a balanced army of archers, cavalry and a core of infantry to co-ordinate and out maneuver your opposing force.
<br>
<br>thirdly probably one of the features that this game has that so many other games fail to deliver is the unlimited style of game play. You don&apos;t have to choose between swarms of cheap units or a few quality warriors. You can have your cake and eat it too. work hard enough and upgrade those conscripts to swarms of highly trained knights or hundreds of elite heavy infantry loaded to the teeth with heavy weapons and armor. There is no limit to how many soldiers you can control and upgrade so long as you manage them appropriately. Also no level cap (though it will become exceedingly difficult to level up somewhere near level 32) you can specialize in tactics and troop support skills, focus all your stats to mastering combat with the weapon in your own hand, or find a niche to split your skills with your companions (hero units) and be both that combat master and a perfect commander. The only limit is the soldiers that appear in individual battles at one time, but this is easily removed with the right mods.
<br>
<br>and lastly just to top it off the controls re astoundingly innovative. Though to be fair it takes some adjustment, the controls can be awkward at first and somewhat complicated, but the steep learning curve is over shadowed by complete control of your character. With only a bit of practice the controls become familiar and user friendly. I haven&apos;t played any other game that lets you have so much immersion in combat than warband. Not even elder scrolls can come close to the combat system.
<br>
<br>though there is a few thing this game fails to use such great potential for:
<br>
<br>Yes the sieges are somewhat bland. Though just as action packed and exiting as feild battles, your soldiers will merely be headbutting in a continuous clash with the other army. More of a tug of war without any strategy to use.
<br>
<br>Also with some work-arounds this game could have impalement a co-op to the single player that could be outstanding. There are mods to allow multiplayer co-op but cannot incorporate the strategic map.
<br>
<br>The graphics are modest at best. A bit dated look the textures and models are well done but falling short of most modern standards. However the graphic quality is good enough to merely leave room for improvement, but do not present a major drawback.
<br>
<br>If you are crazy about story lines and ingame lore, this game lacks much of a story. Don&apos;t misinterpret, the setting is spot on perfect and the world around you is very well in theme. There is no story line past the tutorial. The reason; to allow freedom for the player to manipulate and create the story as he or she goes,but don&apos;t expect to be on the edge of your seat for what happens next.
<br>
<br>This game will be challenging at the beginning, regardless of personal skill of the game. When you are beginning you will face a harsh, unforgiving world before you finally can dominate even the weakest of opponents. I give this game a score of ten, and for a valid reason. This is a damn good game. Period. The drawbacks are overshadowed by the positives. I seldom speak this highly for anything less than an immaculate shining gem of a game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=2639857">Expand</a></span>

The game scales great from you having nothing but a sword and your horse to you controlling an entire army of a hundred men or more. Especially if they are all cavalry to charge the enemy down.. I spend many hours on this game, trying different methods, armies, factions and character developement. You can do so many different things and it is amazing how such a small team of developers can create something so wast and full of entertainment. The only really bad thing about the game is the sieges, where the AI is somewhat stupid and you can have a hard time to get into a castle (as the only way is over the wall by a ladder or two. But it is not that big of a deal and you should really try it out! Remember to set settings on realistic, as it gives the best experience in my opinion.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=1942479">Expand</a></span>

<br>80 hours in and still havent played the single player yet...lol
<br>
<br>Try the crpg mod for multiplayer.....it effectively turns it into an mmo rpg.
<br>
<br>BUY THIS GAME!!</span>

<br>Mount &amp; Blade offers a different way to play a real-time-strategy game. The graphics are above average, the soundtracks are fit to the themes and the mechanics are well-thought out. Instead of sitting back and watching your troops in a battle, you can immerse in the fight yourself, which is a mechanic rarely seen in an RTS game. This game focuses more on skill than equipment, and it actually takes precision to use a bow effectively. A good game which is perfect for people that love medieval warfare, and always wished to be that master bowman!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=2528045">Expand</a></span>

This game uses mouse movement to control your players&apos; attacks and defenses (unless otherwise toggled), unlike any other game in this genre (with the exception of the War Of Roses). The singleplayer and the multiplayer are two different experiences using the same combat system. Singleplayer is the more complete RPG exerience, with customizable armies, companions, nations, entirely open map, and an unforgiving, uncaring world. (Quite realistic.) Multiplayer is mostly combat, with the exception of a customizable avatar and what you bring into combat (essentially your loadout). This game almost reaches it&apos;s full potential if you&apos;re willing to modify it (singleplayer, anyways).
<br>
<br>PROS: Extensive RPG experience, Original combat system, Singleplayer/Multiplayer, Large  &amp; active playerbase, realistic, Globally played, Difficulty is easily adjusted, Entirely Open Word, Decent price, Almost 2 games in 1.
<br>
<br>CONS: O.K. graphics (This isn&apos;t Skyrim, folks), Tendancy to house Bugs, Glitches, and other Parasites, , Difficult to learn, Addictive ; )
<br>
<br>In CONCLUSION, this game is worth picking up if you&apos;re a true RPG/Fighting fan.
<br>On Steam you can grab the entire series for $8-$15.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=2875641">Expand</a></span>

Nonetheless, Warband will make you spend tens of hours playing.</span>

Not only is dose this expansion take a certain prowess to play its that &apos;certain&apos; prowess that also makes the game absolutely hysterical. for example: stalking an enemy fifer away from the heat of battle into possibly the most remote section of the map only to find that the first two notes into his patriotic whistling was met blissfully  with the sound of my sword cutting through his poorly animated torso and the end of yet another enemy fifer.. (on till of course he re spawns in which case ill have to go searching for him again) or to join the bobbing session in the band of your alley bobbing frantically to the sound of the bag pipes on top of the fort we are so posed to be protecting.. only to be met with a thundering artillery attack obliterating the sound of our fortuitous quest to kick the arss of every french man in the enemy ranks thus splaying our corpses into a perfect star shape on the top of our crumbling fort and the end of yet another broken band..    there are endless moments of hilarity in this game and is undeniably a grate laugh.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=2533802">Expand</a></span>

This game runs great on any pc, has a sufficient open world campaign, and has an extremely fun multiplayer that requires skill. The graphics are decent, but the price is great. This game is a must buy for the genre.</span>

For only ten dollars, it has provided me with hours of entertainment in what has otherwise amounted to a decade of vapid, funless, press-X-to-win video games created by soul-sucking mega-corporations. There is greatness hidden here, and I am looking forward to the sequel immensely.</span>

(Wish there was co-op but still doesn&apos;t take away from its overall glory)  Near best single player i&apos;ve ever had the experience to play so many amazing mods that you can never claim you don&apos;t get your moneys worth.  Epic battles with over 200 players in them and the single player with mods has practically unlimited size if you can get 700 troops together then with the help of an easy to install mod you can have the most epic battle i&apos;ve ever seen.  The graphics may not be the best but this game but intuitive gameplay proves that graphics don&apos;t make a game the character customization isn&apos;t the best but there&apos;s certainly some variety although messing with most of the advanced options will create some pretty hideous sights.  The story is one of the best parts for me theres no script its what you make they release you in this great world and then its up to you to make it it very organically creates a story from events you make happen or participate in whether or not you roleplaying.  This game is must a buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=3284957">Expand</a></span>

I had a vague idea of what it was about but I had never played the orginal. Within a week I had racked up hours on end of gameplay. It is quite unique and I absolutely loved how FPS battles have been combined with tactical, RPG and strategy elements. Sure theres a few edges that can be smoothed out, but for the price its a no-brainer. I would love to see some of the bigger developers (notably Bethesda) try something along these lines. Also the dozens of really cool mods out there really add to the longevity and scope of this game.

The vanilla single-player, while lacking a tad, is amazing and quite unique. Becoming a Lord is no easy task and takes time, with becoming a respectable king/queen even longer. The multiplayer is an entirely different experience. The skill curve is higher than most games, and it takes quite some time to become like the pros. There are tons of mods, and the developers encourage modding their game which is something every developer should do for their PC launches. Graphics are &apos;outdated&apos; but authentic and believable. Sounds are good. After playing several mods I wish the developers added more diplomatic features or more variety in terms of troop trees and locations. It&apos;s a great game, and is well worth more than the selling price. I cannot wait for Mount and Blade 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=2787861">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The multiplayer is well balanced and the buying of equipment is an interesting way of dealing out weapons and armor. The multiplayer modes are very simple as you have your DM and TDM but all the real fun is in siege mode where one team defends while the other teams attacks, this is amazing due to fact you can have up to 100+ players. If you get bored of the singleplayer and multiplayer the fun goes on because Mount and Blade Warband is open to mods and there are thousands of high quality multiplayer and singleplayer mod.
<br>
<br>The graphics are not amazing but there are some serious optimization options in this game meaning alot of people are able to run it without problems.
<br>
<br>If you love open world RPGs and med-evil combat games your gonna really want to play this!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=3234415">Expand</a></span>

I will not spend time spoiling the amazing game play for you, just buy this game if you feel like an amazing middle evil experience. please help me to fill up the server list on the great 200 player multiplayer.</span>

If you have played the Total War games and always wanted to get in the mix in 1st/3rd person, then this is the game. 200 player maps and realistic medieval combat.  I only reason I gave it &quot;only&quot; and 8 is because the graphics could be better, but they are not that bad for it&apos;s age.</span>

I played it for about 50 hours without mods before finally giving in to see what it would be like with them... and wow I&apos;ve already spent close to 200 hours in this game (and I&apos;ve yet to conquer all of Calradia haha, and in my defense, it&apos;s harder than it first seems). So much variety in what to do and with what happens based on what you do. Also a good amount of units, tactics, and equipment.
<br>
<br>I honestly am not a big fan of the fighting aspect because its rather rough and could use more polish and fluidity in my opinion. Again, mods help improve this aspect of the game along with most other gripes I originally had (such as more variety in towns/taverns/castles maps since in vanilla they&apos;re mostly carbon-copies of one another)
<br>
<br>Without mods this would be a 9/10 for me, but with mods it&apos;s definitely 10/10.
<br>
<br>Literally a choose-your-own destiny type of game that gives you the freedom to do whatever the hell you want.

<br>First of if you need good graphics to enjoy a game your wasting your time here, tbh the graphics are poor.
<br>If you look past this however theres an addictive game with brilliant combat mechanic&apos;s and decent multiplayer.
<br>
<br>However what really makes this game is the mods, there 100s of different conversion mods which keep gameplay fresh and exciting.</span>

<br>
<br>Just check the /played time on steam reviews. There isn&apos;t another game in the catalog that CLOSE to compares with how devoted players are to this game.
<br>
<br>TLDR: If you&apos;re a hopelessly mainstream gamer with a short attention span - don&apos;t bother. If you tend to enjoy games that take effort and learning and reward that effort, you&apos;ll love this.
<br>
<br>Suggestion: Once you&apos;ve played the vanilla game, play some mods.  My personal favorite is Prophecy of Pendor.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=3941206">Expand</a></span>

Aside from a small quest line at the beginning of the game that can be finished in fifteen minutes, there is almost no story whatsoever, unless you count the odd jobs you get from the lords, ladies, occasionally kings, and if you a relatively decent person who cares about honor, the odd villager. Quests in M&amp;B Warband basically boil down to fetch quests, bounties, sabotage (including the freeing of lords from prisons)  and the odd mercenary contract. If that is completely unacceptable and are currently sending me spam for enjoying M&amp;M, then you might as well close this review now. plain and simple, M&amp;B Warband IS NOT STORY BASED, AT ALL. Aside from the odd bits of lore that you might pick up, virtually everyone in the world, excluding companions, has absolutely no back story whatsoever, unless your willing to look the lore outside the game. Even the companions, which are basically a NPC characters you can equip and level up, have a few pages of text for back story, and most of them have something to say if you take them to the right place on the map, but aside from that, there&apos;s not much to know about them. The Graphics are mundane at best and out right ugly at worst, this is not a game for you to admire grand views, its more of a game where you shrug, and occasionally wince when a character attempts a smile. Also, certain troop types are a little to clearly meant to counter one another, for example; The Rhodok Sargent, a heavy infantry unit, will trump any kind of cavalry if used correctly, where as the Nord Huscarl, will mop the floor TWICE, with absolutely anything that isn&apos;t a horse archer. Also, while the game gives you many options for a play style, and most of them work,(you can even be a merchant if you want) some are clearly more useful than others. For example, every faction in the game has, if not decent archers, than certainly guys with throwing weapons, that do massive damage if you don&apos;t a shield. As such, two-handed weapons (with the exception of the bastard sword) and polarms, are almost completely useless, unless you want to be a living pin-cushion. Now, that&apos;s all the bad things about M&amp;B Warband, and, if your willing to forgive them, you will see why they really don&apos;t matter much. If Minecraft is the closest thing possible to a pure sandbox game, than M&amp;B Warband is the closest thing possible to a medieval RPG, sandbox game. Plain and simple, you can do whatever you want. Sick of annoying bandits wandering around the map? Make it your goal to slaughter them all. Want to harass peasants and their livestock? Raid villages and steal from travelers. Want to become a the head of a fame mercenary company? Get a contract from one of the many squabbling kingdoms, and grab your sword and shield. Want to take over the world? You can do that too. Plain and simple, consequences for your actions aside, their isn&apos;t much, you can&apos;t do within the world of Caldria. &quot;Build you army, call your allies, and make your make your mark on the world&quot; barely cuts it with M&amp;B Warband. You could spend hundreds of hours on this game&apos;s single player alone! And that&apos;s not even talking about multiplayer. M&amp;B Warband, has multiple game modes for multiplayer, including, deathmatch, TDM, a last team standing type game mode, siege, and dual. And that&apos;s just in the main game. The modding community has been busy with this game, that is for certain. There are HUNDREDS of modifications to this game, and all are easy to get working, M&amp;B Warband, actually has a modifications folder, that allows you to download new &quot;modules&quot; which are basically different games running on the M&amp;B Warband engine. There are things I wish were better, sure. I have met rocks more intelligent than then the AI in this game, not that it really matters all that much, as the most complicated thing you are likely to do is a makeshift shield wall, and the sound track is repetitive, but shear content makes up for it by a mile and half. With a huge amount of content,  a good combat system, large fan base, modding support, and hundreds of modifications to try out? You will be playing M&amp;B Warband for years to come. And for twenty dollars, thirty if you buy the DLC, this game has conceivably  has more value for money than all the Elder Scrolls games combined. Now that&apos;s something to brag about. If you are willing to get past its flaws, and intend to download mods, the only reason you should get his game, is if you don&apos;t have a computer that can run it. And if you don&apos;t steal one from you nearest store, and get this game NOW.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=3513784">Expand</a></span>

<br>&#x2022;RPG System - As you fight, complete quests you earn experience which helps you to wear new armor, weapons, horses, allows you to lead bigger army and MANY other advantages.
<br>&#x2022;Battles - The fighting system and horse riding is incredibly fun and awesome. It&apos;s very realistic so it mostly depends on your skill. You can even defeat many enemies self if you are skilled enough.
<br>&#x2022;Factions - You may help one faction to earn respect, improve your relationships (which is very important) or help other factions as well, fight against enemy lords, help villagers, get married etc. Later you can also create own faction and possibly conquer other factions and the whole Calradia!
<br>
<br>Problem is, the game is easy to learn, OK, but very Very VEry VERy VERY HARD to master.
<br>
<br>9/10 - Warning! Game might ruin your life.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=4333507">Expand</a></span>

Personally, i loved it, this is my definition of a free roam RPG. But it is not only an RPG, it feels like a strategy game also. There are so many elements to the game its rediculous, this is what makes the game fun. HOWEVER, i have encountered numerous bugs in the game, the quests can be really annoying, and there are pretty bad consequences for losing a battle. Also, the graphics aren&apos;t the best, and the game seems a little.. stale, that is where imagination comes in however, unlike other games such as Dragon Age: Origins, you do not follow a guided storyline, you kindof make your own, and that is what i really like about the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=1700132">Expand</a></span>

Set in a redrawn map of the European continent you can deposed monarchs and become a king yourself.  Graphically the game is built on a robust engine, that is fairly bare boned, this is deliberate as the designers, TaleWorlds, are an inhouse team.  This means mods can add very impressive levels of detail but combined with the potential of the default engine (400 corpses and their equipment littering the field of battle)  can crash even the mightiest of PC&apos;s.  Default game graphics are good enough and can be quite captivating although the battlefields are a little sparse of foliage at times.  It is not a pretty game but it can have flashes of wonder.  The type of gamer who will play M&amp;B:W wont care that much though about graphics.  The gameplay consists of primarily first person wandering around towns and villages speaking to the guild masters, lords, and village elders about fairly traditional fetch, escort quests with some nice rescue, pay the ransom and capture the spy missions.  These tasks improve your favour allowing you to recruit troops in greater number, trade in towns at a discount or in the later game sway lords to your military or political needs.<br><br>Starting with a rag tag band of peasants you slowly grow into a capable army.  With troops becoming more experienced and levelling they go from a peasant to a footman to man at arms &amp; finally knights with the power and durability on the battlefield that entails.  As your troops grow so do you.  A fairly decent RPG system allows you to develop as a warrior, statesman or trader.  Even as a surgeon, allowing some of your troops to survive despite their KIA status at the end of battles.  The level component of the engine does not restrict your actions in the game.  You dont have to be level 12 to use that sword or any other artificial constraint  but you do have to have hefty skills to use bows &amp; thrown weapons.  Charming your chosen wife into marrying you requires Persuasion as does convincing her father to side with you in the civil war your about to start.  So skill choices have a effect on late game actions.  But thankfully you can recruit &apos;companions&apos; who round out other areas of ytour skill base, provide an unkillable (they can be badly wounded &amp; out of the fight for days though) part of your army and you can equip &amp; level them as you see fit.<br><br>Most of the gameplay occurs riding around the rather bland world map chasing fleeing groups of enemy forces &amp; avoiding large warbands of not fleeing enemy forces :D.  While the AI can be rather irksome it generally engages when it can win and avoids fights when it cant.  Recent patches allow the AI to use nearby allies in combat meaning small groups can dog pile in on your &apos;sure thing&apos;.<br><br>The real meat on Mount &amp; Blades bones is the battles.  Prior to battles a few mano-e-mano fights on foot, either training peasants, or thrashing some muggers or drunks in bars are the main stay.  Battles supporting 150 very individual fighters going at it are amazing.  With a skill called Tactics affecting your disposition &amp; ratio of troops and Looting affecting the prize for the fight, in addition to the value of the target affecting your renown and reputation you can gain alot from picking a fight well.  Rudimentary commands can be issued to archers, infantry &amp; cavalry and  micro tactics can be used but generally your troops manage to stand in a line until they are hit with a wave of cavalry or bow shot.  What the game engine allows for however is detail &amp; precision in the combat.  I have shot a man in the face through the legs of half a dozen charging infantry.  I have used ballistic trajectory to drop an arrow on someones head through ramparts.  Melee is a little rougher but the weapons function approipriately with two handers cutting through a riders leg, the horse and at the end of its swing the man next to the horse.  It is very capable and requires you to use nuances of the engine in blocks and attacks dependant on the weapon your using.  This challenging and rewarding mechanism allows you to be a devastation force when your skilled enough but puts you firmly in your place enough spear points will kill you :D.  Levelling isnt some artificial RPG nonsense for power it allows options.<br><br>The game is at its best when you ride through the enemy lines lance and sabre in hand and sweep the enemy strongpoints with a cadre of heavy knights &amp; tooled up companions behind you.  One important battle detail worth noting is your troops gear.  Each man is individual, I have seen peasants pull out cleavers, clubs, knives &amp; daggers while wearing a seelction of hats, and a selection of shirts. Against it, the AI can be fairly dull (enemy lords particularly charging straight to contact),  but it does do a very good job of creating a confused and messy battlefield a trademark of the medieval period</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=1372915">Expand</a></span>

All these affect how the other characters in the game react to you. For example, some of the Lords DESPISE women being on the battlefield, while a lot of them will respect men from a Noble Background, some of them will threaten to tear your families &quot;banner&quot; (coat of arms) apart.<br><br>Now to get down to business. You first find yourself stumbling across a merchant, who gives you a brief tutorial on how to recruit members to your party but also how to fight! But after this very short tutorial, you&apos;re kind of thrown into the world to build up experience yourself!<br><br>The trading system can be quite complicated if you don&apos;t know where to buy and sell things. For example  (not naming cities) I can buy Iron in one city for around 120, but sell it in another for around 300 making a massive profit, but you can&apos;t find these deals unless you look for them, or know what cities produce which resource. Sure, the forums are pretty active and have people posting all their advice on there about different trade routes and this may be very helpful, but I find the best way to learn is to figure it out for yourself.<br><br>Of course being called Warband, there can be a lot of fighting, especially when you first start out with Bandits, Sea Raiders but also when you&apos;ve got a LOT of man power if you join a Kingdom! I&apos;ve found myself having battles will well over 1000 people on each side with my Kingdom defending a Castle from an opposing Kingdom. Now with these Kingdoms, there are 6 present in the game when you start out, but if you start doing well for yourself you can set up your own and convince the Lords from other Kingdoms to join you! Overall, I have 211 hours of play time but I KNOW I haven&apos;t completed HALF the opportunities Warband offers me. To be honest, I haven&apos;t &quot;won&quot; the game by taking over the whole map with one Kingdom yet, but that&apos;s the fun, I&apos;ve made about 15 different characters trying to get them exactly how I want to, and I&apos;ve finally settled on one (who has just come out of &quot;prison&quot; for attacking another Kingdoms caravan)!<br><br>So overall, Warband can be quite complicated for the first couple of hours, but as soon as you figure out the systems in place in game, it becomes a VERY addictive game!!!!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=1449691">Expand</a></span>

That said, the graphics aren&apos;t bad: just unpolished.  The combat is frankly the best I have ever seen from a first-person hack and slash: I only hope that Bethesda are paying attention to it for the Elder Scrolls V.  Mounted combat is thrilling and exhillerating.  Issuing orders to my army felt second nature after a while.  It is difficult to express just how enjoyable it is to engage 50 enemy spearmen and archers with my own infantry and archers, then have my cavalry flank the enemy and turn those proud lines into an utter rout.  Where this game does falter, apart from the graphics, is the role play element.  Quests and characters seem to have been lifted from a game 15 years older: while perfectly adequate, they don&apos;t provide much in the way of immersion.  But M&amp;B is the only game I&apos;ve come across which offers the opportunity to build and control a warband from a first person perspective, without sacrificing anything in the way of action.  I wouldn&apos;t be without it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=1532659">Expand</a></span>

This game doesn&apos;t have grate scenario - only repetitive misions given by pesants, lords or merchants that -even worse - are re-given after few months game time doesn&apos;t matter if you completed them already or not. This game doesn&apos;t have interesting characters - they are only little more than nameless peasants recruited to your band of mercenaries. So what makes this game just grate? Battle system - it&apos;s the greatest, and most realistic medieval battlefield - or rather mounted knight - simulator that i ever played. When you and your 30 fellow knights charging few times bigger line on infantry it really feels like battle field. It;s not Oblivion where horse is only driving equipment - here horse is as important - or even a lot more - than sword in your hand. Without horse you&apos;re just an easy prey. And even with poor mission system this game has excellent game play - you start as mr. nobody with a stick in your hand, lame horse and a cheese +bread in your backpack. Soon you will be chef of mercenary band that can try his luck even with some lords with mighty army ... to ultimatly became 1 of those lord for himself. And then the real fest start - fighting lords of other realms, conquering castles and cities and accumulating might to ultimately trying your luck as a ruler either by declaration of independence or acknowledging right to rule of some royal bastard and making him your puppet. No campaign here, no interesting missions - you have to create campaign for yourself and it is fun! But if you like everything given to you at plate than no problem also - fun works and mods are just plenty - and they are really good - most of them by few levels exceeded original - native campaign.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=1644110">Expand</a></span>

I can see how people gave it negative marks for being exactly like the original, however...but I love this game.  It&apos;s tremendously fun, intuitive, and cuts a lot of wasted time out of the typical RPG play.  I really was excited to learn that you don&apos;t have to walk through a town to get to a person you wanted to talk to, or get to a vendor you wanted to work with - all you need to do is click on that person or area and you&apos;re there.  I can&apos;t tell you how much more enjoyable it is to play something like this.  The battles are so fun, like, ridiculously fun.  This game has one of the highest user scores on metacritic for a reason...it&apos;s just really really fun.  There is something terrible satisfying about throwing a huge pike and an enemy on a horse and knocking them off of it with a kill shot.<br><br>Boom.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=1367296">Expand</a></span>

The controls feel smooth, the graphics great considering the number of AI on the screen at one time and the music is awesome too, when it&apos;s not skipping or repeating...</span>

I mention this not as a complaint, only to suggest the level of detail.  A twitch game this isn&apos;t -- if you just point and click you&apos;re going to get pwnt pretty darn quick. Within its limitations, fighting feels totally immersive and real.<br><br>See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CvE67YjIyQ for the best small-battle intro I&apos;ve found.<br><br>What isn&apos;t apparent in that video is, again, how much sophistication they&apos;ve gotten into the controls.  It&apos;s WASD and mouse with good keystroke defaults for the ancillary controls (though I like to put sheathe on V because you can run faster with empty hands) like looking around and picking up weapons or spent arrows if you happen to see what you want  LMB controls attack swing strength and timing, RMB controls block direction and timing, combos control feints, mouse movement controls tip trajectory and body or viewpoint rotation, MMB controls weapon and shield selection, WASD combinations control body movement..<br><br>I haven&apos;t loved a fighting game so much since the first Prince of Persia on my mac, 20 years ago. Elite equipment and high character level will not keep you safe.  They&apos;re skill amplifiers, not I-win buttons.  In arena and tournament combat in town (deathmatch-style open melee with wooden weapons, i.e. the basic combat and tactics tutorial range) I started out unable to kill even a single opponent taking quarter damage against the weakest combat AI.  It took me practice and focus and more practice and some time just thinking about it and then more time in to be able to take first prize at that level most of the time, by which time my character was fairly skilled -- more so than the knight in the video above, for example.  Then I tried it on full damage and good AI.  The adrenaline rush was incredible.  I&apos;m pretty sure I sounded like the in-game recorded battle yells when I hit my stride, only at full volume. I&apos;m still learning. I can now more or less expect to survive about a quarter of an arena combat playing as a new character.  I&apos;m not good at mounted combat.<br><br>Many things your arena opponents will do seem unfair until you realize they&apos;re the result of lessons learned.  A tip: unless I&apos;m imagining this, and I don&apos;t think I am, don&apos;t run directly at an opponent if you don&apos;t want them attacking you.  Don&apos;t even stare directly at them. They&apos;re running threat assessments just like you are.  You&apos;ll learn more lessons.<br><br>These guys aren&apos;t just having a great time and a lot of fun building this.  They love it.<br><br>Real combat in the game world adds terrain and weapon variety, not to mention upping the stakes dramatically.  Plus you&apos;re commanding a warband.  See the video for a small taste.<br><br>The rpgfan reviewer gets many things right, but I simply don&apos;t understand why he said: &quot;the game is ultimately directionless.&quot;.  Say what? I also came up with the Pirates! and Total War comparisons, (I&apos;d say the economic sim is closer to Railroad Tycoon in its depth, though I haven&apos;t pushed it yet). But I called Pirates! a story-construction kit and loved it for that; and both their game and their name say it: TaleWorlds love the same things in a game. As with Pirates!, you start out a newly-arrived, inexperienced youth in a limited world, and set out to make your fortune.<br><br>Ruling the world or whatever part of it pleases you isn&apos;t direction enough? From the bottom, there is only one direction: up.  If making yourself king of one country isn&apos;t enough, you can conquer the world, but you sure as hell won&apos;t do either just by winning battles.  It will take smart alliances and marriage, attention to loyalty and economic development, staff development and broad political awareness and strategy.<br><br>I considered giving this game only a 9 because of the faults many people have noted: the graphics outside of combat settings are perfunctory at best, there are some real bugs and lots of long-unfixed typos, there are undocumented features like ctrl-space to accelerate campaign map motion, leaving me to wonder what other of the game&apos;s infelicities I could avoid if only they&apos;d bother documenting how, and the incredible combat sophistication they do manage to cram into the left five fingers on the keyboard and the mouse on the right actually make me long for ... perfection.<br><br>And then I realized steam tells me I have almost a hundred hours into this game,  I&apos;ve barely scratched the surface, and I care enough to write this review.<br><br>Frakking awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=1371936">Expand</a></span>

There is so much to do and the developers have patched in more content, items, quests and ways to make money  (like buying property) constantly.
<br>
<br>Graphically the game is not amazing to look at compared to say a modern FPS but the thing is M&amp;B: Warband is showing you massive battles &amp; sieges with sometimes 200+ units &amp; horses fighting with arrows and bolts flying through the air, blood spattering and the general chaos that makes this game of medi-evil battles so much fun. Sure there is diplomacy &amp; trading and questing but these things are available in other games, Such excellent mounted combat can only be found in Mount &amp; Blade &amp; Mount &amp; Blade: Warband.
<br>
<br>Worth every penny.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=1404417">Expand</a></span>

Even when it is only the combat you can spend hours with just one more seige game play, and I havent eve gotten around to the multiplayer yet. In a world of poor game releases and games that are pretty but crappy you cant go wrong with this one.</span>

<br>Where this game really shines is in multiplayer. Warband multiplayer is a bit unlike anything I&apos;ve tried before. This is the only game I&apos;ve played where real time close combat is done right. The learning curve may be high but those people who keep at it for awhile will find warband to be one of the most intense and rewarding multiplayer game for some time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=1506298">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s really a free-lance game: you start with a sword, and do whatever you want - either serve under a King, or become one yourself.  All is possible.  Some controls might require getting used to - but don&apos;t give up, give this game a go, and you&apos;ll enjoy it for several dozens of hours.</span>

It&apos;s somewhere in between a Total War Battle and a FPS. You get to ride around the countryside building up a small army and working for a ruler along with other NPC characters who control their own army detachments and multiply that by about 50 and what you have is this chaotic game with factions that behave independently and creates this amazing game.<br>The combat system is polished and really effective, no where else have I had so much fun hacking and slashing away in fort attack or defence. Really cool skirmish system with a character building edge to it. Although, don&apos;t get too excited about the character building, it&apos;s very linear as are the options. The fun is in the battles which are really polished even thought the character side is pretty b grade.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/mount-blade-warband/user-reviews?user_review_id=1681952">Expand</a></span>
