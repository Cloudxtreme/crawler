I was skeptic to say the least but i actually works really well. Visually the games clean design looks great and the soundtrack is actually really good. What is sad about this game is that there isn&apos;t a whole lot of content. At the moment have i played through each map in the game several times in only 4 - 5 hours. The game really needs more content and that is the games biggest shortcoming. I have also yet been able to find a multiplayer opponent yet. I would still recommend this game since the free running is just so much fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inmomentum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2805744">Expand</a></span>

Nice graphics but the maps are a messy skew of blocks, nothing interesting to see and even do. All you do is jump and if you jump at the wrong time, you tend to jump off down to hell many times which is unavoidable. I am very glad I only paid a dollar for this as part of a indie pack.</span>

Great music, beautiful visuals, varied stages, and those confounded leader boards will ensure you don&apos;t get bored of the game too quickly.

Even if you rebind the keys, there is simply no way to execute multiple commands while using both the mouse and keyboard to move about the game world. Sometimes it is necessary to use power-ups, and having five fingers in each hand is simply not enough for inMomentum. I am certain that after excessive amounts of practice, it becomes possible, but I am not sure if the trouble is worth it. There are barely any sound effects of any kind. You will hear the occasional beeps and bloops every once in a while, but that is all besides the continuous uninspired music. The game does not give you any indication that you are actually running around and jumping. There is no feeling involved with the movement and game physics. It is as if you are gliding from place to place, then floating, gliding some more, all with odd physics that do not blend well with the game&apos;s setting or anything that makes any sense at all. Timing your glides and floats so that you land on the platforms requires mostly luck, as the controls are incredibly imprecise, and do not allow for the player to develop any real skills or techniques in order to accomplish each level rapidly and properly. inMomentum does not have any story or introduction as to why you are doing this gliding and floating around on platforms collecting orbs and doing time trials. There is no campaign of any kind to speak of, and the only aspect of the game that provides feelings of accomplishment are found in online leaderboards for the two limited game modes available. The game is so bare bones, in fact, that you will wonder if it was actually finished, and if the developer should actually be expecting money for it. inMomentum is a cheap, unfinished, unpolished, bore. Play it every once in a while for five to ten minutes at a time in order to maximize your fun with it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inmomentum/user-reviews?user_review_id=2298605">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I simply can&apos;t excuse poor design. we all know indie developers are trying to convey their existence through nifty ideas and concepts. Those are more than welcome, but just because a game is simple doesn&apos;t mean it should be praised as &quot;underground masterpiece&quot; because it&apos;s rudimentary and obscure. I sure as hell won&apos;t compare it to Mass Effect in terms of production value, but it must serve its primary focus of providing a good gaming experience. InMomentum feels too unpolished for an idea that could work pretty well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/inmomentum/user-reviews?user_review_id=4945378">Expand</a></span>
