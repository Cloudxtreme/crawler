It&apos;s a severe dumbing down for the console players. NPCs have become more one-dimensional, gone are the romance options and in-depth dialogues, and poor Oghren suffers the same fate as Gimli, in that he&apos;s now only comical relief, and not someone you feel with. You also get stuck a LOT in this expansion -- on roots, buildings, and pieces of air. And have to wait around for minutes after a kill before loot shows up. Speaking of loot, &quot;Awakening&quot; is one monty haul after another, where after an hour of playing, your new weapons and armor will remove all challenge from the rest of the game. This is especially true if you plonk a couple of points down on the new rune system, and actually figures out how to use it. (It&apos;s not explained). Cause armor now comes with three slots. All that said, the expansion isn&apos;t all bad. But to ask $40 for it is pure unadulterated greed. The combination of Warden&apos;s Keep, Stone Prisoner and Return to Ostagar costs less than half of this, and gives you far more for your money. Like characters you actually can TALK with, and not just dumb marvel-like tanks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins---awakening/user-reviews?user_review_id=747032">Expand</a></span>

This can be VERY annoying for a while. That said, it&apos;s story is still a good one, your decisions have fairly legit consequences, and the game mechanics remain the same with new skills added as you lvl up as high as the mid or early 30&apos;s (I think I reached 33). Ultimately, you&apos;ll be disappointed if you&apos;re expecting choices to carry over like they did with Mass Effect 1 &amp; 2. However, if you finished the original there&apos;s no reason not to pick this one up, as it adds about 20 hours of Dragon Age goodness that despite its flaws, really shouldn&apos;t be missed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins---awakening/user-reviews?user_review_id=746751">Expand</a></span>

I experienced none of the bugs mentioned here, nor did I have performance problems (I&apos;m running what is now quite old equipment). It&apos;s irritating that Shale didn&apos;t come back -- I had deleted the original game, and had to reinstall. No Shale, but instead dire warnings about potential corruptions. Overall? They would have been better off reusing most of the previous game locations, and making the plot 10 times longer. In sum, I will definitely think twice about buying another such an expensive $ / hour game. This isn&apos;t the worst for this, but it&apos;s certainly in the bottom 1/4 for value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins---awakening/user-reviews?user_review_id=747019">Expand</a></span>

It provides many hours of additional content, but takes away some of the things I liked about Dragon Age: Origins. You can no longer talk to your companions whenever you want, and they aren&apos;t quite as interesting, but still it&apos;s a nice expansion pack, and  definitely worth your money if you&apos;re a fan of the original game.</span>

                                        <span>Its definately not bad. It just lacks some of what made Dragon Age Origins great. Its characters are pretty good (especially Justice, Nathaniel, and Anders). However, the lack of romances and the okay plot hold it back a bit. Now that you can get it for like 12 dollars at gamestop, you might as well go buy it.</span>

The price is a little sticky; I wouldn&apos;t pay the full $40 for this, but would suggest waiting until you can pick it up on the cheap.
<br>/// There are two chief issues that I had with the game. First of all, it&apos;s easy. *Extremely* easy. I did a play-through on Nightmare and not once had a Game Over. This was extremely disappointing. Even the final battle was easy as sin. Battlemage powers are pretty much able to wreck an entire crowd of minor darkspawn; so is the Overwhelm ability given to a warrior. Elite enemies aren&apos;t that much more difficult to take down. Elite Genlock Emissaries could be a tremendous pain in Origins as they messed with you from a distance; here, you can neglect them. It&apos;s as though the enemy&apos;s levels, relative to your own, have dropped by half. It&apos;s terrible.
<br>///
<br>Secondly, I had a few quests that were difficult to trigger, or difficult to resolve, without consulting the Dragon Age Wiki on Wikia. This annoyed me. I don&apos;t like having to constantly halt the game to pop over and see why I couldn&apos;t find a certain quest item, or trigger a companion quest.
<br>///
<br>And, as a more minor problem, a lot of the decisions made in the game have no actual gameplay relevance, but only come into play during the epilogue. Some of them sort of seem like the should have some effect on gameplay, or at least a *greater* effect on the epilogue than they do.
<br>///
<br>This is still Dragon Age, it still feels Biowarey, and I&apos;d still recommend it. I just can&apos;t do so at the full retail price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins---awakening/user-reviews?user_review_id=1361494">Expand</a></span>

I really enjoyed it but I&apos;m knocking it down a couple of points for some performance issues and occasional glitches. That said in some ways I enjoyed it more than the original game, it&apos;s more tight, focused, keeps moving you forward and never leaves you idle. The new abilities such as two-handed are great and add freshness to battles. I would also concur with what some others have written here, the locations are arguably more interesting than the main game. It&apos;s as if the level designers got very little time to contribute to the original game, but now with the engine in place they could flex their muscles. Sure it&apos;s not the prettiest game out there, but the areas are varied and have a better sense of height compared to the relative flatness of the first game.<br><br>The new characters are pretty interesting. Sure no one is as interesting as Morrigan but interesting none the less. It&apos;s true that Oghren is played even more for laughs this time which made him one-dimensional. A quest that involves some back-story on him feels out of place given he seems to be on-board for little more than one-liners. That said, he was one of my go-to companions on the original quest so I was happy to have him back and new abilities meant that there was more I could do with him in battle.<br><br>More of the same basically in the hour-by-hour game-play. Took me a little over 15 hours and I probably had about three hours of side quests outstanding. The ending feels a little force-fit. Some of the boss battles along the way are more engaging but there you go. The final boss of both DA:O and Mass Effects 1 and 2 were not that great either. Someone at Bioware needs to go talk to the folks at Retro Studios (Metroid Prime) - now those guys know boss battles.<br><br>A solid 8. If you enjoyed the first game, definitely pick it up. Now I&apos;m fee to see what all this debacle over Dragon Age 2 is all about. A shame that I won&apos;t be able to import my character after investing all this time in him.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins---awakening/user-reviews?user_review_id=1535288">Expand</a></span>

The quests are very nice... the overall story is in my opinion the best Dragon Age story to date (yes, I am looking at you Dragon Age 2!) but no romances... but I did not miss them!<br><br>&quot;Dragon Age: Awakenings&quot; is simply THE BEST Dragon Age! It took what was good in Origins, added a more interesting storyline, with the option to actually play as a ruler and make a rulers decisions!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins---awakening/user-reviews?user_review_id=1631292">Expand</a></span>

I think Origins is an excellent game, and the fact that it was so involving is perhaps why I struggled at first to get into the expansion. I spent dozens of hours developing my character, establishing relationships with NPCs (yes, even romantic), and making hundreds of seemingly significant decisions.<br><br>Then, whether you import your Origins character or begin a new one, Awakening seems to pay only cursory notice to what you did in the main game. The only returning NPC companion was the last one I&apos;d have chosen (but I guess that is personal preference), and the new companions may have been interesting but I only got to spend a couple of days with them so they were not very fleshed out.<br><br>The expansion asks more questions than it answers. Very few, if any, of the unresolved plot elements from Origins are answered here, so don&apos;t play the expansion expecting closure. I suppose that will be for DA3.<br><br>While it did take me a while to start enjoying this expansion, once I got out and away from the opening location I did find the story to be intriguing, and if it had lasted more than the approximately 15 hrs. of gameplay I am sure I would have enjoyed getting to know the new companions.<br><br>The new skills/talents/spells and other new elements also seem to be logical &quot;expansions&quot; of the original.<br><br>On a negative side, Awakening did have a few &quot;no u-turn&quot; areas where you can play through and follow one path, miss other areas that you can&apos;t revisit. Once you &quot;finish&quot; and area you cannot go back and explore to see if you missed anything. One of those areas is the Fade. If you go through a certain area you cannot benefit from full exploration of the previous area.<br><br>Al in all, I&apos;d say it is an odd expansion that was fun to play but seemed more like a separate game unaffected by the original. It is fun though.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins---awakening/user-reviews?user_review_id=1600535">Expand</a></span>

If i compare the areas to Dragon Age 2, where It&apos;s not-stop repeating, every, and I mean EVERY area is used only ONCE, and this is just an Expansion Pack but it beats Dragon Age 2 at everything, except the length (Honestly, as boring as DA2 was, It felt like a lifetime to play it through). And not only they always differ, they are very beautiful. The connection to Origins is unquestionable. I don&apos;t know what IGN was talking about there. Ohh, and I think everyone will be happy for the returning characters here. The combat has been extended with new powers and the max level has been raised, though some might find the new powers a little over-powered in smaller fights. I think the ending was very good. I think most people didn&apos;t like it because there wasn&apos;t any big ceremony like there was in Origins. But if you take a closer look at Awakening&apos;s ending, you should know what I mean. Unlike Origins where It always make you feel heroic and happy no matter who died, in Awakening it&apos;s much more deeper and often more sad than Origins. They just walk off the scene to see what effects their choices made on others and  indicates that It&apos;s nowhere near the end of the story and when you read the epilogue with that music under it, only then you&apos;ll truly understand the meaning of the ending and realize how some choice you make is more dramatic than in Origins. I think it can stand its ground easily as a standalone game. I hope I didn&apos;t blow off any surprise from the game and I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll enjoy it very much just as I did.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins---awakening/user-reviews?user_review_id=1551454">Expand</a></span>

After playing Awakening I basically decided to see the Mass Effect series through and not buy any other BioWare games anymore. I guess that sums it up.</span>

It has great writing (as always) but was built with the FATAL BIOWARE FLAW: This game is a dead-end. You get to the end and its a desert. There is nothing there. Nothing to do. You end up building a high level fantasy character and there is precisely NOWHERE you can take it. There is no follow up. This leads to an incredible feeling of emptiness and pointlessness. I will re-write this review later and elaborate on some of the nice content in this game. Better if you buy it and enjoy it yourself. However be warned: Bioware is a company that is truly CLUELESS when it comes to building worlds and offering open adventures. Awakening will definitely wake you up for about 20 hours or so. But when it finishes its the abyss. Go back to sleep, because there is NOTHING else to do once you played it once. Since it is Bioware&apos;s own narrative-driven design that has players hanging out for their next fix, you would have figured they would have made DA2 good, and somehow let their passionate fans all stimulated by origins and Awakening fired up to &apos;get back to Thedas&apos;. My God you would be wrong! This game is a spectacular DEAD END leading nowhere. It didn&apos;t even offer proper closure for DAO or make sense of any of the rancid DLC for Origins. Great writing in a FAILED franchise. Another episode of meandering, pointless, going nowhere rudderless &apos;adventures in Thedas&apos;. Compare this to the professionalism of Blizzard who built Azeroth from the outset and allowed millions of gamers to write their own adventure, and explore a fantasy world for YEARS on end, and its clear, that Bioware has been an over-rated pack of amateurs, poorly lead, with little real understanding of gaming, and far too much smugness about their writing prowess. Pride comes before a fall. But you can&apos;t fall if you dont first rise. Fantasy RPG&apos;s require enduring world. So long as Bioware refuses to make those their games well end up like this one, a forgotten fragment of lost potential, remembered and loved by a few hard core fans, mocked by Orctowngrot who knows the true value of things. Who can tell you all WHY this game failed. Ingredient One: ENDURING WORLD. Good though Awakening is, this game is a very BLEAK and joyless experience when you get to the end. Its better to quit before you have to make the choice of Vigil&apos;s Keep or Amaranthine. Either way your options are expiring faster than a Genlock with AIDS.

<br>THE GROT REVIEW CRITERIA: After a long time writing reviews like an anus, think its time to set a few bad habits straight: Stop insulting designers. Show some respect for the design process and getting games in circulation. Hence (1) No Red scores. (2) Game scores as follows: Bad Game 5/10. Poor Game 6/10. Mediocre Game: 7/10. Good Game 8/10. Great game 9/10. Stella Game 10/10. To get 10/10 it must be a game that can be (theoretically) play-able for 1000+ hours. Not only great but near endless fun. Games may be bad or poor but making them should earn respect. Thus even the worst POS will still be a 5/10. 0/10 no longer exists in my vocabulary. Yellow is the new red.

I won&apos;t spoil too much, but....suddenly the secret Warden ceremony, remember that? Well it&apos;s not so secret anymore and what a joke. I lost all faith in the story from that point and it does get worse. On my third attempt to get through this xpac during the quest in the forest there is a bug where you can lose all of your gear. It is deleted. I&apos;m serious. In fact, now I&apos;m angry about that again and gonna lower this score to 0, it was 3 because the graphics and new spells are good. But, the bugs, oh god the bugs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins---awakening/user-reviews?user_review_id=1600657">Expand</a></span>

The new skills and specializations are fun additions, and the ability to craft runes is handy--though both contribute to making Awakening much easier than Origins. Aside from that, the gameplay is essentially the same as the main game. The story is fairly good, and leaves open interesting possibilities for future games. Unfortunately, the characters are less interesting in Awakening: most have potential but are simply underdeveloped due to the significantly reduced dialogue and lack of romances. The locations are a mixed bag: some are fairly good, while others are just more of the same (more Deep Roads, more elf-forest). If you liked DA:O, then you&apos;ll probably like this well enough, and given that you can get the two for $20 or less, there&apos;s no reason not to give Awakening a try.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins---awakening/user-reviews?user_review_id=2563441">Expand</a></span>

Looking back, I wish this were just the sequel of Dragon Age Origins and the other two just didn&apos;t happen. If this were the case, less people would hate EA and Bioware today. Awakening is a worthy sequel but not as good as Origins. If like me, you romanced Leliana, you&apos;d miss her so much and the characters here, while certainly interesting and better compared to most games, fall short of the original due to a reduced amount of conversations. Gameplay has been improved and the new skills are formidable. The keep building thing is also a plus and the quests are very good, especially the one against the spectral dragon or the politics and decision making that happen in your keep. Overall, a great expansion to an excellent game. Why and how EA went from this to DAII and Inquisition could only be blamed on the &quot;consolification&quot; of Dragon Age, which ruined and stripped-down so many things that made the original so great.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins---awakening/user-reviews?user_review_id=7039438">Expand</a></span>

True, it&apos;s an addon to Origins, but the lack of depth that&apos;s now rapidly becoming Bioware canon is already there on the horizon of Awakening. Starts out with not having the option to interact with companions at will and have to wait upon the pleasure, continues with being taken by the hand when it comes to gifts, in case you&apos;re to stupid to figure it out by yourself and ends with a very short story. Enjoyable, but the mediocrity is already there and tries to pave the road for the later distasters under that brand.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins---awakening/user-reviews?user_review_id=2725570">Expand</a></span>

Also, while some of the new classes and skills are useful, the skill system starts to become a mess with higher level characters having dozens of skills.
<br>
<br>One thing to mention is the subgame of managing your soldiers and keep. On several occasions, you are given options where you want to place your forces. You can also do some minor upgrades to your keep. In the end, however, it&apos;s left unclear how these choices affected to anything which wasn&apos;t very satisfying.
<br>
<br>The are also some problems with setting the tone/mood of the game. E.g. the joining ritual is near comical (In original game it was anything but). There&apos;s no feeling of desperation, like in first game and lots of stuff feel pretty lackadaisical. Awakening also contains lots of Bioware style sidequests, where you run around and gather some stuff without any relevance to anything.
<br>
<br>All in all, the game was still fun to play. It wasn&apos;t really anything too memorable like the original game, but it&apos;s worth buying if you get it cheap.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dragon-age-origins---awakening/user-reviews?user_review_id=3271365">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I can accept that with a darker, &quot;edgier&quot; game compared to past Bioware titles to date, they would seek to have more cynical, &quot;adult&quot; characters, but they were so miserably sarcastic and annoying that any time they spoke, I wished desperately that you could just murder your companions. I&apos;ve loved Bioware&apos;s games since I was a child, but never will I ever choose to pick up another Dragon Age game because of how terrible the companions were. It&apos;s rare when bad characterization can force my hand into giving a poor rating on its own, but that&apos;s just how bad it was.

<br>Better than Origins in certain aspects, but still suffers from stupid AI and some bugs.

Reminds me of some full-scale sequels - story long enough (but not as long as the main part), companions very good (though not as good... you get me), few nostalgic moments as a reminder of the original story. I should really award this DAO-A with a 8, but when I compare it with some DAO DLCs or DA2, I just have to go higher. So... nine it is.</span>
