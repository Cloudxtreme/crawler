<br>When I got to the large, frustrating and boring maze in the third chapter I knew this game probably isn&apos;t worth playing. Why to game designers continue to include mazes in adventure games? A few other puzzles are also ridiculous.

Instead, it is a work of gaming fiction and design that stands alone on its own merits, weaving a beautiful, haunting tale (with several lovely twists) with fairly seamless, reasonably logical puzzles. While the art is beautiful, the voice acting (in English) could do with some polish, but these are trivial points when considering the breadth and depth of this game.
<br>
<br>I would generally agree with others that the characters could have been built up more in order to truly reinforce the narrative and its twists, but given the number of key characters (three, effectively), it was always going to be a big ask. Still, overall, excellently done, and here&apos;s hoping for another entry in the series in the near future.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/memoria/user-reviews?user_review_id=3511465">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s also odd/interesting that the fantasy story mentions Mogul sorcerors and Caliphs.  Voice acting wasn&apos;t bad.  The ending is at the same time surprising, satisfying and also confusing (did we ever get an answer to the riddle?).  Good fun all in all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/memoria/user-reviews?user_review_id=3488606">Expand</a></span>

Another shining star of this game was beautiful hand drawn graphics and interesting characters. That is the strong part of the game and I will definitely reccommend it to everyone.
<br>However it is also important to mention some of the drawbacks I encountered. Puzzles were okay, but I found them too obvious or plain ridiculous, only a few were somewhere in between that left me with a warm feeling of accomplishment. The game also glitched a lot on my few months old high-end PC. And for the last thing, I don&apos;t understand in general achievements in a point-and-click adventure game. Seriously, why ? Such games don&apos;t have a replay value ... or at least not right after I finished it. Okay, I can forgive that, but at least after finishing the game I would like to go and get those achievements. Unfortunately, no. I can only start all over or use only my own saves (which I dont have many since it is an adventure game). And yeah no jumping to chapters. Nevermind, the negatives of this game are more or less insignificant, so do yourself a favor and go dive into the Memoria story !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/memoria/user-reviews?user_review_id=4142140">Expand</a></span>

<br>Very captivating story with some nice twists, interesting characters, great puzzles, fantastic art.
<br>The only downsides are the subpar animations and the bad voice acting. But they&apos;re small flaws, and all things considered, the game is great.
<br>It&apos;s recommended to play Chains of Satinav before this, but it&apos;s not necessary.</span>

<br>
<br>Memoria gets most things right. Decent voice acting, fantastic background art and a somewhat interesting story with a good few twists on the way.
<br>
<br>However the game falls short with several flaws. The story ends up in a twisty illogical affair that makes little sense. It&apos;s like watching an episode of Lost. The plot is just all over the place towards the mid-section of the game, and the ending is just full of plot holes. The is no pattern to the writing, its just full on erratic.
<br>
<br>If that wasn&apos;t bad enough, the puzzles in Memoria start off following logic. They are easy to comprehend and grasp. Towards the ending of the game, its as if they decided that they couldn&apos;t be bothered anymore, and put you in a situation where you had to complete some rather outlandish puzzles that leave you scratching your head. The tower puzzle at the end is by far the most criminal of these.
<br>
<br>Memoria is a decent outing, but will leave you frustrated, confused and just downright bored towards the end.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/memoria/user-reviews?user_review_id=4944632">Expand</a></span>

It still lacks clarity in its storytelling at times, leaving you uncertain of what happens and why. However, the story itself is better, more memorable, hooking in an intriguing enough mystery, and regularly introducing pleasant new characters. The English translation isn&apos;t perfect still, including lines spoken in German, although the occurrences are rare and unobtrusive. The backgrounds are as lovely as you&apos;d expect.
<br>
<br>On the seriously minus side, the interface is a mess, with icons useless because they are too small to identify, overlapping hot spots making some of them inaccessible, and clicks with zero feedback (while the majority of clicks trigger an episode of logorrhea.) Very often, I ended up not doing what I was trying to do, usually doing something else in the process. Also, despite a number of puzzles that are quite fun to solve, the rating takes a serious hit for including a maze, a.k.a. the poorest man&apos;s puzzle, the one which replaces difficulty with annoyance. And a big one at that, to make sure more players will quit and uninstall. Also, I almost forgot to mention the not so uncommon moments where I had to watch patiently the protagonist walk at a turtle&apos;s pace towards an object before describing it to me.
