PJ Monsters is super minimalistic, not in a cool way, but in a lazy way.  The sprite variety is extremely limited, and they have no death animations.  The towers have no graphical indication to being upgraded.  There is a huge priority to earning a perfect score by taking no hits on your base, but there is no way to &quot;earn back&quot; a hit on your base, which results in a frustrating need to restart from zero.
<br>But the biggest negative by far is the paths the enemies follow to attack your base.  The whole point of tower defense is to devise a strategy from what you know about the enemy types and the terrain they must follow.  But for half the maps in this game the field has an &quot;open&quot; design that leads the monsters right past your base in the middle of their attack path.  This makes a mockery of tower defense strategy, since the baddies are arbitrarily &quot;deciding&quot; not to kill you, rather than falling to your strategy.  Overall, this game makes me appreciate Kingdom Rush and Fieldrunners, and the effort their developers put into them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pixeljunk-monsters-ultimate/user-reviews?user_review_id=3800766">Expand</a></span>

<br>Graphics are poor and sound is very annoying and repetitive. As others have mentioned, the game places a huge emphasis on getting a perfect score (loosing none of your villagers). It is important to get a perfect score because you need to do this on most levels to progress through the game. That&apos;s a truly idiotic game design decision, it should be up to the player to determine how close to perfect they want to get on a level. The iBomber tower defense games get this right by rewarding you with stars that you use to purchase upgrades.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pixeljunk-monsters-ultimate/user-reviews?user_review_id=3955961">Expand</a></span>

It is tricky but cracking each challenge requires a tactful approach which, judging by his review style, he lacks. Safe to say this is a very polished TD game with the unique approach of having a character that you move to upgrade/sell towers.  For those of you struggling with the game, the base towers are almost all you need to finish most of the levels  the flamethrower tower is VERY useful and I never needed to use the ice tower, good luck! (Also there are secret levels if you get enough perfects)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pixeljunk-monsters-ultimate/user-reviews?user_review_id=3666064">Expand</a></span>

The only reason I&apos;m rating it a 9 instead of a 10 is that I feel some of their music should have been slightly less repetitive and a little more complex, and because I felt the menu system for co-op games could have been made simpler.
<br>
<br>Do other TD games have better graphics?  Yes!  But does this art style work and is this game enjoyable too?  Yes!  Plus, it&apos;s the only TD game for Linux right now!  Highly recommended!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pixeljunk-monsters-ultimate/user-reviews?user_review_id=3766120">Expand</a></span>

<br>The system of unlocking, building, and upgrading towers is simple, but not so much that it becomes boring. All necessary information is clearly conveyed to the player, which is very helpful. In addition to currencies and remaining villagers, you can see upgrade statuses of all towers, and their ranges. You can even see which type of enemy is attacking next, and how long you have until they do.
<br>
<br>Unlike many tower defense games, enemies never attack your towers, they only go after your villagers. This makes the game less stressful than other tower defense games.
<br>
<br>Towers get experience from kills and from you dancing under them. This experience will upgrade them over time, or you can pay gems to skip to the next upgrade level. Each tower starts at green, and upgrades to yellow, red, purple, and finally black.
<br>
<br>The campaign is fairly long; it took me around 20 hours to complete all levels on the three main islands. Replayability is decent, with challenges, Steam achievements, higher difficulties, co-op mode, and a fourth island that includes randomly generated maps.
<br>
<br>The downsides are the occasional difficulty spikes and the clunky tower selection spinner. The game also doesn&apos;t do a good job of explaining how towers are upgraded, which is why I explained it here.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t let the cute characters and pleasant music deceive you, this game can be tough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/pixeljunk-monsters-ultimate/user-reviews?user_review_id=4934103">Expand</a></span>
