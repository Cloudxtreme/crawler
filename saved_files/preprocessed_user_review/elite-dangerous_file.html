In 1993 with Elite 2 they updated game but still produced the same back and forth boring game play. In 2014, its the same none sense. Yet the X series by Egosoft stole the Elite crown over a decade ago by adding more depth to that simple formula. Making space in to an interesting simulation.... Admittedly Egosoft threw the crown away with X3 and XR, abandoning core features that made it a great space sim. But does Elite Dangerous deserve a crown, even one that is laying in the mud because nobody wants it....
<br>
<br>The biggest issue here is the fact they decided to make a single player game in to a multiplayer game, so multiplayer feels like single player should feel and solo play is just you in multiplayer without players. Truth is, without Multiplayer Elite Dangerous is so boring it will put you to sleep.
<br>
<br>It is a great space sim, definitely made for the PC and PC hardware, from a space flight perspective its great the best. But these games moved on decades ago, they became much deeper than any Elite game has ever managed to be.... Elite Dangerous is like a Pacman shoot em up in the age of Call of Duty. Players simply expect more in a universe then to watch the stars flash past for 10 minutes at a time as you fly towards a station you will be leaving within seconds of arriving over and over and over again.
<br>
<br>Good game, poorly designed, nice flight mechanics, but this is not the 1990s anymore....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4839424">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s perhaps one of the most immersive space game I&apos;ve ever played, and I&apos;ve pretty much played them all, being an avid space sci-fi gamer.
<br>
<br>What&apos;s odd about it is my playtime. I look at it, and shake my head. I feel ashamed. I feel guilty. Here&apos;s a game that I&apos;ve dreamed about since my first outing in outer-space. Here&apos;s a game that I know I should love, cherish and burn away at until I&apos;ve soiled my pants and I&apos;m knee-deep in my own waste...
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, that never happens.
<br>
<br>What happens instead is, I tend to play Elite in short strides, because, to be perfectly blunt, it isn&apos;t &apos;ready&apos; yet. It still feels like a &apos;beta&apos; and it most certainly does not feel complete. There is no mistaking that Elite has a lot of potential, it&apos;s just a shame that most of that potential will be in the form of paid expansions and future DLC. Which mind you, I have no problem with. With promises such as planetary landings, and multi-crewed ships, I&apos;ll happily throw my money at them. But make no mistake, I&apos;ll angrily grumble away while I do it, reminding them that I didn&apos;t pay for an empty shell of a game.
<br>
<br>And that is sadly what Elite is at the moment. An empty shell. A game that promises so much, and has delivered so little. It is immersive. It is a great game, to be fair. But a deeply flawed one at that. The game&apos;s current mechanics are sub-par and undeveloped.
<br>
<br>Combat is exhilarating, takes skill, proper skill, and is a joy to behold. It&apos;s just a shame that combat aspect of the game that I&apos;m least interested in. I&apos;m sure the Elite combat jockey&apos;s are enjoying the game to its fullest, but even they get burned out from it now and again. I&apos;ve a couple of friends of mine who also have Elite, and are 90% combat, 10% trading. They don&apos;t play Elite anymore.. Why is that? It&apos;s a question that gets answered with a shrug and a statement of, &quot;Well, there&apos;s not much too it...&quot;
<br>
<br>There same could be said for trading. If your not doing anything related to combat, then your possibly grinding your way at the rather mundane method of making money in Elite. Regardless of how you earn your credits, be it bounty hunting missions or trading away on some profitable route, or doing sanctioned courier missions for some NPC faction, watching your faction rep tick up, one percent at a time, you and along with your combat buddies, are all in the same boat.
<br>
<br>That is, you are all grinding away for money. Combat pilots do it for the bounties, and faction rep to boot is a nice bonus for them. Traders do it via smuggling or legit means, regardless, it&apos;s all about money. And what can you do with that money? Well, here&apos;s where Elite falters greatly.
<br>
<br>The core process of progression in Elite is jumping from Ship A to Ship B, and from there to Ship C and D. That&apos;s basically what Elite is, in a nutshell.
<br>
<br>Some of the mechanics are not fully fleshed out and this further emphasizes why Elite is a great but deeply flawed multiplayer game. Let&apos;s do a rundown on some of them:
<br>
<br>Piracy - For anyone that hasn&apos;t played Freelancer Discovery, the online RP mod that has a medium sized community following it, then let me tell you that piracy in that game was fun. Essentially you would camp a space highway/tradelane and wait for your intended target. You&apos;d then knock out the tradelane and issue your demands. That was enjoyable and when I did it, I felt like I was committing piracy. It felt... &apos;right&apos;. In Elite, I do not get that feeling at all. Piracy is not only difficult, (as it should be) but it can be tedious and downright boring at times. It takes a lot of work, a lot of luck, and a lot of waiting around, for it to be reliable and profitable. And even then, why do it?
<br>
<br>Economy: Essentially Elite&apos;s economy is only there to support players in upgrading their ships, there is literally nothing else to it. Sure prices will change based on trades being done, but really, nothing happens on the grandiose scale of things.
<br>
<br>Factions: Players can grind, and I mean that literally, GRIND to gain faction influence for a system that overall has little value in things, barring direct intervention by the developers. This is an area that is still being worked on, and I&apos;m still not impressed.
<br>
<br>Exploration: My favorite aspect of the game. Or, it would have and should have been if it was even remotely interesting. It isn&apos;t. Go look up player vids of players exploration. Most of it contains oddball commentary on the stats of a planet, such as atmosphere and orbital period, while pretending to sip some cognac while pretending to be the late great Sir Patrick Moore. I want to explore ancient ruined wrecks in space. Interesting and bizarre visual anomaly&apos;s  and other odd stuff... I don&apos;t want to drool over a planets stats. Speaking of planets, another point of criticism is that most of the planets look the same, and are quite dull and not as beautiful as they should be.
<br>
<br>I can recommend Elite, but I whole heartily recommend waiting for a more complete Elite.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4906284">Expand</a></span>

<br>I don&apos;t mind that the systems are all similar and repetative because I expected it.
<br>I&apos;m disappointed with the absence (not lack, absence) of multiplayer features.
<br>I&apos;m disappointed that all of a ship&apos;s aesthetic options cost actual mf dollars.
<br>I love the visuals.
<br>I love the audio.
<br>I love lamp.
<br>I love the combat (i didn&apos;t know until yesterday that visiting Nav Beacons guarantees a steady flow of combat).
<br>I love that this game has endless potential.  Yes this is a shell of a full-game, but its a perfect shell.  When the modding community gets their hands on this, they&apos;ve got the best foundation to support their talent.  I&apos;m optimistic.
<br>I&apos;m so invested in this game that I often catch myself talking to myself while playing, and even if it&apos;s something minor, I&apos;ll leap outta my chair yelling whether I&apos;m giddy or pissed.  Not having some unintellectual hand-holding HUD to play the game for you and actually having to do tasks yourself like travelling makes for a sense of accomplishment and individuality (Skyrim vs Morrowind).  I can see how many gamers wouldn&apos;t have the patience to enjoy this and I don&apos;t blame them.  It isn&apos;t a casual game, its a long long-term investment.  Please Frontier, IMPROVE CORE GAMEPLAY BEFORE ADDING NEW.  Scouring a whole star-system for a USS (unidentified signal source) is more repetative, frustrating, and boring than travelling or docking.  Last thing, do Discovery Scanners need to be so expensive?
<br>
<br>-3 points for: poor customer service, no multi-player features other than coexistance, everything related to trade, and &quot;find&quot; missions (including: how the f am I supposed to selectively retreive personal weapons or slaves in 2 hours?).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4903542">Expand</a></span>

<br>What&apos;s really annoying besides the &quot;400 billion&quot; glitches that the game has is the bounty system which is very poorly conceived. You can get attacked by an NPC and if you retaliate you get a bounty on your head for no reason, unless your attacker is marked as &quot;wanted&quot;, and this makes life of a bounty hunter very difficult.
<br>Excellent graphics but in spite of my PC specs being far above Elite&apos;s recommended system requirements, the game runs far from smoothly so the game&apos;s code optimization upon release promise was not kept. God knows what sort of rig one needs for this game...
<br>If you haven&apos;t bought this game yet I don&apos;t recommend it, not until serious changes and fixes have been made.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4872236">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It has the potential to become the &quot;Killer App&quot; for Oculus Rift when the Rift goes mainstream.
<br>
<br>Just don&apos;t expect a top tier AAA title with story line with a vast multi-player experience, since the on-line social interaction is hopelessly weak to say the least. This is modern take on Elite:1984, ground breaking at the time, but hopelessly weak compared to its modern contemporaries.
<br>
<br>I know quite a few individuals who have picked this title up, well aware of what they were getting into. They have all expressed the notion that the experience will greatly improve as the game develops.
<br>Difficult to justify the $50 cost at this stage for what you are getting. I see that $50 as an investment for something better in the future.
<br>
<br>Frontier Developments now have the responsibility to deliver an experience ultimately better than its modern contemporaries. The only problem could be forthcoming space combat/trading titles due for release in the 2015/16, they may steal the thunder.
<br>
<br>At least coming in at the ground floor at this stage, if the game does eventually take off, individuals should have a head start with equipment, cash and experience.
<br>
<br>I have no issues with the online cloud server interaction, if it protects the investment Frontier Developments have made in Elite Dangerous.

<br>I&apos;m giving it 7 out of 10, since it has the potential to be something fantastic. From a gaming perspective. I wouldn&apos;t put it into the realms of BF4, Skyrim or GTA V at this point, since I&apos;m not going to be running into the office tomorrow saying what an epic session I had on Elite Dangerous last night.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4836443">Expand</a></span>

<br>.
<br>the mining as it stands is pretty good, a solid mechanic and a bit of thinking is required to get to/find the best places.
<br>.
<br>Like I said combat is solid, its engaging, exciting and can be rewarding as an early career path.
<br>.
<br>Exploring still needs some work, bu I kind of enjoyed this feature as it can be easily done in a starting ship to get you on your way with a couple grand in Cr.
<br>.
<br>This is it for a basic out line of the game.
<br>7/10 for the following reasons:
<br>.
<br>you need a joystick/HOTAS setup so -1 point for that.
<br>.
<br>there is are a few missing features and or broken petty things that should have been addressed -1 point for that.
<br>.
<br>Offline mode was killed but its not a major feature for me personally I can understand if its off putting for some people but just remember there are clever people that can (and probably will) mode the files to make it off line (watchdogs had it (got hacked), SimCity had it....(EA finally gave inn) this will have it eventually) -1 point for that</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4819442">Expand</a></span>

Echoing other reviews I have read out there, when it is good, it is very good, but it can also be dull and slightly infuriating at times. I have been mainly doing exploration, with a side of bounty hunting. The former can be very dull, even if profitable if you have the right specs in your ship. The latter can be exciting, but it really depends on your opponents. The frequency of dog fighting in Elite is a bit uneven. Sometimes one gets attacked by pirates in supposedly safe systems, while in star systems where anarchy reigns you don&apos;t get almost anything happening. The steep learning curve is fairly steep, which is both good and also bad. I feel some systems would require a bit more explanation. The controls, even if highly customizable, are a bit overwhelming for newcomers. However, if you get a decent flight stick controller (I have the Hotas X) flying will seem like second nature after a while, and that is a pretty good feeling to have. Overall, the game is just good enough to keep me interested, albeit mildly, and I look forward to what the future brings to Elite: Dangerous.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=5054453">Expand</a></span>

<br>2 - Great Ship interface
<br>3 - Great fun in wings with friends
<br>4 - Cruising through space demonstrates it&apos;s vastness.
<br>5 - Ever changing player crafted storyline with their interaction with persistence AI characters.
<br>6 - No 2 planet are the same
<br>7 - Nebulas are beautiful and getting more beautiful thru updates.
<br>8 - If you are a space nerd you will get space orgasm.
<br>9 - No hand holding figure the game out ... for those who love this sort of stuff.
<br>
<br>CONs
<br>1 - Not really a full game yet.
<br>2 - Certain career path are not focused on and lack polish. Eg. Exploration.
<br>3 - Space can feel empty when you travel the fringe world.
<br>4 - Bugs and more bugs (expect that in all next gen games with loads of hardware to render to.)
<br>5 - Downloading the game from frontier can be a pain but there is a steam version now.
<br>6 - Steep learning curve for some players who require hand holding (Hint : Play the training mission)
<br>
<br>Elite is not a full game at the moment. Although it&apos;s released in Dec 2014, frontier is still developing the release version. I am a beta backer, did not really agree with the way it&apos;s being done. Certain key feature
<br>that were promised never came, some backers asked for refund on the game. They felt betrayed.
<br>Nonetheless I still hold high hope for the game as there were active development every month and lots of
<br>patches when the need arises. Needless to say it&apos;s a painful still beta game, and probably will forever be
<br>beta.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s only right that I should warn potential buyer into this game that if you are not ready to come into a beta
<br>game that have been said to be fully release , dont. Just dont because you would feel cheated. But if you
<br>came here to see some beautiful space scape your money will be well worth. Just have to sit tight to let
<br>the feature roll in. I come on and off the game once in a while so I don&apos;t feel burnt by the current lack of
<br>content. The only cool thing in Elite Dangerous is pvp , war , community events and wings system where
<br>you can have friends in a squad of 4.
<br>
<br>With that being said it&apos;s a strange kind of MMO ... althought it&apos;s an MMO with 100K players only 32 players can appear in the same instance. So for example no more than 32 human players will be visible to you in the same system. There have been some issues with match making, bugs that make wing members invisible and such. Yes there are bugs and issue, but all modern games have loads of them as they become more complex over the years to write and compile... so this will be the future issue of all next gen games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=5148978">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>If you are able to stand the grind to progress, and the continuous development process, then this is a great example of a space game. The flight mechanics feel great, and make combat about much more than just aiming fast. If you aren&apos;t convinced by the game at the moment, keep an eye on it as more time goes on for it to be developed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4832187">Expand</a></span>

<br>Fighting is done in various places in the game, it doesn&apos;t feel very consistent in that there are either a limited number of ships in your instance, or they continually spawn in, it can be fun but becomes a grind relatively quickly no matter where your doing it.
<br>
<br>Trading speaks for itself, unlike the X games however where trading seemed to have an effect on the stations, getting them to create new items over time, the Commodities market in Elite seems flat and lifeless, there is no crafting in this game by players or by the game world itself everything simply exists, so trading is a means of moving stuff from A to B endlessly trying to make a profit while doing so.
<br>
<br>Mining is a sub set of trading, as there is no crafting or manufacturing aspect to this &apos;mmo&apos; you simply sell what you mine, no depth here. fly to asteroids shoot them scoop chunks, currently its less intuitive than if you could get out the space ship with a pickaxe.
<br>
<br>Exploration has the most depth for me, you have enough star system to explore the galaxy is massive, if all you need is the variety of space itself to keep you entertained you&apos;ll enjoy this aspect of the game, although it doesn&apos;t necessarily have much depth in itself, its a matter of going out scanning planets and star and returning to civilisation with the data.
<br>
<br>Basically I feel its potential but Elite: Dangerous doesn&apos;t really do anything new, the cockpits are nice to look at, space is great, the detail and sound are top notch, but there is barely an mmo here and barely a game I would consider playing for more than a couple of hours every other day. No matter what profession you do in Elite it doesn&apos;t not feel like a grind toward a new ship.
<br>
<br>If your the kind of person that is happy just exploring space from a first person perspective, uninterested in too many complex game features and player impact, you&apos;ll like it, there are plenty of places to visit in the galaxy and plenty of nice vistas to find.
<br>
<br>If you want a deep complex sand box mmo similar to Eve online, you will not find it in Elite, they both try to achieve similar things that is a breathing universe, although Elite is a far cry from the intricacies that gives Eve its notorious wrap for having a extremely steep learning curve. and depth/synergy with the professions.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ll Score the game a 7, and put it on Par with what X3:TC is sitting at on this site, which i think is fair, although X3:TC or AP, are currently the deeper games of the 2, what elite has is better fidelity and sound mostly, but less player control no empire building which directly results in basically less things to do to keep the game feeling grindy. Elite: Dangerous is not a terrible game its simply not a very deep one, although as time goes by it hopefully will grow depth to bring it in line with X3 or Eves longevity/complexity.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=5164112">Expand</a></span>

<br>Although there are a lot of things that are not yet fully finished and makes me feel that I payed 40&#x20AC; for product not yet finished. The universe is beautiful but it feels like it is mostly dead, and as far as there are community goals that are bringing the game back to life a bit there&apos;s still not really that much to do. There is no planetary landing (yet) and no first person module (yet) which in Star Citizen (SC dev &apos;s had much more money and the game is not released but still) will be already implemented on release. Nonetheless it is a good game that can bring up a lot of fun if you are not against a continuous repeating the same scheme all over again. I would also love to say that after adding needed expansions and some more polishing it will be perfect space sim but right now it deserves 7/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=5076842">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>since freelancer i&apos;m waiting for a game like that and this could be it...almost.
<br>the best thing about this game is the atmosphere. there is no other game where you feel like a real space pilot like this. on the bad side are the quests which are for the most parts pretty boring, repetitive and sometimes just really hard to complete without getting an appropriate reward.</span>

Still some bugs to be dealt with mainly with alternate missions. Games hangs up from time to time. 6 is the best I can give ED right now.</span>

FD has released a good platform (if MP works OK with release that is) to build upon and they have said they will build upon it. To be fair atm I would give it a 6 but future improvements could make this a 8 or 9.</span>

<br>
<br>Graphically: It is beautiful.
<br>
<br>Depth: I&apos;m still sinking and I am 6 months in. You can role as combat, trader or explorer and that is only down to ship loadout and option, not a class selection. Freeform is the word of the day.
<br>
<br>Playability: Expect a steep learning curve and remember that the forums are your friend. I use a HOTAS, keyboard and mouse. To be fair, I&apos;m currently saving for a Wookie co-pilot.
<br>
<br>My only negative is that because the play space is so vast you may forget it is an MMO at times. Exploring is a lonely business, but combat if gritty and intense. Don&apos;t expect to dock at a station with a nice cutscene sequence, you land that ship yourself, controlling all aspects of your ship position.
<br>
<br>Anyone with less that a few weeks in game experience writing reviews is simply not qualified, and so their opinion should be immediately discounted.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=5142900">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The missions are randomized and based off templates, so you&apos;ll see the same mission pop up at different stations with a different item to acquire, or person to kill.
<br>
<br>Unlike the X series of games, each planet/star only has ONE station in it. And there&apos;s only a small handful of station designs. So while there are literally billions of systems to visit, they all seem the same.
<br>
<br>Right now the esthetics, visuals and controls of the game feel FINISHED, and really nicely refined. It feels *really* good to fly especially with a nice joystick system. However the content is painfully lacking. I&apos;ve spent a LOT of time grinding, doing research on best trading runs and making lots of credits, but I actually have nothing to buy with all these credits.
<br>
<br>- I can&apos;t make a fleet
<br>- I can&apos;t build a station
<br>- I can&apos;t make my own empire
<br>- Very, very limited number of equipment/customizations to buy for my ship
<br>- and even if I could customize my ship the way I wanted, I can&apos;t even see it from the exterior, except in &quot;outfitting mode&quot;
<br>
<br>As far as a trader is concerned, all I can do is just buy a bigger ship, and continue... grinding with absolutely no end point. And when I get the &quot;elite&quot; trader status, then what?
<br>
<br>Ok, but we do have a REALLY fantastic sandbox right now. So I&apos;m just hoping this was planned by the developers to release the &quot;heart&quot; of the game so to speak, by a series of expansion packs. I do sincerely hope there is something amazing planned to input into this cool world, because it has amazing potential.
<br>
<br>Right now unfortunately, feels pointless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4849973">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>positives
<br>1. I like the combat and exploration system.
<br>2 graphics are great.
<br>3 ship handling
<br>4. Rift + track ir support magnificent
<br>5. they convey nicely the feeling of the unknown- unexplored . especially within meteor fields
<br>
<br>sadly the disadvantages are many
<br>1. game is a shell = no real missions= you are paying for an always online beta version....NOT a full game
<br>2. while the need for always online it is not an MMO= no interaction with other players
<br>3. GAME SERVERS MOT STABLE, NOT POSSIBLE TO PLAY WHEN YOU WANT...
<br>4. bad support
<br>

<br>If you see reviews giving 0/10 then you know you&apos;ve found one of the disgruntled offline players. Did Frontier handle that whole thing well? No. However those are not reviews anymore, just revenge attacks.
<br>
<br>Yes it&apos;s online only at the moment. Don&apos;t buy if you live on an oil rig with no internet connection. It&apos;s annoying that the developers basically keep all the stellar data on their servers and you need to have internet connection for the game to know what stellar bodies to generate, but that doesn&apos;t make Elite a 0/10 game. Not by a long shot.
<br>
<br>Elite Dangerous is an amazingly beautiful, if troubled game. The feeling of space flight has been nailed in a way that competitors will struggle to match for some time. Space really does feel big, you&apos;re not restricted to a cubical &quot;mission area&quot;, Space is also pretty empty, but when you do get close to planets, gas giants, stars or even black holes, Elite turns into the most beautiful space game to date. There are entire websites dedicated to collecting the best screenshots from the game, and for good reason. And then you stare into space and wait for your frameshift drive to take you to a station that&apos;s quite some distance away, doing nothing. Well, almost, for there&apos;s pirates pulling you out of frameshift. But there can be stretches of boredom.
<br>
<br>Sound design is simply 10/10, hands down. The entire idea of your ship &quot;generating&quot; sounds for your situational awareness instantly solves any of the &quot;sounds in space&quot; issues, and the first time someone shatters your cockpit glass you&apos;ll hold your breath instinctively.
<br>
<br>The overall stability is good. There&apos;s a constant stream of patches with both bugfixes and major new features. Multiplayer is a bit hit and miss, with the peer-to-peer networking sometimes causing problems. These days it works most of the time, but it&apos;s still spotty at times.
<br>
<br>The controls are perfect. The ships are huge and have significant mass, and the game feels like it. You&apos;re not turning on a dime in Elite, since even the smaller ships are the size of a small house, and the bigger ones get up to half a kilometer long. And that without even counting the non-controllable capital ships that are several kilometers long and announce themselves with one of the most amazing warp-in effects you&apos;ve ever seen in a game.
<br>
<br>Oh and you don&apos;t need a joystick for this game, many people including myself are happily playing with keyboard and mouse.
<br>
<br>Why is this only 8/10? Because once you&apos;ve mastered the various activities, you realize that a lot of the long-term motivation is still missing. We&apos;ve had a big update recently that does help and turns Elite into a great Coop experience, but it clearly needs more actual content, more activities to do.
<br>
<br>Luckily Frontier is working on new feature updates and there&apos;s even (paid) expansions adding a first person mode as well as multicrewing and flying and landing on planets coming up.
<br>
<br>As it is, Elite is not a 10/10 game. That said, it could end up being a 10/10 in the future, and it is wholly recommended in it&apos;s current form. It will definitely entertain you longer than any CoD game. Elite is a deeply atmospheric game with slightly spotty networking but extremely polished combat and controls. You will have a lot of &quot;wow&quot; moments, and the next feature update isn&apos;t too far away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=5140241">Expand</a></span>

<br>(Previous review)
<br>Giving this a grudging FIVE for now, as I&apos;ve only been playing for a couple of weeks. I&apos;ll come back later and update after another week or so.
<br>What I can say is that NO WAY IS THIS WORTH 10/10 AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW!
<br>There are just too many bugs, and mechanisms that don&apos;t work as they should. Well, I&apos;m praying they aren&apos;t working as they should, cuz if this is how they have designed it then God help us.
<br>Had some fun, but it&apos;s hard to find sometimes. Frontier are gonna have to release some damn good stuff very soon or players are gonna bail.
<br>Hey, the 5 is for potential. Will have to see.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4973439">Expand</a></span>

All you got by now is a framework of 400 billion star systems which are just generic and empty (automatically created). Generic missions that are extremely boring with over 90% travel time (hours), everywhere the same. The same 3 station models in every system. Only a few available ships and little equipment. There is close to no content next to this. So at the moment only dreamers and roleplayers actually find what they want.
<br>
<br>And instead of adding the missing content, they offer you the next big update for the price of a full game!!!
<br>
<br>Plus the forum moderators are very agressive if you talk about that on either steam or frontier forum. They ban you on steam forum for fake reasons if you don&apos;t shut up when they tell you to, and remove your valid comments. This is pure fascism.
<br>
<br>The name David Braben now seems to stand for exploitation and fraud. Very saddening.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4859377">Expand</a></span>

The systems have no character, nothing to set them apart. The ships and equipment don&apos;t, either, while we&apos;re at it. The missions are repetitive, and players have no impact on the world. The AI is limited at best, and I&apos;m having a really hard time figuring out why I should launch the game again. I want it to be great, I really do, and I&apos;m hopeful that it will be.

<br>Have seen some small bugs, but nothing game spoiling. Sure, it is shallow exactly on a level with the previous Elites ,and the multi-player aspects are lacking. But as I expected Elite, it is exactly that and does it brilliantly. I just love the atmosphere, sounds, fighting and mainly, the immersion. Only thing I&apos;m concerned is the current difficulty-level: once you know how to fly well, the npcs are way too easy. I hope there will be harder challenges in the updates.
<br>At the core, gameplay-wise, it feels like a Euro Truck -simulator in the emptiness of the deep space, spiced with optional combat. If that sounds like your thing, it is really good. But right now, if you&apos;re looking for deep story, complicated multi-player experience or anything else than straightforward space-flight-simulation - better wait for the updates and expansions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4849775">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve played Elite: Dangerous for a few hours now, and the graphics look amazing, the sound is great but the gameplay is semi-repetitive which I can understand, as I&apos;ve just only started playing. I hope the gameplay will change up a bit after a few more hours. For now, it&apos;s been something like this. Step one, get to a station. Step two, get a delivery mission.

<br>
<br>Pros:
<br>
<br>+ Beautiful graphics and sound.
<br>
<br>+ Flight - you have pitch, roll, yaw and four directions of thrust, and a choice between the default flight assist mode where the ship does more-or-less what you&apos;d expect, and &quot;flight assist off&quot; where it behaves in the crazy way objects in space actually behave.
<br>
<br>+ Combat - a variety of weapons, ships and tactics, and everything from one-on-one encounters to massive PvP+PvE battles that go on for weeks.
<br>
<br>+ The galaxy as your sandbox.
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>
<br>- Although its better than the release version, it needs to develop multiplayer a lot more, though the latest version does have &quot;wings&quot; (i.e., combat teams). Teams and events tend to be organised via the forums or social media; this should be integrated into the game.
<br>
<br>- While player actions do affect the universe, the devs need to tweak this to work much better. Of course the actions of one player can&apos;t have a major effect on the fate of empires, or even most star systems, but there need to be certain tipping points where a system could go either way depending on what players do. One thing people like about games is the idea that their character is going to make a difference.
<br>
<br>- The universe is kind of homogeneous. Types of government need to have more effect on how business is done, starports need to look more different from each other, there should be rare local commodities, weird religions you can get on the wrong side of - in short, different cultures.
<br>
<br>- Missions are generally obtain/transport/destroy one-offs, with tiny incremental effects on your reputation. They need to feed into each other more.
<br>
<br>Procons (i.e., things some people will hate and others may not be bothered by or even like)
<br>
<br>* There&apos;s no back-story for characters or an overarching story line. You start as a blank slate, and if you&apos;re not careful, you&apos;ll continue as one.
<br>
<br>* Space is big. That&apos;s an advantage in many ways, but it does mean you won&apos;t run into many other players outside a few popular (and hence dangerous) locations. Sometimes nothing much happens - you can spend a long time just travelling from one place to another. It used to annoy me, and it&apos;s a deal-breaker for some people, but now I kind of enjoy the change of pace.
<br>
<br>* There are few limits on PvP. If some guy with an Anaconda (the biggest ship) feels like blowing your little Sidewinder out of the sky, there&apos;s nothing to stop them except the prospect of their bounty increasing, which tends not to deter pirates who have Anacondas. Even NPC fights can be absurdly one-sided (hint: don&apos;t investigate anything that says &quot;Strong signal source&quot;). On the plus side, you get more of a sense of danger from the game, which leads us to  ...
<br>
<br>* Real penalties for dying. Your ship is insured, but you&apos;ll lose a lot of money, all your cargo and even cartographic information (but not any bounties on your head, unfortunately). Some people hate this; I find it adds to the excitement. Fight or flight is a serious choice.
<br>
<br>* It&apos;s difficult. You&apos;ll spend a long time just learning how to fly your ship, and it&apos;ll be a while before you can enter a combat zone and survive more than a few seconds. Personally I like that it&apos;s difficult, but I agree with criticisms of the learning curve. The game needs proper tutorials that talk you through things, not a few basic solo missions and links to YouTube videos.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=5092800">Expand</a></span>

It makes for a perfect Oculus Rift title thanks to it&apos;s stunning visuals, immense sense of scale and beautiful audio.
<br>
<br>tl;dr - Current state of the game: Grind credits to buy bigger ships so that you can grind credits better. Graphics &amp; Gameplay has been improved over the original Elite (1984), but content has stayed the same (unless you count the 400 billion empty, lifeless, procedural star systems).
<br>
<br>Elite Dangerous will be a great game in another year or two. I have little doubt of that. However, as of the writing of this review, Elite is almost entirely unplayable. The foundations for a great game are all there, but there&apos;s little to keep players interested.
<br>
<br>Mining, exploration, combat and trading are the only activities currently open to players. You can either do any of these activities on your own, or you can accept a generic mission and do them for an npc you&apos;ll never meet or interact with. With exception to combat, all these systems are basic and repetitive.
<br>
<br>While there is a dynamic economy in the game, trading is hardly complicated when compared to that of games like X3 or EVE. You buy low, and you sell high. The only excitement comes in the form of random pirate and police attacks. You can observe changes in the economy, but, unless you enjoy watching numbers go up and down, I doubt you&apos;ll find this exciting.
<br>
<br>Exploration involves flying to new systems and pointing yourself at &apos;undiscovered&apos; celestial objects &amp; stations. You won&apos;t be stumbling into any ship graveyards or sentient nebulae. There are no surprises here and, unless you&apos;re an astronomer looking to observe binary stars &amp; black holes, you probably won&apos;t find this very exciting either.
<br>
<br>Mining is even simpler. You find asteroids and you shoot at them. Maybe you&apos;ll get attacked by a pirate, maybe you won&apos;t. Combat, on the other hand, feels great and intuitive. The game&apos;s audio and HUD are highly immersive and really shine in combat. Unfortunately you&apos;ll most often find yourself fighting against AI due to the whole 400 billion star systems thing.
<br>
<br>There is no concrete system that promotes team-play, and you&apos;ll probably make more money fighting NPC&apos;s rather than players. The games selection of ships is also rather limited when compared to other titles (and they all look like geometric shapes).
<br>
<br>The biggest problem with the game right now is the fact that there is no end-game. There&apos;s nothing to strive for. You may set personal goals, like visiting a distant system or getting a certain ship, but, at the heart of it, everything you do ends with you making credits in order to make credits better.
<br>
<br>The living world is entirely a novelty, and will almost never directly impact you. You may have to go to another system to buy cheap goods, or you might note the presence of more police ships, but this will never make a significant impact on the way you play the game. You will never feel like you&apos;re doing something important. There is a giant disconnect between the world of the NPC&apos;s and the world of the players.
<br>
<br>There is a giant intergalactic war being waged, but unless you force yourself to care it&apos;s really of no consequence to you. You can&apos;t interact with NPC&apos;s, so there&apos;s very little to connect you to the troubles of the poor populace of miners living on some rock. You might visit a planet with billions of inhabitants, but the space around it will feel just as empty and lifeless as the distant reaches of the galaxy.
<br>
<br>So, all of this leaves you to motivate yourself. Sure, you can try to join one of the galactic empires and lead them to victory, but what&apos;s the point? No NPC will thank you, unless it comes in the form of a giant wall of text available as a generic contract in a space station. You won&apos;t get a limited edition ship, nor will you get the joy of watching or participating in any giant cinematic battles. There&apos;s no sense of urgency or need to drive you forward.
<br>
<br>All you have to do, is to make credits so that you can get upgrades simply for the sake of getting upgrades. The foundations for a great game are all there, but to call this release ready is a joke. I highly advice new players stay away from Elite until more content is added. I&apos;ve honestly had more fun playing the Star Citizen alpha than I have playing the release-candidate version of Elite.
<br>
<br>To put it into contrast, imagine an X3 with better graphics and combat. Now imagine that you can&apos;t control more than one ship. That NPC&apos;s don&apos;t have a voice and communicate through text. That there is no single player story. That all space stations serve only one purpose. That you never see any other ships unless you&apos;re in combat or docking. That you can&apos;t own space stations. That exploration only leads to you finding floating credits. And, well, the list goes on...</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4829382">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I have been playing since mid-beta and can see why it is not for everyone. But there is one factor that keeps me coming back:
<br>
<br>It&apos;s not Eve. I don&apos;t have to spend my time playing by other people&apos;s rules. I can have fights with other players and not worry about a million other players turning up and zapping me. I can do my own thing.
<br>
<br>If you want Eve fork out your 10 quid a month and stay away with your tedious griefer buddies. Sit around in space stations all night doing nothing except talking because you are too scared to leave and might start having to play the game.
<br>
<br>The graphics are amazing and although gameplay can be repetitive, that&apos;s the nature of computer games.
<br>
<br>A few points get knocked off because missions don&apos;t work tremendously well. I would like to be able to complete them without having NPC pilots trying to bribe me all the time and then having the whole thing cancelled because I hit the wrong button.
<br>
<br>The nerd in me admires the attempt to create a Milky Way copy in the game. There&apos;s no way of telling whether or not it&apos;s accurate but I like the point it makes about the vastness of space.
<br>
<br>In conclusion I hope that Frontier keep pushing this thing forward and make some improvements, add a few more ships and perhaps add some more variety in terms of missions.
<br>
<br>I have spent a fair bit of money on this game and although it&apos;s been worth it, my VFM rating will go up if Frontier introduces developments such as landing on planets and walking around.
<br>
<br>So ratings are:
<br>
<br>Graphics 10/10
<br>
<br>Gameplay 7/10
<br>
<br>Sound 9/10
<br>
<br>Value for money: 6/10
<br>
<br>Overall 7/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4885176">Expand</a></span>

<br>You can&apos;t get away from it - the more honest reviews have nailed it.  It&apos;s a shallow, hollow, soulless game with little to offer apart from initially pleasing visuals and a good sound treatment.
<br>And everything DOES start to look the same, as you do the four things that you&apos;re allowed to.

I&apos;ve been a backer since alpha and was really sold on the vision that they had. Unfortunately, the game that was released is not the game I imagined it to be. If you were expecting an MMO, I hate to disappoint, but this is not an MMO in any sense of the word.
<br>
<br>Interacting with other players when not completely broken is almost impossible due to the sheer size of the universe. Although huge, I&apos;ve never played a game that has felt so empty. I imagined roaming the galaxy pirating and bounty-hunting other players in epic battles of wits, but I&apos;m lucky if I even see another player. Not to mention the hours upon hours of tedious grinding it takes to be even remotely equipped to do so.
<br>
<br>Playing with your friends is just impossible in the current version not only because the game lacks even the most basic of social tools, but because the game punishes you for playing with other players. Bounties are only awarded to the person with the last kill, missions are given and rewarded individually, you can&apos;t even see your friends half the time, multiplayer is just a downright mess.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t get me wrong, the game is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, and the sound design might be the best I&apos;ve ever heard in a video game. But great visuals and audio does not a game make. It&apos;s just a shame that the game design is so horrid. There is no story to speak of. Every mission follows the same of several archetypes: &quot;Kill this&quot;, &quot;Deliver that&quot;, &quot;Fetch this&quot;, etc. Missions are boring and feel as though there is no consequence, especially when you&apos;re offered the exact same mission seconds after turning it in.
<br>
<br>The actual gameplay is mind-numbingly grindy. Most MMOs get away with this because the grind is for a greater purpose, but in Elite the only reason to grind is so that you can grind some more. It kills what very little motivation I had to play the game in the first place. The combat is pretty good, but it&apos;s not enough to carry the game through.
<br>
<br>There is also so little in regards to depth it&apos;s absurd. There is an entire universe of systems, yet there is hardly any difference between the systems. The missions are the same, the factions are functionally the same, it&apos;s the same system over and over with a couple of variables tweaked along the way. Ships are &quot;customizable&quot; in that the more money you have the better your ship is. There are no side-grades to speak of except maybe weapons where really only 2 or 3 are actually viable.
<br>
<br>At the end of the day, the game is just disappointing. Modern graphics and stunning audio coupled with gameplay from the 80&apos;s. I think it&apos;s naive to say game design hasn&apos;t improved in the last 30 years, and it&apos;s a shame that this game decided that it didn&apos;t have to.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4846973">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It&apos;s difficult for me to explain why i like this game so much, i think it&apos;s because it makes me believe i&apos;m really there. let me describe to you just one of many moments i&apos;ve had since playing. iIm in a hauler, the Elite Dangerous equivalent of a transit van, and the engines whine and moan with every adjustment to my speed or direction, the cabin shakes as i boost forward, i set course for a ringed, gas-giant, i fly down toward the rings and they become asteroids, i zip between them and i&apos;m like a speck of dust. I kill my engines and sit there, so many stars out there, i could go and explore any of them, the giant planet looms in front of me, everything is dead silence, i actually feel fear at being so alone, but i also feel wonder at the sheer size of space.
<br>
<br>Ok so that&apos;s just me, but if that doesn&apos;t impress you then the fighting is awesome and the missions are horribly addictive, i just find myself sinking hour after hour into this game. ED is really cool now, albeit missing a load of stuff that we all want for it, if it gets those things in the coming few months i will upgrade my mark to a ten, because it&apos;s got more potential than a young Mike Tyson. A solid and well deserved 8 from me, a unique and beautiful experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4864175">Expand</a></span>

After seeing so many Youtube videos of Elite explorers I had to try it out and it has not disappointed. Black hole light distorsions, nebulae, oyu name it...  Being able to chase and combat wanted PC or NPC to know stars has no price.</span>

Been playing for a couple of weeks - graphics and sound are good at first.
BUT, all the star stations look the same, NPCS are dumb as rocks, so they are either boring or instantly kill you.

The in game tutorials are rubbish - enormously disjointed and assume far too much.  Rather than have in-game videos, you&apos;re flicked out of the game to YouTube to watch some video that again, assumes you know a heap of stuff as it proceeds to talk about &quot;basics&quot; that are not basic at all.
<br>
<br>There is obviously a solid game in here somewhere based on the number of positive reviews and if you have the patience to try and muddle through this minefield as a new player then you might find it.  As it is, keep your money - at least until they fix the new player experience (or if you&apos;re already versed in such wildly mystifying &quot;basics&quot;).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4864727">Expand</a></span>

<br>WRONG!
<br>The trading sim is pathetic, the missions are generic fetch quests, I can barely work up the enthusiasm to type a review here.
<br>Superficial and fake.  Instanced, grindy, boring.
<br>Tedious, punishing, and boring. Absolutely hate it and have deleted it.
<br>Enjoyed the graphics for the first week though.</span>

Elite Dangerous 1.0 is a framework, the fundamentals are there - trade, fight, mine, explore but it&apos;s lip-service. Having experienced the game&apos;s development from Kickstarter onwards, having insight into the development process via the Design Decision Forum and access to all builds from premium Alpha, it&apos;s fair to say that the release was premature. Features had to be dropped (postponed), the last month of development took on an almost panicked air, with as many elements being broken as were fixed.
<br>
<br>Fortunately the release candidate worked fairly well out of the &quot;box&quot;, I haven&apos;t experienced any game breaking issues and am still enjoying the experience - which is not a bad thing at all as having &quot;played&quot; for a year prior, I&apos;d be likely to feel entitled to a more jaded outlook - but I don&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Give it 6 months, and we may see the kind of game that it&apos;s potential implies, as it is, the release is worth a solid 7/10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4835688">Expand</a></span>

<br>Elite Dangerous was to offer me an ingame multi player experience which were not implemented on release. How a company can not even have a way in which players can communicate with each other in game is beyond me. The MMO side of this game does not exist.
<br>
<br>That aside, ED was enjoyable for the first week until one comes to realise the bugs, exploits and total lack of content available for a very expensive game just left me feeling defeated.
<br>Ship insurance? This is the worst idea since Everquest use to penalise players for deaths by removing hard earned exp. It is quite possible in Elit Dangerous to lose everything you have worked for in a matter of seconds, due to lag, poor NPC AI or just GTA griefers out to destroy your ship using hacks.
<br>Yes Elite dangerous is a new game, and the bones are very solid. Should FD waited a couple of months before releasing? Yes probably but the push for Christmas sales put it onto the shelves, so now they must contend with angry customers.
<br>There are some PVE group games available, but without the correct ingame chat/communication, it still feels like a lost cause.
<br>The current game is very tiresome and dull but does have massive potential. I just hope the Devs hurry up and fix what is already here because as far as I am concerned, it still feels like Beta testing to me.
<br>My biggest concern for ED and partly the reason why I was banned from the official forums was because I felt the only testers of this game were Flyboys, die hard fans of the original. So we ended up with an almost duplicate game from 1984 but with better graphics.
<br>You can&apos;t do this, a game needs to evolve, it needs to captivate its audience not suck their will to live ( try trade runs for 4 days straight ).
<br>Flyboys will tell you to experience all the game has to offer..... Right....
<br>If you are going to market a game as an MMO it neefds to up to the standards of what most expect an MMO to have. ED does not even have the basics of any MMO currently.
<br>
<br>I have high expectations for this game in the future, if you are thinking about buying this dont.
<br>Wait a few months, check in on reviews, there is just not enough to offer more than a couple weeks of excitement here and the patches seem to be creating more problems than they are fixing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4901635">Expand</a></span>

<br>HOTAS gear is not essential, I have played with mouse / keyboard since launch date - just bought a HOTAS set now for a change.
<br>The people giving this game a score of 0, after playing for weeks and then getting bored, are being rather mean-spirited I think - any game that you have played for weeks and enjoyed has been a good game I believe. Every game gets &quot;old&quot; after a while so it seems unfair to give E:D such a low score. I have played a lot of other great games for far fewer hours than I have spent in E:D and still considered it a good investment of my leisure time. Perhaps it is because E:D has no set &quot;end&quot; that people stop playing when they have got bored and some have only negative impressions at that point and have forgotten all the fun they had ? Whereas with other games once you have reached the &quot;end&quot; you can have a more positive closure experience.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=5102223">Expand</a></span>

What every nerd longs for, an open galaxy with endless possibilities. But thats not enough, not in a game with so many possibilities. This game is dying for a storyline, the game is thirsting for something more. But that something more isn&apos;t here yet. The game runs perfectly, if you think of perfect like driving around a parking lot that full, and nobody is leaving. The game itself seems so close to being done, close, but not done. Like a late beta, the meat isnt there yet, but it could show up sometime? Maybe? Who knows, because nobody has told me **** For whats there, the games fun, if you like unfinished games, this is the game for you. Oh, its not unfinished in a bad way, its unfinished in a good way. Like Star Citizen, its not done yet, but when it is, oh man... Your dick wont go down for days.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=5207543">Expand</a></span>

So far I&apos;ve put about 30 hours into it and I&apos;m not bored by any stretch of the imagination. Granted the game does look a little barren and some features are flat out missing like any form of player interactions (except maybe crashing at docking port - thanks guys for flying close to red light) but the foundation is pretty solid and what is in the game works really well. Looking at what the game has to offer in terms of ship customization has me a bit worried because choice of available guns and modules seems to be quite limited, scrolling through the station&apos;s inventory gets you a lot of things looking exactly the same but with a different price tag.

<br>And even the little content that it does have does not work.
<br>
<br>If you are thinking about buying this game, ask yourself, are you willing to spend the money you normally spend on a finished product on a product which is not even half done.
<br>
<br>Yes it has alot of star systems, however you can not do anything in more then 99% of these start systems.
<br>
<br>If you buy this product you are not buying a product, you are spending some money in the hope that 1 day the product might be up  to a standard normal people/developers might call &quot;ready to release&quot;.
<br>
<br>Don&apos;t get fooled when they say the scope of this game is huge, since this all depends on their future.
<br>If they decide to release this game on a console ( which i think they first intended ) the scope of this game gets alot smaller, since consoles are lesser platforms in terms of performance.
<br>Because at this moment already a playstation 4 has 2 year old hardware, after 1 or 2 years thats even older.
<br>So if they release this game on consoles they have to take this into account when they release new content.
<br>
<br>So all in all, think well before buying this game, i did and am not pleased with what i got.
<br>The game is far from finished or even in a state one would call beta, this game shows signs of not even beta testing at all.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4890221">Expand</a></span>

<br>1. Premium Alpha and Beta backers are discarded, not listened to and continually been ignored, since 2014.
<br>I paid $75.00 for Premium Beta, and according to Frontier, I do not qualify to own Horizons.  There are thousands of us, some paid over $140.00 and left in the ditch by Frontier Developments. They are fraudulent and money grabbers with a half baked product of something they call a game, and obviously they are not implementing any meaningful changes to the game, beside adding more places to do nothing (Horizons) for a full price of a new game.
<br>2. Anyone bought Elite: Dangerous previously and paid for the full product $49.99, must pay another $49.99 to own Horizons.  So, they have to buy twice the price, just to land on planets.
<br>3. Those who only buy Horizons, only have to pay $49.99 and essentially own both Elite:Dangerous and Horizons.
<br>Let alone the fact, that the base game  &quot;Elite:Dangerous&quot; continues to remain just a shell of a game, an empty void with barely any game play, beside auto-generated -spawned AI ships and completely non-functioning economy.  Despite the raving reviews a year ago, the game has not evolved, beside a few additional gameplay elements, which has not changed much the game.
<br>You can kill thousands of ships, it will not make any meaningful (nobody is getting weaker or stronger) changes in the game world.
<br>You can trade thousands of items all across the systems, nobody is getting richer or poorer, beside you, and your reward is, that you can buy a bigger ship and do the same mindless/meaningless truck driver job or arcade shooter.
<br>
<br>The &quot;Horizons&quot; addon, let&apos;s you land on planets with no atmosphere, but not even all.
<br>
<br>Please, tell me if this is a fair business practice.
<br>Even the most criticized EA Incorp. with its endless addons and expansions to their core games don&apos;t do this.
<br>If you buy - for example - Battlefield 4 (core), for $49.99, your expansion of your pick will not cost another $49.99, and they aren&apos;t only adding another rifle to shoot with.
<br>Following Frontier Developments&apos; money grabber practices of the past- my predictions:
<br>- You will be able to land on planets with atmospheres (sometime in 2016) for additional $20.00 for Horizon owners.  Elite:Dangerous owners (if they still havent deserted this empty shell of nothing)  must pay another $70.00  to own Horizons with &quot;Elite: Atmosphere&quot; upgrade.
<br>-You will be able to land on gas giants for addititional ($20.00) for Horizon owners,  or you can get a Gold-Platinum-Game of The Year (no doubt the reviewers will hype it again, with a whole-total of 5 mins of gameplay)  full package of Elite:Dangerous Horizons Atmospheric Gas Giant Edition for as little as $95.00.
<br>
<br>Previous Elite:Dangerous owners with no Horizons upgrade must pay an addtional $120.00 to enjoy Horizons+Atmospheric Landing+Gas Giants super package.

<br>
<br>The Interface is not mouse driven in menus. You have to use keyboard controls which is not intuitive seeing how you used the mouse to navigate the menus before the game launched. The interface has to be instinctual and natural to the majority of PC users. This means the Mouse. The interface is a Vital component as it should be background and thoughtless. Just a smooth interraction to get through so you can play the game. It isn&apos;t... It&apos;s awkward. You cannot use your mouse in the various menus. When you are in the system map and click on a station you do not get options like &quot;set destination&quot; or anything. You have to use your keyboard as if you were playing an old 286 computer computer game. The galaxy map you can click on things and a pop-up menu does come up but it is so sensitive that trying to mouse over to the options closes it more often than successfully choosing an option. Interface -3
<br>
<br>Graphics are pretty good. They are by no means Amazing. I have settings on Ultra and run it on a 60hz 4k monitor. They never made me go &quot;WOW&quot; they were just pleasing. Score: +2
<br>
<br>the ships are kind blah. Just wedges that look kind of dated. Put up against the environmental graphics the ships look drab... Score: +0
<br>
<br>Controls: They are complicated. This is a steep learning curve. If you have just a mouse and keyboard you have to fool around with the controls for quite some time to get anything resembling intuitive controls to fly with. Score:-1
<br>
<br>Manual everything: Docking is a pain in the butt. Apparently after you play the game for a while you can buy a computer to automatically dock... but if you have played the game long enough you may just like manual docking and not want the computer to do it for you... I don&apos;t know why the auto-dock computer isn&apos;t a starting item and you can save ship resources by taking it out later on... It&apos;s easy to miss the spot you have to land on, you get warnings by the station to MOVE NOW OR YOU WILL BE SHOT, you accidentally press a button to deploy hard-points and your guns deploy. You were just fined. Score: -1
<br>
<br>Navigation: It&apos;s ok, you have to adjust the mouse sensitivity and dead-zones to improve this, and if you don&apos;t know what these are because you&apos;re new to games like this.. You&apos;re SOL. Some planets don&apos;t even show up on the system map because they are tethered to another planet.. Nothing explains this, you have to figure it out on your own. The ships seem sluggish, and you have to fool around with Pitch, Yaw and roll to get something you like, again if you are unfamiliar with what this means, you&apos;re again, SOL. Score -1
<br>
<br>Tutorials: Not very helpful at all. This game assumes you are experienced before you play. It assumes you&apos;re an existing backer. It assumes you&apos;ve played the original game. It seems that without a HOTAS or Joystick set-up the game puts you at an initial disadvantage. Buying a new HID before you experience the game is asking a lot. New Player experience Score -2
<br>
<br>I tried going back to this game, and I couldn&apos;t... It&apos;s just so boring. I had to drop my score by another point. -1
<br>
<br>I really want space games on the PC to make a come-back. I didn&apos;t back the game, and I wanted to try it once it was released. I bought the game, and my experience has not been that positive at all. I showed the game to some friends. they were not that interested in picking it up after seeing how much micro-management is required at the start of the game. I can see micro-management of all the details giving efficiencies and advantages once you become more familiar with the game, but it seems that you have to deal with all this right out of the box and can earn money and buy stuff later to reduce the micromanagement..... Strange..... The community generally says &quot;we want a complex game. So get out of here&quot; I&apos;m sure I&apos;d want a more complex game as well, once I have sunk my teeth into it... but not right out of the box...
<br>
<br>I can&apos;t in good conscience recommend this game to anyone other than the initial backers.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4838539">Expand</a></span>

You play a solo character who is a small time pilot with a spaceship. You can play in several different ways. You can engage in combat, in trade between solar systems, explore new systems or mine asteroids. You can do one, some or all of these, but you don&apos;t HAVE to do any of them.  I think this is one of the best aspects of the game because it allows for different types of people to enjoy the game. Some people aren&apos;t good at combat. In some games, that rules out the whole game, but in this game, you can prosper in the game without firing a shot and often the occasional attacker by avoiding &apos;bad neighborhoods&apos; and running away.  With 400 billion solar systems, there&apos;s space for a lot of different people.
<br>
<br>I also like it&apos;s emphasis on space travel as a thing in itself, where you need to plot courses, take fuel into account and navigate around starts and planets in order maintain the best speed.  Space flight is not simply a thing between battles, it&apos;s a thing itself.  Because Elite Dangerous is more than just a first person shooter in space, there is considerable learning curve at first, and there can be a good deal of time between combats (although you can always find them if you spend time with the game to find out how).  It&apos;s a space game and not a shooter with space as a skin.
<br>
<br>When I see criticisms of it being &quot;boring&quot;, it usually boils down to people having an expectation that it&apos;s solely a combat game (it&apos;s not) or it&apos;s a &apos;conquer and rule the galaxy&apos; game which it&apos;s not as well. It&apos;s better to think of it like a &quot;Firefly The Game&quot; game where your focus is to trade and do missions to keep yourself flying, rather than conquer a planet and build a private empire. That&apos;s not something you can do.  If people expect it to be something it;&apos;s not ,  that&apos;s when I see complaints.  Might as well complain that crossword puzzles have no guns.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=5085070">Expand</a></span>

<br>That said, the mechanics of the game are fantastic, the groundwork for a truly exceptional game are most definitely there to be built upon, Frontier in my honest opinion cannot take their eye off the ball and MUST keep churning out new content and by this I mean a lot more than setting up the odd conflict zone or manipulating the legality of certain mushrooms. Things like planetary landings and being able to walk around your ship etc are all well and good but these shouldn&apos;t be the things Frontier Development concentrate on imho they need to focus very heavily on content such as multi-player tools, additional ships and variety, the milkyway isn&apos;t as simple as a copy and paste solar systems which for all intense and purposes may as well be the same ones over and over making exploration as much fun as packing fruit on a conveyor belt.
<br>
<br>As it stands Elite Dangerous is an awesome game trapped inside a very good game, it just needs to be encouraged to mature properly, and seeing as offline mode is history now this development is solely in the hands of Frontier Development.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4879527">Expand</a></span>

<br>This Elite Dangerous is a really cool game. I already spent a lot of time on beta/ gamma.

Immersion !
Exploration, trade, fight, mining,  Each module is working really nicely and the bunch of ships available deserve it ! And there is of course a tons of mission relative to your stuff and specialization.
Buy &amp; stuff your ship to specialize it or keep it</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Hello commanders !

<br>Buy &amp; stuff your ship to specialize it or keep it versatile, it is your choice :)
<br>Everything is working fine and there is a lot to discover in the game.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>Multiplayer !!!!!!!! seriously this game is sold as an &apos;MMO&apos; like game but actually there is absolutely nothing to do with your friends.
<br>
<br>It is really hard to meet friends (you don&apos;t know where they are) and even more hard to try to do something with them... No coop mission, no PVE (except conflict zone but it is really boring), no convoy escort for example etc...
<br>
<br>Just don&apos;t buy it if you don&apos;t like to play Solo, wait for early next year, the multiplayer part called &quot;wings&quot; will be added.
<br>
<br>-3 points because of this, it looks unacceptable to sold a multiplayer game without multiplayer stuff !!
<br>
<br>Otherwise, all good !</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4820014">Expand</a></span>

An outsider looking in will not see a sandbox (if you can call it that), at best the game is a sandcastle beach, where you are merely a bystander.  At worst, the game is a barren desert, one which you are free to play in.  It is an open world, but it is an empty world and one which players can play little to no real part except with ever watchful approval of Frontier.
<br>
<br>If you can somehow not tire of doing the same old repetitive missions or doing the old repetitive trading, mining or &quot;exploration&quot; then good for you. I however expect something more from a game of revolutionary scope than to just provide me the bare minimum of paltry amusements.  Not to mention that it takes everything that is annoying about online games and removes all of the benefits, leaving just the always online, unpausible and constantly running mission timers.  It provides no social features, little interaction with others without a lot of effort and has a game breaking approach to player conflict which rewards rage quitting and disconnecting by removing you from these difficult situations at your leisure. Just quit and reload and you&apos;re fine.
<br>
<br>At the same time, it provides a basic and simplistic singleplayer approach to a space game, all the travel, all of the grind, with little reward or acknowledgement.  You will hear a lot of comments about using your imagination in the forums, to which I respond that I did not pay good money to a developer for a pretty backdrop for doing nothing but imagine.
<br>
<br>At the moment, it&apos;s release state is a framework of a game, with glaring issues and nonsensical design choices around every turn.  This is a great shame as it has a lovely amount of potential, it&apos;s galaxy is mind boggling and gorgeous, it&apos;s combat is quite entertaining, if infrequent and unrewarding. The game engine is polished and stable, but without content and any semblance of immersion and interaction then there is no point.  Nothing you do matters beyond what Frontier actively allows, it is not a malleable sandbox, it is reduced to a glorified Elite museum.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4871832">Expand</a></span>

<br>This is not however to everyone&apos;s taste and if you prefer a standard &quot;go here, do this, then go there and kill that&quot; style of play, you may find this is not the game for you.
<br>

Some people have been waiting for more than 27 days for a refund after Frontier broke the promise to make it an offline only game. They have stopped all communication with the customers who have been requesting refunds. Those customers are also being treated like criminals, and like they are trying to abuse the system.
<br>
<br>The game is incomplete, it features very little of the actual promised features and everything has a little star next to it saying this will only be added post-release. It took my friend and me 8 hours to reach each other because the game does not allow you to specify your start location and does not offer any fast-travel methods. That&apos;s also a post-release &quot;promise&quot;.
<br>
<br>Because the game has always-online DRM the future of the game is entirely in their hands and you never actually own the game yourself. If they pull the plug on the servers tomorrow all your money and time is gone. Due to the high cost of the servers I would not be surprised if the game is F2P in 6 months to a year.
<br>
<br>Their EULA also allows them to add in-game advertising...
<br>
<br>It&apos;s actually a 7 or a 8 game, but I can&apos;t give them a score like that with the way that they are treating their customers. and for the reasons listed above.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4834590">Expand</a></span>

Well i am here to tell you, that is only true if your way happens to coincide with the way the developers play. There is a glaring sense of selfishness in the development of the game that has turned out for the worse upon release. It is, as others have said, a shell of a game. There are some great flight mechanics and wonderful graphics holding up a flimsy grind fest that lacks any depth or character or content or multiplayer or anything that would make it an actual game. Elite: &quot;Dangerous&quot; is basically a space flight simulator minus the simulation.
<br>
<br>Just to give you some history, i backed the game when it was in closed beta and have played for a few hundred hours and have done everything the &quot;game&quot; has to offer. So i want to try to give you a quick run down of the features they are ADVERTISING without all the marketing fluff to hide what you will really be getting.
<br>
<br>&quot;Play Your Way&quot;- unless you want to be a solo trader, this is the biggest lie you will find in the descriptions of the game on their website. you will not play your way unless your way is- playing alone mostly and almost never seeing another real player while trading and trading and trading and trading again to have any hope of having enough money to &quot;Play Your Way&quot;
<br>
<br>Combat- first the website will make it sound like there is great PvP bounty hunting to be had in tandem with difficult PvE. I can tell you that there mostly certainly is not any of that. What you will get is news updates at stations for bounties on players you will never see. you will probably see Jesus Christ in this game before you take down a player bounty. The AI in the game is terrible and so easy to kill or escape from that they serve as nothing more than a waste of time. However if you do happen to take some damage or lose an engagement in anything but a stock starter ship, the cost is so astronomical that your immersion will be broken the moment your read the total. When you combine this with the extremely poor pay outs for combat, what you get is a fundamentally flawed risk vs reward system in terms of combat roles.
<br>
<br>Exploration- exploration consists of pointing your ship at astral bodies that are &quot;undiscovered&quot; then trying to get to a system as far away from your discovery as possible to sell it. basically it is information trading for sightseers with a small profit margin than standard trading. i will take this time to say that, if your goal is to explore a 1:1 representation of the milky way and nothing more- this game is perfect for you.
<br>
<br>Trading-&quot;your every trade contributes to the dynamic market activity&quot;. the trading system is a static, one-note system that equates to little more than &quot;easy win mode&quot;. of course there is nothing to WIN in ED, but what you can do is make money and trading is the easiest way (and i mean painfully easy) to do that. there is no economic simulation in place and you will never have a noticeable effect on any market. the worst of it all is that they do not tell you that there were exploits during the &quot;gamma&quot; phase of the game and they did not wipe any players prior to the 1.0 release. so you will be playing with players in 50 million+ credit ships who are multi billionaires. I am not sure how much the last part matters because, again, you will NEVER see them anyway.
<br>
<br>Factions- the faction rep system is broken as far as i know but even when it is working  it does not provide any tapestry or color to your world in ED. all factions are just letters on a screen in a station telling you to do more boring stuff for hours so you can gain rep (broken) and do slightly less boring stuff for slightly more money. when i got this game i said &quot;finally, i can be like boba fett and do merc work for the empire&quot;, then on Dec 16th i started the game in a turd of a ship deep in Federation space 200 light years away from the empire&apos;s capital. it took me 3 hours to fly to the outskirts of imperial space. this is not playing MY way.
<br>
<br>Now, i know what you are thinking- &quot;this has a pretty decent meta score and i totally LOVE space sims&quot;. Well, i love space sims and rely heavily on feedback from the pc gaming community when making purchases. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE SEMI POSITIVE REVIEWS HERE. The Elite community is filled with the most blind and relentless fan boys one will ever encounter. If you would like to put what i am saying to the test then simply register for a forum account and attempt to post some useful criticism of the game. Before you know it you will be trampled by the horses of a thousand ED white knights and the keyboard punches of mighty neck bearded fan boys. You can attribute the reviews here to a small portion of those gray bushed and naive super fans. The reality is the game is 1 year away from being complete at best and even then i have little faith in the creator and lead dev and their ability to make this game work for a contemporary community.

Elite has that &quot;just want to play for a few more minutes until it is 4:00 in the morning factor&quot;.  While more content is needed it is fun as it is and Frontier  is hard at work with addition free content and eventually paid add ons, such as first person and planet landing.  I highly recommend Elite Dangerous.</span>

Its a challenging game (im playing using a regular KB+M config, and it took me around 10 hours of in game time to be a decent pilot who can land, launch engage without fail), mainly because of its gameplay which is very complex ( you cant land on a space platform for example without asking for permition first, and you must go to the landing pad assigned to your ship otherwise your ship will be attacked and most likely destroyed), the grinding at first its a little bit boring since you only start with 1000 in game credits, a very weak spaceship and many things you have to figure out either by watching youtube videos or searching the forum since the in game tutorials are very basic. For me at least its a great game that would evolve in the future (now it has only the features of the first Elite released in 1984, later they will add more things that are found in Elite 2, and other space sims like landing on planets, more freedom to exploration etc. At this point it has a decent amount of bugs but if you enjoyed space sims before you would enjoy this game too. (also the voice control commands work like a charm).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4863262">Expand</a></span>

<br>But, we&apos;re waiting for expansions like getting out of your ship, landing on planets etc. Don&apos;t play with mouse and keyboard, a gamepad is fine, HOTAS maybe better. Oculus RIft-ready, they say. Also, this is a very long game, will take ages to get the biggest ships and upgrade them. Likewise in changing politics of a system. This game puts you as a space-ship-owning nobody amongst 400 billion star systems. Can&apos;t be the hero here, how&apos;s that for realism and something different?</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4900401">Expand</a></span>

Explore space, trade rare goods, do some bounty hunting, smuggle some goods you pirated,  buy new ships, etc. Its about the journey not about how fast you can grind to an anaconda ship. Some people on here are mad the game isn&apos;t casualized, the game doesn&apos;t hold your hand AT ALL!. There are normal tutorials like docking, and combat but thats it. You have to figure out the game mechanics yourself and that is very rewarding once you do. Whether you saw some guy on reddit post about best mining locations or you met a commander(real player) tell you about a rare trading route, its all very cool to figure these things out that aren&apos;t labeled &quot;GO TO THIS OBJECTIVE&quot;.
<br>
<br>What I suggest to new players is to ask around what actions get a bounty on your head because a lot of new players expect the game to be unforgiving when they come in but its not... You can easily amass 100k worth of bounties cause you did illegal things. Ill list some things that get you bounties:
<br>
<br>Some tips to avoid bounties:
<br>- If you are not in an &quot;anarchy&quot; govt system (you can check govt, factions,etc in the galaxy map) attacking clean ships (you can check this after scanning them) will net you a bounty, killing them gives you a much bigger bounty.
<br>
<br>- If you find goods laying around and pick them up getting scanned by federal security ships will net you a huge fine for carrying stolen goods, thus to sell these you should go to a place with low security (check galaxy map) or there are specific manuevers to smuggle them into stations (one is to be around 7km away from entrance of station and very fast go in the station doors because once you are inside fed ships cannot scan you). You sell goods like this at the black market under the &quot;contacts&quot; tab in many stations.
<br>
<br>-Do not do the missions which as you to kill civilian or trading ships, these net you a bounty far bigger than the payout, the only reason to do these is to get higher with the specific group that is giving you the mission.
<br>
<br>Some early game tips for new players:
<br>- Do hauling missions when you first start out under the &quot;bulletin board&quot; in stations, these are quick easy and safe starting money.
<br>
<br>- ALWAYS ALWAYS ask for docking permission from stations before going in otherwise they WILL SHOOT YOU after a given period. To do this go under your contacts tab on the left UI of your ship and clicking on the station, ask for docking permission. Check which dock number you are assigned and land there, take out your landing gear (L on pc) before landing. trying to land in wrong one will land you infraction and get you killed.
<br>
<br>- DO not shoot near stations, they will kill you instantly. You will see a message saying that a place is a &quot;no fire zone&quot;.
<br>
<br>-Before jumping to another part of space you have to retract hardpoints (weapons,landing gear, cargo hold) otherwise you cannot jump. you can check if landing gear and cargo hold are out on the bottom right. U is to deploy or retract weapons. Also you cannot jump if you are &quot;mass locked&quot; meaning you are too close to a station, keep getting further away until you are not mass locked anymore.
<br>
<br>-When you are buying parts for your ship check your power consumption on the right, if your power consumption exceeds supplied, your ship will turn off stuff like life support or shields when deploying things like weapons ( you can sort of get around this by setting unneeded things to lower priority on the right UI but its better to get a bigger powerplant.
<br>
<br>-when you are buying parts check your FSD jump distance, this laden is when your cargo is at max, unladen is when its not. Make sure you don&apos;t make this too low and can&apos;t jump anywhere (check galaxy map to see how far things are. You can increase this by buying lower mass parts, better thrusters or by getting a better fsd drive.
<br>
<br>- REMEMBER TO REFUEL. You can buy a fuel scoop which lets you get fuel by going close to starts but its very dangerous. you can refuel at any nearby stations. IF you run out of fuel to jump in deep space with no station nearby, you are screwed. Just self destruct on the right otherwise you will just die a slow painful death.
<br>
<br>Thats all I can think of for now. Hopefully it helps a new ED player looking on here for reviews.
<br>GOOD LUCK COMMANDER!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=4853806">Expand</a></span>

It has plenty of room to grow during post-release development, and does suffer a bit from underdeveloped features and a steep learning curve. There is actually a lot of depth in the political simulation (which is still being tweaked), but a lack of tutorials and the fact that Elite: Dangerous departs from the standard economy sim is space model means that some players may miss it. But at its heart, it&apos;s a game of discovery, not only in the literal sense of exploring the insanely huge galaxy, but also in finding out how that galaxy works.
<br>It has no campaign as such, but Frontier are injecting story &quot;hooks&quot; in the form of events which players can get involved with and influence the outcomes of. The current storyline is a struggle for the Imperial throne. As well as the injected storylines, others naturally develop as a consequence of the many thousands of local factions goals and statuses, and how players respond and interact with them.
<br>As an MMO, it&apos;s radically different to what the term usually implies. There are a massive number of players in the same persistent galaxy, all of whom have an influence on it, but the galaxy is so huge that it can be quite rare to meet other players. The game doesn&apos;t artificially force players together, so you&apos;ll need to make more of an effort than is usual if you do want to play with other people. There are also no standard MMO features at the time of writing, so guilds, parties and chat channels are absent - though they&apos;ll be developed as time goes on.
<br>But what the game does right now, it does very well. The flight model is fun, there are plenty of different activities to engage in, the background simulation brings a lot of unusual (and often overlooked) detail to the proceedings, and the galaxy model is a work of art. If you&apos;ve played previous versions of Elite, you&apos;ll have a good feel for the game and where it is heading.
<br>It is, however, a niche game and always will be. It follows its own path within the space sim genre and is very different in feel, aim and effect to EvE or the X games, and this may throw some players until they get a handle on the Elite-style gameplay.
<br>As previously mentioned, the game will benefit from post-release development (which is relatively common these days for large-scale multiplayer games), so if you&apos;re looking for a fully featured game, I&apos;d say leave it for perhaps six months before buying it. If you&apos;re happy to get in early and be part of the game as it grows and unfolds, then go for it. What is there right now is solid, stable and immensely playable even though there is plenty more to be added to it.

Your actual options as far as the game is concerned and how you want to play it are essentially limitless.  To be fair, as everything is organized around income generation, this does somewhat restrict what you could do, at least at the moment.  You&apos;ve got several general income paths, either by trade, by exploration, or by combat.
<br>
<br>Exploration is purely exploration at the moment.  It involves very pretty pictures, interesting systems, and a whole lot of scanning.  It&apos;s somewhat repetitive but less so than other things.  The appeal of exploration is the views, and really the chance encounters with extremely rare stellar objects, including Earth-like planets.  If you&apos;re the first person to scan these objects, your name is permanently written on it, netting you prestige with any other player who visits.  Now the galaxy is a reasonably accurate depiction of the Milky Way, with around 400 billion different star systems that can be visited.  This is a major selling point of the game, and provided you&apos;re willing to go off the beaten path, there is no lack of places to scrawl your name saying &quot;I&apos;ve been here&quot;.  Several large areas in the galaxy that currently require permits will be homes to vast alien empires, once this component of the game is implemented.  Eventually the game designers will be implementing expansions that allow for planetary landings, though on the hundreds of thousands of Earth-like worlds, I wonder how they could successfully implement alien wildlife in a way that was realistic, exotic, and also reflecting the differences between worlds.  I imagine this will be an incredibly large expansion, that is if it will net the realism that the designers are hoping for.
<br>
<br>Trading is the most repetitive of all game activities, though it tends to be the most profitable after a certain point.  It used to be the absolute most profitable activity in the game, but significant profit increases have been added to the other income streams, balancing this out a bit.  It is by far the safest way to make money, and it takes a lot less initial investment to get going.  There is a very zen quality to trading, jumping between stars and plotting routes.  A subcomponent of trading is mining, which is not particularly interesting, but a very effective way to get out of lower tier ships.  Lastly, rare trade goods net some of the highest profit margin, but require large jumps and sophisticated route mapping to do well.  Also human pirates love to predate these routes, so your day can easily get ruined if you&apos;re not paying attention.  Black market trading is the one kind of trading that is more interesting in its own right.  Sometimes you have to sneak into stations past the police forces, who will ruin your day if you get caught.  Lots of fun when you do it right, and pirates will be selling all their goods on the black market.
<br>
<br>Finally, combat.  You can bounty hunt, play as a mercenary, or be a pirate.  All are a huge amount of fun, and it&apos;s never repetitive because every fight plays out differently.  It&apos;s incredibly skill based, and the attention to detail that the developers paid really shines in combat.  You have full 3-D maneuvering, allowing you far more sophisticated maneuvers than you could fly with a plane.  Clever people with good situational awareness and piloting skills will excel at combat.
<br>
<br>Now, as far as the overall feel of the game, the sandbox portion cannot be overstated.  This may be a major turn-off for some people.  This is a game where hundreds of thousands of players are always interacting and aiding in the progression of the game.  The game actively changes based on player input, and developer prompting as well.  But in a sea of several hundred thousand, the actual impact you have will be quite small.  For example, a recent mercenary mission I played for around 15 hours, made 11 million credits was in the top 15% for progressing the mission, but the mission wasn&apos;t completed until 35 BILLION credits were made.  As you can see, no one person can change the course of the game.  There is also no false premise about giant universe ending events.  No game bosses (except the capital ships) and no god-like level of achievement where you can&apos;t be beaten.  You will probably never be able to own your own capital class ship.  They cost hundreds of billions of credits.  So you can&apos;t bully your way through the game with your giant pile of cash.  And you can&apos;t count of being some massive hero either.
<br>
<br>This game is presently solid.  The fundamentals are great.  Though there is a lack, at the moment of content diversity, they keep adding to the game and expanding this.  Eventually players will be able to walk around, and FPS will become a thing.  But if you want a storyline or a quest line, you will not get it in this game.  This sandbox factor means no one holds your hand.  I like it, others don&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/elite-dangerous/user-reviews?user_review_id=5085380">Expand</a></span>

<br>Nothing to do other than grind AI who cant fight back, Mine rocks to sell to AI or trade with AI on static markets that cant have any player buy or sell orders or any player industry.

<br>Overall, a grind to get the biggest trader to carry the most to make the most profit, nothing to use money on and same for combat ships.
