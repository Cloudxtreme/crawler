If you can get past the fact that they reel you in &quot;Magic&quot; style to buy new cards, it&apos;s unbelievably fun and varied. If you on;y spend $50 on cards, you will have a better time than most games you would drop $50 on without blinking.</span>

I one of the best free MMOs out there.
Battle Forge approaches to hybridize real time strategy and cards game (magic gathering like). As it also has been done before, no one has been as successful as Battle Forge.

As it also has been done before, no one has been as successful as Battle Forge.<br><br>Battle Forge as I already said merges RTS and cards and the result is that you have up to 20 cards in your deck, which you use in field. There are 4 main different elements: Fire, Nature, Frost and Shadow from which you can create a vast number of differently combined decks. Each deck is suited for various situations. (PvP deck greatly differs from PvE).<br>Every element has cards of several tiers (levels) 1-4, therefore in order to create a successful deck you need to have cards from each tiers. (usual structure 5 from each tier -&gt; 2creatures, 2 spells, 1structure; However is may differ greatly).<br><br>There are 19 campaign missions (PvE), which can be played on 3 levels (standard, advanced, expert) and can be played with 1-12 players.<br>PvE missions are used in order to harvest gold and upgrades, which are later used to upgrade cards and make them stronger.<br><br>PvP is very fulfilling and really test the ability of all the players. PvP cannot be approached as PvE, due to the fact that you need a great tactics plus awesome cards in order to be the top.<br><br>Trading is one of the most important factors in the game. It is done via Auction House, where people add the cards they want to sell and other people can bid on them. Other way it to use the trade chat or forum.<br><br>If you are skillful enough the gather the best cards, create the ultimate tactics and are a dexterous trader -&gt; you are the perfect candidate for becoming the top player!!<br><br>So, do not waste any more time and get to it</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleforge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1459652">Expand</a></span>

Great production values and addictive game-play wrapped up in a interactive collectible card game. Tried the F2P version and that was enough to upgrade to the retail version for under $20.00. Good deal, good game!</span>

The first thing I noticed of course was the card system. I spent over an hour just building a single deck with my first tome of cards and had a blast doing it. The completionists of the gaming community will have a great time collecting and trading their cards, while the hardcore players will have fun building a deadly deck. The main gripe seems to be that people think you need to spend money to get more/the best cards. Well you dont, it&apos;s very easy to build a stellar deck with the points you get from buying the game. The artwork in the game astounded me. I felt like a little kid in a candy shop when I was looking at the different cards and units, and I&apos;m not usually one to hang on graphics. Next up is the RTS playstyle. I thought they did a very good job in setting up the unique system of not using barracks like other games have repeated over and over and over. While I will agree that certain tactics are proven to be OP, only a month into release and the developers have already released a couple patches to help balance it. That brings me to the next point: content updates. Some people love them, while others hate them. It seems to be a growing trend in the market now, mostly thanks to consoles and DLC. The BF developers have hopped on board with the trend and have already begun releasing additional maps, with much more reported content on the way. Most notably, is a second &quot;Edition&quot; of cards said to premier sometime in Q3 of this year, consisting of an added 200 cards, nearly doubling the stockpile already in the game. The first thing most people should notice is that generally, when a game has an update as significant as this, it comes in the form of an expansion pack, costing anywhere from 20-40$. However with any point management, you could play BF to your hearts content and keep enough points to buy a tome right away when the new edition is released.....I absolutely love this game and look forward to supporting it through it&apos;s development.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleforge/user-reviews?user_review_id=423749">Expand</a></span>

And for that i have got literally THOUSANDS of hours of top-class entertainement. Compare that to a $50 game that u get 25 to 50 hours of gametime from and then tell me which is better value for money.<br>They say that these days its all about the multiplayer, and for me its all about the PvP. BFs PvP is unprecedented. its unique and exciting and gets my pulse racing like no other game.. and ive been a gamer for 25 years. And the beauty is it doesnt matter how bad or good you are because with the ranking system everyone plays opponents of their own level.  Someone that levels out around rank 15 can (and will) have matches that are as exciting and fulfilling as somone that levels out at rank 25. Your opponents will always be a balanced mixture of those at your level, those just below youre level and those just above.<br>And, unbelievably for an online pvp game against strangers, many of the players demonstrate good sportsmanship and manners. Losers often congratualate their opponent on a match well played, and indeed the standard concession of defeat is &quot;GG&quot; - good game. and to me Battleforge is exactly that - a VERY good game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/battleforge/user-reviews?user_review_id=1621144">Expand</a></span>

The units are not interesting. The storyline is a document, like a long and boring book . PvP is not interesting because some cards are seriously overpowered. If you buy this game, then you will regret it.</span>

                                        <span> I loved the Beta, but as soon as we have to pay to unlock content already in the game, I quit. Spending $2.50 on 8 virtual cards just doesnt cut it. Plus, PVP is pretty lame since you keep seeing the same OP&apos;d cards over and over. The only way to win is to use the same cheap tactics...I loved the Beta, but the pricing scheme and unbalanced play killed it.</span>

The game feels like it is missing something or it might just be me feeling burnt out of the RTS genre. Either way, while the game is entertaining, it was only entertaining for a limited amount of time. It is certainly worth a try.</span>
