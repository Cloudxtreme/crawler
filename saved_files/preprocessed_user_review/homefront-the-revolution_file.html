<br>A broken misuse of a great ip
<br>Homefront The Revolution is an open world first person shooter set in an alternate universe where north Korea establish control over the united states&#x2026;
<br>And as the name suggest, it&#x2019;s up to you to spark a revolution in the city of Philadelphia
<br>Despite this game technically being an open world, this unfortunately is actually a bunch of hub levels separated by travel points..
<br>This is not one massive map...
<br>And that&#x2019;s a shame, because Deep Silver mistakenly decided to ditch the linear first person shooter style this game originally was to jump into the saturated market of open worlds,
<br>And you&#x2019;re going to jump into a saturated market, where 9/10 AAA games are unique or flat out copying ubisoft, you better make sure that your open world or ubisoft clone world is worth existing in&#x2026;
<br>This one isn&#x2019;t
<br>There are 2 different zone types, a red and yellow.. red means anything goes..
<br>yellow means there are civilians, and you need to be stealthy and destroy Korean property to get the citizens to up rise&#x2026;
<br>The yellow zone liberating is required for the story&#x2026;
<br>And the objective much like the rest of the game feels very copy and paste&#x2026;
<br>Even down to the location you need to get to in each zone&#x2026;
<br>You can tell the developers tried to mix things up.
<br>sarcasm.
<br>It&#x2019;s just an ugly, brown, lazy, boring and lifeless world with assassins creed style liberation points&#x2026;
<br>You can take control over vantage points in the city to unlock safe houses to respawn at if you die as well as shops to buy weapons and upgrade your gear&#x2026;
<br>Weapon customization is pretty standard,
<br>but you can equip scopes and modifications on the fly, turning your 3 weapons into 9
<br>the weapons are easily the best part of the game...
<br>Liberating the entire map will add about 8 hours to the 12 hour main campaign&#x2026;
<br>And this 12 hour campaign much like the world just feels lazy...
<br>You feel like an errand boy rather than a hero&#x2026;
<br>You do fetch quests and baby sit.
<br>And you get frustrated at the broken game not continuing a mission right, or hard crashing 10 times in a row or just due to the combat&#x2026;
<br>The combat in this game feels completely unsatisfying, and the difficulty of this survival open world feels frustrating even on the easiest difficulty thanks to an inefficient hit detection system&#x2026;
<br>you don&#x2019;t feel wounded when you&#x2019;re about to die which in a typical fps you would get an indication aside from a bloodied screen like a slowed character or limping effect as a cue to take cover and heal up&#x2026;
<br>nothing like that exists here, which will have you dying seemingly out of nowhere&#x2026;
<br>You also have to rely on med packs, which for some reason can&#x2019;t be crafted while explosives can...
<br>makes no sense and also frustrating since health does not replenish itself&#x2026;
<br>But if you&#x2019;re not a fan of hard crashes or have just given up on the frustrating single player, you can play with a friend in resistance mode
<br>which will be fun for like 5 minutes, you can customize your character with a variety of options like male or female until you&#x2019;ve suffered long enough to unlock helmets to hide your generic face
<br>There are 2 modes in resistance mode..
<br>Attack or defend...
<br>The best part is, neither of these modes are competitive...
<br>They are both 4 player co-op modes where you either defend a position from enemies or you invade to complete on objective...
<br>of course either of these modes could turn into a killzone style competitive mode, but that would take too much effort.
<br>I give Homefront the Revolution
<br>a 5.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront-the-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=6420096">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game starts off horribly, for around the first forty minutes you do nothing but walk around the street and are stared at by bland characters you could care less about. Nothing is established well at all. It&apos;s a mediocre attempt at an FPS game, and right now the original Homefront is looking so much better. It&apos;s really bad when you keep repeating in your brain how you wish there was a competitive multiplayer, in fact if there was my review for this game would be so much better. Reasons being the gun system and how they play and feel is great, combat is exciting, until you realize your ai partners and enemy have the mental capacity of a potato. I would only recommend buying this game if you can ever find it on sale for around twenty dollars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront-the-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=6408471">Expand</a></span>

<br>What is wrong with these people???  They are saying things like &quot;you should expect a game to be released
<br>and need patches&quot;  OR  &quot; This game is a amazing and i don&apos;t mind that it has technical issues&quot;
<br>These kind of people need to be slapped into reality or put in isolation away from the general public due to their stupidity level!
<br>NO it is NOT Ok for a game to be released Broken and almost unplayable!  and NO this is NOT a &quot;Amazing&quot; game despite it&apos;s technical issues!
<br>I don&apos;t know what other games these people like but it cannot be the same game i do!
<br>Homefront the revolution was a MISSED OPPORTUNITY to make a incredible game! Period!
<br>Even without the tech problems that plague this Game, it still is a generic shooter game.
<br>The actual shooting is not good or fun, the AI is ridiculously bad,the so called Stealth mechanic is NON existent and the side quests are dull,easy and boring!
<br>The main missions have moments here and there of good and fun gameplay but overall
<br>they are nothing new or special.
<br>Bottom line, by supporting this game you are saying to the developers of games that &quot;Hey we do not care you put out crappy games, will will still buy them&quot;
<br>The fact they are asking $60 for the regular version of this and even more for the deluxe editions($160 for the  special Goliath edition) is not only a slap in the face to gamer&apos;s but is a insult to out intelligence!
<br>Buyer beware you have been warned!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront-the-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=6415927">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In a nutshell, it&apos;s a truly decent title. It&apos;s demanding on PC, but I haven&apos;t had any serious performance issues. The soundtrack is good, the gameplay is solid, and the graphics are superb. I&apos;m really not seeing the problem.
<br>
<br>I have this feeling that the game isn&apos;t to some people&apos;s tastes, which is okay, but in addition, some people are determined to hate the thing for whatever reason.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a semi-open world urban FPS game. There is basically nothing competing with it currently. If you liked Crysis 2, and wished you could have done open world freedom fighter stuff in Crysis 2, this is a game for you.
<br>
<br>The shooting is a lot better than most games of its type, with non-hitscan weapons and chunky feeling guns. People who accuse the game of bad gunplay are simply wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront-the-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=6438287">Expand</a></span>

Really pissed off at what they made , I mean the game&apos;s graphics are **** , the clumsiest AI , i got stuck in an NPC civilian for about 10 minutes for christ&apos;s sake !
<br>Conclusion: Don&apos;t buy this game , this game doesn&apos;t deserve any money at all!</span>

It feels like a blend between Classic FPS games like Frontlines fuels of war, an urban set Far Cry, and Starbreeze titles like Darkness, Riddick, and Syndicate. Loud guns, brutal melee, and the ability to stealth everything. If you were at all interested in this game I highly recommend giving it a chance, most reviewers were probably expecting COD or something but this game offers something different. Graphics look great as well, at times look straight photo real. Another hidden gem For old school FPS fans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront-the-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=6409906">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>First of, it doesn&apos;t look next-gen, it looks like a PS3. Full of bugs and glitches, terrible AI. Runs at 20 FPS. Interesting setting?
<br>
<br>None of the characters are memorable, seriously I can&apos;t remember anyone from the campaign.
<br>Overall this is just a painfully average game, just like the first one.</span>

Everything in this game is borderline average and that&apos;s quite an achievement in itself. What&apos;s shocking is how unconvincing this game is in its progression system. 3 hrs in and I inspired the malnourished citizens of America by back stabbing 10 soldiers who were harassing random citizens and by cutting wires on few small generators sitting by the roads. Now my malnourished fellow Americans are spray painting anti KPA slogans on structures, calling out the KPA, and starting a riot in the streets. These are the same people who were at their lowest 10 mins ago and questioned their existence. The area that was constantly being patrolled by armed KPA soldiers and tanks was empty of KPA forces because people started rioting and screaming. A world power was this easy to scare? Brilliant.
<br>
<br>People giving this game more than 6 haven&apos;t played a lot of quality games I would reckon. Do me a favor: If you are interested in this concept, then go get Red Faction Guerrilla and The Saboteur instead. These games do the whole Guerrilla/revolutionary concept far better than this under cooked abomination and are far more interesting and fun to play. And despite having dated graphics, they are far more immersive in their setting and lore. I was going to give this a 6 but I will have to knock the score down to 3 due to glitches and unstable frame rate. And no, I didn&apos;t buy this game, I rented it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront-the-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=6409915">Expand</a></span>

The frame rate is total garbage, the gunplay is the worst iv played in ages. There are identical npc&apos;s standing next to each other in the game. The grafics are rubbish. And to top it off its boring as hell. The bad reviews are totally warranted. Please do not give them your money. This is lazy crap</span>

If the sheer fact that the development phase was riddled with drama and didn&apos;t put you off the title isn&apos;t enough, listen to everyone on here. Don&apos;t waste your money. What&apos;s hilarious to me is that the developers decided to use denuvo drm, as if anyone actually wanted to pirate this garbage anyway.</span>

The game, designed with cryengine, looks amazing and the details put into every small inch are amazing. Dambuster Studios had acknowledged the issues with frame rate (among other things) and promised to fix them ASAP. The campaign, around 30 hours long, does get repetitive but only after several hours already playing and even then it is still so fun it frankly doesn&apos;t harm the game, for me that is. I hope this helped you, have a great day and i hope you enjoy this game.

Graphics are about as good as most late previous gen games. the sound is effects are good. Gameplay is fun. Your character seems to move slow but once you buy the proper gear it improves greatly. the fact that you can change your weapon attachments during a firefight is pretty cool. The story is mediocre but its not horrible. The Co-Op multiplayer is surprisingly very fun. The multiplayer has a lot to unlock and will provide any player with hours of gameplay. I honestly would give this game a 7-7.5 but I am giving it more because I feel the 0 ratings are from people who played the opening and stopped there. most of the 0 ratings showed up not too long after the games release and there is no way that they gave it the time to rate it fairly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront-the-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=6409299">Expand</a></span>

The execution is done well enough that the game is enjoyable, it has plenty of content to keep you busy for hours. Don&apos;t listen to butt hurt nerds that don&apos;t like it when a game is buggy on release. Fallout 4 was buggy and that game is praised to hell.</span>

The idea of helping &quot;liberate&quot; certain areas of Philadelphia is cool and in a lot of ways the game borrows from the old &quot;Mercenaries&quot; Series (and that&apos;s a good thing). All in all, I think it&apos;s a solid game that some people will criticize too heavily.</span>

Well that&apos;s nice but I am a PC Master Race kinda guy so I have not seen anything to bad yet, mind you i have only played in the first 2 zones, on the PC Version, AI Running into walls and, hovering texture meshes (an american flag floating in the middle of a warehouse), &amp; Something that kinda bugs my eyes about this game is despite what the monitor is set at in windows the game seems to use a lower refresh rate. I am going to measure the fps and tweak for ~100 fps and game tick if i can get it to work (will post any fix or setting I find for it), for optimal viewing so that my eyes don&apos;t hurt and so that I don&apos;t get motion sick (I game on a 27&quot; 144Hz Asus monitor (with Lightboost Blurbusters Hack) and like my fps to be around 120 Ideally but anywhere above 100 is comfortable.)That being said so far the setting is nice, the shooting mechanics are a little clunky, for ex: a 5.56 mm round has a lot of recoil in this game, and a 45. Cal SMG with a rifle stock has huge amounts of recoil, I can see maybe if it had no stock but it has one so... The character movement is decent don&apos;t like the screen wobble when running, Climbing. It is kinda like an urban Farcry 2, with a lot less driving (a Good Thing). the atmosphere is nice and the setting is well done. missions are okay, some of the side quests seem more important than the story missions for ex:

This game is so bad it make the original Home-Front, (short as it was), look like a masterpiece.

<br>
<br>Some needs to be done about a company releasing a game that is horrible. If the game wasn&apos;t ready it would have been better for the developers to delay the game, but they released it nonetheless. The problem is that once the game is released and opened you CANNOT return it, even if the game is horrible. If you went to a restaurant and the food you order is bad the food is taken of the bill, or that restaurant will not last long. For games, if professional reviewers give it less than 70% then the customer should be able to return it. For those, (like me) who got it through day one digital, you cannot return it. This needs to stop.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront-the-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=6408348">Expand</a></span>

Played through and was enjoying it, even though it was a hybrid of Far Cry 3/4/Crysis/Dying Light elements. But I continued. Then the bugs came. And kept coming. Crippling frame rates with an i7 4770k and nvidia 980ti. Solid 60 and drop and stutter to 10... WTF! Random and repeating. For no reason whatsoever. So i trucked through it anyway. But at the end mission, glitches prevented me from even being ABLE to complete the mission. What a LOAD OF SH*T. I honestly would have given this a 6/7 or so, if the damn game wasnt buggy BEYOND BELIEF!!! So basically, game is ok, a little repetitive, copying other games mechanics. Graphics are pretty damn impressive maxed out, when it works and is stable of course. AI is pretty bad, but oh well. The bugs! GOOD GOD HOW DO YOU RELEASE THIS WITH THIS MANY PROBLEMS!!! YEs I know the change mid production yadda yadda. SOrry I literally created a Metacritic account just to voice my RAGE for this atrocity of a game that costs $59.99. This trash is worth $2.99 at best with all these bugs. Could have been a stellar game, but whadda you know, garbage glitches and no SLI support with horrible optimization. So sad to see the CryEngine run so badly! So much potential. Thrown right into the sewer and puked all over and cr*pped on. Get this on sale, or wat till this is $19.99. Don&apos;t waste your money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront-the-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=6489464">Expand</a></span>

Playing XCOM2 as a resistance commander, I was dying to have the same resistance movement experience but this time in modern FPS perspective ala Fallout3 style and this game was exactly that. The gun customization on the fly is a big plus for me because its really unique and fun. The graphics are very nice but as many people said, the AI and graphic glitches can be disturbing at times. Overall, it didn&apos;t spoil my experience much as I played both story mode and resistance mode (coop mission) so far. I was disappointed that there isn&apos;t a &quot;Resistance Mode&quot; ala XCOM2 style where you simply start at a base location and start to take over the world on your own and plan for yourself without a rigid storyline in true open world style. Shooting is nice in this game even though guns do not have the feel and impact of true bred FPS games like Battlefield. Its still as good as it gets for me. Overall, this game may fail many hardcore gamers but does scratch my itch for now. 7/10. -1 for not having open gameplay mode , -1 for the graphic glitches , -1 for the console feel of the whole interface.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront-the-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=6417083">Expand</a></span>

For a game that went through what it went through during development, I&apos;m actually surprised it was better than expected. You can tell the noticeable issues for a game that didn&apos;t have a smooth development process. Things like npcs walking through each other, npcs appearing and disappearing out of the blue, etc. Despite its issues, the game is somewhat entertaining. I enjoyed the openness world although it could&apos;ve been improved upon. The weapon customization was pretty good but felt more like an afterthought. The acting and interactions between the npcs was actually quite good.
<br>
<br>But the biggest praise I would give is the graphics, especially the main npc characters to the story. Aside from that, the environmental graphics were so-so, some had really awful textures and I am playing the game on maximum settings. The game was optimized well though, never had any framerate problems. I truly believe if this game didn&apos;t have to go through all those issues during development, had a steady and stable development team behind it, it would&apos;ve been a much better game. You can see the potential but unfortunately falls flat. Picked up this game for $20 so either way I&apos;m satisfied.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront-the-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=6923049">Expand</a></span>

I wouldn&apos;t know its initial state as I bought it exactly a year after release. But either way, please consider what you&apos;ve said and revisit it, because Homefront: The Revolution is a good game. Yes, the devs should have delayed the game, but give them props for sticking out when others would have abandoned it outright.
<br>
<br>The game is more or less an urban Far Cry with North Koreans. So if you love FC, you&apos;ll love this. Capturing strikepoints (i.e. outposts) is quite fun. Some even require you to solve puzzles. I also love the in-game customization mechanic, yo can convert you assault rifle to an LMG and so on. Oh, and no regenerating health, either. And AI is competent: the KPA are NOT happy to see you and they will show it. You can, and will, die. A lot. And I&apos;m suprised at the detail they have put in the indoor areas. You can enter almost every building, especially in the Red Zone. So don&apos;t be fooled by the reviews.
<br>
<br>The story is, well, good also. The characters are also decent. What I hated, however, was the backstory. Who came up with idea of having the US military use North Korean technology? As if North Korea wouldn&apos;t turn them off with the push of a button. Oh wait...they did. Seriously, the backstory of the original Homefront was not only better, but believable. It&apos;s the only good thing about that game. Seriously, watch it.
<br>
<br>Graphic-wise, it&apos;s neither ugly nor pretty. And it performs well, too. I played it on medium on my GTX 960M.
<br>
<br>What I hated is that sometimes when you recruit Resistance members, they occasionally get stuck and/or block your way.. This can be solved by dismissing and re-recruiting them. Another problem is that sometimes KPA soldiers can spawn out-of-nowhere. Yes, they can be gunned down relatively easily, but still...
<br>
<br>I have not tried the DLC yet, but I heard it&apos;s good. I&apos;ll get it when it&apos;s on sale.
<br>
<br>So, is it the game good? YES. Not great, but worth the price now.
<br>
<br>Is the game fixed? YES. But please devs, either fix your game before release, or don&apos;t release at all.
<br>
<br>Do I want a sequel? YES. And please learn from your mistakes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront-the-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=7374036">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Worse still the usability is dismal. Trying to hack a console in the early portion of the game was next to impossible. The integration with my mouse was simply hopeless and again I&apos;m running a good quality gamer&apos;s mouse so there is no excuse here such as low end gear.
<br>
<br>Gun play is also dreadful with clumsy chunky weapons handling and aiming. Character movement is little better. I should add here I experimented with a variety of graphics settings and it made little different. I suspect this may be more to do with design than anything else.
<br>
<br>A BIG thumbs down here. The idea behind the game is good as is the setting but its so unplayable that its simply not worth the effort.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/homefront-the-revolution/user-reviews?user_review_id=7465649">Expand</a></span>
