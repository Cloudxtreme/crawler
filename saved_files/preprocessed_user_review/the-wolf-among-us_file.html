<br>
<br>Now the game play has been disappointing for some as it is unlike Monkey Island or any classic adventure game for that matter. While you do have an inventory and sometimes get to use items from it there really are no puzzles to solve. The game just moves along regardless if you do things or not. I think to get full enjoyment out of it you should view this game more as one of those &quot;choose your own adventure books&quot; but with a great story, great characters and some though choices rather than as an adventure game. If you do that you will have a blast, if you are looking for clever puzzles then I am afraid this might not be the game for you.
<br>
<br>The choices are pretty hard regardless whether they really matter and so on in the end. What matters is that you know what choices you made and some of them were some of the hardest choices I have ever had to make outside of real life.
<br>
<br>The characters are very interesting and the game is quite mature, and not in a boobs everywhere type of way. There is poverty, forced prostitution, loan sharks, and even the bad guys are more of anti-heroes than just one dimensional evil characters.
<br>
<br>The whole settings, based on the Fable comics which are quite great, is awesome. But I am a sucker for fairy tales and seeing this downtrodden community of characters you grew up with facing every day life far from their home is downright heartbreaking.
<br>
<br>And this is what this game ultimately gave me, it gave me a good 8 hours of an emotional roller coaster filled with hard choices. I was angry, I was sad, I was happy, and I was sorry... the walking dead made me cry, but this made me feel.
<br>
<br>Overall, highly recommended!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=4352057">Expand</a></span>

The noirish setting with its unique art style had me hooked, and most of the characters that are introduced have a lot of depth and personality. Voice acting is great and the soundtrack feels appropriate for every scene, aiding whatever emotional impact the game attempts to induce. Overall, the first episode gave me a very positive impression of the game and the cliffhanger ending had me wanting more.
<br>
<br>Subsequent episodes are still quite decent, however I felt they weren&apos;t of the same calibre as the first episode which I consider to be the most well constructed of all five. Difficult choices are present throughout the series, however the game does occasionally feel as if there&apos;s very little progression and some glaring plot holes also start to emerge. I think most people will agree that the fourth episode was relatively weak, as not only was it the shortest, but the secondary characters that were introduced felt poorly developed and the build up to the finale was underwhelming. The final episode had some pretty epic action scenes, but the Crooked Man doesn&apos;t feel like much of a threatening antagonist, thus the trial scene wasn&apos;t as tense or climactic as I expected. I was also hoping for a better resolution between Bigby and Snow, though the final interaction with Nerissa is very eye-opening and concludes the series on an overall positive note.
<br>
<br>Lastly, throughout the whole game, you&apos;ll also probably encounter occasional stuttering. Some of the animations may also seem a bit jerky, particularly in action scenes, but none of this isn&apos;t very significant. Finishing the game, I couldn&apos;t help feeling slightly disappointed that the rest of the game didn&apos;t quite hold up to the very high standards of the first episode. However, the game is still very engaging and well worth the price. Anyone who has played previous games from Telltale, or anyone interested in what is a very mature and memorable setting should consider playing The Wolf Among Us.

Excellent art and writing, great voice acting, and a fair amount of branching choices to help you define your character and create the story.

<br>I still don&apos;t like adventure games, but I&apos;ll continue to make exceptions for anything from this studio, as long as they maintain this level of quality.</span>

After finishing it I consider replaying it making different choices since it actually matters - unlike in TWD where everyone dies anyway.

Bottom line: I think Wolf is better than Dead.  The end of the game indicated the setting is from a series of graphic novels (not something I&apos;m likely to read).  However, I found the setting original and the story-telling to be everything I could have hoped for.  Compared to the Walking dead game, I found this one to be better for the following reasons: (1) Wolf gives you ample opportunity to engage your inner badass (2) the grittiness and violence ground the story so that its not too fantastic (3) the fantasy elements are part most people&apos;s culture, so we all can participate without special learning effort.  (4) the Fabletown citizen decision making at the end of the game appeared to me to be a novel game mechanic and was temporarily memorized.  Perhaps its not as deep as it appeared, but I felt like there was a difficult mob mechanic that I was ultimately able to win-over to my opinion.
<br>
<br>That that being said, I deducted a full point from the rating because the developer failed to allow freaking keybindings.  This is completely unacceptable in 2015.  I probably should have deducted 9 points to show my utter disdain for this sin.  I&apos;m not left handed, by why alienate a huge percentage of the population?
<br>
<br>Finally, I must complain about the action sequences.  I can&apos;t say for sure, but I think they alter the game in any way.  So why include them?  I never died.  Am I really that good?  Replace that WASDQ bullocks with more mouse select-able choices.  One of of my favorite choices to select was &quot;hit him&quot; - so do more of that and get rid of the WASDQ.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=5467343">Expand</a></span>

The Wolf Among Us raises the bar for interactive storytelling because it takes a relatively unknown comic (at least to me at the time of playing the game) and brings it into a perfect gaming medium for it. The voice acting is great and the characters are awesome. I had a blast playing this game. It feels like R-rated Disney, not that it&apos;s goofy, but that it takes well-known fairy-tales and brings them into a dark and gritty world. I highly recommend this game. It solidified my belief that Telltale needs to keep making games, even if they have made some questionable decisions as far as what franchises they should take on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=6391727">Expand</a></span>

It is considered a game but is closer to being an interactive book. If you&apos;re looking for something with a stromg story this could be worth a purchase.

<br>
<br>As far as game play, it was really up my alley. I love character driven plots, interactions/dialog that have impacts on the gameplay, and combat that doesn&apos;t feel too frantic or button-mashy. This really hit a home run for me. Not only were the dialog choices usually impactful and varied, but they seemed true to character and relevent to the surroundings and mood. The combat felt tense without feeling panicked or rushed. I really felt like I got to play the game my way, and almost never felt shoehorned into making a choice I didn&apos;t want to make.

<br>Some of the controls when you&apos;re looking around and moving around on your own are a little wonky. The camera angle when you&apos;re walking Bigby around a room can be awkward, and occasionally you might miss certain items to interact with because of it, but that was really the only technical flaw I found. For the more artistic elements, there were a few characters whose voice acting didn&apos;t really hit home for me (looking at you, Beauty and Beast), but most everyone else was spot on.
<br>
<br>The highlight of this game though is the story. If you love fairytales or a good piece of fiction, you&apos;ll enjoy this game, even without any prior knowledge of the comics. Highly recommend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=4460327">Expand</a></span>

<br>The dialogue choices often don&apos;t make much of a difference but many of them do, along with some other major choices. The fighting can be pretty fun and is definitely a joy to watch.
<br>
<br>Overall, a pleasurable 9 hour experience, the whole way through. The ending was wrapped up nicely (no major plot holes) with a *slight* cliffhanger at the end, JUST enough to get you excited for Season 2.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=4434508">Expand</a></span>

<br>The episodes are very short - an hour of gameplay - thats the other advantage
<br>At the end of the 5th episode the only choice i regret is playing this game. I&apos;d be better off staring at the black screen.

<br>What I miss, and this is problem in these games (WD, GOT), is more interaction. But this is a small thing.
<br>I take these games more as watching story then playing game. Which is working for me quite okay.</span>

Multiple choices and consequences give the game a genuine feeling of making an impact on the game. However I am only speaking of Episode 1. The first episode came with such high hopes and promises for the series and left us the fans wanting more. Three months has gone by and not a word on Episode 2 or so much as an ETA from Telltale Games. The only thing that TTG has said was that there would be an ETA on episode 2 after the holidays. They have not so much as posted anywhere online in over a month and that has left a lot of fans with souring regret in their mouths. I understand delays and wanting to put out a polished game to the fans but when the game is sold as episodes and is meant to be released every couple of months, it would be beneficial for the dev to keep in contact with the fans. Game developers need to understand that the fans make the game a success or a failure. No word from them means they could care less about the game and is making the rest of us would be fans falling into the same mindset. They have our money and that seems to be what TTG cares about the most.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=3912255">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_6499992"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">With The Wolf Among Us, I had very high expectations. A production of Telltale Games, one of my favorite game publishers (and based in my spiritual home of Marin County, California), the game uses a similar engine and format as The Walking Dead, Season One, one of the best games of recent years. It has a noir setting; draws on the smart comic series, Fables; features similarly breathtaking visuals as The Walking Dead; and stars many of the same excellent voice actors. My mental narrative was an exciting one. It foresaw The Wolf Among Us as a brilliant riff on Western fairy tales and urban legends, holding the Magic Mirror up to these classics and showing us their dark undercurrents.
<br>
<br>Expectations can be fatal, however, to the success of a game. The writers behind The Wolf Among Us failed to pull together a coherent story, let alone one as smart and caustically insightful as The Walking Dead.
<br>
<br>Up through Season Five, I was quite deeply engaged in the story. My favorite character (other than our hot hero, Bigby Wolf) couldn&apos;t be any other than the morally demanding, politically engaged, strong female character of Snow White. In some ways, I consider her one of the best developed characters in video gaming of recent years. She takes charge, but vocalizes her self-doubts; she holds firm to principles of justice in the face of exceptions that have proved the rule for too long in Fabletown. Her back-and-forth with Bigby is compelling, and though predictable her relationship with him satisfyingly deepens over the episodes.
<br>
<br>The climax of the game, though--apparently meant to be a dramatic and epic fight between Bigby and the villain&apos;s henchwoman, Bloody Mary--nearly drove me to laughter. Suspension of disbelief may seem strained in a game where pigs complain and moan between draws on their cigarettes, but it wasn&apos;t until this climax that I felt the boundary had been broken. This silly turn-of-events made me realize that I had crushed on Snow White and Bigby Wolf so much that I no longer really cared what was going on in the narrative. For an intentionally story-driven game, this isn&apos;t a good thing. It not only failed to turn the critical eye on literature that I wanted, but it collapsed inward on its shoddy narrative. Not even the strength of its voice acting, graphics, or gameplay, in my view, can balance out the game&apos;s inability to make good on its reason for being: to provide a rich interactive story. My expectations far exceeded what The Wolf Among Us became. As a result, it seems little more than glamour on a pig.
<br>
<br>The magic of this fairy tale thus broken, I sit disappointed. I would recommend The Wolf Among Us for fans of Telltale, of noir, and of interactive stories. But only just. I wish this weren&apos;t the case, that it had been as masterfully developed as The Walking Dead. But there lies the problem: The Wolf Among Us will always stand out in my mind as the weaker counterpart to an amazing game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=6499992">Expand</a></span>

However the ending wasn&apos;t as satisfying as I had hoped and there are clear quality differences between the episodes, specifically episodes 2 and 4 which are much worse than 1, 3, and 5. If they made the gameplay better and raised the quality of the two bad episodes, this game would have been perfect.

Ive loved absolutely every chapter of &quot;The Wolf Among Us&quot;, being a fan of the Fables comics, telltale games have done so much justice towards the source material, giving us a better, and much more fascinating origin story compared to the first Fables arc. The wolf among us is so rich in characters and dialog, the setting is so bleak and melancholy and just the general idea of having characters from fantasy fictions such as beauty and the beast and snow white come together in a modern setting having to hide and survive in the modern world is just so fascinating and interesting. Id recommend The Wolf Among Us to anybody that is a fan of noir story telling and comic book fans alike, this is my new Favourite Telltale game, loved every moment and cant wait to replay it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=5367956">Expand</a></span>

Inspired by the same comic book series name, The Wolf Among Us thrusts us into the paws of Sheriff Bigby Wolf who must keep Fabletown together. Having not read the comics of the same name, this game introduces players wonderfully to the dark, grim, and somewhat satirical nature of old fables struggling to thrive in the modern world. The writing is still top notch, as well as the voice acting and animations that accompany it. What I really enjoyed is the very noir inspired synth soundtrack which really draws much inspiration from 80s crime noir films. The mechanics are much the same with The Walking Dead where you go a about a fixed camera angle inspecting items, making conversation and decision, and when the going gets tough QTEs come into place. Its a well working formula that has succeeded in much of the episodes but along with that came TellTale&apos;s biggest flaw: your decisions have little impact whatsoever. It irked me a tad when I read on the top left corner that example character notices something, but fails to see any consequences. Even deciding who lives or dies does not change outcomes or later scenarios, which is a big flaw in a game that promotes player choices. Overall it was a vastly engrossing adventure from start to finish, but I somewhat felt I had little control over the occurring events, entertaining or not.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=5366648">Expand</a></span>

It is safe to say they delivered. Based on the Fables comic book series this original storyline is sure to have anyone who like a good thriller gripped, with twists and turns throughout.</span>

<br>The Wolf Among Us was amazing from start to finish, Telltale really shines in their newest game. It&apos;s based on the Fables comic book series. You play as Bigby Wolf, or The Big Bad Wolf, who is sheriff of Fabletown. It follows through a string of connected murdles that lead through an unpredictable story that&apos;s witty and deceptive. There&apos;s so much to love about this game, you can go into it knowing nothing of the comic series, as I did, and still get so much out of it. It&apos;s perfect as a prequel and it definitely sparked an interest to check out the comics.
<br>
<br>The story is strung together throughout all 5 episodes, and Bigby really shows why he&apos;s called The Big Bad Wolf, he makes a perfect sheriff and can definitely back up his bark with his bite, which episode 5 showcased completely what he&apos;s capable of if pushed to his limits. I thought episode 5 brought the season to a perfect close, but also leaves the door open just enough for a second season.
<br>
<br>The controls are easy, choosing what to say when prompted, exploring environments is fun and rewarding, and the script is perfect, especially Bigby&apos;s lines. It made me laugh, made me cry, made me sad, and I really felt like I connected with the characters and Fabletown. I really feel like this is Telltale&apos;s best work so far, and I loved The Walking Dead and Back To The Future games. I&apos;m really looking forward to see what Telltale has in store for us next!
<br>
<br>There&apos;s nothing I can really say is wrong with the game, the choices you make seemlessly weave the story along and I felt like my choices affected the story in a way that felt very personal. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes comic books or fans of Telltale Games, or even if you liked The Walking Dead game....no not Survival Instinct. But definitely give it a try! You won&apos;t regret it. It has an amazing story, the graphics are beautiful and really looks like a comic book. It&apos;s probably Telltale&apos;s best game so far, and I can&apos;t wait to see what&apos;s next!
<br>
<br>I give it a 10/10 Perfect score!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=5843350">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>What put this game over The Walking Dead for me was the setting, I absolutely loved it! It was basically Once Upon a Time sprinkled with Grimm and I&apos;m all over that. The story was well written which I&apos;ve come to expect from Teltale and you were constantly left guessing right up until the end, I am still confused about what actually happened 30 minutes later, which honestly I didn&apos;t like, I much prefer clear cut endings over the whole &quot;let the player decide what really happened&quot;, it&apos;s like the cinema shutting off the tape 5 minutes before the end and telling you to imagine the ending. That being said it didn&apos;t hurt the game and I have my own theory!
<br>
<br>Teltale have opened my eyes to a genre I never explored before and I thank them for that, I have been really enjoying just sitting back and relaxing in bed deciding people&apos;s fates in these interactive films.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=5997397">Expand</a></span>

<br>Another great game from Telltale games.
<br>First of all, The Wolf Among Us is a prequel to the renowned comic books, Fable. In The Wolf Among Us, you will play as Bigby, The Big Bad Wolf, trying to keep peace inside the Fabletown as it&apos;s Sheriff. One day she met a girl named Faith, and on the same day, Faith was killed and her head was left in front of Bigby&apos;s apartment. Who&apos;s the killer? and Why? Play the game to the conclusion and you&apos;ll get your head blown for it.
<br>Plus point:
<br>- After The Walking Dead Season 1, Telltale games made their name known for that masterpiece. And after that, they went and released The Wolf Among Us. When i played the first episode, i was blown. The game is visually beautiful, compared to The Walking Dead, it&apos;s totally an upgrade. Kinda like 2D Cell Shading kind of Visual, and it&apos;s awesome.
<br>- The story includes characters that are famous and known to us. Like Snow white, Little Red Riding Hood, Humpty &amp; Dumpty, Bloody Mary, &amp; Etc. Although you never read Fable before, the characters are basically from the fairy tale. So, it&apos;s not someone that you don&apos;t know at all.
<br>- Although i must say that the story progress is kinda slow, the conclusion to the game is pretty much awesome. That plot twists are gonna make you nod your head.
<br>- A much more elaborate battle system. It becomes more similar to Heavy Rain, much more actions you can do, and much more objects that you can interact with. I think this system is an update from The Walking Dead.
<br>Minus point:
<br>- Unlike The Walking Dead, the choices that you made in the game doesn&apos;t really affect your storyline in an extreme way, which is why the options in the game isn&apos;t really that important. This game is not about an adventure, it&apos;s about solving a case. So if you are looking for a thrill of adventure in this game, don&apos;t.
<br>- I did mentioned it before on the plus point, that the story progress is slow. And yes, those five episodes has totally different level on intensity. Like Episode 3, it feels like a filler to me.
<br>The verdict:
<br>The Wolf Among Us is another great game from Telltale games, and i personally love it. But don&apos;t expect it to be similar to The Walking Dead, since it&apos;s not an adventure game, but kinda more like Sherlock Holmes kind of game. Uncovering the mysteries is the point of this game.
<br>And the visual level is beyond good, although you will still feel some technical issue like loading time and frame skip. Other than that, the game is good. What i want to say is, don&apos;t compare it to The Walking Dead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=4386217">Expand</a></span>

Plus it has a whole lotta more active brawls than TWD which is always a bonus</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=4815574">Expand</a></span>

<br>I used to think TWDG was the best TellTale have done but TWAU is just...amazing! I am in love with some of the characters and the game really drags you in from the start. I don&apos;t mean to compare TWDG and TWAU but so far TWAU is slightly better than season 1 TWDG even though both are amazing. I could say that both really get you interested from the moment you start playing. I can&apos;t say the same for season 2 of TWDG ...that was disappointing but I&apos;ll just leave it at that.
<br>
<br>I loved playing TWAU and the finale was so awesome plus the little cliffhanger at the end. I can&apos;t wait for season 2 and hope it will be as good as season 1. The story line is great, and the choices available are really good - You can either make your character into a very nice person or a very hostile one, I like that. Not to mention the graphics and the whole atmosphere which is really good. I like the music too, and the whole Fable community; it&apos;s interesting.
<br>
<br>The fighting and action parts are good, TellTale have done a real good job at those. You actually feel like you&apos;re playing a game as well as playing out a story line and that&apos;s essential to make a game a game instead of a movie.
<br>
<br>I love Bigby Wolf just as much as I loved playing as Lee Everett, they&apos;re awesome protagonists. Voice acting is great and while you&apos;re playing you feel as if you&apos;re in the place of the playable character which is awesome. Furthermore, the themes are great, as are the antagonists who have well-written roles just as most, if not all, other characters. I am particularly a fan of Bloody Mary as an antagonist (though I disliked her personality as mostly anyone would, I have to say her character was very well-developed) although all of them are good.
<br>
<br>The only bug I ever received on this game was a minor one, which was fixed just by starting that checkpoint of the game again. It never bothered really bothered me though.
<br>
<br>I have to admit, I am looking forward to season 2 of TWAU more than I am looking forward to season 3 of TWDG, most probably because of how amazing TWAU was and how disappointing season 2 of TWDG was, despite season 1 of TWDG being superb.
<br>
<br>I would recommend this game to anybody who enjoys episodic games with player decisions, this game is definitely not for everyone. I know some people have found this game bad but it is NOT (in many people&apos;s opinion). Some decisions may not affect the story line, true, but that is only to build up the whole story until the finale so it doesn&apos;t have to make a game bad. You&apos;re mostly in control of the player in TWAU. Plot twists are great and this game really gets you thinking - I think that, aside from many other parts, the two parts that really got me thinking and trying to guess was the ending of episode 1 and the ending of episode 5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=4924302">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The things I love... the story with many cliffhangers at the end of each episode, I remember being shocked when it came out and not all episodes were available. It may seem like it&apos;s a typical detective story, but trust me. With the interesting setting this game is in, it&apos;s way more complicated than it first seems. The characters in TWAU are also very nicely done. This was probably the last Telltale game where they actually weren&apos;t money-grabbing **** All characters you meet are important to the story and are very developed. There&apos;s not a single character that seems pointless. The positive ones do really help you and feel their presence, negative ones are also awesome, makes you feel scared... until the wolf gets angry. Now we get to the absolute bad ass main character - Bigby Wolf. All his forms bring new gameplay elements. First, it&apos;s just a man-looking wolf, then he reveals his second form and becomes way more powerful. Though in the final episode, the enemies managed to make him so angry for him to transform to his true form - the Big Bad Wolf. While playing for this character you feel great, you feel like you have a lot of power and you are not afraid of anything. It&apos;s a great feeling. Another thing I absolutely love is the soundtrack. A M A Z I N G! It first the theme and I still can&apos;t stop listening to some of the tracks in this game. My favorite one must be the Opening Credits theme.
<br>
<br>Overall, I&apos;d say this is on the level of The Walking Dead. Very powerful, but not in the same way as TWD. A must-play for story-lovers of the game industry. 10/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=7373902">Expand</a></span>

That alone is pretty much enough to sell it to me, and it delivers on the promise of dark, gritty twists on classic characters while also involving you deeply in the world around as it unveils itself right along with the mystery you&apos;re tracking.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s mature and has plenty of adult themes, but it doesn&apos;t indulge in these things just for the sake of them. The darker content fits very well with the sleazy underworld it&apos;s showing to you, and the writing and acting are consistently excellent from start to finish. Mystery, black humour, sudden brutal violence, and a great cast of weird, slightly crazy characters makes this one of the most enjoyable worlds to dive into in recent years. Telltale really knows how to capture a fictional setting well, so if you&apos;re into point and click adventures with emphasis on story over puzzles, you can&apos;t go wrong with this one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=5665931">Expand</a></span>

<br>You are Sheriff Bigby Wolf, in our world, New York. The fables try to keep regular citizens(Mundies) out by using glamours to appear normal. When a few heads start to roll in Fabletown it&apos;s up to Bigby to solve this dangerous mystery that will keep twisting. As for the gameplay, the mechanics are typical for Tellatale. They are QTE prompts but you are the choreographer of the fight scenes which is why I love The Wolf Among Us, as well as its well designed consequence system. If you have read Fables by DC Vertigo you would understand more but you still have a great story either way.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=6871650">Expand</a></span>

<br>I fully recommend this Telltale Games experience. Is only one Season (5 episodes) and it deserves at least two playthroughs ;)

<br>
<br>No hay mucho que decir, si conoces esta empresa (Telltale Games) sabr&#xE1;s que sus juegos son aventuras gr&#xE1;ficas, centradas en la historia, dejando aun lado la jugabilidad. Esta ultima se centra solo en elecciones que aparentemente modifican la historia (he probado a cambiar algunas elecciones, y he de decir que los cambios en la historia son realmente m&#xED;nimos) y con eventos de Quick Time Event (aparece una tecla y le tienes que dar repetidamente o antes de que desaparezca...).
<br>
<br>Respecto a la historia, solo decir que es una revisi&#xF3;n adulta de las fabulas para ni&#xF1;os, las cuales han tenido que emigrar de su lugar natal al mundo terrenal, y se han establecido en un barrio de New York llamado Fabletown. Nosotros encarnamos a Bigby Wolf, el lobo que normalmente es el malo en todas las fabulas, ha dejado su pasado atr&#xE1;s y ahora trabaja como Sheriff para proteger a todas las fabulas que habitan el barrio. Al comienzo, hay un asesinato, y es ah&#xED; cuando toda la historia se desencadena.
<br>
<br>A&#xF1;adir que esta completamente en ingles (aunque puedes encontrar traducci&#xF3;n al Espa&#xF1;ol).
<br>
<br>Dicho esto, si lo que buscas es una historia polic&#xED;aca que te mantiene enganchado de principio a final y te importa poco que carezca de jugabilidad, este es tu juego.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-wolf-among-us/user-reviews?user_review_id=7082590">Expand</a></span>

Czy to jednak wada? Rzecz jasna decyduje to o dalszym rozwoju fabu&#x142;y, jednak zdecydowanie brakuje tutaj wi&#x119;kszej interakcji z otoczeniem (czego&#x15B; wi&#x119;cej ni&#x17C; szybkie naciskanie okre&#x15B;lonych klawiszy i klikanie na widoczne przed nami przedmioty). Jestem wi&#x119;c jak tytu&#x142;owy bohater - rozdarty mi&#x119;dzy dobrymi i z&#x142;ymi stronami tej produkcji. Zdecydowanie jest to gra, kt&#xF3;r&#x105; zapami&#x119;tam na d&#x142;u&#x17C;ej, jednak bardziej w kontek&#x15B;cie ciekawej fabu&#x142;y, ni&#x17C; samej rozgrywki.
<br>
<br>Plusy:
<br>+ wci&#x105;gaj&#x105;ca i emocjonuj&#x105;ca historia
<br>+ postacie (szczeg&#xF3;lnie g&#x142;&#xF3;wny bohater)
<br>+ fabu&#x142;a i wybory moralne
<br>+ &#x15B;cie&#x17C;ka d&#x17A;wi&#x119;kowa
<br>+ ba&#x15B;niowy &#x15B;wiat przedstawiony z nieco innej perspektywy
<br>
<br>Minusy:
<br>&#x2013; wt&#xF3;rne elementy rozgrywki
<br>&#x2013; ka&#x17C;dy kolejny epizod by&#x142; coraz kr&#xF3;tszy
<br>&#x2013; gra przechodzi si&#x119; praktycznie sama
<br>&#x2013; to ju&#x17C; bardziej interaktywny serial ni&#x17C; gra
