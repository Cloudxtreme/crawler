<br>
<br>THE GOOD:
<br>- Nice graphics
<br>- Enjoyable music
<br>
<br>THE BAD:
<br>- Tons of bugs and glitches
<br>- Combat system (teleportation and charging)
<br>- Controls are clunky and do not flow well
<br>- Terrible frame-rate, complete lack of optimization
<br>- Laughable dialogs (narrator voice)
<br>- Game crashes frequently and at random</span>

Its no surprise then that Aaru&apos;s Awakening caught my attention.  The cel-shaded environments combined with the beautifully painted backgrounds make this a truly gorgeous game.  However, it takes more then really good art to make a really good game.  Thats not to say this is a bad game but it certainly carries with it some baggage that weighs down the overall experience.  This test of reflexes and patience may not be for everyone.
<br>
<br>The story of Aaru&apos;s Awaking is a tale of four gods.  The gods decided long ago to split the day into four equal parts Dawn, Day, Dust, and Night.  You play as Aaru.  A buff looking creature that lies to serve Dawn.  You&apos;re warned by you&apos;re master of an evil presence invading Night and must traveling through all four kingdoms to face this threat.  As Aaru travels through the realms the other gods sow seeds of doubt into his mind and he begins to question if he is on the right path.  This makes for a pretty interesting story which is narrated though story book cut-scenes between each realm.
<br>
<br>After seeing someone play it on Youtube, Aaru&apos;s Awaking quickly caught my attention.  I proceeded to download a demo and was instantly impressed.  Not only was the game fun to look at but the mechanics were very clever.  Aaru was fairly maneuverable but the key mechanic of the game is teleportation.  This is accomplished by pressing the left mouse button to project out a ball of light then press the right mouse button to appear at the balls current location.  This makes for some unique platforming especially when combined with Aaru&apos;s dash ability.
<br>
<br>For a simple concept the developers certainly push it to its absolute limits.  The later levels become extremely technical requiring immense speed and precision.  Although the first couple stages help get the player into a rhythm it still seems like the difficulty ramps up a bit too quickly.  I don&apos;t mind a challenge but I definitely didn&apos;t realize what I was getting into.  Towards the end of the Night chapter, especially the boss stage, it became so hard I just wanted to pull my hair out.  This was the point where I stopped having fun and I decided to stop playing soon after.  (About 80% through the game)
<br>
<br>I&apos;m glad I tried this game.  It had a really unique mechanic at its core and some pretty clever level design.  My favorite part is still the wonderful art and original soundtrack.  That being said, I was so focused on trying to stay alive I didn&apos;t get to enjoy the music that much.  (Not to mention in the end I got so sick of hearing Aaru die I took off my headset.)  Whether or not you&apos;ll like this game really comes to down to how much you like a challenge.  I don&apos;t quiet have the reflexes to really enjoy this game to the end but I&apos;m sure there are gamers out there who do.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aarus-awakening/user-reviews?user_review_id=6384901">Expand</a></span>

<br>For the graphics part, I find the game to be extremely beautiful! The graphics aren&apos;t too high standard nor are they by any means low.
<br>When it comes to the actual playing of the game, I quite enjoy it. BUT it&apos;s often a really HARD game!..
<br>Which I LOVE, so many games these days are just plain EASY!
<br>This game gives you a real challenge, if you think you will not be able to handle a difficult game that might test your nerves, don&apos;t buy it.
<br>I haven&apos;t yet had any issues with bugs/crashes, so I will not comment on that part.
<br>
<br>All in all, it&apos;s a GREAT game but only for the RIGHT people.
<br>Compare it to the category it&apos;s in, which is Indie Gaming!

You say the controls are clunky, but it&apos;s probably your reflexes or lack of understanding with trajectory.
<br>
<br>Graphics:
<br>
<br>Comparable to Rayman Legends, Earthworm Jim, and Dust: An Elysian Tail. Have you ever played Chuck Rock on the SNES? The slime stuff and a few of the enemies remind me of that game too. This is a game that many 80&apos;s and 90&apos;s gamers will enjoy. If you grew up with Sega and SNES then you&apos;ll feel at home with this game too. The price was a bit steep before it became free this month on PS4 so get it while you can.
<br>
<br>Sound and BGM:
<br>
<br>Day, Dusk, Night, Dawn, and the end game. Five BGM tracks, and very good sound design. I have to admit that you don&apos;t get much bgm for $15, but what is there is very well done.
<br>
<br>Level Design, Mechanics, and Replay Value:
<br>
<br>28 levels as far as I can tell. I&apos;m very close to the end though, so the game is rather short. There is a leaderboard system in place, and until the PS4 is hackable, the scores posted will remain legit. Since I don&apos;t play the PC version, so I can&apos;t claim that the controls are well done for PC, HOWEVER... they are very fluid on PS4. I have no clue what you guys are complaining about. If you want another game that lets you map your controls then this isn&apos;t one of them.
<br>
<br>You dash with L1 and Teleport with R1 and R2. That&apos;s three buttons, the x button mafia probably hates this, but guess what? How many simple x-button masher games do you people need before you have had enough? That being said, the bumper controls are what make this game unique, and I wouldn&apos;t have it any other way.
<br>
<br>Difficulty:
<br>
<br>Here is the reason people are low balling the game. This game plays out like Super Meat Boy when you&apos;re approaching the end. There is a single level that I had some trouble with, &apos;Hopeless&apos; because you have to use everything that you&apos;ve learned through the past three boards, very rapidly AND you have to let yourself fall, then teleport, then dash. So it uses gravity, teleport, and tests your ability to split-second dash your way through breakable walls all while avoiding spikes and thorns.
<br>
<br>One hit completely decimates you in this game, making you start back at the last checkpoint, (some of which are unfairly placed.), and so I think a lot of you guys are just butthurt that you can&apos;t even beat some of these levels and get easy achievements. The shoulder buttons are flat this time around (On the PS4), so if you&apos;re playing on the PS3, yeah, you have every reason to gripe about the controller, because the PS3 controller&apos;s shoulder buttons suck.
<br>
<br>All in all, I can&apos;t recommend it on PC or PS3, because I could see how complicated the controls would be on those two platforms. I do, however, recommend it on PS4 because of the redesigned ergonomic controller. My only gripe about this game is the difficulty.
<br>
<br>Aaru&apos;s Awakening has a steep learning curve for those of us that are not naturally good at trajectory or banking shots off of corners. This is a game for you if you are one of those pool shark kinda people, you&apos;ll absolutely love the mechanics. There is a lot of thought needed to get around some of the challenging obstacles that the levels throw at you.
<br>
<br>Fifteen words summary:
<br>
<br>Aaru&apos;s Awakening is great fun for pool sharks and people that enjoyed Contra or Worms.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/aarus-awakening/user-reviews?user_review_id=5172627">Expand</a></span>
