<br>1) Subject matter is cool  My Space ninja is gonna slap ya crappy steampunk back into the 80&apos;s!
<br>2) Graphics  Very good, and i like the rather bleak and moody feel.
<br>3) Gameplay is smooth and easy, as is the matchmaking. Missions are fast paced, but everyone seems chilled and tolerant of newbie starters.
<br>4) But mainly its because its fun to play. Controls are solid, as is the gunplay. Melee is a bit frantic, but there is nothing wrong with it.
<br>5) Its free (ish). But I don&apos;t think they quite understood the idea of MICRO transactions. The store is very expensive which I think will harm the game in the long run. Its probably at least double what most people would expect. Although I would normally buy some initial credits to support the game writer, here its just to expensive to feel comfortable with.
<br>
<br>Overall, I think this is a great game to grab the odd 30mins on here and there. Play for free, and I cant see how you could be disappointed!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3164459">Expand</a></span>

One of the best free to play games I&apos;ve played.  I would highly recommend experiencing it with your friends as it was meant to be played  cooperatively and it&apos;s a far more fun than when played solo.</span>

The leveling system recently underwent a massive change, which made the game more challenging.  It also opened up a much wider spectrum of upgrade possibilities than was available previously.  The game still has some small room for improvement, but it is a heck of a lot of fun to play--and it&apos;s FREE!!

<br>
<br>Positive:
<br>-Game graphics look Great
<br>
<br>-big selection of weapons
<br>
<br>-good selection of warframes
<br>
<br>-large amount of missions
<br>
<br>-able to get most items without spending real life money
<br>
<br>-fun for first little bit until you have replaced all your starting weapons
<br>Negative:
<br>-Skills are pretty much exact same on different frames with different strength and slight variations to graphics to make them look different. (excalibur last skill kills stuff in ring around you with lances, saryn kills things in ring around you with poison, ash slashes people in a circle around you... realize a pattern here?)
<br>
<br>- Everything is overpriced or a cash grab(more than most mmos)... Last patch they added 3 colors into their store with different shades (red, white and blue) for 4th of July and charge 5$ for it, 10-15$ for weapons and up to 20$ for the good frames
<br>
<br>-boss fights aren&apos;t really boss like. a boss run online takes about 3 minutes and 80% of that is running to the boss and to the exit (while ignoring mobs)
<br>
<br>-mod variety is pretty nice but you stick to pretty much exact same build for each one
<br>
<br>-no real customization besides colors (your frame and weapons are the same as everyone else&apos;s)
<br>
<br>-only a few of the weapons are really used (boltor,latron,paris,hek)
<br>
<br>-semi autos kill your finger. dual semi auto pistols have a clip of 30 and can hold 200+ rounds and you can only fire bullets one click at a time. is fine in most shooters but most shooters don&apos;t have 300 or more enemies in some of the games.
<br>
<br>-missions are extremely repetitive and have the share the same layout
<br>
<br>-storyline... not really much of one, you kind of bounce back and forth killing people in different areas. boss has a bit of a back story to explain why you are killing him but majority of missions have almost no explanation and just a goal.
<br>
<br>- hosts can lag really bad and if you are a bad host player you can&apos;t choose to let someone else host
<br>
<br>-game is mostly farming oriented with no real end game. you gather materials to build different weapons (eventually reaching the point where you just build weapons for the sake of building weapons) then you farm mods(weapon and frame buffs) which you fuse to other mods
<br>
<br>-if you have a rare blueprint, mod or item drop you must finish the entire mission. If you need to leave because of real life, internet crashes, fail the mission, the game crashes because of your setting or because its in beta and is unstable your screwed out of the drop.
<br>
<br>Overall:
<br>Good for killing time but not worth sinking money into it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3271703">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>+Fun gameplay with a lot of different methods of customization. Modding your weapons, warframe(character), and sentinel(Pet) provides a lot of different avenues for progression.
<br>+There are (I believe)12 warframes to pick from, though you only get access to 3 out of the box.
<br>+You can potentially get access to all the content in the game w/o spending any money, excluding cosmetics such as colors.
<br>+A welcoming community and a section of the forum dedicated to helping new players and gets a respectable amount of traffic
<br>
<br>And now the low note. This is going to hurt, Warframe, but try to grit your teeth.
<br>---If you do decide to spend money on the game, you&apos;ll find Warframe has one of the most expensive premium shops around. Buying a warframe can cost up to 25 dollars! Getting access to more than 18 colors(Not as many as it sounds) is 5$ a piece, and weapons range 5-15$!
<br>
<br>-----After you&apos;ve spent hours farming the cash and crafting mats to build a weapon or warframe, you have to wait 12-72 hours for it to finish &quot;building&quot;. But wait! If you spend a paultry 25-50 plat(The least plat you can buy is 5$ for 70 plat, the cheapest weapons, colors, and warframes being 75 plat, btw) you can rush it to get your hard-earned buy immediately. A laughably obvious inconvenience forced on the players in order to promote buying premium currency
<br>
<br>-The combat gets dull, after a while. The AI is pretty primitive, even for an indie game. Melee is gimmicky and with knockbacks and stuns abound, you&apos;re better off just keeping distance and picking enemies off. The game mistakes punishment for difficulty, if you&apos;re not careful it&apos;s very easy to be &quot;stunlocked&quot; to death, with very little you can do about it.
<br>
<br>-Expect a Diablo-level grind. The whole game is a grind and the only goal is to grind more, all the bosses are bullet sponges with little to no difficulty, the Infected(An enemy faction) are generally the hardest enemies you will fight, and that&apos;s only because of the stunlocking mentioned above.
<br>
<br>-Even though there are lots of options and customization, the game is plagued with balance issues. The Hek, Lex, and Dual Heat Blades will be the only weapon loadout you&apos;ll ever need. Half the cast can&apos;t even compete with other much stronger, more versatile Warframes. Health, Armor, and critical hit/damage mods are almost completely useless.
<br>
<br>-The levels are reused constantly. It&apos;s not uncommon to play on the same level multiple times within one short gaming session.
<br>
<br>-The handling leaves a lot to be desired. The game tries to be Assassin&apos;s Creed/Darksiders but it just doesn&apos;t have the polish things like wallrunning, sliding, and complex maneuvers need to function. Very rarely will you pull off super awesome stunts your friends will be wowed by. Once you get into the higher level content it all boils down to cover shooting because you just will not survive being in the middle of the grinder.
<br>
<br>To sum it all up, you pay out the ass for the conveniences premium currency offers, the game gets stale and very grindy, very quickly. I&apos;ve read people praising the massive updates but they apply sweeping changes that completely alter the game, keeping it in a perpetual state of imbalance.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3123387">Expand</a></span>

First off, I kept asking myself, didn&apos;t I just play that level?  Because I pretty much did just play that level.  It&apos;s the same thing, over and over and over and over and over again.
<br>Even then, the movement and combat mechanics seemed pretty awesome.  If that was the only thing I was basing my rating on, that would be an 8.5.
<br>But the real kicker to the groin is the real money system.  $20 will get you a cheap warframe, a weapon, and some respawns. (So if you die a lot, you end up having to pay just to continue playing the game)
<br>If you really want everything, you can pay $260, and you after some time you may end up spending even more money.
<br>Their greed has completely ruined what could have been great.  If, instead of charging us large sums for absolutely nothing, they had provided a wealth of content and charged us reasonable prices, they could have had a gold mine, but right now the game tailors to spoiled rich kids.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3064311">Expand</a></span>

I wouldn&apos;t mind so much if I could actually improve my skills without having to spend real life money to buy &apos;platinum&apos;. Since the credits you earn from missions is a pathetic sum compared to the cost of powering up your mods (without mods you basically have a lv30 Warframe that&apos;s as strong as a lv1). You get a maximum of 5000 credits if you farm the first boss for an item he drops worth 2500 credits 100% of the time. Building a new Warframe is also a chore, it costs 35k for the master blueprint, you then have to farm the specific boss for blueprints for helmet, chassis and systems. Not only will this take forever because of poor droprates, the parts also cost 25k each to build and 24 hours build time. You then have to build the Warframe for 25k more with a build time of 72 hours. We&apos;re already at 135k, but it doesn&apos;t end there! You also need an &apos;Orokin Reactor&apos; to supercharge your Warframe, or you will be stuck at 50% of it&apos;s maximum potential. These only drop from rare alerts that have special rewards, with those Reactors being just about the rarest to come by. Once you finally get the blueprint for that, it takes another 35k to build that. So we&apos;re at 170k for a second Warframe. Couple this with MAYBE max 40k an hour for farming, and you&apos;re grinding the same mission over and over for at least 4.5 hours. Everything takes months in this game without spending real life money, for which in game items have a ridiculous price. Buying the pack for the Warframe &apos;Frost&apos; (1 Warframe, 1 primary, 1 secondary and 1 melee) costs a whopping 60 USD. I can easily buy 5 great games for that kind of money in Steam sales which won&apos;t bore me to tears like Warframe does.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3061968">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are amazing and the gameplay is also good.

<br>Sure its F2P and EA, but if you decide to actually invest in it you do not get much for it:

<br>Of course there is the lack of P2W but that involves a relentless grind. So much grinding that it feels like the deliberately made it this way so you would not be bothered with it and spend money.
<br>
<br>There is no story at all.
<br>Tactics are limited to grouping up and hoping your teammates are able to help and cooperate. It is possible to work together I suppose but there is no easy way of communicating.
<br>
<br>Level design is repetitive yet confusing yet repetitive. Maps are divided in little zones and objectives are show by a logo at the edge of the zone you are currently in. Sometimes its just down the corridor, other times you have to look for a small hole in the wall way up or below, while enemies relentlessly attack you. If you die you can be revived by a teammate but if they are up ahead they will not be able to make it within 15 seconds before bleeding out. You can revive on the spot (enemies still there, surrounding your corpse and blocking your escape) up to 4 times a day for free. Do you need more? Wait or pay up!
<br>
<br>All in all they need more diversity in the levels, AI, increase loot drops a bit and offer way more value for the currency you can buy. Be aware of price differences between their website and steam packages, also buying more does not mean more platinum for your money!
<br>
<br>It is something that can grab your attention and keep it for a month but the grinding and repetitiveness will make you look for the next better thing.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=5077802">Expand</a></span>

Keep that in mind when you fight a boss or clear a mission 20 times in a row to get that one weapon part that won&apos;t show it&apos;s face.  This game is grindy and tedious and repetitive and even a bit glitchy at times.   But why do I, as well as millions of other people enjoy playing it so much?  Style.  Any other game would pull the aforementioned grind off horribly.  It takes a team like the one at Digital Extremes, the developers of Unreal Tournament, to make this work.  Warframe is one of the only games where you can front flip forward and land on your sword lodged in a space nazi and pump his buddies full of shotgun shells that explode.  The combat is fast fluid and fun.  The graphics are marvelous even on the lowest settings possible, and it&apos;s free to play.  The words Free To Play usually has a stigma behind it, as it usually can mean, &quot;Pay-To-Win&quot;.  Warframe is more along the lines of &quot;Pay-To-Win-Faster&quot;, as nearly everything in the game can be acquired without spending real money.   Sure, you can buy one of the best guns in the game, but then you still have to level it up, fit it with the appropriate mods, level up the mods, and learn how to use it to the best of your ability.
<br>
<br>So in conclusion, This game barely get by with an 8, only because it has had enough content and fun and style to keep me on it for nearly 1000 hours now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=6572992">Expand</a></span>

But the feeling of playing this game in particular with the level cap isn&apos;t just there anymore. And yes, players of this game says &quot;Who cares about level caps when you get to play with big ass weapons?&quot; Well, actually most of us. I played this game for just about 3-4 days I think. This is just a constructive criticism guys.

There is no pay to win system, and everything including the &apos;premium currency&apos; can be earned without paying a dime.  Having a group to play with makes it much better.  Its rather grindy but thats the kind of genre its supposed to be.  For people who like games like Borderlands, Destiny, and PoE.  And since I&apos;m writing this at the same time that Destiny 2 is newly released on PC, this game has loads more content and reasons to keep playing that Destiny.  The only thing I&apos;d give this game on Destiny 2 is the overall polish and graphics.  Besides that, this F2P game blows a triple A title like Destiny 2 out of the water and if anything exposes how complacent the gaming community has become with these huge publishers just recycling assets, slapping a new title on it, adding some micro transactions, and calling it good.  Give you money to a dev team who truly cares about their playerbase and continues to innovate instead of making money grabs.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=7652782">Expand</a></span>

<br>In general, I hate first-person shooters.  I love Warframe, and it keeps getting better and better because it&apos;s a constant work in progress.  A lot of the original complaints about the game -- repetition, relatively few levels, uninspired bosses, etc. are being addressed and disappearing.  Many of the bosses are incredibly unique and require some creativity, not just having maximum levels and equipment and aiming skills, in order to beat them.
<br>Think Halo meets Ninja Gaiden.
<br>
<br>What I love about Warframe that sets it so far apart from other shooters is the mobility the Tenno have (bullet jump, double jump, run along and up walls with no limits, gliding descent) combined with the strong diversity of strategies.  You have your heavy armor Tenno who can power through a bullet blizzard while mowing down hordes of hideous Grineer with a giant axe, you have the master of deception that can get them all shooting at the wrong target while picking baddies off by the dozen with a modded sniper, a Tenno who can unleash an ability that makes all the baddies shoot at each other, and many, many others, all of whom are roughly equally viable when you get the strategy right.
<br>
<br>Graphics are really freaking good for a free-to-play game.  Great use of my graphics card.  Looks like it actually belongs on PS4/XB1 instead of being simplistic crap you usually get with F2P.
<br>
<br>And it&apos;s not &quot;pay to win&quot; because you can&apos;t buy levels, can&apos;t buy experience, and can&apos;t buy your way into the next areas.  Everything that&apos;s available to buy can also be farmed, with the exception of decorations.  It&apos;s &quot;pay to skip farming,&quot; which can get repetitive if you&apos;re trying to build up to make something specific.  But I guess that&apos;s what keeps you playing -- that there&apos;s more to keep getting.  Also, increasing Mastery Rank requires building up affinity with many different pieces of equipment, so not only are you rewarded for trying out multiple different loadouts and strategies, you *have to* try out different loadouts and strategies if you want to progress further in the game.  You won&apos;t like every single loadout, but it turns out it&apos;s really more a matter of style and which enemies you&apos;re facing than it is a matter of &quot;there are only a few good weapons and Tenno.&quot;
<br>
<br>The best Free to Play game available on any platform.  100% recommend.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=6894001">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Gfx:
<br>Solid.  The optimization for physx sucks, but the game looks amazing without it.
<br>
<br>Audio:
<br>You could say it&apos;s ok. Gun sounds are, often, allright, although most of them just lack the oomph part. Ingame music is like any other. You&apos;ll turn it off after a few hours and play your favorite playlist.
<br>Ambient sounds, like bullet ricochets, doors, elevators, are too quiet.
<br>
<br>Content:
<br>Apparently, DE thinks quantity&gt;quality. In 2 words, power creep. It just doesn&apos;t work.
<br>In a lot more words,
<br>The mod system looks intriguing and as if it offers a lot of diversity, but in reality you&apos;ll be using the same set of mods for every enemy type and every mission. Basically, there are unused useless mods and mandatory mods.
<br>When you look at the mission map, you get the feeling you&apos;ll have to play a very long time in order to
<br>experience everything. Wrong. each tileset can be fully experienced, and gotten sick of, within several missions.
<br>The game offers boss fights! Awesome, right? When majority of the boss mission is running around 1shotting everything with your ubermodded weapon, and then killing a boss vastly inferior to your weapons, it&apos;s quite a meh experience.
<br>The newly added syndicates are yet another example of quantity&gt;quality. 10 &quot;different&quot; factions, that all require the player to do 1 thing : grind mindlessly and endlessly.
<br>
<br>Guns:
<br>In correlation with previously mentioned power creep, there are uber awesome weapons and there are useless and unfun weapons. It&apos;s all fun and games while you&apos;re ranking up fun weapons, but run out of fun weapons and it becomes a chore worse than washing the dishes.
<br>DE isn&apos;t doing much to remedy this issue, but rather adding more weapons hoping they&apos;ll hit the right note occasionally.
<br>
<br>Grind:Reward ratio
<br>Grind&apos;s not always bad, if you reward the player. This game doesn&apos;t do that.
<br>Currently, there are plans to reward players with a high master rank(a general progress indicator), but it&apos;s all just paper.
<br>The newly added syndicates require such an enormous amount of farming to reach useful rewards that it&apos;s a major turn off for casual players.
<br>RNG drops. When the gods are on your side, it&apos;s a fun night, otherwise it&apos;s pretty frustrating seeing a weapon part, that you already have 10 of, drop mission after mission.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer factor:
<br>The game can be played solo, which is good but also says a lot about how much developers are investing in player to player interaction.
<br>There&apos;s the mandatory general chat, trade chat, guild chat, group chat, friends chat. That&apos;s it sadly.
<br>There IS a player hub planned, but seeing the previews, it&apos;s not really promising.
<br>Clans can have their own &quot;dojos&quot;, but they end up being large abandoned museums of someone&apos;s creativity.
<br>Oh right, PVP. There IS pvp, but it&apos;s a sideshow, and a really bad one.
<br>
<br>The feel:
<br>First couple mastery levels(namely 8) - &quot;Cool, I&apos;m getting these mastery levels I don&apos;t know **** about, while trying out all these fun weapons. I don&apos;t care I have no idea what they do, it&apos;s cool and awesome.&quot;
<br>Post 8 - &quot;Ugh, yet another **** weapon to level to get mastery up.&quot; *checks inventory and sees 20 more rank 0* &quot;yeah, **** it.&quot;
<br>The fact that the game is discouraging use of single equipment a player finds fun, is rather baffling.
<br>
<br>P2W factor:
<br>The only mandatory platinum market purchases are inventory slots and weapon power ups, called potatoes.(they increase the mod capacity of a weapon by 100%)
<br>Thankfully they&apos;re pretty cheap and the powerups can occasionally be gained on special mission.
<br>Other than that, everything is attainable through farming, albeit it&apos;ll take much longer.
<br>
<br>Summary:
<br>The game doesn&apos;t feel new, but it sure feels fun the first 100 hours. If you don&apos;t mind being played a fool with &quot;new&quot; content based on the same principle, grind, you can keep being a positive statistic on their charts.
<br>The quite positive thing is the nearly non existent P2W factor.
<br>Basically, if you REALLY have nothing better to play, or have a fetish for ninjas in space, this is the game you can sink your money into.
If not, wait for a 50% platinum discount, buy some platinum in the worth of an average indie game, buy inventory slots and kill time.
Contrary to what fanbois preach, this is NOT an AAA title.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=4796601">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s also absolutely one of the best examples of a free to play game out there. Spending cash on this game gets nothing that it unachievable by a non paying customer other than cosmetics. Market prices are expensive, but not on everything, just on the stuff that&apos;s a punishment for not playing the game(ie if you want to skip way ahead you&apos;re going to have to PAY for it. Either put in the game time or expect to pay a premium price). The items that really influence your experience(item and warframe slots and super chargers) are pretty cheaply obtained, and you can trade in game for the currency to do so from other players, meaning even a completely free player can purchase anything in the cash shop through dedication and trading. It&apos;s also extremely fun, you should be playing it right now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=4291053">Expand</a></span>

I have never played a game where the developers do such a great job of adding content on a regular basis. The game in itself is one of the best I&apos;ve ever played. It has a steep learning curve for understanding mods, upgrades, crafting, etc, but it&apos;s well worth it! 11/10 easy</span>

<br>
<br>For those who say: It&apos;s a repetitive grinding game, i&apos;ll say:
<br>Each major update (we are currently on the 14th) you have several new weapons, new warframes, new ennemies, new bosses, new maps, new game mechanics, new interface, new story, new Gameplay (!!!!), new mods........
<br>If you want a funny game that evolves REALLY, Warframe is, in my opinion THE BEST game you can reach. And you know what? It(s freeee... i see some bad ratings dated &quot;2013&quot;. Come back here, and dare say the same thing. (Impossible, it&apos;s not the same game anymore). It&apos;s true.
<br>
<br>If you are affraid about pay to win Games:
<br>You can get EVERYTHING without any dollar if you are perseverant, and have a lot of time to spend in a game.
<br>Plus, you CANNOT have everything with virtual money. In fact, you can only buy specific things with virtual money. You can spend 400000000 dollars, you will still have to play a lot to get resources, and craft, and up your rank...
<br>Plus you can actually trade virtual money with other players. So, you can get it without any dollar.
<br>
<br>For those who say: &quot;uh, mom, it&apos;s so hard, and this player in my party is so cheat that i&apos;m sure he paid, it&apos;s unfair&quot;: Grow up.

<br>
<br>For me as an founder (playing since the closed beta) i can really understand that many people criticize(d) issues like bad AI, melee system, being forced to spend real money and other stuff.
<br>I can all agree with them. But the game as a whole has continously improved.
<br>
<br>Improvements (Pro):
<br>
<br>1) Clans, Relais (trading/ interaction with other players)
<br>2) improved AI
<br>3) individual moves for all kinds of weapons, overall new stamina/ damage/ skill system
<br>4) quests which grant you access to new frames, weapons equipment and least but not least A STORY.
<br>5) almost no necessity to spend real money since almost everything, beside accesoires and decoration,
<br>can be obtain from farming/ trading
<br>6) areas like the Void (unique drops) can now be accessed without spending money for keys (5)
<br>
<br>Points of criticism (Con):
<br>1) still a pain in the arse to farm some rare ressources
<br>2) minor bugs
<br>3) repetitive map design on some tilesets
<br>4) it takes a lot of time to craft some wepons or other equipment
<br>5) the game isn&apos;t very self explaining and thus very confusing for new players
<br>6) some ressources can only be obtained by checking &quot;alerts&quot; which grant you the cance to farm your
<br>desired stuff... so check the alert section all the time
<br>7) to get more weapon/ warframe-slots you HAVE to spend money (i think 3 slots for frames, primary,
<br>secondary, melee)
<br>
<br>Conclusion:
<br>So in the end i would say Warframe is a very good game afterall. Of course there are a lot of points to criticize, but it&apos;s F2P. If you have any problems ingame you will always get help from other players (personal experience). Allthough Warframe is a very simple game it is still fun to play (solo or coop), because you have a variety of playstyles to choose from and a now very solid storyline to follow.
<br>
<br>with kind regards

<br>However, this game has no longevity and is a large grind to get certain things you want. Not to mention that if you want to get to late game, there are certain items that are gatekeepers to the late game that you have to -buy- with money just to proceed into the game. Or you have to wait for them to do a livestream and MAKE a special alert for said items.
<br>
<br>This game is good for a small time frame, but it sadly just does not hold my attention. If want to grind for items, I&apos;ll play an MMORPG that actually rewards you for something that&apos;s impactful rather than farming for a new skin of something that already exists.

<br>
<br>Oh, maybe I didn&apos;t make myself clear enough. When I say that Warframe is free, I mean, literally speaking, it is free. Still not clear enough? Alright, I&apos;ll elaborate. Apart from two different types of items - appearance items (such as skins and coloring pallets) and weapon/Warframe slots - it is possible for all players to access almost all types of in game items and entities (apart from a few that are no longer available to everyone). In this manner, it is possible for you to obtain every Warframes (characters or so to speak), every weapons, every non-visual-based items and the likes. Of course, there are conditions to fulfill, and obtaining everything will most likely take up a good portion of your time (isn&apos;t this what you are looking for?), but the point is, it is perfectly possible to play Warframe in the long run without paying a single cent. It&apos;s your choice.

<br>So, what is Warframe? In this game, you are basically a character known as &quot;Tenno&quot; who fights battles within a futuristic solar system. You will be teaming up with 3 other Tennos (this is a 4 player co-op game) to complete missions laid out by Lotus, a female commander issuing you orders. Nah, she is nicer than your ex-girlfriend, so don&apos;t worry about that.
<br>
<br>You will basically be facing three separate forces, Grineer, Corpus and the Infestation (think of the three races in Starcraft if you want to get a better idea). There are different types of missions, ranging from elimination, rescue, spy, to defense and rescue. As for weapons, basically you get to equip a primary weapon (rifle, shotgun, sniper and many others that are hard to categorize), a secondary weapon (categorization is hard for this as well) and a melee weapon (sword, mace, fist... you know the deal). As for your character, you will be using one out of the somewhat 10-ish (slightly less than 20, though the number is gradually increasing as more update comes by) Warframes. Each Warframe comes with different stats, such as self-repairing shields, like those in halo, health, energy (mana) and speed. Still, more importantly, each Warframe has its own unique set of 4 skills. These skills are great assets for the players as most of the times they will come in handy. One thing to note is that gender is preset, so those transsexuals don&apos;t have to fake their gender anymore, which is, well ... you decide if it&apos;s good or not. There are also mods (modifications) that you can insert into your weapons and Warframes to make them much stronger than they originally are.
<br>
<br>Oh and there are parkour. Learn how to press &quot;WASD&quot; + &quot;LShift&quot; + &quot;LCtrl&quot; + &quot;Space&quot; in fluid coordination. It will be helpful and painful, but you will definitely need them.
<br>
<br>Simple?
<br>
<br>Unlike many co-op shooters, Warframe definitely has its merits. One of the most apparent distinction of the game is that it has a leveling system that can be found in most MMOs. You can level up both your weapons and Warframes to a maximum rank of 30. Moreover, you can rank up your mods as well to make them more powerful. In this way, Warframe won&apos;t be a simple &quot;run-shoot-kill see-score go-sleep&quot; type of game. Never. There are things more important than that.
<br>
<br>Another merit of Warframe is that there are frequent updates. When I say frequent, I mean FREQUENT, as in one big update per month or so. There will be new game modes, Warframes, weapons, mods ... etc. I mean, come on, who thinks that L4D2 came too fast after L4D1 is released? I do. Who is still waiting for L4D3 after all these years? I am. Who thinks that Gabe Newell should fulfill the unsaid promise of completing the trilogies of Valve games? I do. Come on, we have been waiting for L4D3 and Portal 3 and HL3, and we are sick and tired of being sick and tired of waiting. This won&apos;t happen for Warframe though. The game has a gradual and comfortable pace of updating. You get new contents every now and then, and they usually blends well with the game. Usually.
<br>
<br>Still, like most games, there are pros and cons of Warframe and I have to sincerely admit that there are shortcomings with this game when compared to other games. One major shortcoming (I won&apos;t say flaw) of this game is that it lacks a concrete story line. Apart from some trivial storytelling, there really aren&apos;t much of a tale going on. There are stories told, I&apos;m not saying there aren&apos;t, but they are rather weak. I know, that is not their aim, and that is not really the point of Warframe, but compared to the rich (though monotonous) storyline of L4D and Portal, Warframe needs to good a better job here.
<br>
<br>Also, the game can be rather repetitive. You know, this applies for most Coop shooters, so there really isn&apos;t much to say about this. Yeah, repetitive.
<br>
<br>So, in general, try Warframe. It&apos;s free. If you don&apos;t like it, drop it. Simple as that.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3978707">Expand</a></span>

<br>Warframe is a constantly evolving game with new things added frequently.
<br>The fairest pay model I have ever seen. EVERYTHING but cosmetics can be acquired through normal gameplay, and cosmetics that cannot be acquired through normal gameplay can be acquired by selling materials or blueprints you do not need for the premium currency.
<br>
<br>However, Warframe still has yet to polish its new player experience, which holds the game back. A proper intro and tutorial are needed badly for any future expansion of its playerbase. As of now, getting started is the most difficult part of Warframe.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=4054649">Expand</a></span>

I usually play Warframe within a time frame of maybe 30 minutes to 3 hours, depending if I am playing with others or not. The leveling system in this game is unique within itself. You level your profile (or Mastery) rank, which allows you to unlock some of the later weapons, and there are the levels that your weapons gain over time. It is true that the game does get repetitive, but it&apos;s nice to always come back after a while. I do recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good game in Third Person.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=4415713">Expand</a></span>

<br>As this game develops, it gets better and better.
<br>The lore is taking shape, the UI is more intuitive, new game play mechanics are being implemented and old ones improved or revamped among other positive changes that enhance the game experience as it continues to develop in Beta.
<br>
<br>The developers have a good reputation with the players of the Warframe Community.
<br>They involve themselves in the forums, communicate to players via social media, and are also involved in the in-game chat. Working closely with the community, they have been able to tailor the game to what the players are looking for.
<br>
<br>Being in beta, there is always room for improvement.
<br>With each update release, the game gets buggy but you can expect that with most games during update phases - especially online multiplayer games. Smooths out with the hot fixes.
<br>The game is not perfect yet but I gave it a 10 because of how much it has improved since the time of its release. I also gave it a 10 because of the relationship the developers have with the players.
<br>
<br>I have been playing since closed beta but have only been actively playing since Update 9.
<br>I really like how much the game has changed and I think I will be playing for a while longer.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=4371596">Expand</a></span>

<br>- Great tutorial and start to the game
<br>
<br>Cons
<br>- VERY repetitive maps. I don&apos;t find the actual gameplay to be repetitive at all, in fact the gameplay get&apos;s funner every time i play it, but the maps sure as heck are repetitive. dozens and dozens of different missions and i&apos;ve only noticed about 5 unique maps.(keep in mind i haven&apos;t unlocked all planets but my statement still stands).
<br>
<br>- No real story. When i first started playing it started off with a cool quest to hunt down someone who tried to capture you, and it seemed like this would lead into a really cool and interesting story. Unfortunately after you complete this quest, any remnants of a story disappears, and the game just becomes nothing more than hunting for loot to build more gear and doing the occasional event.
<br>
<br>This game is amazing and has amazing potential. If a proper and immerse story and allot more unique maps are added. This will without a doubt be my favorite game of all time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=4385501">Expand</a></span>

But the repetitive gamplay is the problem for players who get tired easily, but this is still being developed so in the future, this game be a more fun for players and maybe they can get a higher rating compared to now.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=4437758">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>And the ai feels dated by roughly ten years.

<br>Alot.
<br>The level design is incredibly boring and you only shoot and slice with your katana/sword/thingy.
<br>I really did not appreciate this game after 1-2 hours of gameplay. And it took forever to get ANYTHING. Not even a single weapon or upgrade after 2,5 hours gameplay. Not even an item to build.
<br>
<br>Not recommending. But since it&apos;s free, try it.</span>

It requires a significant investment of time, and if you want to make any real progress, money as well. This is just part of my review from my steam profile:
<br>
<br>One word review: Disappointing
<br>
<br>More details: This is a game that starts off really promising. Interesting controls, large variety of weapons, numerous ways to level up and progress, seems like it has it all.
<br>Unfortunately it crumbles under it&apos;s own weight. Numerous ways to level up turn into an extended grind game that is overwhelming. The large variety of weapons turns into a double edged sword, which requires an explanation of the mastery system.
<br>Each weapon, warframe, and anything else you can take with you to level up has a cap of level 30. The levels that you acquire during gameplay all contribute points towards a mastery system. The mastery system caps how much progress you can make in a given day towards other aspects of the game.
<br>
<br>There is a faction type system in a game called syndicates. The items offered by these syndicates are generally considered extremely good, and cannot be acquired any other way. The problem with this syndicate system, is that the points you can acquire each day is capped at a rather low number. Add to this problem with points that are capped universally. You may have 10000 faction points you can make in that day, but that&apos;s across ALL factions.
<br>In certain syndicate themed missions, you can search for insignias, that you can turn in to a vendor for additional syndicate points, sometimes worth more points than the mission themselves, but there are at max 8 of these in a given mission, and it is an exhaustive search through very large missions that can sometimes border on futility. The worst part is if you decide to do these missions with other people, but they decide they don&apos;t feel like searching for all of them, and rush to the mission end point, you will be forced to end the mission after a 1 minute timer. You CANNOT replay these missions, and if it ends early, you could be out of potentially thousands of points.
<br>Naturally I did most of these missions solo, even though the rest of the game recommends, and is designed for group play. I will add I also did Spy missions solo, as even 1 person in your group triggering an alarm, can lead to the entire group failing the mission.
<br>
<br>The biggest problem with the mastery system, and where the game really collapses under is own weight is leveling the weapons. There are so many filler weapons in this game, that are commonly called &quot;mastery fodder&quot;, that acquiring these mastery points becomes a chore. It takes time to level weapons, made all the worse by leveling weapons that are weak, and not fun to use. You can tell very quickly when a weapon you are using is terrible.
<br>This is aggravated by the fact that you are limited to how many weapons, warframes, etc, that you can have in your inventory. Unless you are willing to buy premium currency, which of course costs real money, you cannot increase your inventory size. That has been an issue since the game came out years ago, along with many other issue which I will go into later.
<br>Numerous weapons and warframes, that you might have actually liked, will be sold and discarded, all because you don&apos;t have space for them, unless you&apos;re willing to fork over a lot of money. The game gets to the point where you might be looking at hundreds of dollars of investments, if you&apos;re willing to make significant progress in this game. The day and age that we live in with steam sales, bundle packs, and numerous other sources of price discounts for quality games, makes the $50-$60 retail game almost a thing of the past. This game will be looking for much more money out of your pocket.
<br>
<br>In addition to leveling up the weapons for mastery points, you also level these weapons for mod slot points. At level 30 you have 30 mod points to empower your weapon. The mods ALSO require leveling up, however they don&apos;t level up from use, but rather by sacrificing other mods to level them up. In addition to sacrificing mods in this process, you ALSO use up credits, which is the games fictional currency. This can be one of the most expensive parts of the game is terms of credit use. Unfortunately, the developers of the game seem to be aggressively cracking down on ways to farm credits, which in and of themselves are still excessive time sinks.
<br>Leveling mods and farming credits are one of the longest processes in the game, however Digital Extremes is all too happy to offer ways to boost your credit income, or level up mods, for your platinum in their premium stores. I think it says enough that one of the most popular store purchases are fusion cores, which help level up your mods, at an extremely overpriced platinum amount. I want to say it was the equivalent of $5, but i could be wrong. Either way, it was still overpriced given the amount of other things Digital Extremes wants you to buy....</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=5277234">Expand</a></span>

However after countless hours of playing I have to say the critics were kind. This game has MAJOR flaws the number 1 flaw of this game is that the entire game is just grind ALL OF IT, it gives you the impression that the grinding will pay off eventually but it doesn&apos;t. You get no where there is no end game NOTHING, you just find a new weapon or a new character and level them up.
<br>
<br>Another flaw is not really of the game but more the development team. The team is completely mis-staffed there is too many content creators and not enough people left to fix stuff, amongst the playerbase there is a popular opinion of the team that creates stuff isn&apos;t the team who fixes issues within the game. That is correct but the real issue is resource management.
<br>
<br>Overall game design and direction come into play also. There seems to be a severe lack of clear direction when it comes to overall balance. At first they took the stand of every weapon should be balanced and compensated with mods. However now they seemed to have changed their view on it in favor of a tiering system that is utterly broken. Generally a tiering system works in a way that weapons that require higher stats out preform those with lower requirements. This is not the case it just appears to be random.
<br>
<br>This is a f2p game afterall so the monization of content has to be questioned is it good, is it bad, inbetween? Answer, its misleading. As a new player in a F2p game the first thing I do is work out how much something costs a warframe will set you back an average of 20$ weapons around 10. That is just too expensive considering the games longevity solely depends on trying different weapons and warframes.
<br>
<br>All of that being said there are still plenty of positives when it comes to this game. As other users have pointed out in much greater detail the mechanics and the sheer amount of fun that can be had whist playing in co-op are this games strong points whether they are strong enough to outweigh poor staff management and overall incompetence when it comes to game design. I don&apos;t know that is something people will have different opinions on.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3674040">Expand</a></span>

Some levels are the same looking...but I don&apos;t complain about it...why?...because its free to play and I don&apos;t have to pay! so think about that before you give it a bad review!</span>

<br>Even though the game is free to play, it is in no way pay to win, and it has a great player economy. I always set goals for things I want to get in-game, which personally makes the experience even better.

<br>Plot &#x2013; Warframe follows an ongoing narrative of the development of an evolved generation of humanity: the Tenno. The initial quest doesn&#x2019;t actually inform you of any backstory, leaving the origin behind the Warframes and Tenno a mystery. It&#x2019;s not until the quest &#x201C;The Second Dream&#x201D; we actually begin to discover the mechanics behind the Warframes and where the Tenno came from. It begins by introducing one of the main antagonists in the game: Hunhow. He appears to be talking to an army of Sentients (whom are native to the Void &#x2013; an alternative universe which is set in the past during a time known as the Orokin Era), whom are plotting the annihilation of the Tenno in a highly intriguing avalanche of events.
<br>Controls &#x2013; Featuring customisable controls, Warframe consists of a very easy to learn combat system &#x2013; also including many different combos you can choose to modify your weapons with. Although it can be difficult to newbies, grasping an idea of how to craft, initiate missions and how to effectively modify weapons can be easily developed &#x2013; and if you have too much trouble modifying, there is an &#x2018;Automatic&#x2019; option that will create the most efficient build it can for your Warframe; however in my experience, I have never found this helpful as different Warframes will require different kinds of mods and polarities to fully optimise their power, stealth and defence.
<br>About &#x2013; As of 06/10/2017, there are 34 diverse and unique Warframes to choose from &#x2013; 18 of those having a prime counterpart whom is superior, featuring more polarised spots for greater modification and increased stats; as well as a pretty pimped out look.
<br>The game has outstanding voice actors and active developers, constantly making bug fixes and doing giveaways on YouTube &#x2013; as well as constantly updating the game and keeping the users updated. However, nicknamed as &#x201C;Bugframe&#x201D; by the users, Warframe can often have small bugs &#x2013; sometimes ruining a mission, but most of the time they can be harmless or just plain annoying; but taking into consideration the fact that these bugs are quickly resolved and that this is indeed an early access game, these bugs can easily be overlooked when comparing them to the gameplay.
<br>
<br>In my experience, the main pros and cons include:
<br>PROS:
<br>&#x2022;	Highly customisable pets and warframes.
<br>&#x2022;	Great detail and graphics.
<br>&#x2022;	Amazing story line: If you&#x2019;re into Lore, everything fits together well.
<br>&#x2022;	Great voice actors.
<br>&#x2022;	Many different tasks and challenges to do when you&#x2019;ve got nothing else to do.
<br>&#x2022;	100+ different modifications.
<br>&#x2022;	Easy to learn controls and combos.
<br>&#x2022;	Diverse warframes: there&#x2019;s something for everybody, may it be stealth or chaos.
<br>&#x2022;	Create clans or join one for help and advice, these clans generally have great communities.
<br>&#x2022;	Active mods and bots to answer your questions.
<br>&#x2022;	Runs smoothly.
<br>&#x2022;	Frequently updated.
<br>&#x2022;	Not Pay-To-Win.
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>&#x2022;	Viable to crashes and bugs: not often but can happen.
<br>&#x2022;	Missions are repetitive.
<br>&#x2022;	A lot of grinding.
<br>&#x2022;	A lot of bugs.
<br>&#x2022;	Bugs.
<br>&#x2022;	Constant grinding.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=7594437">Expand</a></span>

They need to make the levels playable for 1 player and they need a grouping system to help players meet. I have a few friends on steam but none like this game so I have to find other players playing a level then hope they decide to join with me in the levels i haven&apos;t completed. The level up system takes a while 20 odd hrs playing many levels over and over. Maybe I am not great at the game. I think they need to make the Warframes interact with the AI better too like in Ninja gaiden where you can jump on them. making melee attacks have more flow. I do like the graphics, I do like the gun customization. They should have tutorials or recommendations about how to level up Warframe, rifle, pistol, melee weapon.
<br>
<br>Im not sure on the reward system but maybe Warframes should unlock instead of having to buy platinum play a level of each war frame ???
<br>
<br>Also the menu for weapons should be suited to class, Why have a lvl 4 weapon when im level 2?
<br>
<br>gave it a 7
<br>maybe 2/10 for price of platinum,
<br>7/10 for originality
<br>8/10 graphics
<br>10/10 for fun (when you find a good group of people to play with)
<br>7/10 for difficulty
<br>2/10 for sound effects  that lady says the same thing over and over.
<br>4/10 for level layout.  have to do levels over and over.
<br>0/10 game lobby (where is the game lobby)
<br>2/10 for tutorial  maybe tutorial till you reach level 2 as in make level up easier until players know each element of the game
<br>
<br>This game could be one of the best games but has a few things they need to improve on. Thus i havent yet invested into platinum as the short comings make me want to play other games
<br>
<br>If they fix the issues i mentioned it will be more appealing to players, creating a larger community.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3514579">Expand</a></span>

The melee combat in it&apos;s current state feels rather gimmicky, it really boils down to just mashing the melee button repeatedly until your enemy dies. Shooting fairs much better and it&apos;s satisfying to pick off your enemies from afar using the game&apos;s large arsenal, whether it be an automatic rifle or a good old fashioned bow. This leads me to my next problem with the game. I know that Digital Extremes has put in considerable effort into making newer environments for the game, however, it still isn&apos;t enough. Long range encounters are a rarity and it completely eliminates the need for you to ever touch the sniper rifle. Levels often take place in ships and tight corridors, which is still fun, but when overused in the way that warframe does, after a few sessions the game starts to feel like a grind, and you really get tired of the visuals, which is a shame considering Warframe has beautiful graphics, but it is marred by the repetitive art style and level design. Having said this, it still isn&apos;t enough to keep me from playing this game as it offers a great upgrade system of mods for weapons and warframe, as well and satisfying and responsive gunplay, you&apos;ll have no regrets jumping into this game, especially since the game is free and the devs are already starting to address the problems I have listed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3517812">Expand</a></span>

I am glad that his game isn&apos;t just only a PvE only kinda game but, it also has a PvP which gets pretty fun. The best part of this game is that it gets updates almost every day which is really surprising and that I&apos;ll give a 10/10 on how active the developers are. The only thing missing is MUSIC! If the developers can just put must or battle music and even on boss battles it would be perfect!
<br>
<br>Over all I&apos;ll give Warframe a 10/10 and I recommend to play this game with friends.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3965039">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Let&apos;s start with the good things first, because this game does have a few. It&apos;s a nice idea; I&apos;ve always wanted to be a ninja in deep space. The ability to craft stuff is good too, and the level design, aesthetically at least, is rather well done.
<br>
<br>Now to the bad things, and strap yourselves in, because there are lots and lots of critical flaws.
<br>
<br>Let&apos;s start with the aesthetic, or lack thereof; this game, even on the highest settings, looks awful. Half the time I didn&apos;t know what I was looking at.
<br>
<br>The sound design is terrible. The guns do not feel like guns in anyway, and the voice acting is practically criminal.
<br>
<br>The level design is linear, cramped and doesn&apos;t explore the main mechanic of the game  being a ninja. Please tell me how I am supposed to be a ninja in the corridor of a spaceship? You better get used to it too, because the levels are pretty much corridor, room, corridor, room, corridor, with no variation inbetween.
<br>
<br>On the topic of the guns, none of them have any recoil, or anything, really. There&apos;s not really much reason to use anything else other than reading the stats and deciding which of the only slightly different weapons you prefer.
<br>
<br>The UI is probably one of the worst I&apos;ve seen since ArmA II. I spent about an hour figuring out how to craft, and still to this day, I have not worked it out.
<br>
<br>The game is far too easy. I am roughly five hours in and I still have not received anything close to a challenge. This is reinforced by the all the enemies having severe mental defects. There are two types of AI, the ones that run straight at you, and the ones that stand in the same place and shoot you.
<br>
<br>The game also has one of the worst transaction models I&apos;ve seen. You get two starting characters. Want another? Sure. &#xA3;20, please. A weapon? &#xA3;5.
<br>
<br>The whole &quot;ninja&quot; thing is clunky and not well designed, many a time did I find myself stuck to a locker in a corridor full of enemies. Luckily for me, the enemies seem to just be using BB guns.
<br>
<br>Warframe is bad game. Some people will say &quot;Oh, it&apos;s still in beta, it&apos;s allowed to be bad&quot;. It&apos;s not, it&apos;s allowed to be bad if bugs are breaking it, but the core gameplay mechanics are. It&apos;s worth nothing more than to get the trading cards on Steam, and then just leaving it to rust away.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3489190">Expand</a></span>

Repetitive levels and missions that usually consist of going to a location doing something and getting out whilst hacking everything in your path to bits as you do so. It has no real story no sense of achievement just mindless hack and slash and if that&apos;s what you look for in a game go for it, after all it is free.</span>

<br>
<br>What you get: (after 2 years)
<br>-100+ Missions sharing . . .
<br>-only 5 Maps with extremely repetitive map layout
<br>-few gamemodes with the objective to kill all or defend and kill all
<br>-a very very very bad AI, best at not killing you
<br>-quiet bad game sound, most of us players have Warframe muted
<br>-long loading &amp; connecting times between missions (SSD &amp; 8-core)
<br>-lag, due to player hosted at every time
<br>-30fps or lower due to the extremely bad optimised &#x201C;Evolution Engine&#x201D; (GTX 970)
<br>-and a game being in beta for 2 years, only getting worse -&gt; most importantly more PAY2WIN.
<br>
<br>Digital Extreme: Ninjas Play Free!
<br>Players: Cool. Well it took me 5 hours but now I got this blueprint for my second weapon, what do I do with it?
<br>Digital Extreme: (Grins) First you farm a lot for the resources then you&#x2019;re going to wait 12 more hours for it to finish. OR you buy the weapon in the market for 5&#x20AC; only.
<br>Players: Oh okay, ill craft it overnight then. (night passes) Wait, now it says I don&#x2019;t have enough inventory space for it, what can I do? And what about Warframes?
<br>Digital Extreme: Pay us.
<br>
<br>I know, to make something it takes money, or passion. They have enough money, easily &#x2013; but have no idea how to make a game &#x2013; good. Grindfest =/= Fun. They don&#x2019;t listen to the community. They nerf and delete things we liked, worked ingame and implement things we never need or asked. The Devs ignore even the simplest requests. I have yet to see a more arrogant bunch of developers.
<br>
<br>No lore, you can fantasize about it, but there is none.
<br>No quests, you can call your missions quests if you want, that&#x2019;s what the developers do.
<br>No endgame, you read right, no endgame. Just the same missions and enemies all over again.
<br>
<br>But the best (worst) part about the game is the progression (experience) mechanic. Using your cool stuff to level up sounds really good, but not in Warframe. I wont go into details but I can say to use your weapon/warframe you have to level it to 30. Which takes many hours!
<br>Digital Extreme: But wait, you can buy boosters to level quicker! And a catalyst to make it 60 (not just 30)!
<br>
<br>That&#x2019;s basically what you (cant) hear but see everywhere in the whole game. Pay us &amp; grind free.
<br>I discussed a lot with people why Warframe has such a high user scoring on &#x201C;Metacritic&#x201D; and we came to the point it&#x2019;s because about the first few hours, it looks good, many weapons, warframes and a lot to do.
<br>
<br>Every update just includes more weapons MUCH more to grind, just to level them and throw away afterwards, nothing fun. There are no improvements, no engine fixes, no nothing. You spam 1 key ingame and win.
<br>
<br>It is addicting somewhat somehow (at first), you want more, better weapons, the best actually! 50 hours of grind is enough and you will have access to everything ingame. And that&#x2019;s exactly the point you realize how much time you wasted and now that you finally have your weapon - there&#x2019;s nothing more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=4645937">Expand</a></span>

First of all, there is nothing in the game that is challenging in terms of difficulty. You could pretty much walk through enemies and bosses and laugh at how easy they die. The levels, bar some variations are pretty much the same and enemies variation is lacking to say the least. The loot, which we all love and cherish is uninspired and boring. It basically consists of the same weapons plans and mods with no variations to power. The game could have inspired itself from random loot generation in the likes of Diablo and Borderlands, but decided otherwise. This pretty much means everyone has the same weapons, the same mods and the same warframes which  in my opinion provides no attachment to the character or sense of character uniqueness to the player. Last but not least is the cash shop. While I got a bundle at -75% steam summer sale, the normal prices are just too steep for any player. In addition, the only access to platinum (the currency used to purchase weapons and warframes directly, i.e. without crafring) is through the cash shop, contrary to some other f2p games where it is possible to gain small amount of the coveted currency through challenges or as rewards for difficult content.
<br>All in all, it is a good game to try and the free to play model should be incentive enough to try it out. But I would not spend more time on it since its novelty wears down pretty quickly.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3395347">Expand</a></span>

Structured around 4-man instanced missions, Warframe has a large variety of map objectives with random secondaries being added during the mission. Overall, the randomization is pretty strong, piecing together gigantic levels that are easy to get lost in. Exploration is rewarded with rare mats, bonus cash, and EXP for all your equipment. The leveling system doesn&apos;t increase the stats of your gear but instead how many mods you can slot into your equip (and how strong); combined with a low level cap of 30 (for each gear piece), it&apos;s easy for new players to jump in while veterans are rewarded with stronger mods. Everything in the cash shop, apart from skins &amp; colors, are purchasable in game or are craftable. My only major complaint right now is that the environment variety is a bit slim. Overall, Warframe is a well balanced third person shooter with tons of customization and replay value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3073559">Expand</a></span>

<br>I&apos;ve played about 50 hours.
<br>
<br>The premise is this game is very interesting, you are an assassin that can wear different suits known as &quot;Warframes&quot;. These are essentially the different characters that you can play through the game. The gameplay is PvE which resembles Mass Effect 3 multiplayer with Crysis style suits and Diablo style loot drops. Weapons and Warframes in this game can be bought with cash, in game currency, or built. Most weapons and Warframes can be made simply by farming the necessary resources.  The progression of the game starts out quite slow as the grind to acquire materials and blueprints get quite tedious.
<br>
<br>Warframe has severe balancing issues regarding the warframes themselves. Some warframes lack utility, while others are overpowered. Weapons also suffer from this same fate. Warframe introduces Mods to weapons, similar to perks in Call of Duty. Mods are also affected by a balance issue.
<br>
<br>Bugs are quite apparent in gameplay and level design, which is to be expected from an open beta game. Warframe still has a lot of kinks which need to be ironed out before it can be a worthy title.
<br>
<br>This game is supported through the purchase of platinum with can be used to purchase warframes and weapons. 75 platinum costs $5 USD, which cannot even cover costly warframes at 325 platinum. A warframe like Rhino for example would cost a ridiculous $20 USD! Platinum prices are too high, and are not competitive enough. I for one will not dump my money into something which rewards with so little value.
<br>
<br>Overall the PvE is not compelling enough and lacks incentive to progress further into the game. Warframes are a hit and miss with some being fun, while others are utterly boring. Warframe does have potential, but expect a long road ahead.
<br>
<br>Final score 6.5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3196784">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are very nice and the game play is exceptionally fun. The concept of the game is interesting and with future updates could become perfect, but that is up to the developer to decide. The ability to play solo, with friends, or with random players, allows flexibility with anyone&apos;s gaming style and there is a lot of customization you can do with your character. Granted without the ability to trade items with other players makes it a little harder to obtain some items, it does allow for a more satisfying feeling when you finally find the item that you&apos;ve been wanting for awhile.
<br>
<br>The game does feature an ingame store but I have yet to find a reason to actually use it. Most if not all of the items available in the store can be found in the game world, and seeing as the majority of content is PVE there really aren&apos;t  too many things that could be considered overpowered.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s a fun game and players should at least give it a chance before looking at the 69 that meta critic has given it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3383837">Expand</a></span>

<br>The world is vibrant, colourful and you really feel like you are exploring a future solar system.
<br>Coop gameplay is really where the game excels. Playing with friends is addictive and fun. I have personally sunk more than 100 hours into such games with my friends and the experience has never gotten old.

<br>A great game and definitely worth the money.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3857225">Expand</a></span>

I wouldn&apos;t mind it too much having bugs in a beta, I did my shares of beta and I know what it entails, what bothers me is what is not there. First, how do you expect to get new people to enjoy the game when the tutorial is so horrible?! I&apos;ve never seen a tutorial so badly done, where almost nothing is explained. Sure, you get to know to to move and kill enemies but that&apos;s it, some commands are not explained (like changing weapons, even though the tutorial *asks* you to do it, not even a &quot;this key by default&quot; prompt) the missions are not explained, the forge is not explained and neither are the mods. If the missions were easy to understand, it wouldn&apos;t be a problem but how you&apos;re supposed to know that, in order to capture a target (which you&apos;re ordered not to kill at any cost) you have to *shoot* it
<br>The game is pretty, I&apos;ll give it that, it&apos;s smooth, runs well and I will admit that the slick look of the warframes and the cooperative side of it is what got me to try. The cooperative is more &quot;free for all&quot; than real cooperation, with people rushing in to get the goods before the others.
<br>A big disappointment for me, and I might give it another try when the glaring flaws have been fixed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3877827">Expand</a></span>

I have leveled four warframes and numerous weapons to rank 30. If something is being built in your foundry, USE SOMETHING ELSE. If you know what you&apos;re doing you will always have something to rank up! You can change your playing style to avoid repetitiveness. You can approach enemies with a long range bow, mid-range assault rifle, parkour on the walls, melee charge attacks, your warframes special abilities, etc. I&apos;m assuming these complainers haven&apos;t made it very far in the game. I have completed ALL planetary missions and various void missions. There are some missions with laid-back gameplay and others with so many enemies that my computer nearly crashes while fighting. Also, most of the stuff people choose to waste money on is eventually given to all players for FREE. People who pay are basically making donations to help the developers modify the game. Lastly, I&apos;ll mention the updates with amazing content: countless new mods, new warframes, new weapons, bug/glitch fixes, and damage 2.0, which is an overhaul of the previous damage system with elemental combos, status effects, and damage bonuses. Oh, about the bugs and glitches: the PC version was the Beta for the PS4, and they are currently creating new content for two completely different gaming systems...there will be problems.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3806243">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>However, it&apos;s kind of difficult to become really strong because of it&apos;s highcost micro-economy. Without some platinum, you harshly can get new weapons and/or characters, as well as a lot of customization. So in that way, it gets limited.

Fine to play in short bursts, regardless.
<br>
<br>It relies heavily on long wait times(between half a day, to three real-life days) for item crafting, RNG, and heavily diluted loot pools to extend it&apos;s life. On top of that, use of extra warframes, weapons, or companions requires slots to be purchased with real money, or to sell gear to other players for &quot;Platinum&quot;, which is the game&apos;s premium currency purchased with real money. Going back to the RNG, this means that unless you buy Platinum yourself, you are at the mercy of RNG to give you something valuable enough for players to want, which isn&apos;t often enough. Overall if you have invested any amount of time leveling something and don&apos;t want to spend time leveling it again (which is irksome at low levels and tedious at high levels) you are forced to keep it, or delete it to make room. This can become a bother when weapons are nerfed and/or buffed seemingly at random, making a once-reliable weapon or warframe useless.
<br>
<br>The graphics use most of the common &quot;good&quot; things like DoF, Motion Blur, and Bloom which can actually hinder gameplay and makes it difficult to run without a good computer. In spite of all this you will encounter areas where the textures are inconsistent. Not by any signifigantly noticeable level, but enough that it is noticeable, especially on warframes when players try to customize their colors (additional color sets require Platinum, too. And the basic selection is an off-color rainbow that can be frustrating)
<br>
<br>The controls are what you&apos;d expect from a third person shooter, and not worth mentioning aside from clunky parkour mechanics and melee controls being reduced to a single button press, and melee combos barely go beyond that.
<br>
<br>The story is mostly missing in action, but seems to be slowly fleshed out over updates. However most of it seems to clash with it&apos;s own established lore and backstories so take it as you will, but don&apos;t take it seriously.
<br>
<br>Sound is simple and satisfactory. Nothing more to say about it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=5238118">Expand</a></span>

Its fast-paced co-op combat and huge + easy horizontal progression with abundant equipment drops is exactly what I needed after years of slow MMORPG raids, months of farming with zero to none rewards shared between 10-40 people, exhausting PvP combat. So - pros:
<br>
<br>nice graphics combined with somewhat low hardware requirements;
<br>
<br>very fun co-op combat;
<br>
<br>a lot of different game modes, different types of enemies, different difficulty modes;
<br>
<br>interesting and easy progression scheme, nearly endless;
<br>
<br>abundant loot drops + a lot of easily accessible equipment (don&apos;t have to farm it for months);
<br>
<br>cheap in-game currency (for $25 you can buy almost every interesting prime frame);
<br>
<br>interesting setting and storyline;
<br>
<br>decent economy scheme without any traces of inflation;
<br>
<br>very nice auto-grouping scheme combined with healthy population result in minimal waiting time for group runs;
<br>
<br>PvP is available and its balanced.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>
<br>to progress you have to play &quot;characters&quot; (frames) and equipment you don&apos;t like - for many weeks till MR12;
<br>
<br>character isn&apos;t a human thus cannot be customized beyond armor colors (i.e. no faces) so there will be no emotional link;
<br>
<br>warframe (character) type is strictly linked to visual appearance;
<br>
<br>not enough introductory quests for existing content;
<br>
<br>lack of marketplace, strange direct player trading scheme (though it works nonetheless);
<br>
<br>game is somewhat buggy.
<br>
<br>Overall it&apos;s surprisingly good game, well beyond my expectations.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=6005743">Expand</a></span>

It gets a little repetitive after a while, but not enough for me to bother knocking off a point.  It&apos;s also only like 1.2 GB, so the download is fast.  Usually games with small downloads have either minimal content, or bad graphics.  Not the case here; there&apos;s tons of content, and the graphics are actually quite impressive.  It looks better in person than the screenshots do, because of all the nice specular effects, reflections, and glowing things.
<br>
<br>Also, you can wall-run, and it doesn&apos;t even feel like a cheap anime wall-run.  Any game that manages to make wall-running seem serious and realistic deserves cookies.
<br>
<br>Keep in mind, I also enjoyed Rengoku and Dark Souls, two games known for requiring long, difficult persistence to get anywhere meaningful, so this game may seem monotonous to you if you played Dark Souls or Rengoku and thought they were boring.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3069050">Expand</a></span>

It&#x2019;s beautiful from loading to menus to actual game play. If it looks like crap to you, get a new pc. It&#x2019;s extreme sci-fi with laser gun fighting ninjas. Yea, no kidding. I like the over-the-shoulder play style, and the melee is a BLAST! This is because the second best piece of this game is the fluidity in player movement. You can move with basic controls  forward, back, left, right, mouse to aim  or combine keys for additional moves like sprinting into a slide (which btw, makes you look awesome), jumping on the back of enemies to slit their throats, and even wall-walking. When you start off, you can choose between three &#x2018;classes&#x2019; and after a short tutorial, you&#x2019;re careening through the solar system. The Lotus system is decent, the objective map is helpful, and the enemies aren&#x2019;t complete morons  they&#x2019;ll duck and hide and move according to where you are and hiding. Not to mention, the upgrade options for your warframe and weapons are simple to use and fun  and there&#x2019;s always blueprints you can find or purchase to build with components you find in certain parts of the system. God dang, there&#x2019;s too much to say!! There&#x2019;s clans you can create with your own clan dojo, you can play with friends (up to 4 at a time), solo or join random players. There&#x2019;s a market to buy and trade stuff and.. and&#x2026; and&#x2026;. it&#x2019;s friggin&apos; ninjas in the future with dyable suits!!!  Did I mention this game is free? 100% free? Free to download, free to play, free to level. Paying only speeds up advantages you&#x2019;ll otherwise find yourself. OH&#x2026; and it&#x2019;s run through Steam! cheers!
<br>
<br>What I don&#x2019;t like about the game: Sometimes the Lotus chick feeding you info is dumb and annoying and tends to repeat the same things map after map. This is a small complaint though, because even if her comments aren&#x2019;t exactly original, they are helpful and accurate. There is a lot to learn in a short amount of time  what storage containers and canisters do, what the objects are for (cuz there&#x2019;s a crap ton), and dealing with the menus. None of these are deal breakers however, they just require a slight learning curve. The only thing that drives me crazy over this game is the lighting contrast. In some ships it&#x2019;s meant to be dark and it&#x2019;s a little difficult to navigate through. But then in training sequences or promotions, the blinding WHITE is painful and most of us (friends included) just sped through it to make the bleeding from our eyeballs stop!
<br>
<br>Would I recommend it: It&#x2019;s FRIGGIN free!!! What is wrong with you? Login to Steam, search for it and download it. No seriously. NOW. Even if you hate it, it&#x2019;s worth a try. Please note: It&#x2019;s currently in Beta and updates frequently, but for a Beta it&#x2019;s very complete and you won&#x2019;t give a crap.

Regardless of trying to avoid the cash shop you still have to to get extra slots for your Warframes and Guns which is much needed as you play further. The difficulty of the game also hangs in the balance on your credit card balance. So I enjoyed the game and paid 50 dollars to be a founder to get a new Warframe and some value Platinum and restarted and soloed at the beginning with this new Frame with weapons bought from Cash Shop and was it a lot easier over my first Warframe that had massive amounts of difficulty on the first parts. As you get further though all Cash Shop weapons are purchasable even by in-game money but you have to build most of the awesome ones via blueprints.
<br>
<br>Graphics and Visuals: There is nothing truly outstanding in this game that you haven&apos;t seen before. Nothing really game breaking or amazing. The bloom though is overtoned to the point where I had to turn it off because White Warframes are blindly bright.
<br>
<br>Sound, Music, and Voice Acting: Nothing you haven&apos;t heard before. Guns go boom. Enemies scream. There is one hilarious thing where you capture people and they are just screaming their heads off though it&apos;ll get tiring after awhile. The music may be repetitive but I never get tired of it! It gets me pumped and is truly amazing. The drums and the beat just gets you pumped and wanting to shoot everything! Voice acting... well... there&apos;s not much to go by here. The game has some stupid alerts though. I mean really irrelevant like telling me what type bad guys are up ahead but later in the game that becomes useful as you&apos;ll run into a variety of them. One thing that was really stupid was saying &quot;Something is wrong, there is a heavy unit approaching.&quot; I&apos;M SHOOTING UP THEIR ENTIRE BASE/SHIP! Of course something is wrong!
<br>
<br>Story: This is non existent. Seriously. Bad guys are taking over the universe. You are a killer robot. Stop them. After that... yep nothing.
<br>
<br>Difficulty and Replay Value: You won&apos;t see any real challenge if you use the cash shop at the start. This game will be extremely hard at the start and end if you don&apos;t use it. The end game gets a lot harder with or without cash shop. This game is extremely repetitive but it keeps my interest so it is hit or miss for people. You shoot you run you rinse and repeat until you complete the 1 of 5 different objectives.
<br>
<br>Multiplayer: Well it&apos;s an MMO... there is no PvP and I&apos;d certainly hope so because only certain guns are worth using and are overpowered. Not to mention those who buy via cash shop would have an unfair advantage early levels.
<br>
<br>Overall: This game is nothing special and nothing great. It&apos;s a game that will either stick to you or not. I enjoy the game so I like it but... even then my score isn&apos;t going to be biased. It&apos;s a 4 out of 10... because... well it&apos;s nothing game breaking or new... I just really enjoy being a killer robot lol.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3115826">Expand</a></span>

Add to that the problem of hideously occurring environments and enemies, and you have a great looking, great sounding game which leaves me just wanting something more. I feel like the problem was that the dev team made the game, complete with assets and game logic, without asking the opinion of anyone NOT involved with the project. Were I making a passion project, and just wanted to make a butt-baby of MGS and Ninja Gaiden, this would be a visually acceptable result. However, I, personally, dont have all that much attachment to this game&apos;s visuals (well made though they may be), so the game&apos;s numerous and glaring gameplay flaws force me to give this game a 4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3091455">Expand</a></span>

This is a game that is not for everyone. I am sure people who were fans of MMOs and Diablo will find more to like than other players.
<br>
<br>This is an action based game but it does get repetitive. Unless you are willing to drop some cash on new weapons and Warframes then you will spend a good amount of time either grinding levels or farming for crafting items.
<br>
<br>One measure of a good free to play for me boils down to one question: Can you unlock everything without spending money? This is true with nearly everything in game.(for the exception of cosmetic upgrades) The real money market is quite pricey though but you can acquire new weapons in a relative short amount of time. Different planets drop different gear, this means you will be jumping around quite a bit from one to the next trying to find the crafting gear you need.
<br>
<br>This game is great fun, but it is not for everyone. If you do not like grinding then you should look somewhere else. If you like Diablo, then you will find a lot to like. (It is the best grinding for level and gear comparison I can make)
<br>
<br>Graphics are great, some levels can feel the same after awhile and they are quite large so there is a learning curve to following the objective marker. When you first start out you will get lost and left behind. Solo missions are good for leveling up, but the game is not well suited for it. Solo you will be faced with almost overwhelming odds, adds a good amount of challenge but can be unfair especially with missions that require you to carry data packages and they take away your primary weapon for half the mission.
<br>
<br>Overall great game. It is still being improved upon and it keeps getting better.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3404028">Expand</a></span>

Been playing since PS4 launch day, at the time of writing Mastery Rank 21.7 and all frames. Ive watched as its only gotten worse every month. Or every 3-4 months, since consoles are not even top 10 list of priorities for Digital &quot;PC Masterrace&quot; Extremes. Almost 3 years now and still no &quot;wars&quot; are being fought, no clan based pvp, no working Dark Sectors, no auction/market system for trades, and the same old boring hallway missions and void key grinds. All DE does is add more cosmetics and p2w systems. The raids are actually worse than Destiny and Conclave is a joke - completely disjointed from the main game with separate rules and stats. Archwing could have been a redeeming factor if the Arches played more like Gundams and the enemies were more like Mobile Suits, however you are just a monkey with a rocket pack fighting miners on hovercrafts. DE should have never ported to PS4 (and even worse to xbox) if they had no intentions of running Crossplay. And to top it off I had to start from ZERO on PC because DE wont let me transfer my frames, mods or weapons? Oh well, Paragon will be the game you wish Warframe could be. Crossplay, PVP focus, AND all frames free? Take notes DE.

I was playing the game back when every mission had roughtly the same content so I waited a couple weeks and now there&apos;s a ton of new scenery.  Thats kind of how beta&apos;s work, they are actively adding content to the game so reserve your negative reviews till launch.  Then they are valid.   Moving on, warframe is kind of the sweet spot for me and I am guessing a lot of gamers.  First off having a coop only game was a pretty bold move and I would say it&apos;s a resounding success, so kudo&apos;s for that.  While this game does make you wonder how cool pvp would be it still stands, imo, solidly as it is.  I love so far how the game unfolds and how you slowly discover abilities of the warframe as you gain familiarity especially as regards advanced wallrunning and combat.  Last night I realized I could power up my  main abilities by fusing mods so I torqued up a sprint mod and got in a higher lvl mission with some more experienced players.  I was flying through the objectives doing crazy wall running trying to keep up with these guys who knew all the shortcuts.. So much fun, being a space ninja has never been this badass.  The art style is reminiscent of manga, but in a good way, because some manga is terri-bad.  There is a nice diversity of warframes, weapons and playstyles available which should keep things interesting for some time.  Also new content like dojos, clan structering, etc.. is in the works.  The f2p model is working for me so far though expect to grind for new stuff which instead of buying outright you buy a blueprint for and then find crafting materials on missions to create content in your foundry, a main menu crafting screen.
<br>The high pointsfor me here are the slick art direction and music, space ninja theme in a variety of deadly flavors(stealth to hulk) and rpg elements that hardcore gamers crave.  I don&apos;t knowk, games tend to all go stale on me after two months so if I at least get that I&apos;m happy and I expect too.  Play this game!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3106140">Expand</a></span>

<br>Currently there are 27 pages including 540 postings by extremely angry players of this game on the Warframe forums regarding the ill treatment we have received at the hands of this company.
<br>- Free to play?
<br>Before you invest your time and money in this potentially wonderful but actually disappointing game please read on.
<br>Welcome to Warframe where you will be asked to invest real money to buy in game platinum currency which is used in a nonrefundable manner to purchase items that improve your otherwise useless &quot;free&quot; weaponry.
<br>Then watch your weaponry (for which you have paid real money) get arbitrarily destroyed by nerfing.  While new items are then offered to you in the market  for real cash   to replace your now useless weapons.
<br>Alternatively you will be asked to grind out 100 missions in a &quot;special Event&quot; for a promised reward weapon.
<br>You do the grind   you get a nice weapon that looks worth investing real cash in in order to make it a respectable end game weapon.  Then weeks later after spending your real money and wihtout any warning  the nice weapon you got gets basically destroyed by a major nerf from the developers and the weapon is simply no longer useful.
<br>This has been a recurring theme for this game for months now and the veteran gamers are extremely unhappy with this business model.
<br>The developers have repeatedly encouraged players to spend real money on an allegedly F2P game to get decent weaponry and then they have repeatedly trashed those weapons to the point of uselessness  only to introduce a new weapon for real currency  rinse and repeat.
<br>
<br>Case in point  a weapon called the Soma  offered for sale for real cash and a weapon slot purchased for real money  weapon purchased  then subsequently the stats significantly change from the purchased weapon stats rendering it far worse and in fact useless in many parts of the game.
<br>Case in point -
<br>A weapon called the strunwraith shotgun  offered as a reward for time invested in special event which the developers used to test a new game format.
<br>Event done  weapon awarded then subsequently &quot;nerfed&quot; to the point of being put back on the shelf.  Oh yes this weapon also consumed real cash for a weapon slot and for upgrades to make it truly useful.
<br>Current Case in point -
<br>A weapon called the Brakk  again an event reward for running over 100 missions!  100 mission! That is a HUGE investment.
<br>And again the warframe developers arbitrarily ruined the weapon after many people had invested real cash upgrading it too.
<br>
<br>The behavior of the game developer here, DE, is at best abusive and indifferent to the gaming community.  But it also constitutes engaging in deceptive and unethical  business practice.
<br>I would strongly encourage the gaming community to avoid spending any more real cash on this game until a little well deserved respect is shown and this reprehensible bait and switch business practice is terminated .
<br>If you don&apos;t believe me then go to the warframe forums page and read the now 27 pages of  540 postings of extremely angry gamers.  It says way more than I ever could.
<br>Avoid this game like the plague.
<br>thank you</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3853599">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The ONLY downside to this game is that there are a lot of people in the community that like to complain, but if you can get passed that, you get to play a solid, well polished game, that looks more like a triple A game than a indie game.
<br>
<br>On a side note, I find it irritating that this game has a review already, and the only somewhat valid reason this game has a rating is that they are selling in game products, but that is easily shot down when you take into consideration other games being pre-ordered, and green-light games.
<br>
<br>If anything, give this game a try. Decide for yourself by doing a little research at the Warframe wiki while you play. You aren&apos;t wasting anything but time since its a F2P.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/warframe/user-reviews?user_review_id=3297288">Expand</a></span>
