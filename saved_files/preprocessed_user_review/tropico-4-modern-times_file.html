Now here is a game company actually trying to entertain people with a quality product instead of mega corporations ripping people off with mediocre at best games that carry on some huge franchise. This expansion adds a whole other dimension to the game: technological progression over time with upgrading several key buildings. I liked everything about this expansion. My only caveat is some of the new structures are a bit gimmicky, but almost all of them are useful.<br><br>Also, the storyline, if you realize there is a message to gain from it, is quite enlightening.

The Modern Times expansion completely solves this.  Nearly enough levels to call it an entire game on it&apos;s own, plus a wealth of new buildings and mechanics.  If you enjoy Tropico 4 at all, this is an absolute must-buy.</span>

New buildings and a longer time line in particular.
<br>
<br>The buildings are visually very pretty, but show up way too early. It nags me if a 1960es neighborhood in a carribian dictatorship looks like a 2015 skyline from a financial centre in East Asia. Maybe I&apos;m just strange, but I&apos;d like my 60es slum to at least remind me of City of God. In stead, from 1966 and forward, all apartment buildings will me bade mostly out of glass and have a helicopter landing pad on top of them. Not the third-world country in the cold war feel that Tropico is otherwise managing to cultivate very well.
<br>
<br>Other changes to the buildings are game play breaking and have obviously not been thought through. Just to mention a few thing: The farms have made it impossible to play on the hardest difficulty levels because of the terrain on these maps (and I&apos;m talking about hardest difficulty for randomized maps - the predefined maps carrying the label &quot;hard&quot; are actually fairly easy). You NEED a certain area of level land with good crops to place a modern farm. The old farms you could place near a hillside, and the peasants would do their best to put up a few fields here and there to get some crops out of the meager land. So can you not just build some old-timey farms you ask? No! Once the new farms have been invented, there is NO building regular farms. This turns the start of the game into a rush to build as many farms as possible before the useless farms are invented. After this, there is no re-building farms that get destroyed, basically ruining your chance to produce farming goods.
<br>
<br>Furthermore, there is now &quot;superior&quot; housing buildings. Better in all ways. Who wants to play a stategy game where you have to be an idiot to use five out of six options? Without &quot;Modern Times&quot; you have a hard choice between the different home types offering different advantages - which is what strategy games shoudl do: face players with hard choices.
<br>
<br>I guess the increased time line is an advantage, but you&apos;ll enjoy the extra time city building only one type of housing building (that is, if you&apos;re not an idiot) and as many huge, circular farms you can fit in (which is probably not very many if you&apos;re going for a challenge).
<br>
<br>In short, Tropico 4 (which is quite amazing on its own) is simply better without Modern Times. The game design mistakes are so very basic that no game company should make them. Avoid it like you would a t-rex with acne. I wouldn&apos;t recommend that anyone buy this DLC. Don&apos;t get it if it&apos;s really cheap. Don&apos;t get it if it&apos;s free. If you have it, don&apos;t enable it - in stead put it in a coffin with garlic-covered lead spikes on the inside, and dump it on 30m of holy-water.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4-modern-times/user-reviews?user_review_id=4347409">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The DLC is pretty much a must buy as it expands massive parts of the game and addresses any and every weakness the base game had. One criticism would be that borehole mines and bio-farms are overpowered as a revenue generator and the game is simply too easy to beat (available through DLC which is usually bundled with the game in 2015; I lost one time due to my own careless stupidity throughout my entire playthrough of the base game and the expansion).
<br>
<br>The game shines with the sandbox maps though. Here, the difficulty isn&apos;t an issue as your goal is to create your own tropical paradise, and it excels in this regard.
<br>
<br>If you are considering Tropico 5, don&apos;t bother - that title takes multiple steps backwards in the franchise. Tropico 4 is dirt cheap now with the expansions and is comfortably the better game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/tropico-4-modern-times/user-reviews?user_review_id=5247727">Expand</a></span>
