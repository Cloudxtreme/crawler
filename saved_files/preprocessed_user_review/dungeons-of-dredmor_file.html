Don&apos;t spend your hard earned on money on a game from developer who doesn&apos;t value their customer&apos;s time. This game is horribly buggy. You will lose your first character from a bug more likely than an actual death. You might try a second time on the default &quot;permadeath&quot; mode until you encounter yet more bugs and vanishing saves, rendering your 10, 20+ hours invested a total waste. At this point you might turn off permadeath so you can reload but then Gaslamp will release an *update* (1.02 to 1.03) that invalidates your saves and forces you throw yet another 10-20+ hour investment down the drain because they were too lazy to write an old save to new save conversion routine. Then they give you an achievement to joke about wasting your time. From their blog post about the 1.03 update: &quot;Your old save games from Dredmor 1.02 almost certainly do not work with Dredmor 1.03. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Contrary to several reviews, the game DOES have a definite goal, its to reach level 10 and kill Lord Dredmor, the final boss. Although I have been unable to get this far down, I am therfore unsure how the DLC works, as it adds levels 11-15.<br><br>The character creation is a nightmare for first time players. It is a list of about 35 skills (about 42 if you have DLC) which you chose 7 of. These decide your base stats and starting gear, while many are obvious (swords, maces, axes, staffs, prothean Magic etc.) Others are difficult to guess. And their descriptions do not help. A few examples could be 1. Archaeology - Start with a fedora, how am i supposed to know what its stats are since the game has nothing to do with Archaeology? 2. Mathemagic, all the abilities it gives have little to do with math, and this is rediculas. This in theroy is a good thing, it makes the player experiement, allowing the player to try abilities that they would otherwise not choose that they might like. But honestly, it should tell you what they do, let us see the skill tree or something.<br><br>The games leveling system is simply everytime you level up, you choose to upgrade one of these skills, (yes it tells you, usually, what these do) which gives you a stat bonus and/or spell and/or chance ability, some being quite unique. This system works very well and still manages to give you a definite boost while avoiding the boring list of numbers problem that RPGs seem to be fixing nowadays.<br><br>The game has a few features for difficulty, the usual uniquely named Easy, normal and hard modes, with a permadeath feature (which without, ruins the feel of the game) and small levels mode which allows less grinding for people who don&apos;t want grinding.<br><br>The game is quite fun to play, with a LARGE array of weapons and armor to choose from, including randomly boosted upgrades and general strange things to find throughout the dungeons, with MANY MANY references (my favourite being My Little Anvil - Smithing is Magic) While many of the jokes are hit and miss, some with definitly make you smile.<br><br>The graphics are fine for a roguelike, playable on bad computers while ok to look at, thanks to a great art style.<br><br>The only truely annoying feature is the lack of your characters look changing when getting new armor or weaponry, evetually it can be annoying looking at the characters oversized eyebrows.<br><br>The background music is very very good, and fun to listen to.<br><br>For people who dont mind turn based RPGs will love this game, and i highly reccomend it as it gives hours of entertainement for a very small price, with the added benifit of supporting a indie company.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2442228">Expand</a></span>

The game is very hard and should be played with permadeath (I can imagine it being a bit boring without it). Character creation offers you a wide range of options, as you create a character by picking seven skills form a long range. Want a fireball throwing, Odin worshipping, axe swinging berserker-vampire-archeologist? Go right ahead! The game doesn&apos;t take itself very seriously and has a good sense of humor. The sound track is very catchy and would be worth the cost by itself imo. I immensely enjoyed playing it, even when it was handing my ass to me over and over on level one, and I simply had to play it till I got through it. Of course it doesn&apos;t provide you with amazing graphics, an epic plot or such - these things are not what the game sets out to do though ... what it does set out to do it does excellently, and if you like looting, character building and a hard challenge this is the game for you.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2334010">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game has tons and tons of references and jokes, and the core gameplay is also brilliant. Through lots and lots of trial and error you come to understand the vaguely described skill sets you choose in the beginning of your run, and finally you manage to prepare for every peril before you: enemies, traps, backfiring abilities and even thugs coming after your stolen goods (stealing, SERIOUSLY NOT COOL).
<br>
<br>Although knowing your bit of pop culture and gaming history adds to the experience, Dredmor can be just as captivating and fun even if you grew up in a barrel under a rock. Developing strategies and hoping not to fall to a trap you didn&apos;t have the sufficient skill to see and/or disarm can keep you entertained for a long, long time.
<br>
<br>I also highly recommend getting the DLC for the game (one of which is free, others 3&#x20AC; each). This is the steam sale must-buy.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=3215899">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Great game. **** &apos;retro&apos; graphics though.
<br>With the graphic potential of modern hardware, graphics that look like a mid 80&apos;s Commodore game just seems like cutting corners.
<br>Still, the game has lots of replay value as no to games are the same.
<br>Permadeath is on by default, and I recommend playing that way.
<br>Makes it a lot more interesting.
<br>Easy worth full price if you love old school RPG.</span>

The only downside in this game is that the bugs are not yet at a minimal, and when you find one it can sometimes ruin an entire saved game of many many hours. Looking forward to more games from Gaslamp.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2017883">Expand</a></span>

The graphics are cheesy, and the story is pretty much non-existent, but I&apos;m finding myself not caring because the game is just so much fun.  I&apos;m really enjoying the humor in the game as well.  On the negative side, the inventory management can be a bit clunky at times, and the game occasionally crashes, which stinks if you don&apos;t have a recent save to fall back on.  Also, this game isn&apos;t for everybody.  Be prepared to die a lot.  If you can&apos;t deal with that, you may want to toggle off permadeath, or even skip this game completely.  Hardcore roguelike fans might find this game too watered down for their tastes.  Despite its flaws, DoD is a great value for your gaming dollar.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2044364">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;ve only played it for a few hours but I already think it was worth my money. The exploration is fun and the humor appeals to me. Combat could be a bit more exciting though, and the player character looks pretty bad, as though he was drawn in paint, it would be better if the player looked better and equipped items showed up on the player, but these problems are completely aesthetic and don&apos;t affect the game at all. The soundtrack is great and it has everything a dungeon-crawl should, it&apos;s worth your money, you cheapskate.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1705067">Expand</a></span>

You are going to lose a lot of characters to dying, that&apos;s the idea, losing one character because they bought out a new patch is hardly a big deal. Anyway in terms of the view, for the price it&apos;s certainly a good buy, it offers something unique and very challenging when you play it on normal and perma death. A huge amount of skills to choose from allow you to pick different setups each time and try and further your score from your last adventurer, even if some of the skills are a bit rubbish. I haven&apos;t encountered a bug in this game yet and I bought it when it came out and it has only crashed for me once. It&apos;s a game where losing all your progress and equipment isn&apos;t something to make you never want to play the game again, due to its highly addictive nature. Music is very nice and the humor and names certainly adds to the gameplay. Overall it&apos;s a fun little game, with a small price tag and a huge amount of fun and addictiveness. Certainly worth picking up to kill quite a few hours while you try and fail to complete the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1757782">Expand</a></span>

<br>The game has you choose your difficulty, then permadeath on or off, then your starting skills. If you are like me, then choosing random skills with permadeath on is the best way to have fun and use survival skills to try for a high score or see how far you can make it.
<br>Some negatives about the game are you can&apos;t customize, change, or even see any equipment changes to your cahracter. You will always be the young lad with large eyebrows. I&apos;m sure the developers could add a character creator, but to not see your character wearing that kick ass skull sword, fury wand, or goggles, is kind of dissapointing.
<br>The game also doesn&apos;t take itself seriously at all. There is so much humor and parodies packed into this game that it&apos;s oozing out from the seams. You can&apos;t pick an item up, kill a monster, or read dialogue without seeing some of the funniest RPG nerd jokes.
<br>As it stands, for $5 on Steam, you have no reason not to pick this title up and support the developers who really put their blood and sweat into making a game they obviously really cared for. If you are a dungeon crawling gamer, or love roguelike games, I urge you to check it out.
<br>If not, and you have some cash, try it out. The few flaws far outweigh the great time you will have for hours and hours this game provides.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1754064">Expand</a></span>

There are bugs and control oddities, but those should be worked out soon. You don&apos;t have much to lose, except many hours spend giggling at item descriptions and dying to the randomest enemies you&apos;ve probably seen. Buy it!

The game is difficult and not dumbed down for the lowest common denominator like so many games these days, and also very fun and addictive.  I forgot how much fun roguelike games were since its been so long for me!</span>

Keep in mind it&apos;s an indie effort and don&apos;t expect AAA graphics and cutscenes - just great gameplay and replayability, something some of the &quot;big&quot; titles seem to have forgotten.

Occasional bug can force a restart, but nothing game breaking, and constant updates means it should be near enough bug free soon.</span>

Obviously I&apos;m not encouraging you do attempt this in real life, but percentage wise, the chance of failure in this game is extremely high. I would wager to guess that I might actually have a better chance of winning the punch a neighbor out experiment than I do of getting through a single level of Dredmor on hardmode with perma-death. It&apos;s sadomasochism at heart, and although rewarding in some levels, at the end of the day, you do sort of just feel like you payed someone $14.99 to kick your ass. There&apos;s a whole lot of backstory with rogue-likes etc, but when it comes to the average gamer, I bet most just want to have fun. Fun is to be had, but again...it&apos;s the type of fun where you have to enjoy it in the moment because your beloved character is always literally one door or corner or misplaced trap from death.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1744518">Expand</a></span>

My personal favourites are Viking Magic, Promethean Magic, and Psionics. Melee classes include dual wielding anything (even staves, and shields!) and you can mix and match any aspect of Mage, Warrior or Rogue to fit your liking. Permadeath can be turned off (but why would you?)<br><br>Also, The music in this game is phenomenal and the humour is spot on. It makes fun of everything a roguelike RPG is, with silly tool-tips and dialog coming from the npcs. An update has been planned and that&apos;s a good thing. For the $5 this game costs and the amount of replay value the gamer gets from it, it is totally worth the purchase and I highly recommend it to anyone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1716847">Expand</a></span>

It loses marks because despite the true random element in loot spawning and level design, it lives in the shadow of far better roguelike games like ADOM, Nethack, Transcendence and the innumerable mods of these games which took interaction with the game itself to a whole new level. Unlike the majority of unmodded roguelikes the game has a shiny, easily interpretable GUI with menus, difficulty options and the ability to save (if desired). It also comes with a very indepth crafting system. These are definite pluses, but they are mitigated by the horribly buggy skill system, the disgusting system lag (even on top end computers) and the limited fashion that one can engage with the dungeon environments.<br><br>Worth a few dollars and a few hours of game play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1765265">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s your standard roguelike with less complex mechanics in favour of eyecandy. On top of that you have to pay for it, when you&apos;ll get a much more rich experience from the countless FREE roguelikes that are infinitely deeper. Its basically ToME with &quot;humour&quot; which wasn&apos;t terribly amusing.</span>

It can and surely is.  Example - Dungeons of Dredmor!  Apart of real graphics instead of ASCII, this game is typical rouglike rpg with random generated levels. There&apos;s plenty of good humour too. Unfortunatly, graphics could be a little bit better. I know, it&apos;s indie production but... Well, we should be grateful there&apos;s graphics at all, developers seem to say.  Game lacks story, but that&apos;s not a flaw - you dont need a story in a  game like this. It&apos;s just about fun, exploring, leveling up and killing your enemies. Of course, there is the last, final boss in the last 10th level of dungeon (Mr.Dredmor, indeed)... and a couple of minor bad guys on the way. You would not be bored;)  Another interesting thing - Dungeons of Dredmor features permadeath - long forgotten, now revoked! Of course you can choose to switch it off, if you value your sanity. Try losing your character after couple hours of gameplay... ;)  But if you want to play as if it&apos;s still 1995, go ahead!:)  Some gamers reported bugs and crashes with DoD. I guess it&apos;s all patched, because im playing without any problems.   In conclusion - nice little game, but marked for a small group of players. If you like classical rpg&apos;s, dungeoneering style games, you&apos;ll like Dungeons of Dredmor. For rest of you guys, this game gets boring and repetitive after half an hour.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1981971">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s very replayable, and discovering new ways to use the many, many skills and items is rewarding. Turnbased may seem like the obvious choice for a roguelike crawler, but I much preferred how Binding of Isaac handled combat - having it real-time. Due almost solely to their decision to keep it turn-based, combat is tedious. Nethack was saved from being tedious due to the unique level of detail in the game. There were hundreds of types of monsters, hundreds of different items, a fascinating &quot;BUC&quot; system, deities, factions, and on and on. Dungeons of Dredmor does not match this level of detail, as others have noted -- we&apos;re talking about a much more shallow game, with maybe 20 different NPC types, ~100 items, poor inventory management, a fairly clunky GUI, and adequate graphics. Don&apos;t forget -- while DoD has a low price tag, Nethack is free and easy to modify. OTOH, the crafting system is an addition.... but the items aren&apos;t particularly interesting, and the poor inventory management ends up leaving you unable to craft what you want as there isn&apos;t enough inventory space, and this ends up turning DoD into a bit of a &quot;inventory management game.&quot; While I recommend trying out DoD, I don&apos;t believe their attempt at &quot;bringing roguelikes to the masses&quot; was much more than stripping out most the work that went into Nethack and putting a mediocre graphical overlay atop it. Nethack was also able to get away with lack of balance (that is, one game could be dramatically easier or harder than the last based on one randomly-generated item you happened to find) because everything had strengths and weaknesses. In DoD, there isn&apos;t much room for strategy -- you hit the target, the target hits you - back-and-forth until someone dies. It&apos;s kind of like cover-based FPS games, but without any of the intensity. With all this criticism, there are some glimmers of great design within, and I hope we&apos;ll see continued development from Gaslamp Games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=1782563">Expand</a></span>

For example - you will not find out what certain character traits do by simply reading them! :)  The gameplay, however, is rather monotone - it gets boring pretty fast, simply because there is no STORY in the game!  And what is an RPG without a story and strong NPC&apos;s?!</span>

In it, you will enter randomly generated dungeons with various levels to explore, and a large amount of loot to collect and experiment with. The artwork is charming and adequate, albeit not too creative. There is even a crafting system, for those interested in hoarding items for the hope of usage as you progress. There is a tutorial with several chapters, but even then it fails to explain and introduce a few aspects of the game to the player, which leads to a slow-paced approach to learning how to play. Dungeons of Dredmor is more focused on exploration, rather than action. There are many items to find and experiment with, as well as the innumerable crafting combinations. It is also more difficult and less forgiving than The Binding of Isaac. Death comes from various means, and there will be many times where you will be overwhelmed by the enemies. There are also many skills to choose from when creating a new character, which makes each attempt at the game different each time. Personally, I have no interest in crafting. To be able to craft valuable items, you must hold on to many different items needed for a very long time, in hope that you eventually will be able to craft something worthwhile. This means that your inventory will be populated by mostly garbage. Besides, if you proceed through the levels deep enough, you will encounter good, quality items to equip your character with. This to me, makes crafting practically abandoned. As you go deeper in the dungeon, the appearance of the levels change, and become more interesting. There will also be more unique and challenging enemies to fight against. As with everything else in the game, the shopkeeper is populated in the levels at random. This means that sometimes you will need to go up or down a few levels to sell your loot. Dying and losing everything is part of the genre, but that doesn&apos;t stop it from being slightly frustrating. The game also tends to crash sometimes, which means you will lose all your progress and be forced to start over. The developers even added a Steam Achievement for this. Dungeons of Dredmor is a difficult game. More difficult than The Binding of Isaac. You will die much more often and much easier than you ever did in The Binding of Isaac, while accomplishing much less. Even though the game is filled with what is supposed to be clever humor, I personally did not find any of it funny, but it does not ever get in the way of the game&apos;s enjoyment. Unfortunately, any items that you equip during the game do not change the appearance of the character in any way. I feel that this particular shortcoming detracts from the indulgence of the game, as there are many items that would make the game much more interesting if they actually changed the character&apos;s looks. The constant dying and lack of real progression through the dungeon in this roguelike leaves much to be desired overall. It simply isn&apos;t as exciting or as rewarding as The Binding of Isaac. With that said, Dungeons of Dredmor is still a title that should be kept installed for future casual ventures as a more classical style of roguelike game. In moderation, and with much patience there is plenty of fun to be had with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2153200">Expand</a></span>

However it is extremely unstable. 75% of the time when i start the game up Steam tells me that my files failed to sync the last time i shut the game down. The game will often crash and on rare occasion your steam achievement progress will be completely reset. Also, the developers added an achievement to the game where you have to buy them a beer in real life and then they will manually add the unlock the achievement on your account. Seriously? I mean, I&apos;ve never seen such a stupid move made by a developer in making an achievement for a game. Something that is supposed to be obtainable in-game and be FUN. It&apos;s a good game, but terrible stability and a piece-of-crap developer makes it not worth your time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=3668503">Expand</a></span>

Oh look you died from a monster zoo, well done silly billy. The games tutorials (and trust me there are alot of those) dont explain much and are very hard to remember. They basically say: Kill the diggle using new type of weapon, well done you are a dungeon master. The difficulty is unmatched and i wouldnt buy it unless you love beating your brains out for being stupid or throwing your laptop out of the window.

Even better, wait for a 60-75% off sale, and you&apos;ll pay less than $3 for all of it like I did.  The game randomly generates dungeons, monsters, loot, shops, and side quests, and has a sense of humor that will appeal to some, but not all.  For example, there&apos;s an item that pays homage to Monkey Island, a fair amount of lutefisk jokes, and monster taunts can get a bit ridiculous at times.  The game has three difficulty modes, and you can decide whether or not to play with permadeath on or off.  Personally, while learning the game, I played with permadeath off, but am finding value in replaying on the hardest level with permadeath on.  Lots of deaths, but lots of fun.  Usually when I die, I just laugh and make a new character -- sometimes with the same skills, sometimes I let the game randomly assign skills for me.  Dungeons of Dredmor also has lots of mod capabilities, so if you like to mod, you&apos;ll have even more to do.  Overall, if you like RPGs with random elements, need a break from deep immersive games that require huge commitment times, and don&apos;t mind a bit of silly humor, this game is probably for you!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2541241">Expand</a></span>

<br>-It&apos;s Canadian
<br>-It&apos;s silly and funny.
<br>-It&apos;s a RPG.
<br>-It&apos;s a good RPG.
<br>
<br>What I don&apos;t like-
<br>-Glitches (But on steam, you get a achievement for it!)
<br>-Music gets repetitive.
<br>
<br>If you like the RPG games, try this one out. If you can tolerate some glitches (There&apos;s less glitches here than in the War Z, thank the lord Dredmor), then this is worth your time.</span>

Exceptionally balanced, easy to get into, hard to let go of, entertaining humor and style. For 5 bucks, you&apos;d be hard pressed to find a better use of your money.

<br>
<br>And you will die. For instance, the game comes with a tutorial designed for people who have never played a video game before in their life. I died in there twice. The game congratulated me for dying then gave me a Steam Achievement for it meaning the devs not only know you can die in there... they wear it as a badge of honor. *Note: You can turn off perma-death if you wish.
<br>
<br>- Combat:
<br>Dungeons of Dredmor is the standard hack-n-slash loot fest (Diablo/Torchlight genre) except it uses a turn-based system. This means winning is not about quick reflexes/clicking, but rather how you choose to utilize the skills at your disposal. It works well and the turns are pretty much instantaneous so fights/exploring plays out as fast as you want it to.
<br>
<br>- Loot:
<br>Loot is plentiful. So plentiful in fact you will quickly learn to stop picking up things that do not suit your character&apos;s build. The game has a crafting system for food, potions, armor, weapons, traps, etc. giving you even more ways to obtain items. And a few shops located around should you choose to buy items.
<br>
<br>- Character Customization:
<br>At the beginning of the game you have 50+ different base skills at your disposal of which you get to choose 7 to take along with you on your adventure. As your character levels up related skills get unlocked giving a high level character 40-50+ skills. The skills are quite varied and allow you to create all kinds of weird character combinations. Mage skills, range combat, warrior, thief, assassin, trap specialist, alchemist, smithing, banker, etc. Its all here. If you want somekind of weird warrior vampire mushroom loving tourist you can make one.
<br>
<br>The stats for each character are also pretty deep. 7+ different types of damage resistances/types to go with 23 different stat categories (dodge, critical chance, trap skills, magic, health regen, smithing, etc). This is definitely an old school RPG at heart.
<br>
<br>- Replayability:
<br>As mentioned the character customization is pretty deep so starting over can feel like a completely different experience. The monsters, loot, store inventory, crafting recipes you find, and other in-game items are all randomized for each play through. Its even moddable so new loot, recipes, character skills, and features (loot deconstruction to extract raw materials) can be added.
<br>
<br>- Some Minor Cons:
<br>a) Some things are quite vague. Whats this potion do? What does this skill do? Why not just tell me in the tool-tip?
<br>
<br>b) You don&apos;t get to visually see your character progress from peasant to mighty warrior. Equip a traffic cone on your ragdoll it won&apos;t show up on your actual character. Bummer.
<br>
<br>c) Screen seems to be always locked on your character. Cannot use the mini-map to view parts of the dungeon that you have already explored.
<br>
<br>d) Tried and true user friendly RPG elements are missing. A way to compare the stats of loot you find with the current loot you are wearing would have been great.
<br>
<br>e) I thought the music sucked. Mute it and use your own collection or play in silence.
<br>
<br>- Final Thoughts
<br>The screenshots/video might not blow you away, but I thought the actual gameplay was pretty good and at $1.25 for the base game or $2.50 for the game+all DLCs I feel its a no-brainer purchase. Works great on Linux as well.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=3300006">Expand</a></span>

Character customization is fantastic with many diverse skills, unique build options, and damage types to choose from. On &quot;Normal&quot; difficulty you can pretty much play however you want provided you are careful with your positioning and kiting. Although more forgiving than many permadeath games, it is easy to get cornered and beaten to death; My biggest complaint about this game is how some enemies have very unpredictable movement sets. Many enemies will also have very high resistances to specific damage types, leaving you unable to kill them. With the right skills, you can teleport and parry your way down 10 gigantic floors that are packed with plenty of loot, puzzles, secret passages, and a wide variety of traps.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=2979156">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Dungeons of Dredmor is a quirky game.  The designers&apos; sense of humor is readily apparent and that&apos;s probably its best feature.  There are a lot of options for class/skill differentiation, but they don&apos;t seem to make a ton of difference.
<br>
<br>DoD gets old really fast.  The dungeons get repetitive and there&apos;s not real sense of purpose to playing after a couple hours.</span>

<br>To begin with, every time I die, and that happened frequently, I&#x2019;m happy that I can start a new game.
<br>Because the game is fair and always when I have to start over, what is certainly a pleasure, I know it&#x2019;s my own fault.
<br>
<br>The music in this game is exactly what I want to hear in a game like this. It&#x2019;s a way too much orchestra song kind of music what really give the feeling of a middle age castle period.
<br>Call to arms and conquer!! Tadadum tadum tadum&#x2026;Very good choice!
<br>
<br>The interface and menu is very detailed and clean. Compared to the graphics of the dungeon itself it&#x2019;s modern style.
<br>The dungeon is old style, but with enough diversity and eye candy to not feel boring or repetitive. Even that the dungeons are randomly generated every game plays like his own story. Every random set up is like handcrafted by an experienced level designer. The placement of monsters and goodies is a surprise every time, but always very well balanced. Behind every door you open on a gigantic random map is a whole new game generated before your eyes. Within every room dozens of monsters to fight and dozens of pick-ups to find.
<br>
<br>Every character you build, chosen from tons of skills yourself or totally randomly, is unique. But really unique. Not unique because the skill you are good in blocks your access to all other skills, but because the skill you develop really makes sence. Every skill point you spend for a skill is game play changing in real time.
<br>
<br>Another very good balanced, well designed aspect of this game is that for the first time (I played hundreds of RPG&#x2019;s and TBS games) you can use all your skills on many, many places of every map.
<br>The fighting is fun, fast and rewarding and it&#x2019;s even turn based, so you really have time to make every turn and every action you make count. Also it&#x2019;s very easy to understand and again perfectly fair for the AI and for the player. Fast because every action is just one point, so your turn or the computer&#x2019;s turn doesn&#x2019;t take more than a second to make. What is also groundbreaking is that the turn based gameplay in battles and the exploring part of the map is seamlessly. So you don&#x2019;t have to push the end turn button a thousand times if you are not in a fight but exploring the map.
<br>
<br>It was running flawlessly the first few hours after installment and without any glitches, lags or crashes on a three years old laptop with a build in video adapter.
<br>
<br>The only bad thing was that one time I had to kill my own summoned monster, a golem, myself because he was blocking my only way out. This was done in a second, but it was just horrible to kill my own loving pet with my axe.
<br>
<br>This game is also original in many ways. The art, the item and spell description and the subtle, delicate jokes all around the game. Sometimes just written on walls or as little text balloons above NPC&#x2019;s or monsters. But again it is done so balanced and it fit so naturally in the rest of the game.
<br>
<br>The last time I walked from my PC to take a piece of paper to write a secret code on it to gain access to a secret portal was 15 years ago. C&#xE9;st magnifique!
<br>This game is just brilliant in many ways and I can only thank the developers to let me play this game for a few bucks.
<br>It&#x2019;s really worth more!</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=4307896">Expand</a></span>

<br>Having played this game for 100+ hours, I wanted to love this game so much, the flavour and humour in describing items is just perfect.  And the skill tree concept works beautifully well with the idea that you can make nearly any combination of skills viable...but then it doesn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Some skills are woefully imba, some skill trees are quite underpowered, and the part which sadddens me  the most - crafting {my absolute favourite part of rpgs - who doesn&apos;t love crafting elite equipment from scavenged loot?}; gives minimal pay-off.  Also, often by the time I finally craft  my high-end items, I will have discovered another item of similar power-level from chest or loot drop.
<br>
<br>Fighting monsters is also quite repetitive.  Just point and click, use your timer or magic-based skills appropriately, drink potions as necessary, rinse repeat.  There is very little variety in terms of monsters or monster  strategies, besides of course ranged vs melee enemies.  &quot;Boss monsters&quot;, just hit really hard, but rarely do much else, and since this game is turn based, you can kite all monsters easily {assuming you cleared the dungeon leading up to them before -hand}, so its not like there&apos;s any real moments where I go &quot;Oh, I might die here if i&apos;m not careful&quot;.  You just run away or even go back up stairs where monster can&apos;t follow, eat food, heal up and then your good to go again {monsters themsleves don&apos;t regen}.  YOu  can also lead groups into a corridor so that you only ever have them one-on-one instead of being surrounded.
<br>
<br>The only times I had &quot;scared of dying&quot; moments was when I was acting foolish in a huge group of monsters, or being reckless.  This was on the hard difficulty.
<br>
<br>Each dungeon has the same basic layout   So there&apos;s no real surprises besides when you open a door to group orf angry monsters but then you soon learn to expect that.
<br>
<br>It sounds like i&apos;m really down on this game, but its only because I see so much potential in it, and don&apos;t want to see it wasted.
<br>
<br>-So, what about having skills which scale to your level - so low-leveel skills can still be used at high-level dungeons?
<br>-what about having unique boss monsters which can teleport and/or heal / cast unique spells / use unique items and give unique item drops?
<br>-what about items which give boosts to skills, temporarily, to allow characters to diversify or specialize their builds?
<br>-more items, better crafting system, with a range of items at certain levels {even with secret recipes} rather than just one main item.  E.g &quot;steel sword of magma&quot;, AND &quot;steel sword of tesla&quot; AND &quot;steel sword of toxicity&quot; at same level.
<br>-what aobut unique dungeon scenarios?  There&apos;s some good stuff here but it gets repetitive. What about corridors of traps, pits of lava that fall, hidden walls that must be activated / scouted, sequences of buttons that must be pressed exactly but can only be learned from completing a quest elsewhere.  A la, dungeon master???
<br>
<br>Final score 6 is because 4 points for concept and another 2 for excellent humour.  If only the execution was there too  I would love to give a 10.  This game feels like it just almost there but lacks the core gameplay and variety, in both items and monsters, to keep me coming back for more.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/dungeons-of-dredmor/user-reviews?user_review_id=6584463">Expand</a></span>
