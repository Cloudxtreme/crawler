This can be the difference of it&apos;s Success or Failure. Shadow Ops:Red Mercury is your basic FPS Where you must Stop a Backpack Nuke from getting in the wrong hands and being used. Your Met with Fierce aggression and many perhaps too many enemies that pop out of nowhere at times. But this games Cinematic feels keeps you immersed in the action ducking to find cover and figure out where the hostiles are. You Team does a good job of helping take out some of the Enemies but you feel out numbered 5-1 at times. Your firefights are immense with exploding drums and grenades making it feel your in the middle of a real mission. This is No Call of Duty, But the action is intense. With Details such as breakable and movable objects thrown in the Game Comes alive with action. With all these Postives there is one major drawback which is no Quick saves along the way. So if you die during a mission you must start that level over. This can get frustrating but makes you proceed with caution next time which brings me to another negative, the enemies spawn in exact same areas, so its not hard to know whats coming and from where next time you play the level. This is no Blood or gore such as in Far Cry Or Doom3 But a pretty immersive FPS That will entertain the casual player for hours .</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/shadow-ops-red-mercury/user-reviews?user_review_id=387090">Expand</a></span>
