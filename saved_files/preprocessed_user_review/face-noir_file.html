<br>Face Noir did a very good job of giving me the noir-style storyline I was hoping for complete with twists and turns, but was not a total success do to the introduction of certain supernatural elements that felt a bit contrived.  Overall, the game was interesting  with puzzles that tested my skills and characters that (while numerous) I cared about deeply.
<br>
<br>Pros include a cool mechanic where you connect facts to formulate new questions, a dark storyline with a bit of humor mixed in, and a great soundtrack with some nice instrumental jazz to set the mood.
<br>
<br>Cons include Italian-to-English conversion problems, issues with historical accuracy, and a horrific options menu including no possible way to change aspect ratio.
<br>
<br>If you&apos;re into film noir, then you&apos;ll like Face Noir  provided you&apos;re not a stickler for historical accuracy and you&apos;re willing to forget a little supernatural deus ex machina.  It did well and considering that it&apos;s their first game, it did better than I expect.

<br>As always, full video review on my YouTube channel.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/face-noir/user-reviews?user_review_id=3397575">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>One of the problem/weakness I noticed was the streets and others locations were a bit too clean and lacking some population. Would have been nice to meet some random people on the streets. People asking you for a smoke, lose womens, poor souls sleeping on the street, angry people on phones, cats walking, ect... But no big deal. I read there was only 2 devs, and the amount of work they provided is just insane.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/face-noir/user-reviews?user_review_id=4251560">Expand</a></span>

The story is &quot;not bad&quot;  like a midday movie that you don&apos;t bother turning off because it&apos;s not offensive.
