<br>
<br>The development has been marred with problems, mainly I believe to fanboy outrage to initial screens of the game. I was actually looking forward to a First person, investigation game. Then the game went dark, but eventually came back to life, in what seemed to be a mash up between Mass Effect and some XCOM elements.
<br>
<br>I love the XCOM series, do I care that this game has XCOM in the title? No. I take games on face value, and not what I expect the game should be. In fact, I don&apos;t go into any games with expectations  why would you? Why not be surprised, which I am about this game.
<br>
<br>It didn&apos;t take long before I started getting the knack for the controls and ordering my men around  it all seemed to work well, and I was killing aliens left, right and centre. The AI, seems intuitive enough to get the job done on both sides.
<br>
<br>I love the setting, and the story isn&apos;t as convoluted as some have suggested. The game isn&apos;t perfect by any means. There have been some hiccups with stuttering, and slow downs  but the steam community is on the ball. Hopefully updated video drivers and possible game tweaking will solve most of these issues  which we should all be reminded happens even to the best of games.
<br>
<br>I do feel the game is a little barron in respects to environments and ambient objects within the world. It kinda feels like a lost opportunity, but I also wonder whether it was a design decision to have more of a clean sterile look to most environments?
<br>
<br>Overall this is a solid title, not great, but definitely not worth the scores that it&apos;s getting. This game is easily a low  mid 8. I paid $36.00 for this game through a site, with some discounts, if you can&apos;t get 36 dollars worth of value from this game, then you are doing something VERY wrong.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3435107">Expand</a></span>

The developers attempted to create a different game set in a universe similar, but not the same as, the universe XCOM and its predecessor, UFO resided in. They then took this altered reality and said &quot;we&apos;re going to try something different&quot; and made The Bureau into a 3PS. In short, if you&apos;re looking for an expansion to XCOM Enemy Unknown, you&apos;re barking up the wrong tree.
<br>
<br>So, how does this 3PS differ from other 3PS?
<br>
<br>Well first of all, you&apos;re not alone in your fight. While you are a badass, if you run in guns blazing alone, you will get yourself killed. For this reason, the game gives you a pair of sidekicks that accompany you on missions (the characters themselves are unimportant) these two can do any range of jobs from pissing off giant alien quadrupeds so you can shoot them in their rear, to deploying laser cannons to cover your advance or do massive amounts of damage in a single shot.
<br>
<br>Secondly, the game penalises you heavily if you aren&apos;t in cover. IT utilises a similar cover system to XCOM EU with a half and full cover, with damage being reduced based on where you stand. Also like XCOM EU, if an enemy is in a position where your cover is useless against him, he flanks you, that is, he will do a lot more damage as you aren&apos;t expecting the hit. These combined features make The Bureau one of the most cover-intensive modern games, and makes a good position the difference between life and death.
<br>
<br>A good position is not everything, however, as your opponent&apos;s AI, a stunningly complex and intelligent system on heavier difficulties, is always on the move, always changing position and trying to get into places from which the most damage can be done. For this reason, constant movement, literal island hopping is needed to ensure the safety of your team. There is never a single map where you can&apos;t gain an advantage as the fight progresses, and there is not a map where you can be safe in any one place for long.
<br>
<br>To top off a gripping, battlefield motivated gameplay, the game contains a novel plotline that you can truly get into, and offers many interesting plot twists. This along with adequate voice acting and enjoyable graphics makes for an inspired, if not what you expected game.

<br>
<br>The characters are actually not bad, the story is good, the art desing and graphics are nice and the combat system is decent.
<br>The game is not a masterpiece and certainly its kind of a mass effect wannabe with the overall control and combat of the game... but that doesn&apos;t make it a bad game, it just lacks a bit of identity when it comes to that.</span>

The original FPS version of this game looked like it would be filled with story and immersion while taking a lighter take on the strategy. Everyone whined about it and they changed it to be a tactical TPS instead. The story itself had all the makings of being good, but the terrible animations and voice acting killed any opportunity for the player to get involved with it. Being a TPS, it was very difficult to get immersed in the world because i never really felt like I was there. The tactics themselves are crap. Even on the hardest difficulty, there is absolutely no reason for you to try to flank enemies because of how awful the AI is. If you try to move you squad around, they&apos;ll just jump out of cover and immediately get downed. So you&apos;re stuck with straight firefights and skill spam. There is little depth in your character. The high point of Enemy Unknown was that you could completely customize every aspect of your character. In The Bureau, you can change their cosmetic appearance, but the weapons and backpacks are all unlocked at set times throughout the story and the later you acquire them, the better the gun is. There is nothing interesting about it. The skill trees are boring, you&apos;ll either have 1 or 2 options each time you level. The game is just very shallow. You can see that there are good ideas, But due to public outcry against a game they&apos;ve never played, the developers had to constantly change their vision of the game until it has become the unfinished, sloppy mess that it is today. It&apos;s still an enjoyable game at times. If you&apos;re a fan of tactical shooters, it&apos;s well worth a single playthrough. Just don&apos;t expect to be wowed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=4212103">Expand</a></span>

<br>- lack of freedom in choosing missions, the game is pretty railroaded;
<br>- lack of freedom in researching upgrades and training your team from the start, very constrained;
<br>- lack of overview in battles, third person perspective is interesting but very unlike other XCOM games and more akin to (for example) Mass Effect.
<br>
<br>Depending on your preference, the above is a bad thing or a good thing if you want to feel a little more immersed and don&apos;t care about the base and team micro management of the previous titles.
<br>
<br>I liked:
<br>- the setting and period look and feel, like a less tongue in cheek Fallout or LA Noire with aliens;
<br>- the combat system basics, although the novelty wears off well before the game is over.
<br>
<br>I did not like:
<br>- the artificial feel of the set pieces, with ammo and weapons piled on every street corner, just to balance out the ridiculous amount of aliens sent at you at fixed locations, or the toughness of the bigger aliens - a weak bid to make an overly easy game a bit harder;
<br>- the wooden direction and dialogue; the voice acting is ok and the dialogue options are fine, but it all feels too formulaic.
<br>
<br>With a world a little more free form like Left 4 Dead or a less clinical separation between battles and combat and story, the Bureau could have been a modern classic - even though it would still have split the XCOM fanbase in lovers and haters.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=5499013">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The game clearly took inspiration from Mass Effect - the fighting, the dialog choices, even many of the abilities are set up exactly the same.  However, it&apos;s missing the RPG-elements and side-quests that made Mass Effect so great.  It seems like a game made by Mass Effect fans, who didn&apos;t quite &apos;get&apos; what made the game so great.  Thus, if you haven&apos;t played Mass Effect before, you should be playing that instead:  you&apos;ll have basically the same experience but 100x better.  And if you have played it, you&apos;ll probably be disappointed by this poor clone.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3935430">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s nothing but an unnecessary and overcomplicated mess taken after Mass Effect&apos;s formula. Instead of having all abilities conveniently conveyed to you via HOTKEYS, WHICH YOU HAVE OVER 20+ OF ON A KEYBOARD, you have to clumsily jump through character to character in order to take use of them and adapt to swapping viewpoints like an indecisive CCTV operator making the entire game scream &quot;CONSOLE PORT&quot; so badly, I cannot even begin to note it all. But what I can note is the painfully apparent rushing of this game. The character (whom is a skinny, malnourished and sleep-deprived 1960&apos;s human) pushes up 15+ ton vault doors like they&apos;re made out of styrofoam, REPEATEDLY as early as in the first 15 minutes of the game. Just cutscenes, right? Sadly, every other cutscene I&apos;ve seen so far involving facial viewing has not only a downright wrong lipsynching but the developers also went that extra feet to feed every gamer uninspired dialoge through the &quot;cake&quot; system.
<br>
<br>But enough graphical. How are the controls for steering your character besides the moronic order-giving? They&apos;re horrible as well sadly. You sprint (shift) to take cover. You sprint (shift) to vault over things. You sprint (shift) to sprint. And only forward. How dare you presume that controls will be suited for an actual keyboard mouse whereas you can hold down sprint with one hand and perhaps press something else than forward as you just bought the game for 50&#x20AC; to have it on a PERSONAL COMPUTER? But the controls aren&apos;t even the worst part though.
<br>
<br>The AI is the most rotten piece of this turd. I have lost count on how many times they flop behind you, dying repeatedly from not keeping up without your constant micromanagement (turning it into a put that foot infront of the other chore) just to keep them alive or how they are insanely eager to run into the middle of the battle-field at a moments notice when fighting breaks out. Even guys I have recruited with extra stamina (survival, more hp etc.) flops dead within split seconds of a mission if I don&apos;t pause every other second to give them non-braindead advice on where to be, run from grenades and not try to snipe enemies with shotguns and instead aim at the ones that are 2 feet to the left. Combine that with the extremely tedious combat of having to headshot most things 12 times, there&apos;s not much more that can be said about this embarassing flop of a title.
<br>
<br>Needless to say, this game is a shame and a surprising one at that considering the previous, excellent X-com release that integrated just fine onto a PC from a console even when the launch had a few bugs so I would whole-heartedly recommend everyone to stay away from this game unless you can get it for 10$ or less.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=4336328">Expand</a></span>

This game was not that.  At first, I almost stopped playing because this game felt way more first person shooter than tactical.  It could be because the battle never slows down enough for you to think out your decisions, or because the beginning battles are in such small rooms/areas, or because the battles barely lasted long enough to actually flank anybody, or because if you actually did try to flank somebody, you&apos;d die on your way there. Additionally, none of the powers you start with are very tactical at all. At any rate, it didn&apos;t feel like I had much control over the battlefield.  However, the story, characters, graphics, and voice acting were good enough to keep me trudging through.  Eventually, though, the powers started getting better, the battles started getting larger scale, and it started to feel like what I ordered my team to do mattered a *little* more.  Toward the end, you can still win a battle without leaving your starting spot, but at least it feels a little more like Mass Effect 1, now.  And I&apos;m enjoying myself.
<br>
<br>I think the reason this game is getting such bad reviews is because of 1) the expectation of it to be similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown and 2) for whatever reason, the beginning is pretty weak.  But it does get better and the graphics, story, acting, etc. are great.  I&apos;d classify it as a slightly weaker copy of Mass Effect 1.
<br>
<br>I also think the one thing they could have done to improve this game *tremendously* would be to actually pause the battle when you bring up your command screen, rather than just slowing it down.  Just slowing it down makes things rushed and chaotic.  You care less about making the &quot;right&quot; decisions and tend to just spray and pray, instead.  You also have absolutely no time to &quot;scan&quot; the battlefield as you were meant to (it&apos;s a power) because if you actually spent time doing that, it would remove the small window of time you have to flank an enemy before they die.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3498885">Expand</a></span>

<br>The biggest shortcoming is that it is very short game. I did all the missions, talked with people etc. and clocked less than 20 hours before it was finished. Given that it is very story dependent game it is very unlikely that you will want to play it twice.

<br>TL;DR if you manage to buy it with a discount you can get solid 20 hours of gameplay similar to Mass Effect.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=7228024">Expand</a></span>

Mix of 60 &apos;s and traditional Xcom is eatable. If You had good time with ME (especially 2 and 3) You will like this game also. It is not so long though, but worth of playing.</span>

<br>Despite all these flaws, the atmosphere it creates and the ambition to combine the turn base tactical roots with FPS is VERY new and enjoyable.
<br>Just didn&apos;t think this game should be rated as low as it is now despite needing some refinements with some patches. For me, at least 7.5 without patches, and maybe 8.5 if all technical problems are smoothed out.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3597492">Expand</a></span>

The Bureau is not a perfect game, but the score of 6.4 is very unfair to it.
<br>Had they NOT used the name XCOM then I think the score would be even higher, but fans of XCOM got angry because it is a different kind of game then the original et al.  BUT BUT BUT you guys need to embrace ideas like this, as they try something new with a beautiful franscise.
<br>We fans should embrace these attempts and allow games like this to develop and not slate and destroy them just because &quot;it is not XCOM boohoo&quot;.
<br>
<br>The Bureau is a fresh take and copies the Mass Effect combat system in many ways and IMPROVING it greatly.  The combat system is actually unique and I personally don&apos;t know ANY game that is so good in its team AI tactics and gameplay.  You have alot of choices and it would be nice if more games had these ideas.
<br>
<br>The graphics are actually really pretty and the world is interesting.  Yes it is linear.  Yes it has hidden walls.  These things are a negative, but the idea of what they tried should be embraced.
<br>
<br>The story is amazing.  Some may disagree, but I find myself enjoying the strange atmosphere and the alien base mission was just.....good.  The main missions are good.  Good.  Good is enough.  In the older XCOM games the story was....basic.  Even in the newest version the story wasn&apos;t that great.  IN the Bureau they try and flesh it out more and it is a nice attempt
<br>
<br>I will stop here and conclude that this game is worth a go for 20 euros (on kinguin).  It has so much potential and I think a sequel or a spin off of these ideas would be fantastic if they took this game and made it better, cutting out all the flaws.  This is a gold mine for fresh ideas and it deserves at least some minor praise for attempting something new.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3655091">Expand</a></span>

<br>It&apos;s a mission-orientated FPS with the feature to control your squad (with two more soldiers) by pressing Space during combat, you can feel the peculiar tempo this game delivered which I think is the reason why lots of people hate this game, but honestly it&apos;s quite novel and it requires more than aim and shoot to keep your squad alive.
<br>In conclusion I&apos;d say the combat itself is too long and repetitive, and the story isn&apos;t compelling or even a bit boring, you can actually take down every tough aliens with heal (from lv1) and with the lengthy main quest scenarios there&apos;s no incentive to do those side quests which is a requirement of this game from time to time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=4587334">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I have actually created a Metacritic account, simply to point out that this game has been criminally underrated!  i&apos;m not saying its going to win GOTY, but its a superbly build game, with excellent voice acting, creative gameplay elements, and a cool storyline to boot!
<br>
<br>Its the thinking mans FPS :-) do yourself a favour and give it a try.  i promise, you don&apos;t be disappointed!</span>

This is the only &quot;game&quot; I&apos;ve played where if feels like the developers set out to make the game unintuitive and difficult to master.
<br>I&apos;m writing this review, because after several tries, I&apos;m unable to get past the first part of the first actual mission (after the tutorial level) on Veteran.
<br>
<br>2K Games has no concept of &quot;Learning Curve.&quot;  The most basic enemies (sectoids) in the game take eight hits from the M-14 or multiple hits from the friggen shotgun to down (at close range).  Meanwhile, your entire team goes down in seconds.
<br>
<br>The choice of having a way-point save system is mind-boggling in this day and age.  Way-point saves were a product of the limitations of early console systems.  &quot;It&apos;s fun to have the developers choose exactly where my game saves,&quot; said no gamer ever.  The actual choice of where the game saves leaves a lot to be desired.  For example it saves after you choose your team and personal equipment, after which you can&apos;t go back.  Having trouble and want to try different team members or weapons?  Tough.  Go back to the beginning of the level and watch all the cut-scenes again.
<br>
<br>Your squad&apos;s AI is actually worse than nothing.  The squad members don&apos;t start the battle by rushing to the nearest cover and opening fire.  They don&apos;t start the battle by standing in place and opening fire.  They start the battle by rushing across the battle-field to your side while not opening fire.  You have to baby-sit all of their actions from the battle-commander view to get even remotely competent performance out of them, a big problem when you want to be getting to cover and opening fire yourself.  This is something you can&apos;t do from the group coordination screen.  I would much prefer if you could give orders to your own character and treat the game as a real-time squad combat game instead of a shooter.  Or if I could give generic orders a-la Unreal Tournament and have the squad carry them out competently.  As it is, you can choose to get perforated while trying to manage your squad, or have your squad go down, and then get perforated.
<br>
<br>As far as shooters go, it&apos;s just not very good.  Aside from everything mentioned above, there are problems such as requiring you to press an &quot;aim&quot; button to see a reticle of where you&apos;re aiming at, and grenades that work--well, I don&apos;t know.  There was no explanation of how to throw a grenade, so I assumed it was simple.   I pressed the grenade button, and nothing happened.  (Meanwhile, time&apos;s ticking down.)  I hold down the grenade button and see a grenade aiming curve, so I place it on my enemy and release.  Nothing happened.  (Meanwhile, time&apos;s ticking down.)  Am I supposed to hold down the grenade button and then press &quot;fire?&quot;  Maybe.  That was my next thought.  I don&apos;t know, because by that time I was dead.  Which sums up much of the problem with this game.  You die and get a TPK before you can actually figure out the mechanics of how to play it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=4898780">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The creators wanted to show a possibility how the Xcom organization was formed, I doesn&#xB4;t really think they said it was a prequel to the main remastered Xcom game that came out a while ago.
<br>
<br>Good features
<br>
<br>Nice strategy layout with awesome functionality
<br>interesting characters
<br>The game follow the red line
<br>The abilities for each class
<br>Dynamic field of battle ( victory seems close then the mutons suddenly show ups)
<br>
<br>Bad Features
<br>Very interesting characters but no depth to know them better ( the notes are not enough)
<br>Few missions (can be finished within 5 hours if you guys know what to do)
<br>Repetitive enemies (in the early game make the game dull)
<br>Dull interactions sometimes (finish a badass mission no mention of it later in conversations)
<br>No iconic stuff ( no base management, no economy, no gut mentioned decision( until late game), no research, no production)
<br>
<br>Final verdict
<br>
<br>An awsome third pirson strategy game hybrid, waste of potential and with Xcom theme on it like a label on the game, still worth buying if you are an Xcom fan but if not then let this game pass.
<br>

<br>I guess this is the part of the series, which are suitable for those who have not tried or disliked the previous games. Because in this part all the games you will play in the usual shooting and hide behind cover all game. Despite the fact that shooting is not felt and is not interesting to shoot, no tactical raisins, and two morons teammates that all games will be setting you up. Don&apos;t know what inspired me to play on the highest difficulty level, but it was a mistake that cost not only nerves, but also a couple of extra hours to complete the passage. Fans of the series will surely pass by this game, but newcomers I can say that if was not playing in one part XCOM and would like to try and like the setting (1960, alien invasion, etc), you can try, but don&apos;t repeat my mistakes, I play on medium difficulty and do not bother at the expense of tactics - it&apos;s not here.

<br>What I got was a horribly designed Mass Effect 3 combat game with cheesy but somewhat interesting storyline, horrible AI and even more horrible UI.
<br>The game clearly lacks polish as a lot of sounds appear to be missing. You can see that during some of the cutscenes. Sloppy sound design.
<br>Controls are horrible and unresponsive. This game is a horrible, half-assed console port. At least there are some graphics options to be had. Sadly, the game still looks really horrible, graphically.
<br>You can&apos;t configure it  SHIFT is used to sprint, take cover and run out of cover. Not to mention that shooting from cover is a pain in the ass in certain positions.
<br>The UI is unresponsive and horribly designed. You can clearly experience the &apos;amazing&apos; loading times when customizing your agents. When in-game in combat, you can see the console port. There are no use of hotkeys during combat.
<br>Luckily, the combat in this game is somewhat pleasant. The guns feel powerful enough and the enemies feel real and dangerous enough for a thrill while fighting.
<br>I have to admit, the plot twist caught me off guard. It&apos;s certainly interesting and makes your brain twist at times. Although the characters felt very shallow and boring, the story was solid enough to keep me going until the end.
<br>Don&apos;t drop the game if you get bored at the start play for a few hours. The story gets more interesting midway in the game. There are even some choices towards the end of the game that will give you an extra hour or two if you replay the game.
<br>The fact that the character animations and lipsync were half-assed made the whole experience worse.
<br>Overall, I honestly think the game would have been a lot better with more development time. The story was definitely unique and original, to say the least. However, the game lacks polish.
<br>This game is probably one of the main of examples of sloppy, underdone and mediocre developer work.
<br>Under the horrible graphics, AI, UI, design choices and character development lies an interesting, compelling and thought provoking story. Sadly, that &apos;interesting&apos; part (the plot twist) is by the end of the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3447474">Expand</a></span>

Certainly it has its flaws, like the inconsistent plot (for a while it seems like the game is a parody on B-movies, but it&apos;s not, stuff&apos;s presented seriously) with cliche characters, out-of-place moral decisions, the dialogues, sometimes reaching unprecedented degrees of stupidity (Alien interrogation. It&apos;s VERY dumb.), the cheesy voice acting and moderately clunky controls. But it&apos;s the gameplay that still manages to pull the game out of depths of awfulness. While using Mass Effect&apos;s combat system as a foundation, The Bureau expands on it, providing some interesting tactical situations. Here, especially on the harder difficulties, the Rambo style won&apos;t work, you&apos;ll have to manage your squad&apos;s actions. (The squadmates on their own are pretty dumb, can&apos;t use their powers and tend to run out into the open and get incapacitated.) The Bureau&apos;s path to being released was long and winding, but the developers managed to make the game quite enjoyable. It&apos;s one of the games I clearly see a sequel to: so many mistakes await to be fixed and with that done, we&apos;ll get a great game instead of a good one.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3443865">Expand</a></span>

I liked the idea that experience points, perks, traits and team and character customization were implemented. The side missions are repetitive and the whole game could be a billion times better with more care for the details. It would have been better with implemented world map strategy elements, base building, research and micro-management. I would rate this 57%...

<br>
<br>-Graphics are really outdated, plastic looking faces, hair, and washed out textures. Except for the 2 main characters.
<br>-It has audiologs... in giant movie reels... kind of retarded way to add audio. How do common people record their thoughts with giant movie reels? It makes no sense. They threw it in because most FPS/TPS have it now. Suffice to say it&apos;s really boring dialogue. Nobody has anything interesting to say.
<br>-Characters are almost non-existent.
<br>-Story is the same story as every single sci-fi movie out there. Aliens attack, they have a hive mind and must attack this central point.
<br>-Reclaiming a nuclear missile silo is overtaken by aliens and it&apos;s listed as a &quot;minor mission&quot;?
<br>-AI is downright lazy, not just bad, they run into walls, move right into incoming fire, they will ignore you if you shoot at them from the side/behind,
<br>
<br>When ordering your squad mates to move to an area they either
<br>A. stay there whatever happens.. even if they are ambushed, they don&apos;t tell you that they are and they die.
<br>Or B. They move away from the position you told them to stay in for no apparent reason... even if that position is a good one.
<br>
<br>Theres no hold position command, so when a squad mate gets shot down and cries for help.. all your men will run into enemy fire and die to try and save the man.. regardless of how insane that is.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3465084">Expand</a></span>

It is ordinary tactical TPS, where in most cases you will fight against AI of your stupid allies. All missions are the same. Also, there are problems with optimization.
<br>So, I will not repeat what was written before me many times, but the game is quite poor for such a big project. It is okay for a couple evenings, but no more. It&apos;is not that bad, but do not expect much of it.
<br>P.S.

<br>
<br>If I had to describe with one word what was wrong with this game is that it felt  Recycled.
<br>
<br>And that goes for pretty much every aspect of the game.  Storyline, environments, enemies, NPC&apos;s and even the gameplay.  There was really nothing original about this game and unfortunately that realization comes pretty early in the game.  Also what bothered me is that there seemed to be no logical connection from one even to another, which is most evident with the sleepwalkers.
<br>
<br>So to sum it up:
<br>- not enough story
<br>- not enough action  missions
<br>- not enough unique mission objectives
<br>- not enough unique environments and/or enemies
<br>- too much pointless running around the base
<br>
<br>Again, not a terrible game in it&apos;s own, but definitely not worth full price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3449489">Expand</a></span>

Issuing orders to your team is cumbersome, the feel of the controls and gameplay needs a bunch of polish, a number of the gameplay elements do not flow correctly.  For Example:
<br>- Characters talking but their lips are not moving.
<br>- You are in cut scene but yet your team  in the middle of it start trying to engage enemies as if you were in an actual fight
<br>- The people you talk to know things they should not know yet (such as your situation and who you are with)
<br>- One part I was ask to pick up a radio &quot;Over there&quot;  implying that where the NPC was looking when he said over there is were the radio was.... Nope it was literately beside him and not where he was implying it was.
<br>
<br>Any one of these issues (and there are many many more) are not a big deal, but when you have back to back quirks it really can ruin the flow of the game.
<br>
<br>In a nutshell the game needs work and it should have had another 6-12 months of development and polish.
<br>
<br>Save your money and wait for it to be on sale.  The game as is is worth about $19 dollars.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3437763">Expand</a></span>

Fans may be angry at the change from turn based strategy to an 3rd person shooter, but it definitely is not just run and gun, it requires careful positioning and strategy. looking at this game as a separate entity from the other games in the series is important. yes it is different but a solid game.</span>

Since then I have always been interested in getting to know the other titles from the older series. Time passed and lets plays were watched but, I never bought the games (due to the lack of income...)
<br>Noticing the bundle that came with the new XCOM game The Bureau; I found this would be the perfect time to get some games I really wanted( and spec ops too, cool!). So, I like to lie to myself and think I spent most of my $44 on those games.
<br>With that guff out of the way The Bureau&apos;s good, bad, and ugly.
<br>
<br>Good:
<br>I&apos;m a sucker for the noir  All the retro tech. and fedoras make me smile. The ability to rename and repaint my squaddies helps immerse me in the a world where every one is named Dick Swissknife.
<br>The guns are fun and diverse but, nothing new to xcom. Punching is hilarious, especially when your squaddies never see it coming.
<br>This game also implements Mass Effect style talking sequences. They don&apos;t bother me and help expand the lore. As well as the scattered notes and recordings that you will find along the linear levels. The story is something I&apos;m not really good at judging so I won&apos;t be talking about it.
<br>
<br>Bad:
<br>For a tactical 3rd person shooter The Bureau&apos;s UI is really poor. Switching from teammate and ability to teammate and ability is simple and easy unless, your mouse is anywhere on the screen. The game will then proceed to see the mouse as priority control. Which will then lead you to select the wrong command. Yes, you can then press backspace to cancel but, I shouldn&apos;t have to. Plus, for those of us who do like to squint at the game and pretend I&apos;m doing something tactical, the mistake can set me back and often get my men killed. If my intention was to move them but attack is accidentally selected. For a tactical UI please use either keyboard shortcuts OR mouse control, not both.
<br>Small side note. The options menu is fairly restricted but at least the option to play in DX9 or DX11 is presented right as you load up. Then you are just a fingers-crossed moment away from playing Xcom.
<br>
<br>Oh, and only two weapons, come on.
<br>
<br>Ugly:
<br>I truly believe all of my teammates would much rather be dead than stay under my command. They consantly move out of cover and into the fray, despite my insistance that they stay in the one, and there is only one, full cover area. The team AI is thick as bricks. Moving them from one point to another is a gamble to whether they will remain safe and go along cover to there destination. Or they run straight through to there inevitable deaths.
<br>Also, no coop! I know Xcom has long been a singleplayer adventure but this would have been a perfect way to fix the AI; by getting rid of it.
<br>
<br>Summary
<br>Good: Style, combat and lore.
<br>Bad: Tactical UI and options menu.
<br>Ugly: AI and lack of Coop.
<br>
<br>Do I recommend this. Yes! but on sale. $20 at most. Not full price release.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3439555">Expand</a></span>

<br>I think that a game should be entertaining, if it isn&apos;t surely its in breach of trade description act.
<br>I&apos;m not saying this is the worst game in the wolrd but I think if you&apos;ve got &#xA3;29.99 to spend, you&apos;d probably be better spending it on something else.

The characters, gameplay and storyline seems pretty good so far. Controls are easy to use and quite intuitive...   The people criticising this game for not being like the others should have known that, as it was made extremely clear that it&apos;s a 3rd person shooter.

                                        <span class="inline_expand_collapse inline_collapsed" id="review_blurb_3449192"><span class="blurb blurb_collapsed"></span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Well, when i first heard about this &quot;shooter with XCOM in it&quot; i thought about another quick cash grab game like &quot;X-COM: Enforcer&quot;.
<br>First of all as most of us (i hope so) thought this game has nothing to do with XCOM. Just some shooter with some mutons and sectoids in it.
<br>First of all i&apos;m going to talk about plot. I don&apos;t like it. At all. At first it&apos;s ok: despair of losing war, some tension building with this sleepwalker disease. But around the mid game all that goes to hell and 2K start to feed you something that makes no sense at all as a plot. First mistake is that they tried to do some emotional things like agent Weaver&apos;s brother and agent DaSilva turning into sleepwalker. But they forgot to do anything to get you attached to any character in game. So you literally don&apos;t give a single f*ck. So then Carter let Weaver kill Axis after millions of warnings that everyone and their mothers want him ALIVE i was sitting in my chair with one thought &quot;WTF??! Why?!&quot; After that things goes completely nuts along with Carter himself. And suddenly scientists who&apos;s job before was primary to set silacoids inside the base on rampage or blow you up with new weapon prototype invented and constructed some flying sausage that (despite major advantage of aliens in technology) completely undetectable (even if it&apos;s clearly visible visually) by Outsiders. So all their military might doesn&apos;t matter any more, because XCOM can strike anywhere (for example at main ship surrounded my massive defensive fleet). &apos;Merica, f*ck yeah! Oh, btw, i wonder why &quot;ruassians&quot; in modern games mostly speak the same awful pseudo russian language as in old movies? Don&apos;t think it that hard to find decent russian voice actor now in America. So only thing i can say about plot is that they bite more than they can chew. In my opinion game should focus only on the earliest incursion, defeating expedition force at best and leaving main force for &quot;Enemy Unknown&quot;.
<br>As for strategy TPS a have a mixed feallings. On one side this is the best incarnation of it so far. I found it much more interesting and tense than in Mass Effect. Only thing i wish is slow time effect while you targeting with grenade. At the same time this tactical combat became boring too quickly. Mostly because you doing same thing over and over again. You meet all aliens and all agents hit max level (except Carter) in about first third of the game. So there is nothing new to bring in, just variations for the same enemies but more bullet spongy. Add awful console controls to it. Just imagine sprint, stick to cover and jump over cover  all this actions are on one button. And that not the worst thing. The worst is that you can&apos;t move cursor in tactical pause mode over obstacles. So you have to move it around but that&apos;s not always possible (because of placement radius limitation). To make thing even more frustrating there is an AI for you. You think about enemy AI that cheats or something? Nope, it&apos;s about your mates AI. They act like they know better what to do. So if you gave command to friendly agent to take cover behind this crate don&apos;t be surprised to find him somewhere on the other part of the map just some 20 seconds later.
<br>While graphics are good and probably the best part of this game it still have it share of problems. First of all lip sync. It doesn&apos;t sync at all. Also there are flame rate drops. There is nothing in this game that modern PC can&apos;t handle but from time to time frame rate drops under 20 fps.
<br>So there was a chance to make Bureau a good game. Despite technical problems first half of this game really trying to be decent while everything else have a &quot;oh crap, lets quickly finish and sell it already&quot; taste. But 2k wasted that chance. So if you want a XCOM go buy Xenonauts or Enemy Unknown at least. If you want a good TPS go buy new Splinter Cell. Or Saint Row IV if you want TPS with totally nuts story (&quot;&apos;Merica, f*ck yeah!&quot; included).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3449192">Expand</a></span>

Maybe they expected a common shooter like BF or COD, but They were surprised because it was a tactical action game. The AI is high quality, because the enemies react as they should, although sometimes surprising reactions from teammates.

<br>I totally recommend it.</span>

<br>
I&apos;m a great fan of many games that &apos;The Bureau&apos; borrowed concepts:
Mass Effect 3: Combat, Dialog Wheel, Base navigation, tactical pause to issue commands, ...
Batman Arkham Museum/City: Tactical View with &apos;detective mode&apos;.
Assassin&apos;s Creed: Brotherhood: Dispatch Missions.</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">I have just finished the Game. There is no absolute need to replay it.
<br>I enjoyed it, not lets make some critics.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m a great fan of many games that &apos;The Bureau&apos; borrowed concepts:
<br>Mass Effect 3: Combat, Dialog Wheel, Base navigation, tactical pause to issue commands, ...
<br>Batman Arkham Museum/City: Tactical View with &apos;detective mode&apos;.
<br>Assassin&apos;s Creed: Brotherhood: Dispatch Missions.
<br>
<br>The Graphics Style is nice and detailed, very few flaws. Noir  RetroFuturism. Maybe.
<br>Sound is very good, and so is Voice Acting (regardless of the script).
<br>
<br>History: The drama is present, but not really there. The characters are easy to forget. Your agents are very common and uninteresting.
<br>Perhaps the most disturbing thing is that for the 90% of the Game, your dialogues and CHOICES are meaningless.
<br>
<br>Dispatching Agents in missions only serves for leveling them. The rewards are not really useful.
<br>There are many unexplained abilities of the characters, technology, how do they magically appear?
<br>
<br>I found very disappointing in the fact that in the epilogue you see how they are trying to Cover Up everything (like was so widely advertised). The cover-up effort is barely visible in game.
<br>
<br>It is sincerely not possible to cover up something like that.
<br>You see the US map later in game full of RED (aliens, not commies).
<br>No connection with the US Central Command? Possible, but not realistic in that time, when a crippling attack of Soviet forces was feared.
<br>
<br>Customization: Is there, but is not enough. And when later in game they took my Fedora Hat, I cursed. Details, details.
<br>
<br>Difficulty: For a setting of &apos;Veteran&apos; (easy, normal, veteran, commander), I found it very easy and with a lot of ammunition. For an X-COM title, it had to be Harder.
<br>
<br>Likes:
<br>Besides some usability, the tactical commands, combos and combat in general is good.
<br>Some surprises on the history late game, a few decisions with some impact, well crafted scenarios.
<br>The main character is likeable.
<br>
<br>Dissapointments:
<br>No real bridge (in history) with X-COM: Enemy Unknown. It was the perfect opportunity to explain how the Council was formed years ago.
<br>More drama expected.
<br>SideQuests with no real Impact or rewards, just more extra mini-history.
<br>No weapon customization.
<br>No connection with some of the secondary characters and my recruited agents.
<br>No randomness.
<br>Fedora Hat removed.
<br>
<br>I do Recommend this game, you will have fun, but is only for one playthrough.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3462003">Expand</a></span>

<br>2 .It&apos;s far too short.
<br>
<br>Considering you are in story dialogue and running around the base for a large part of time (about a 3rd) and combat the rest it took under 12 hours total to complete on veteran. This is reading every item, listening to every recording and doing all side missions. I actually thought, &quot;nah, this can&apos;t be it...&quot; and was really disappointed when it ended. I feel i HAVE to go back and complete on Commander difficulty to make this purchase worth it.
<br>
<br>If this is another attempt at developers to cash in on DLC for more content at a later date I&apos;ll be quite pissed. It does feel like half a game.
<br>
<br>Overall it kept me playing to the end in a short space of time and that says a lot, as I rarely complete games these days.
<br>
<br>n.b. A note on character perma-death. It&apos;s a meaningless mechanic as I lost troops twice, but quickly died myself and just re spawned with them.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3449236">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The setting will feel instantly familiar to XCOM veterans with opponents are terrain features that appaer in earlier XCOM titles as well. As far as 3rd person shooters go it&apos;s fairly ok. The game feels somewhat sluggish but offers enough tactical options to make combat interesting. It never evolves past interesting though since the AI leaves much to be desired making combat feel slowpaced and kinda dumbed down. Opponents are hardhitting and tough making combat challenging enough, although perhaps not in the way I would&apos;ve hoped.
<br>
<br>The 1950&apos;s backdrop is cool, not something you see a whole lot, but as with the gameplay (and pretty much everything else in The Bureau) the full potential hasn&apos;t been unlocked. The towns and vehicles are 50&apos;s but never does the game feel convincingly set in the USA of the 50&apos;s. Walking around on linear maps from combat area to combat area there&apos;s the occasional vista which manages to impress but it&apos;s too little really.
<br>
<br>I could go on and on but the gist is clear. This game could&apos;ve been great, instead it&apos;s just ok.

<br>The story was compelling, if a bit rushed in parts, and I wish they had incorporated some more of the research and building aspects of Unknown but in the end I was completely happy with my purchase. The end of the game feels very rushed, and I would have liked a bit more diversity among my squad as I tended to use the same two for every mission.
<br>
<br>Definitely worth a buy though, as long as your expectations are right</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3460753">Expand</a></span>

I have no prior exposure to any of the xcoms or anything from the series except for what I have read on the lore. Upon finally playing it what I will say is; it could have been so much more than it was. IT was a serious letdown in terms of the storyline. I could live with gameplay inconstancies which it has its fair share of. Such as voices not matching characters later on in the story or unexplained lapses in time. The storyline just doesn&apos;t deliver and that is why this game gets such a low rating from me. It felt as though had they brought in good writers it could have excelled even having very little to do with the other xcoms and original lore. Not everything is gameplay as seen by games like Telltales walking dead and The last of us, Both stellar games with central focus on story. Xcom at time also feels like it tries to steel from bioware&apos;s mass effect series, which is the right direction if you want to implement intuitive character dialog and progression, but its only a shadow of what it is in dragon age/mass effect. This game was an alright play and I completed it all the way through, meaning to me it wasn&apos;t horrible. However the whole time I couldn&apos;t wait to complete it to free up the SSD space to play the next game. Don&apos;t expect too highly with this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3465926">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>Fantastic game. Just finished it.
<br>This is *NOT* a strategy game, but a spin-off loosely based on the classic X-Com series.
<br>Most close definition would be a squad-based shooter.
<br>
<br>This game was tremendous fun to play. The graphics are great. The gameplay was great. I loved the atmosphere, as well as the story.
<br>This game is highly underrated. Don&apos;t miss this one!</span>

<br>Regardless of whether other players defend it or slate it I can only say that I simply did not enjoy this game. I &quot;get&quot; that it&apos;s not XCOM: Enemy Unknown however that doesn&apos;t excuse the many bad points this game has.
<br>
<br>First, the good-ish news. Graphically, it&apos;s not bad. No real complaints there.
<br>
<br>Game mechanic-wise The Bureau involves little more than story-telling cut-scenes, a lot of running around to get from point A to B to C and finally to some actual game play  the &quot;tactical&quot; combat. Did I mention a lot of running from point A to point B?
<br>
<br>The combat is the best part of the game. In itself reasonably enjoyable. A hybrid shooter/strategy system but not enough to carry the entire game I&apos;m afraid and certainly far from perfect.
<br>
<br>In The Bureau, your agents can level-up after gaining experience but this just doesn&apos;t seem to have the same relevance as it does for your squad in, say XCOM: Enemy Unknown where having a levelled-up squad seems to make a real difference and you strive to keep them alive. In The Bureau, it&apos;s like &quot;he&apos;s leveled up  meh.&quot;
<br>
<br>Equipping team members with new equipment is laborious and clunky; using a controller because the keyboard controls are just too much trouble involves lots of right button, right button, down, down, click, down, down, click, right trigger, repeat for each team member. Yawn.
<br>
<br>I&apos;ve seen reviews here stating this game has high replay value. Seriously, I&apos;m wondering if I can stomach playing it through to the end ONCE, let alone returning to it. There are far better games out there deserving of my time.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s awkward that The Bureau pre-order perk on Steam; receiving the other XCOM titles including Enemy Unknown are actually better games than The Bureau itself.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3447040">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story was compelling, if a bit rushed in parts, and I wish they had incorporated some more of the research and building aspects of Unknown but in the end I was completely happy with my purchase.  The end of the game feels very rushed, and I would have liked a bit more diversity among my squad as I tended to use the same two for every mission.
<br>
<br>Definitely worth a buy though, as long as your expectations are right.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3440508">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>While it lacks the overwhelming scope of the Mass Effect games, it does offer a deeper tactical system than found in Bioware&apos;s games.
<br>
<br>The story is fun, even if you need to stretch your &apos;suspension of disbelief&apos; a bit.  Honestly, considering that you had to do the same for the previous X-com games, it&apos;s not a surprise.  In the second half of the game, the stakes get raised and the plot twists in some interesting and unexpected ways.
<br>
<br>The voice acting is pretty solid and the overall flavor of setting it in that weird time period of  the space race, yet before the hippie cultural revolution was a jolting and interesting choice.
<br>
<br>It is 3rd best X-com game, past the first and the recent tactical remake.
<br>
<br>The game is not without it&apos;s flaws, of course.  The lip syncing and actor motion capture lacks polish. Also, the graphics are stylized and simplistic, yet run horribly on the highest graphic settings.  It&apos;s also rather brief, with very little in the way of fleshing out and side missions.
<br>
<br>Also, it lacks the research, production, interception and base management of the previous games, so if that is what defines an Xcom game to you, you may be disappointed.
<br>
<br>This game with has convinced me that this will be cult classic game, like Vampire: Bloodlines or Alpha Protocol (though not as broken as either of those) and that not everyone is meant to &apos;get it&apos;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3439044">Expand</a></span>

First off,</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Let me be perfectly clear: The Bureau is a third person alien shooter with sort-of turn based gameplay thrown in, some classes, and some XCOM lore thrown in. It&apos;s more of an X-COM: Enforcer than Enemy Unknown. It&apos;s very important for you to know this, and I&apos;ll discuss why later. For the time being, allow me to give you my impressions on it:
<br>
<br>This game is far from perfect.
<br>
<br>First off, and despite the messages suggesting you to flank your enemies and remaining mobile, the Bureau is a pretty punishing game with aggressive tactics, and the player soon has to learn to to turtle up and play it safe unless he wants to risk two droids suddenly popping out of nowhere and pummeling your squad into dust. In some cases, your squadmates will continually get hit despite being behind cover. It doesn&apos;t help the fact that the AI will act up sometimes, exposing your allies to fire for no good reason.
<br>
<br>And it&apos;s not just the fact that your squadmates seem to have quite a bit of trouble aiming, but the aliens are able to take quite a lot of hits while able to dish out considerable amounts of damage in the process, especially if a Commander is on the field, which will shield allies and make them even hardier. The problem with this is not only the fact that you neeed to be constantly watching out for insta-outflanks, but having to spend almost an entire magazine per alien, you run the risk of running out of bullets pretty fast, and then you will be exposed to both enemy fire and maybe an even bigger hindrance: the controls.

<br>The Bureau&apos;s controls are one of the most indecisive and weird I&apos;ve seen in some time. It seems a game designed with a controller in mind (you move markers along the ground to signal orders to your allies with WASD, as opposed to the mouse, for instance), but it really takes advantage of the keyboard and mouse layout for quick and efficient shootout control, and as a result you are constantly wondering if it wouldn&apos;t be better to switch from keyboard to gamepad and vice versa. Add to that a couple of bafflingly impractical actions (you do THE EXACT SAME THING -tapping &quot;R&quot;- to reload than to pick up ammo than to pick up weapons, which frequently can lead you to switch your empty sniper rifle for a shotgun and grab the ammo the shotgun instead for the rifle in just two presses of &quot;R&quot;, leaving you utterly rifleless in a long-range battle, for instance), and a honestly weird menu layout, and you&apos;ll end up wondering how could 2K Marin seriously mess up such basic features so hard.
<br>
<br>Graphics are OK. For the most part, and for the scenario that the developers thought we would be looking at. Turn around somewhere you aren&apos;t expected to look at, though, and you might find some of the worst scenario filler I&apos;ve seen in a while, and that&apos;s counting sandbox games such as Prototype 2: blank, ginormous sheets of metal, blank walls, lifeless environments; and the game needs a nice computer to run it all at a decent speed, too: my i7 3770  8GB DDR3 RAM  Nvidia GTX650 2GB DDR5 couldn&apos;t handle it at max detail, having to turn off some of the subtler options.
<br>
<br>Characters are pretty unique, and in some cases they remind me a bit of L.A. Noire&apos;s cast. While not award-winning, one can be really entertained by the Dirty Harry-esque dialogue from the main character. There is a dialogue tree that really doesn&apos;t do much aside from giving you some extra info, there are a bunch of collectibles strewn about, and there are a couple of side missions that usually need you to go from point A to point B and then to point A again. Serviceable, if a bit lackluster. Soundtrack can be pretty inmersive, and voicework is pretty good too.
<br>
<br>All in all, The Bureau is not a perfect game, but it is not a BAD one: every aspect of it is unpolished and even weird sometimes, but it does its job without really failing at anything. It is a Rogue Trooper, or a Stubbs the Zombie, or any Red Faction game: bad enough to not be a classic, good enough to play, complete and forget about, and I think it deserves love despite its faults.
<br>
<br>A lot of people seem to hate the &quot;XCOM&quot; in the title, and it&apos;s probably the most main point of many people&apos;s  about it. It&apos;s quite tragic, in my opinion, that someone would pre-order, buy and then complain about &quot;their&quot; turn-based strategy franchise being ruined by a Third Person Shooter when there&apos;s already been X-COM games that have deviated from the original formula (basically all of them between &quot;terror of the deep&quot; and &quot;enemy unknown&quot;), but then again, that shows you when people in the internet feel entitled to with franchises that are older than themselves.
<br>
<br>The game came with its DLC, plus all the X-COM collection and Spec Ops: The Line as pre-order bonuses for about 40&#x20AC;, which is an awesome deal. If you didn&apos;t get it then, you&apos;d probably do better to wait for it to go on sale for Halloween or Christmas. If you like third person shooters get it, but maybe not at full price.

Now that they didn&apos;t you get a bunch of people ranting on Metacritic and other websites with giant nostalgia boners saying this is the worst game ever made. Simply put, it is a refreshing surprise. If you get it in you mind that this game has nothing to do with XCOM and plays more like Mass Effect, its a solid game. Not great, but solid. The Bureau builds an incredible atmosphere right from the beginning. It has a great 50&apos;s Noire feel to it that carries this game. The combat is almost exactly like ME and works well. Although the Ai will have its &quot;special&quot; moments, it is a fun third person cover shooter where flanking and planning are actually needed. Its not XCOM, but thats really the point. Over all i had fun with it, i wouldn&apos;t reccomend it for $60  but pick it up on its first sale or price cut for 30 or 40 dollars.I think its worth giving the devs the money at that price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3441728">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay style and mechanics are very similar to Mass Effect I think the developers actually even came out and said they were shooting for Mass Effect &apos;ish gameplay mechanics. It has a very authentic 50&apos;s-early 60&apos;s theme and feel. Sure it&apos;s not like any of the other X-COM or XCOM games but then again almost all the games in the series are very different from each other anyways. To some it isn&apos;t &quot;X-COM enough&quot; but that doesn&apos;t make it a bad game, The Bureau is good in its own way, and has even some typical features of a XCOM game like the customization of your squad member&apos;s names, load outs and uniform color. So... In a nut shell.
<br>
<br>PROS:
<br>*Awesome 50&apos;s atmosphere that feels very original.
<br>
<br>*Tactical combat is fun and creative.
<br>
<br>*Very logical abilities of squad member classes.
<br>
<br>CONS:
<br>* Limited amount of customization options.
<br>
<br>* The facial expressions of some of the NPC&apos;s are kind of bad, considering the standard of games
<br>in this day and age.
<br>
<br>*Feels kinda short for a story based tactical shooter, games like this are good with longevity.
<br>
<br>*Some wasted opportunities that could of pushed this game higher would of been something similar to XCOM:EU&apos;s collecting resources on the battlefield and researching tech for better weapons and armor.
<br>
<br>In summary, The Bureau isn&apos;t a bad entry in the XCOM, it can be pretty fun to utilize your squad&apos;s abilities in combat, I just feel it needed more features and longer and better character progression for the player and the squad members.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3441528">Expand</a></span>

It is not about FPS, aiming system is so bad, like you hold your gun while being on some ship in the middle of ocean during storm. It is not about RPG, because your decisions are not taking you different ways and level system is just, erm, pathetic. And this is not about your base building, one of aspect X-COM series loved for. This is... I don&apos;t know. This is mediocre mix of genres, but nothing special in none of them. Really, nothing special. I know creating this game took a lot of time, nice ideas and money, but on the end it doesn&apos;t fit cost you pay for. Will you get your fun here? Sure, you will get a bit. Will this fun be enough to stay impressed? No. No. No.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3447804">Expand</a></span>

I&apos;m generally an &quot;Any genre guy&quot;, I play it all, but this new hybrid take on turn based strategy and 3rd person shooting just doesn&apos;t work. Hell, it&apos;s even hard for me to put the words strategy and shooting in the previous sentence because the game misses both aspects by a mile.
<br>
<br>For a shooter to be enjoyable, you need to have comfortable shooting mechanics, nice gun feel and an overall sense of power when you hit an enemy, XCOM fail completely in this aspect. The gun feel is horrible, there&apos;s no feeling of &quot;UMFFF!&quot; when you fire any weapons or activate any abilities, it all seems completely static. Most fights feel like all I&apos;m doing is transporting ammunition from my ammo counter to the faces of my opponents with little to no joy at all.
<br>
<br>This being an XCOM game it&apos;s no surprise that most of the game takes place in cover; behind walls, crates, vehicles and things of that nature, that&apos;s all fine and dandy, but it really shows how lackluster this game is when you realize there&apos;s no way of you to tell your teammates that &quot;You have to STAY in cover!&quot;, no no, your teammates will keep blasting until they drop or get saved (And still you&apos;ll end up killing 90% of the aliens you encounter). Your teammates insist on being part of the mayhem and in many cases you either have to save them yourself or reposition them again and again using the slow-motion tactical view---   which leads me to the strategic part of the game:
<br>
<br>Everything strategic is done using a slow-motion spider sense that enables you to tell your teammates where to go and what to do, this feature is so slow to use considering the game is still &quot;playing&quot; while you&apos;re moving this huge marker across the battlefield to your desired location. Imagine a level where you have a lot of different elevations, high and low, for me to tell my teammate to &quot;Get to high ground, Here!&quot; I have to move my marker AROUND all the obstacles on its way and up the stairs, instead of this marker just floating up and over anything in its way. This may seem like a small issue, but considering when you&apos;ve finally repositioned your team the enemies will have had enough slow-mo time to move to entirely new locations, which leads to a very vicious circle of constant slow-mo management (In many cases I found it easier to just let my teammates stay waaay behind in cover and then go and shoot the baddies myself, even later in the game). Well then, I just need to do it faster and better then... but isn&apos;t that exactly the opposite of what any fan would expect from these series? It rushes the decision making, it forces crude judgement and quick thinking. In the old games I could take a dump between each move and still come out on top, but if I misclicked once BAM, my team would be in trouble, but not doomed. Now you have to think on your feet, if you place a teammate in the wrong location once and he decides to play the hero and keep blasting, BAM down he goes, down forever.
<br>
<br>It may sound like I&apos;m judging the game because of its difficulty, but I&apos;m a very passionate gamer and love a serious challenge, but XCOM has simply taken a route I completely disagree with- the story and characters are all rather enjoyable (at least I enjoyed it) but I simply couldn&apos;t handle the simplistic strategy and boring shooting when I was expecting a sweet blend of XCOM mechanics and &quot;Mass Effect&quot;&apos;ish firefights and storytelling.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s also plain to see as a mostly PC gamer (Is it possible to write this without sounding like a douche?) how this game was specifically designed to be played on a console, which leads me to the conclusion that this game was nothing but an attempt to use yet another great IP to do a quick hit and run cash-in by catering to the sheeple who can&apos;t stretch their minds around too many game elements at the same time.
<br>
<br>Call me a fanboy or whatever, but the changes done to this XCOM is the equivalent of adding shooter elements to Civilization V or changing zombies in Left 4 Dead to normal soldiers- it takes the CORE out the game. It&apos;s no longer what it was born as- It&apos;s simply not XCOM.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3441014">Expand</a></span>

I like the way you moved and issued orders to your squad, and it becomes relevant with the difficulty all the way up. I&apos;m more reliant on my squad in this game than I ever was in Mass Effect, even on insanity. I do think, especially in the early game there are major flaws. The one that really bothered me was your allies in the first mission having alien tech like laser turrets. I know they have you leveled up allies for the tutorial level, but it made things seem absurd. But abilities feel like they have real power when used correctly.
<br>
<br>I feel like the conversation wheel falls flat too often. In a game like Mass Effect, there are certainly the times where a conversation feels unnatural and disjointed based on the order you address things, but The Bureau usually feels that way. Plus the fact that conversations don&apos;t branch makes me wonder why they bothered with the system instead of just having scripted, skippable conversations. I also think the lack of a research system was a missed opportunity, but this game isn&apos;t a turn-based strategy XCOM with randomly generated missions, and I recognize that. It wan nice to see an XCOM game with a story though.
<br>
<br>Overall I&apos;ve enjoyed my time with the game. I might feel a little more short changed were it not for all the free stuff you got with a Steam preorder.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3442108">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>I especially like the XCOM  60&apos;s theme and the GFX is good too. I probably would not pay &#xA3;30 for it but considering I got it for &#xA3;20 with all the pre-order bonuses I&apos;m quite happy and will have fun playing it through once. I don&apos;t see this game having the replay ability of XCOM Enemy Unknown, but these are 2 fundamentally different games, so would be unfair to compare them. They share the same theme and that&apos;s where it ends.

<br>
<br>The plot line makes NO sense at all, if taken in the context of the XCOM cannon.  There is no research to speak of, and no base management.  Interaction with NPC&apos;s is limited to rather boring, decision driven conversation, and the decisions you make in conversations have no repercussions of any kind.
<br>
<br>Movement in somewhat counter-intuitive, and the AI of squad members is laughable.  Because of that terrible AI, you will find yourself hitting the space bar to issue orders so often, that the flow of the action as a shooter, is terrible.
<br>
<br>So basically, the strategic elements that we&apos;ve come to love in the XCOM universe are non-existent, and the tactical interface is lackluster.
<br>
<br>Still, the eye candy is very good.  The details to the environments are really nice.  I just wish that the developers had put more depth into the game play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3437769">Expand</a></span>

This is a 3rd person squad based tactical shooter and it&apos;s a lot of fun. The story is excellent and I feel really immersed. The character models are amazing and it truly feels like the 1960&apos;s.
<br>
<br>Fans of the series should definitely give it a shot.</span>

Now imagine a game NOTHING like that, yeah? That is this. A weird hybrid game that wants to be Call Of Duty so badly it&apos;s shameful.
<br>How can you take a strategy series and make it action without any reasoning behind it?
<br>The game doesn&apos;t work and it never ever will.
<br>Your squad literally have to be babysat. They are useless on their own and will go down consistently. There is no RTS/TBS element to the game anymore and everything is down to luck. It is chaotic in the battlefield, cutscenes are long, boring and repetitive and there is no real storyline, just people talking at each other.
<br>Save yourself money, never ever buy this game.
<br>Seriously. Not even if it goes on sale. You will get way more enjoyment out of a new pair of socks.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3442744">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Theres NO base building or even upgrading your base its just a hub to create new recruits of which theres no female versions. its one big sausage fest here. theres no real threat looming you can do any mission in any order as you see fit..
<br>
<br>The voice acting is not terrible but its lacking considerably theres little to no life to the characters. lots of graphical clipping, mouths don&apos;t move very well and sometimes not at all while the &quot;actors&quot; are speaking.
<br>
<br>This game from my point of view seems incredibly dumbed down for an x-com game. every time you get a new ability it gos in to lengthy detail via a cinematic movie about how the ability works. which is helpful but should be a side thing not a requirement. it really detracts from the story which is&apos;nt really all that great, with out going in to great detail, aliens invade &quot;skins look ripped right out of the previous x-com game for the 360.&quot; you fight them blah blah blah boring...ZzzzzzZZzz
<br>
<br>you dont get to capture alien tech and research it, you just find it in the field and equip it once you&apos;ve found one aliens just drop there guns which you couldn&apos;t get that way before hand because they would disintegrate...now there every where...
<br>
<br>TLDR:
<br>Nothing to do with an xcom game other then the title and aliens..
<br>No base building  this is a big big NO NO imo.
<br>No tech capturing and research, you just find them and use them in the environment. once found you can equip them.
<br>No real looming threat, fills like no reason to continue playing, theres no real bad guy just a bunch of aliens to kill.
<br>No character creation, just minor customization.
<br>
<br>Doesn&apos;t fill like an x-com game at all really needs base building and character creation. In this day and age theres no excuse not to include a character creation with both male and female versions doesn&apos;t even have to be super in depth. Its just laziness to omit such things.
<br>
<br>You just don&apos;t make a new game and complexly leave out the major things that made up a big enjoyable part of previous incarnations. I have half a mind to go back to walmart and get a refund. they always take them back.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3438144">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>In all seriousness, the game was alright; managing to create a genuine sense of scope and gravitas midway throughout, after stumbling over itself in the opening missions.
<br>
<br>However, It did feel a bit bland, and the storyline comes across as forcibly emotive and hard to take seriously in some instances. In XCOM: Enemy Unknown, the situation of an alien invasion felt plausible. The aliens never &quot;talked&quot; or interacted with the player, serving to pull you into the games atmosphere as you attempted to deal with what could very well have been a real and &quot;unknown&quot; threat to the earth and humanity, as you slowly discover clues and scraps of information regarding the alien&apos;s agenda.
<br>
<br>In the XCOM Declassified however, this feeling is gone, replaced by a slightly generic, Hollywood esque scifi narrative that instead creates its own alternate human history, rather than attempt to play along with the events of the cold war in the 60&apos;s as cover ups for alien activity (A premise that could have been brilliantly developed and executed, but alas...).
<br>
<br>But if there&apos;s one thing I should say, it&apos;s kudos to the developers for the SHEER amount of dialogue and brilliant character interactions throughout your time spent in the underground XCOM base. (I swear I&apos;ve almost had the impulse to use one of Carter&apos;s signature hand gestures in conversation :P)
<br>
<br>All in all, it&apos;s a decent, slightly clunky third person cover based shooter, with a commendably executed, yet somewhat bland and predictable plot.

The story is somewhat nice and engaging at times, yet I can&apos;t help but feel that this is a largely missed opportunity. With its setting and overall atmosphere it has the potential to make an awesome tactical strategy. It&apos;s saddening that it&apos;s become just a failed attempt to cater to a wider audience of gamers. Honestly, i can&apos;t see who wouldn&apos;t feel lost in this game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3443895">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>As a stand-alone squad FPS  it&apos;s fairly lacking. Squad controls are mediocre, and AI is terrible (running into walls, ignoring land mines, running through open areas rather than using nearby cover, etc). It really has to be micromanaged which isn&apos;t fun in an action game, and will likely get your main character shot.
<br>
<br>The game also lacks a lot of polish  The graphics are dated (even for the 1960&apos;s style) and framerates are slow on high-end machines unless you seriously turn down settings. The overall storyline is full of cliche moments, and the game just lacks an overall amount of completeness. This isn&apos;t something that&apos;s likely to be fixed through patches either, as the &quot;core&quot; game is done, but not all the little extra things that make it feel alive.
<br>
<br>It is an interesting take on the genre, overall, but I have buyers remorse and would not recommend it to others  especially not at full price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3437223">Expand</a></span>

I gather from the behind-the-scenes that they&apos;re going for the third iteration of the Bureau&apos;s gameplay when the surprise hit...well, hit which sounds rather believable when you watch the video. I just can&apos;t grasp the ignorance that they totally copy Mass Effect 3&apos;s gameplay and would not admit it....granted that it is not as smooth as and not as polished. It is not fair to compare the two games but the developer puts themselves in this position and the success of the turn based strategy rebirth certainly affects them the most, positively and negatively. The traces of Enemy Unknown can be seen throughout the game, as a true homage and also straight copycat. This review is written as I played only a few hours of the game and does not represents my final verdict of the Bureau. That is still to come but I will give my score nonetheless.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3451867">Expand</a></span>

<br>You build your team skills by picking paths of perks (same as before)....I swear I don&apos;t see how some are complaining, if you like waiting 4 turns before your turn come around to shoot then turn base is for you and maybe you might be disappointed.

<br>
<br>Graphics: 8  The game starts as a cold game, not so many explosions, some times the sincronism of the speech and the lips of the characters is ridiculous wrong and ugly. But after 40% of the game, the game engage on a great time, real great graphics like alien bridge, alien doors, alien space ship, smoke everywhere, directx 11 made a great improviment.
<br>
<br>Sound: 7  The worse score in this game, because dont have a GREAT impactant theme sound, all the same music in the headquarter, the combate have same music, and the some sound effects is the same archive of other games. Its not worse because the final ending mission is AWSOME, great music and all.
<br>
<br>History: 9  Good plot, but lack of real decisions, u only have a real choise in the final mission, and its not a huge impact in the ending. The main character could have a better focus and narrative, with cut cenes. And the enemys could have a better explanation of their acts, some times u must make a effort to  let some plot holes not interfer in the logic.
<br>
<br>System: 7  Here your have an area to improve, The game could have the areas as functional, like, on the laboratory u can research upgrades for weapons/itens ate some cost. On the radio tower u could have to build and acess to new missions. Engineering could have to biuld/maintain the avengers. And the soldiers could have better development, maybe some stats, u can use point to distribute, but the soldiers are all like the same with minor changes.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3449532">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>It operates in a very similar way to mass effect during combat and this is no bad thing. However though it does leave a lot to be desired outside of combat. The time in the base is usually dull with the information (books, voice recordings etc) not being very interesting and adding little to the story itself. Most of the characters also seem to be on steroids as they are all very angry all the time.
<br>
<br>An XCOM game though? Not really. There is no research to be done, little use or development of your team apart from on mission and very little control of what missions to do and the impact they have. It also seems to leave some rather large plot holes if you view it as a prequel to XCOM:EU.
<br>
<br>So essentially a good combat game with good mechanics and ideas, but nothing ground breaking, nothing new and most certainly not XCOM</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3452546">Expand</a></span>

This is a well done game, that shows nothing exceptional: I found the combat system too easy. The graphics are nice and the story is really great, but I don&apos;t think this game will be a classic. Sadly not too long (took me 12 hours on veteran), and the replayability is not too high (although there are a few endings which might be interesting to see).
<br>
<br>The game is a simple TPS, copying the Mass Effect franchise in most aspects; the combat system is virtually the same (squad of 3, giving orders while time is practically stopped, TPS cover, etc) and it is not as well done as in ME2 or 3, nonetheless it is good; if you liked those, you won&apos;t have a bad time.
<br>The game is set in the &apos;60s of USA, which I found a bit cliche, but well done cliche; the aliens are nice, though not really different from eachother, and also not too original. There are hundreds of cannon fodder with some minibosses (giving shield, drones, support, etc), snipers, and some bosses which are only fun in the beginning, but after a while they get really repetitive.
<br>The combat works well, I found that while you can choose from 4 types of squadmates (which you can customise further) you will end up with the same 2 after a while, simply because those are the best. This makes the imbalanced combat even easier: although you will die sometimes on Veteran (usually thanks to the sometimes stupid AI of the squadmates), the game gets gradually easier towards the end. The checkpoints are well placed, so even if you bite the dust, you won&apos;t loose much time.
<br>There is an HQ where you can kill some time between missions (like the Normandy in ME), but it is not even close to the spaceship: the characters are just not as interesting.
<br>The story is interesting: in the beginning you want answers about the aliens, but as it goes on, you will find a larger mystery, and it tells a unique and interesting tale, with a few really good turns!
<br>Graphics are nice, polished but not too flashy, but the sounds are mediocre  nothing too good, nothing too bad.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3456721">Expand</a></span>

It has a good story and offers closure to said story unlike in xcom enemy unknown.  Which I enjoyed for another reason all together. However the game was completed in 11 hours.  This could have been greatly been improved if the game had more optional quests. The stifled skill trees of normal characters seemed to cap out way to quickly and you are left only leveling your main character. However its not totally unenjoyable experience I truly enjoyed the story though the game was short you still connected with the main character.  Many thing they could of added like base construction and missions to get certain things to build up your base, and the option to switch between tactical between and FPS it would have been able to please ALL its fans but that would require a great deal of capital and effort. Overall it was a fascinating game which left you craving for more sadly there is nothing more it offers for the re-playability seems sparse at best.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3458736">Expand</a></span>

Even at the supposed correct resolution it is impossible to access some menus on a wide screen monitor. The game suffers from tedious, slow and clunky gameplay. Too plot bound and linear, getting around your base is a royal pain in the rear-end. So while the set pieces, and plot lines, the voice acting and lighting are all FANTASTIC (Bravo) the GAME is terrible. This is a must buy for fans of UFO retro, not as a game but as a cultural artifact. Wait to get it on sale under $10. Play it to enjoy the story because you WILL NOT enjoy it as a &apos;game&apos;.

No way to do any proper tactics, with 10:1 enemy fights, as they overrun you and overpower you at all times. Boss fights is another stupid addition, which makes it like quake, with the exception that you&apos;re running out of ammo on every single occasion. Freedom of movement doesn&apos;t exist, as there&apos;s always only one way in/out and around. Your team is getting shot at all the times, because they have to be standing in order to shoot. There&apos;s no stand down order, so they will force you to keep moving them back, otherwise they will get killed quickly. Your healing power is useless, in those situations, as they get shot down again very quickly, and it only regenerates every minute or so. Enemy AI is always pushing forward, and you&apos;ll get 6  8 enemies shooting from around you in very short time.
<br>Ammo limit seems the worst choice here, as who wouldn&apos;t want to be well stocked when fighting hordes of 10 enemies at every single time, which take minimum 4 headshots to get killed,
<br>Some boss fights are ridiculous, i.e. against some flying crafts, where you have no choice of any heavy weaponry  what happened to Heavy MG class, or grenadier? You fight flying crafts with hand guns instead  how ridiculous is that! Conversations are boring and meaningless. Running around to find tapes with recordings or notes with general info, is also not needed, as there are no added benefits for doing that.
<br>All in all, game feels like an arcade semi-shooter with Crysis like colors, and loads of BS put into it, which makes it a boring gameplay.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3891534">Expand</a></span>

When you&apos;re in strategic mode, the gameplay is either paused or drastically slowed down, much like typical XCOM games. While in this mode you can command your squadmates to move about the map, set up flanking positions, and use multiple abilities that synergize very well with your own.
<br>
<br>For example, your commander can use a telekinesis ability that lifts the enemy in the air, pulling them out of cover, then you can order a Sniper squadmate to snipe them out of the air. It&apos;s very satisfying and very fun.
<br>
<br>Despite that, the game doesn&apos;t feel very loyal to the XCOM franchise. It has some nice things here and there and make you think, &quot;Oh, this is from XCOM&quot; but at the same time it lacks a lot of polish in other areas. The game feels as though it might have been a bit rushed to release. In my opinion this is worth checking out on a sale, you might have a bit of fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3684987">Expand</a></span>

Despite playing it on the PC, I did use a 360 controller. I liked the controller, and I would recommend you use one if you like console gaming, even if you&apos;re playing on the PC. This is not the game that many think it is, it&apos;s much better. I&apos;d recommend renting a console copy or buying it on sale.</span>

I pre-ordered this game on steam seeing the XCOM name and how they were going to make a strategic shooter that has had some great entries in its genre in the past (ie Republic Commando). The Bureau has a downright lazy control system that is more likely to get you killed. Pressing space may be fine, but since its a 10% real time speed strategic mode you MUST nail the control scheme or your squad will be slaughtered... something 2K Games failed to do. Issuing commands are only taken as vague suggestions by the engines, your squad constantly goes to illogical cover only to be shot up. So you overide and by the time you plot out a path and execute the order they are down to half health (about 20 of our seconds plotting the move, issuing cover, and then designating a target). By the time you have one position designated and in proper cover there is already a grenade hurled towards you that the broken cover system wont let you clear in the 5 seconds it takes to pop. Now your allies break cover trying to rez you resulting in a team wipe. Rinse and repeat for perhaps 13 hours of some otherwise good story telling and interesting back-story on how XCOM originally came to exist... though this seems to be quite alternative universe.
<br>
<br>This game isn&apos;t to bad other then that, but it still is unplayable and 2K clearly designed this game to be unplayable despite otherwise decent to excellent content. So go ahead and get a game that has a better day 1 experience... like the new SimCity. :p</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/the-bureau-xcom-declassified/user-reviews?user_review_id=3470021">Expand</a></span>

For a third person shooter it feels right. And I get to actually shoot the aliens this time myself instead of just targeting and hoping.  Fun.
