Despite its flaws, Primal is the best dino game to come out in years, and it&apos;s getting better all the time.
<br>
<br>This is a seriously intense, fast-paced FPS that is both exhilerating and often terrifying as you&apos;re hunted by dinosaurs with the intelligence of humans. Small matches lead to nail-biting tension as you watch the bushes for signs of raptors moving through the jungle, while large matches have tonnes of epic moments as multiple Tyrannosaurs go head to head with flamethrower-wielding Scotsmen.
<br>
<br>The main draw of the game, of course, is that you can play as a wide variety of dinosaurs (and Pterosaurs!).  Each has their own special skills, and have simply beautiful models and animations. The widely different play-styles of each dinosaur (and human) makes it a lot of fun to switch between them  There&apos;s a variety of ways to counter your enemies, but it&apos;s never 100% balanced. They try to respond to fan feedback, but kinda seem to overreact, buffing and nerfing classes way too much. Luckily it never stops being awesome stomping around as a T.Rex, or pouncing someone as a raptor, netting a Pteranodon at the last second as it tries to grab you...
<br>
<br>When it released, there really wasn&apos;t much to the game. Just a fairly fun team deathmatch mode. But the developers have been steadily adding new game types and classes. Remembering that they&apos;re an indie team, this is pretty good value for money, but it&apos;s far from perfect. The last patch fixed some problems but it also broke a number of things, and introduced annoying balance changes. For better or worse, they&apos;re now recoding the game to be a lot more stable. Hopefully once the next update hits the niggling issues with performance and class tweaks will be resolved. More updates further down the line with additional game modes and classes have been promised, so the future seems bright for Primal.
<br>
<br>While it might not be a game you&apos;ll play every day, dinosaur lovers will have a blast, and for anyone who&apos;s into multiplayer FPS, it&apos;ll make for a real fun night with some friends every once in a while.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primal-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=3839703">Expand</a></span>

Playing each of them feels great, intuitive and natural.  Playing the humans is truly a tense experience.  Many times the games will end up with the humans huddled around an ammo crate fending off the dinosaurs as they try to break up the group.  The thing is, when you get picked off from the group (which will inevitably happen), you will spawn away from the group.  Now all of a sudden you are out in the open alone, heading toward the same point on the map as all of the dinosaurs, this is where the real fun begins, as invariably a dino (or multiple) will be hard on your tail before you make it back to the group.

<br>I&apos;m loving this game, and I can&apos;t wait for more maps and a new mode or two.  Definitely worth the price of admission; I&apos;ll get more hours out of this game than most of the blockbusters in the last year combined.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primal-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=2724757">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes, *JUST* TEAM FORTRESS 2 Meets Jurassic Park! Those words were all it took for me. You might need further convincing. Here&apos;s a pro/con list:

Pro:
-T-Rex and velociraptor and pterodactyl and dilophosaurus.

-Very very low cost.

<br>Yes, *JUST* TEAM FORTRESS 2 Meets Jurassic Park! Those words were all it took for me. You might need further convincing. Here&apos;s a pro/con list:
<br>
<br>Pro:
<br>-T-Rex and velociraptor and pterodactyl and dilophosaurus.
<br>-Unique Niche classes on both sides.
<br>-Very very low cost.
<br>-Well-balanced gameplay
<br>-Team-focused
<br>-Recreates that &quot;I must get to homebase and safety!&quot; feeling you get from watching Jurassic Park as the characters try to get out of the wilderness and into fortified structures with others.
<br>-Strong resemblance to both TF and JP brands.
<br>-Simple but rewarding gameplay.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>-Limited Playerbase -Single Deathmatch game mode (which will be fixed on first free update with objective modes...hoping for a car chase).
<br>-Asymmetrical classes (which is a nice refresher)
<br>-Gameplay is simple, no progression/perks.
<br>
<br>In short, it is a simple, well-balanced asymmetrical deathmatch game at present, and depending on how much updates and gamemodes are added, may grow into a more replayable experience. For $15, it can&apos;t be beat, though... if you love gameplay and dinosaurs and Team Fortress 2, this is your game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primal-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=2732155">Expand</a></span>

Not only is this the few dinosaur based game but it is really fun in many ways. The classes are amazing and all of them have a role in the game play and none of them are overpowered. In fact many of the classes have another weakness from a different class. The Tyrannosaurus can&apos;t take far ranged classes. But if there are short ranged it would be a easy kill. Now the game has two types of teams. Dino and Human, The human team plays in a first person few while the dinosaurs play in a third person few. Now let&apos;s talk about the classes.
<br>Humans:
<br>Pyro- Has a flamethrower and a chainsaw and can deal lots of damage. Just don&apos;t attack a T&apos;rex or a Carnotaurus with this class or your dead.
<br>Commando- A heavy tank that can enflict massive damage yet isn&apos;t that well with agility. Pteranodons can pick this one up and drop him to the floor.
<br>Trapper- Does exactly what the name tells. It traps small dinosaurs and kills them. Big dinosaurs can only be trapped by there mouths and even then they can still trample you.
<br>Pathfinder- This class is most likely the supportive class. It can blind dinosaurs and them kill them with his shotgun. Yet the shotgun isn&apos;t that big of a range weapon.
<br>Scientist- The only female character in the game and can do some damage with her sniper. She can also use her trank dart.
<br>
<br>Dinosaur:
<br>Novaraptor- One of the fastest classes in the game. Can lunge onto the humans and will kill them instantly. The pyro can kill this dinosaur with his chainsaw so keep a eye out.
<br>Pteranodon- Yeah so this is the hardest of the classes. It really doesn&apos;t work well and I couldn&apos;t pick up one human so yeah. You may need practice with this one.
<br>Dilophosaurus- Can spit poison in enemy&apos;s eyes ans can bite with a punch.
<br>Carnotaurus- This one replaced the Compy in the game so yeah that was somewhat a let down but it really is fun to play with this class. This class can charge a enemy and ram it in the air as it falls and splats to the ground.
<br>Trex and Spinosaurus- Now the reason why I am doing them at the both time is because they play the same. Both of them have tons of health yet they are slow. Snipers can take these guys out so be carful with these guys.
<br>
<br>Now the game types don&apos;t varry that much you have your standered death match and get to the place. So there really isn&apos;t that much of creativity in this part.
<br>
<br>In conclusion this game is great. I will give it a 8.5 out of ten.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primal-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=3156141">Expand</a></span>

Despite being in South Africa and having to deal with 200+ ping to servers, the game compensates for the lag superbly. The teams are very balanced with the smaller dinosaurs having to rely on pack-work or stealth to take down single enemies whereas the humans have some very powerful arsenals at their disposal. The maps are beautifully designed and the game flows very nicely. Should get an even higher rating because this is an indie game. The dinos are intimidating and very powerful but the humans have the advantage of weaponry and maneuverability. There are bugs and it is a bit short on content but that doesn&apos;t take away from the fact that you can play as a massive T-Rex that runs over or eats people up! How is that NOT awesome? Plus, it is only $15. Also, I got it on special so only paid $5.

                                        <span>I absolutely love this game. It may not have a wide variety of game modes, but it&apos;s still pretty addicting. I mean, come on...dinosaurs, lol. You really have to have good team work in order to survive...or kill. In the end you&apos;ll be satisfied either way. Just try it out. </span>

Plus, people in the game are overpowered and it usually ends up with gang of people that dinosaurs are trying to break. This is not a perfect game by any means, but people are obviously thrilled by another decent dinosaur game after long time (especially after horrible Dino beatdown, after playing that, I would call anything masterpiece), so they rate it better than it deserves. Also, it&apos;s basically L4D ripoff, if you compare dinosaur classes with zombie classes there.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primal-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=2759437">Expand</a></span>

If the technical and graphical glitches don&apos;t make you pull your hair out then the unbalanced classes will. On top of that the devs take months to come out with updates such as fixing two problems and two new maps, but every time an update comes out there are even more bugs added to the current list. It&apos;s appalling that the devs comes out with skin packs you have to pay for, but cannot release a patch to fix the constant crashing that most of the primal carnage community is plagued with. I bought this game for the dinosaurs and because it was unique, most of the positive scores on here are from people that are like &quot;OMG DINOSAURS,OMFG WHO DOESN&apos;T LOVE DINO&apos;s&quot;, truth is this game could of offered something fresh and new to the mp scene, but it didn&apos;t. The engine they built it upon cannot even support what they were trying to do, that much is clear (Example is any dino is able to stick his head through walls, thus killing humans in spots that are suppose to provide shelter). I would of gave this game at least a one, but the primal carnage community is why I gave it a zero. There is a forum section where people can post problems and feedback on the game. If a person were to go and post about some major bugs in this game and expose how unpolished it is then they will surely be attacked by the community. This is an indie game, but that&apos;s no excuse for the poor work done here. I wouldn&apos;t recommend this game to anyone, save your money and buy one the many amazing triple A titles coming out in the coming months.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primal-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=3119689">Expand</a></span>

First, excellent job on Primal Carnage; it is well made and extremely fun, good job team. Also you should give your modeler a higher percentage for doing such an awesome job. Now there are a few things I&apos;d like to bring up that I found problematic. One major issue I have is the auto-team balance. I have played 2 full rounds as dinosaurs out of roughly 130 games and all but those 2 times I have been auto switched to humans. I do not know if people are taking advantage of some team switching glitch or something, but it&apos;s annoying and irritates me to no end.  I understand that everyone wants to play as dinosaurs but don&apos;t quit the server every time you have to be human. Other than the auto team balance issue, nothing remains. It&apos;s a great game that I recommend everyone picks up. Few things can match being a pterodactyl picking up a human and taking them to the top of the map before dropping them; it&apos;s like built-in trolling, I love it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primal-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=2724510">Expand</a></span>

That said, what I&apos;ve played has been extremely enjoyable. There is a lot of detail in the maps gives the battlefield great atmosphere, and the different classes have a lot of diversity and character. Just playing T-Rex and charging into battles, trampling players and eating them whole, was well worth the price of admission. I love to roar as I&apos;m chasing down a lone human player, as they try to avoid this monster bearing down on them. Seldom do they escape...  but with great power also comes certain vulnerabilities.
<br>
<br>There is free  DLC  on the way to add more to the multiplayer experience, such as objectives, as well as skins for the dinos. This game was an instant favorite, and I&apos;m looking forward to what new features are developed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primal-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=2784618">Expand</a></span>

This game is the most fun I&apos;ve had playing with my friends since my LAN party days with Warcraft 3.  It&apos;s not a AAA title with a great story or incredibly large beautiful environments that will pull you in.  What it does though, it does very well.   The maps are designed well, and the game looks very good (much better than I expected).  The controls are precise and pretty easy to get a handle on (take a look at the keyboard layout and you can figure it out pretty well).  There are different classes to play for both humans and dinos, giving you different ways to play.  The game may not be up for any awards, but it is 100% fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primal-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=2796990">Expand</a></span>

It makes sense that dinosaurs only have certain abilities, but humans should be able to at least pick from a selection of weaponry.
<br>
<br>Other than that, it&apos;s a fantastic game and I recommend purchasing it (if it&apos;s on sale for the time being)!.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primal-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=3220646">Expand</a></span>

<br>Don&apos;t believe them. This game is passable for about ten minutes before it gets boring and you&apos;ve seen all there is to it. It&apos;s on Steam sale right now for about 5 bucks. Wait til it drops to 2 instead.</span>

The game that is there (1 gamemode and 5 maps) is well-balanced and fun to play as either humans or dinosaurs with each class feeling unique in its own way. I will update my rating if Lukewarm can live up to their promises.</span>

<br>Is it worth $15? No.
<br>The fun factor of this game is its gimmicks, but that doesn&apos;t make it bad (some classes feel really broken against others (Trappers against smaller dinos, for example)). But, if you wanna pick this up, wait for a Steam sale. In my own opinion, paying $15 for the whole thing is a waste.</span>

This game is just plain fun. Lukwarm was definitely smart by taking some cues from Jurassic Park in this. Half of the fun is the pure chaos that commences when human meets dinosaur. This is not your normal FPS battlefield. Dont be surprised to see a fellow human on the ground being ripped to shreds by a raptor, or a body flinging across the air from a Carno&apos;s charge!
<br>
<br>Even if you do not like FPS (like me) you will enjoy playing this game as the gameplay isnt mirrored - you have two teams, Humans and Dinos, and you really only have one objective: Kill each other!
<br>
<br>Lukewarm did a great job with the dinos. A game like this proves that with a passionate development team, you can do anything. When you are in the forest, hearing the ground shake can be terrifying, along with hearing a dinosaur roar. When you&apos;re a dino, the controls are switched from a traditional FPS setup to something different, making you feel like you really are controlling a dinosaur.
<br>
<br>The game has a few downsides, mainly the low content and the limited amount of maps and objectives. Luckily we are getting a sequel which hopefully will revive the games.
<br>
<br>These cons can easily be forgiven, considering the amount of pure entertainment you&apos;ll find eating people as a T rex or burning some dinos with your flamethrower :)</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primal-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=4267843">Expand</a></span>

<br>Still this could be worth a try for the dino fans, so my thumb is up.</span>

When I saw the trailers for this game, I got really excited. It was the kind of game that I&apos;ve wanted since I was very little: a game about humans fighting dinosaurs. I was excited because dinosaur games are few and far between, and also because this time you could actually play as dinosaurs. I was really excited about this game at the time, but then I looked at Metacritic and noticed it got a mixed reception. So I decided it might actually be better to hold off on getting this game. Then, cut to a little over a year after the game came out, and I finally decided to try it out. So, is this game the dinosaur shooter that you and I have been waiting for our whole lives? Or is this the kind of dinosaur that should&apos;ve been trampled as an egg? Let&apos;s find out. The gameplay of this game may seem like your generic shooter at first, except for one very big difference, one team is humans, the other is dinosaurs. The human team plays very much like a class-based first person shooter. There are five classes total: Commando, Pathfinder, Pyromaniac, Scientist, and Trapper. They all have very good abilities that balance out the team perfectly. Commando is all about shooting every dinosaur you see, Pathfinder can throw flares to blind the dinosaurs, Pyromaniac sets everything around him ablaze with his flamethrower, the Scientist can snipe from a distance, and the Trapper can trap dinosaurs with a net, and then proceed to shoot them. As for the dinosaurs, there are five of those too. The dinosaurs actually play from a third person perspective rather than first-person. The classes are Tyrannosaurus (replaced with Spinosaurus in the Get to the Chopper game mode), Novaraptor, Dilophosaurus, Pteranodon, and Carnotaurus. These dinosaurs also have different abilities that supplement their team perfectly. The Tyrannosaurus and Spinosaurus can eat humans to regain health, Novaraptors rush into humans to take them down, Dilophosaurus can poison humans, impairing their vision for a time, Pteranodons can pick humans up off the ground and drop them to their doom, and Carnotaurus behave like bulls, charging into humans at high speeds. I know exactly what you&apos;re thinking, isn&apos;t this game completely unbalanced because the dinosaurs have too much health, and the humans too little? Surprisingly no! This game is actually very well balanced. Neither team is too powerful or too weak at all. You might think that with multiple Tyrannosaurus the game&apos;s balance would shift to the favor of the dinosaurs. However, because Tyrannosaurus is such a powerful dinosaur, it has been limited to only two players per match, and it&apos;s the only dinosaur with a player limit. This makes the game that much more balanced. Every class in this game controls very well as well. To tell you the truth, I&apos;d say that I have only one major problem with the gameplay: there&apos;s not enough content in this game. There are only three game modes, and a small number of maps to play on. There also aren&apos;t any bots, so you have no choice but to play online. The good news is the developers are updating the game, and constantly improving it. However, as of right now, there aren&apos;t very many modes in Primal Carnage. As for the graphics, they are very beautiful and colorful. They were made with the Unreal Engine, and they make the game look as beautiful as it plays. It doesn&apos;t look as good as Unreal Tournament 3&apos;s did (not as much detail in the textures), but it is still a very beautiful looking game. As for the overall presentation, this is done very well indeed. It looks and behaves like a good first person shooter should. The main menu looks as though it is lacking content, just like the game modes, but it is still good nonetheless. Overall, this is the perfect shooter for anyone who loves dinosaurs. There may not be enough content, but it is still fun enough to warrant a recommendation. I recommend this game to everyone who loves dinosaurs, wants to play a unique first person shooter for a change instead of the totally generic Call of Duty, or just want to have an insanely fun time playing video games.

(I did it yesterday, 3 Novas and 1 Ptera at one time) I can easily sit and play this game for hours on end, even more if I&apos;m playing with friends. It doesn&apos;t seem to get old for me. Visuals in this game are great, dino animations and models are beautiful, the best I&apos;ve ever seen in a video game. Clipping can be an issue sometimes, especially with larger dinos, but I can understand since you would be extremely limited in where you could go with the T-Rex and Spino if they made the collisions more exact, which would make it less fun in my opinion.

The first time I saw it I was very skeptical but it definitely surprised me how good the game actually was/is.
<br>The game is just extreme fun. The maps, dinosaurs and humans look pretty cool too. Altogether the graphics of Primal Carnage look good. Many people prefer the original Primal Carnage because of it&apos;s seriousness.
<br>If you want a game with better graphics, more dinos and more game modes you should get Primal Carnage: Extinction. The developers of Primal Carnage are gone and it&apos;s no longer being developed.
<br>Conclusion:
<br>-good graphics
<br>-easy-to-get-used-to combat
<br>-cheap
<br>-not dead</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/primal-carnage/user-reviews?user_review_id=6967996">Expand</a></span>
