<br>
<br>This game brings you everything you found in the first episode - funny characters, a lot of humor, a new mini game, the comic creation etc. There are also achievements as in the previous title, though one achievement in particular is missable and is therefore quite difficult to obtain.
<br>
<br>Surprisingly, this game focuses on strategy quite a bit, both on your journey to take over the throne, as you will have to take over each country in order to be able to get to the king, but there is also a strategic board game waiting for you somewhere down the line.
<br>
<br>While the first episode took me 7 hours to finish 100%, this one took me 6 hours and I even had to play it twice because of the missable achievement. Even though it is much shorter, it is still a fun game and if you enjoyed Episode 1, you will enjoy Episode 2 as well. If you love adventure games in general or you like wacky characters, you might want to give this series a shot.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/strong-bads-cool-game-for-attractive-people-episode-2-strong-badia-the-free/user-reviews?user_review_id=5169419">Expand</a></span>
