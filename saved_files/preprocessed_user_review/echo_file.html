<br>
<br>My main problem with the game is the story. Not very much gets explained and I&apos;m just left with questions after completing the game. You have to collect all collectible thingies to get the full story, something I would much rather not have to do to get a clear picture of what exactly is going on in Echo&apos;s story. Also, I found the ending to be quite dissatisfying.
<br>
<br>Overall, a great game *especially* for such a low price. Definitely pick it up if you like stealth games</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=7546348">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>However the &apos;gameplay&apos; sections just ruin the game for me, and were very grating on the expierence at first i could solider through to hear the story in between the &apos;gameplay&apos; sections. In the end i just stopped playing.
<br>
<br>The environments throughout all looks the same, the blackout cycles are interesting at first but quickly becomes irritating. The placing of enemies and the direction they are looking make it close to impossible to do some areas without ditching the stealth approach forcing you to adopt more cavalier tactics. These &apos;gameplay&apos; sections become a chore and are very repetitive.
<br>
<br>For me it makes more sense to watch a &apos;lets play&apos; to get the story out of the game that i want and skip the &apos;gameplay&apos;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=7562919">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Most unforgivable is the intriguing sci-fi setup of the game, which never picks up, but instead fizzles out progressively so much, the final &quot;cutscene&quot; is a 10 minutes walk through yet another repetition of previously seen assets, two sentence two describe the most banal resolution in history and then.... nothing.
<br>
<br>I could easily beat the character limit criticizing this non-game, but it already stole too much of my time. It&apos;s an extended demo of a soulless non-game.

<br>Facing yourself
<br>You&#x2019;re going to think echo is a really great game, a really annoying game, or you&#x2019;re going to think it&#x2019;s a mix a both
<br>This is one giant 5 hr. puzzle where the enemy is you
<br>Here you play as En who enters a palace to right a wrong.. To resurrect someone she killed...
<br>You arrive at the missive palace and the lights are out...
<br>Then as you progress bantering with your ai, which is some of my favorite parts of this game... the lights start to flicker... you notice life forms on the ground that slowly become larger every time the lights come back on.. To realize they&#x2019;re all copies of you&#x2026;
<br>This palace is crawling with clones trying to stop you from accomplishing your goal&#x2026;
<br>there isn&#x2019;t much to the level design or mission...
<br>The mansion is gorgeous but slowly it feels less impressive and the gameplay loop is the same throughout&#x2026;
<br>The greatness comes in dealing with the hordes of clones as you go deeper into the lower parts of this palace..
<br>You slowly start to realize that these clones are learning from you...
<br>As you play the gamer the lights go on and off&#x2026;
<br>You would think the lights going off is the terrifying part.. But it isn&#x2019;t...
<br>The scary part is when the lights are on... because this is when the house is watching you&#x2026;
<br>You have plenty of tools at your disposal... you have charges that you can do special moves with... initially 2, but every 5 blue orbs you find will give you another charge.. 1 refills by itself the others are refilled by white orbs that are in abundance&#x2026;
<br>You have a lethal gun that can shoot through multiple enemies at a time... you have a non-lethal shot that can knock enemies in range down&#x2026; you take out enemies from behind, the issue however is that enemies don&#x2019;t stay down..
<br>When the lights go off, or when they come back on every enemy you took down is back... and this time each and every one of them is doing what the house saw you do...
<br>If the house sees you shoot, enemies will now shoot&#x2026;.
<br>Though either way they are coming after you&#x2026; it&#x2019;s just up to you how aggressive and deadly they are... this is where the puzzle comes into play... are you patient enough to scout things out while the lights are on and do the killing and item grabbing in the dark, or do you think you can run through a room, killing everything in your way, get what you need and get out
<br>this forces the player to be careful with their choices and what they do.. Don&#x2019;t touch the water when the lights are on and enemies will be afraid of water&#x2026;
<br>don&#x2019;t open doors when the lights are on and enemies won&#x2019;t know how to open doors...
<br>What they know resets every checkpoint... and checkpoints in this game can be frustrating.. especially the orb missions that cap every one of this games 6 chapters
<br>This is where all of your skill, timing, and risk taking comes into play.. As the game doesn&#x2019;t save an ounce of progress and doesn&#x2019;t care how close you got to collecting all 40 orbs...
<br>if you die with only 3 to go... you&#x2019;re starting all over again...
<br>these are the moments that will break you... these are the moments that will make you rush, pull out your gun in a desperate situation because you&#x2019;re so close and you think you can handle the guns until you&#x2019;ve collected what you need&#x2026;
<br>these are the moments that make this game just as frustrating as it is great&#x2026;
<br>My only complaints with the game are of course the 0 checkpoints in the orb sections.. but I get it&#x2026;
<br>enemies not permanently staying down&#x2026;
<br>I feel this could&#x2019;ve been done for an easier difficulty as the concept of the game could stay the same... of enemies still alive learning,
<br>it feels a bit frustrating at times when I feel I just got out of a tough situation only to be jumped and die when the lights come back on
<br>And lastly the banter sort of stops as you get deep into the game which is actually my biggest issue..
<br>I loved this games dialog and I would&#x2019;ve liked more
<br>But the gameplay here is great and challenging
<br>Beating Echo is no easy feat
<br>you need patience to get through even on its easiest difficulty...

I found myself playing it in very short chunks, like from one major save point to the next. It&apos;s a beautiful design, especially played in 4k, which helps but the gameplay itself is a pressure that rarely responds to the amount of time you&apos;ve invested. In other games, achieving mastery is part of the reward of the game, and after [x] hours you&apos;re the ruler of the world, but Echo&apos;s not really like that. Every &quot;level&quot; of the game felt as bewildering as every other, but that&apos;s partly a testament to the design. Anything you do sabotages you, which means there are as many ways to potentially win the challenge as there are ways to ruin yourself. You never quite escape the trial-and-error experiment, and sometimes winning feels like it only happened because of a chance mistake by the AI.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/echo/user-reviews?user_review_id=7547021">Expand</a></span>
