While AC3 was a bad porting but was at least playable, this one is really not worth the money. I really don&apos;t think PC gamer deserve a poorly optimized game like this.</span>

Runs absolutely terribly on pc, and the fact that atl east half the missions are recycled &quot;stealth&quot; get to point a to point b without getting detected. Literally, tailing simulator 2012. The &quot;NAVAL STEALTH&quot; was the last straw, if you are gonna get this game, i suggest pirating it.</span>

<br>Chase missions both on foot and on the ship are just downright terrible and so badly implemented that you will rip your hair off from the rage they induce.
<br>
<br>DO NOT buy this game at full price, the best i can say is that this is worth 20 euros when it includes all DLC 6 months down the line.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3807711">Expand</a></span>

This game is extremely fun and I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the previous games. The ship combat has improved and the graphics are beautiful. This game is probably my favorite in the franchise so far.</span>

<br>Any reviewer who writes it is a great game, and &quot;it has some minor technical issues (FPS) that will need patching&quot;, are lying or part of the hype-troll factory. There aren&apos;t minor glitches, there are huge ones... Doesn&apos;t matter what the Ubisoft copy/paste promo revs say.
<br>
<br>THE FACTS: the controls are the same as in prequels, made for the console, you have 8 buttons to do everything. If the view changes you&apos;re not running forward but sideward with the same button, making impossible some difficult moves and finishing 100% (if you care about it). If a reviewer never mentions bad controls, it means they never played the game. Read carefully.
<br>
<br>There are no savegames, but checkpoints. So if you scrw it up because of the bad controls, you can start all over again. Is it really that difficult to make a good port to the pc? I don&apos;t think so. But Ubi cares about money not about fans or gamers. On the long run this will prove an epic fail.
<br>
<br>I give 1 for the score because exactly that much they improved the game from AC3 (some flashy effects and a bigger map). If you are not payed by Ubi, you would never score this game above 3 or 4 (on the PC).</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3807291">Expand</a></span>

<br>The single player content is carried out very badly. The multiplayer is totally the same, lacks the sight of the smallest innovations. It was satisfying two games ago... now it feels like Call of Duty...
<br>
<br>The game mechanism are so dumb down, even a monkey could play the game. A lot of good features from the predecessor games are missing. Specially from the combat... this game was build around it, but still this is the most unpretending part of the game... Everything that was good in AC3&apos;s naval combat, devs just trashed all of it.
<br>
<br>- There aren&apos;t any diffirences between ships... a 3500 tonne man of war will be as fast as Edward&apos;s small ship. The legendary ships are some kind of freaking jokes... they accelerate at 80 m/s and they are equipped with jet engines. WTF?
<br>- Canon reload time is so low... it takes (even for the man of war&apos;s 100 canons) only 3 seconds... just spam full boardside volleys, that is the only thing you will do in combat. Frigates and man of war ships have some future tech gatling canons... they can fire up to 5 volleys in quick succession (under ~10 seconds)
<br>- You can no longer change canon rounds like in AC3.
<br>- Ship sails no longer takes dmg, chain-shots lost there whole function... oh wait they&apos;ve got a new one, now they STUN ships like in damn WoW...
<br>-This game is so arcade... you have the option to repair your ship AND loose all you notority after you board a ship.
<br>
<br>Melee combat sucks also... Thee E is your ultimate key used for anything... counter, dodge, parry. HP potions removed entirely.
<br>Edward regain heatlh automatically.. The fast-travel option added to the game, it has some nice side effects too, it can be used anytime, even in combat. Also recharges your full ammo supply (smokebombs, darts too) Eagle vision now tags enemies like the annoying wallhack in Far Cry 3. Assassinte missions are so arcade, you can run straight to your target, don&apos;t worry about being detected, because it&apos;s no longer cause desync. (mission fail, not even in story mission)
<br>
<br>The world looks big on the map, but its feels empty even towns and also lacks detail. Side activities are so few and even those are so boring, just a tons of ridiculously easy assassination contracts.
<br>
<br>This game won&apos;t provide any fun for whose played the older games. Black Flag is a huge disapointment. Made for 10 yrs old console-kids. This game probably don&apos;t deserve a medicore score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3809391">Expand</a></span>

<br>It has the same problems as the earlier ACs, nothing changed, a bad port to pc. Make a bad game, spend tons of money on advertising, fake reviewers and there you are. I was so hoping after the 2nd part, that they will fix issues, but Ubisoft is only out for money. It&apos;s a shame.</span>

Yes, yes, yes it has some minor technical issues (FPS) that will need patching, but these are expected for a game with this much scale.  I felt that depressing feeling during the opening cutscene and tutorial island when the game wasn&apos;t as smooth as I&apos;d hoped.  Once I boarded my ship and headed to Havana, things improved and confidence regained (unlike my hairline).  AC:BF is very good.  The map is HUGE, the graphics (some frame rate drops) are excellent, the sound passionate, the naval element well implemented, animations are fabulous, cutscenes and voice acting some of the best i&apos;ve seen and the game is simply fun.  Greatly improved from AC3 and with so much to do and collect, it&apos;s gonna take a while to see all of it.  This is my new favourite AC game.

The only reason this game could possibly get good reviews is because of blind fanboys upvoting the game simply because it&apos;s a pirate game.This is an action-oriented pirate simulation that has absolutely nothing to do with the Assassin&apos;s Creed franchise. The graphics are good but just about everything else isn&apos;t. Sound is terribly synced, especially when performing kills. The controls are slightly improved but still terrible. The optimization is beyond bad. The insane amount of context-sensitive controls and movements are incredibly frustrating, and have been throughout the whole series but Blag Flag just proves that Ubisoft has no intention whatsoever of fixing it. The story is laughable and will not interest you in the slightest and the modern day sequences are worse than ever. The gameplay is super repetitive with linear levels lining the campaign and a repetitive grind awaiting you at sea. This is the last straw for the AC series in my opinion. One of my favorite franchise has been ruined yet again by a a yearly development cycle and a greedy publisher. I&apos;m not longer going to purchase this garbage and I highly suggest all of you do the same.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=4019581">Expand</a></span>

<br>STORY/DESIGN: (5/10) - On the one hand, the story is boring, and there&apos;s no real climax/payoff at the end, it&apos;s just a-bunch-of-stuff-that-happens that seems to rely on player time investment to make us connect emotionally rather than an interesting plot.  On the other hand, the main character is somewhat unique in that his major motivation is making money and he aggressively wants to avoid joining either of the warring factions. But the most important part of the story is that, unlike AC3, it is mostly unobtrusive.
<br>GRAPHICS: (9/10) - this is a gorgeous looking game in almost every respect.  There&apos;s a good variety of environments, from period cities of varying elevations (to facilitate the freerunning) to deep jungle to tropical islands.
<br>GAMEPLAY: (7/10) - this is kind of hit-and-miss, depending on what the game asks of you.  Each of the 4 gameplay types represents about a quarter of the experience:
<br>Ship-to-ship combat is good (7/10), kind of like space combat games if you couldn&apos;t move up or down, but what makes it interesting is a very developed, shifting 3D ocean that is constantly buffetting your ship and changing the angles.  I also like how quickly you go from sailing to aiming a side cannon at individual enemie on a ship, then swing over on a rope and go straight into hand-to-hand combat.  One nice touch is that you can sneak-swim onto an enemy ship that&apos;s otherwise overpowered for your ship, kill all the soldiers in hand-to-hand, then return to your ship and conquer the now weakened and crippled ship in one shot.  What I dislike about ship-to-ship combat is that, other than size and flag color, basically all ships you fight are identical in look and structure.  I feel like they could have designed more than one enemy for you.  Additionally, it would have been nice to go below decks for combat, instead of just up the masts once in awhile.
<br>Freerunning (3/10) hasn&apos;t really changed from AC3, but the environments are quite a bit better and smoother, particularly in jumping from tree-to-tree.  It&apos;s very intuitive, but it&apos;s still hold-down-a-button and point the analog stick, whereas any true platformer would require individual presses of the jump button.  There&apos;s also a swimming mechanic for underwater side missions, which is cool, but slow and eventually gets boring.
<br>Combat (5/10) has a few new enemy types that often require a different button press (i.e. &quot;stun&quot;) to defeat certain enemies, plus the ability to throw enemies (off ledges or into other enemies) instead of insta-kill adds another layer.  And sometimes you have to press a button to grab a human shield just before you&apos;re shot.  But it&apos;s still way too easy to be fun most of the time.
<br>Stealth (5/10) is still functional but not improved.  It&apos;s still based primarily on moving between bits of grass and insta-killing anything that gets near.  Your only other options are a berserker dart (makes an enemy attack his friends), hire dancers to distract guards, and a smoke bomb escape; that&apos;s fairly paltry compared to any other stealth game.
<br>DESIGN: (9/10)
<br>The game starts with you experiencing the major gameplay types (ship-to-ship combat, freerunning, stealth, then combat) all the in the first mission with only a few seconds of cutscenes intruding on that.  There are FAR fewer enforced-slow-walk-for-plot-exposition parts than in AC3, though there are still some.  Similarly, you spend very little time in the &quot;future&quot; world outside the animus, another great choice, although even this half-hour total was still the worst part of the game.  I never even got to the sailing portion of AC3 because I couldn&apos;t tolerate the pathetic &quot;platforming&quot; and the fact that they buried the good stuff so late in the game, but AC4 understands that it is a game and puts its best feet forward.  There are a bunch of side missions, and you never have to do any of them more than once if you dislike one.  And if you just like open-ended missions where you get to a guarded target and assassinate him, there are like 30 of those as &quot;assassin&quot; side missions.  So it&apos;s a long game (21 hours) but it held my interest long enough for me to beat it.  If they could just make you actually press the &quot;jump&quot; button when they wanted you to jump and made the melee combat more challenging/interesting, this game could have been a 9/10 easily.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=4314611">Expand</a></span>

I recommend Assassin&apos;s Creed IV: Black Flag to anyone who is a fan of the Assassin&apos;s Creed series or pirates. This is also a great game for those who wish to get into the Assassin&apos;s Creed series because this is truly a new standard Ubisoft has set for their games.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3881434">Expand</a></span>

There is so much content on the map.Finding buried treasure and collecting songs for your crew are some things to do.  Hunting from AC3 has been kept in the game,you can use the animals for crafting or sell them.But hunting gets really repetitive after a while. The new addition of harpooning sea creatures helps add variety but this too gets repetitive.The story is not the worst nor the best, and that keeps my review from getting a 10.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3892173">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a disgrace that Ubisoft has fallen so low that they would let themselves become so blinded by greed that they just flat out don&apos;t give a crap anymore.
<br>
<br>The controls are clunky, combat is streamlined to mash X constantly while hitting B every so often to block.  You will not be able to run anywhere without climbing up a wall you didn&apos;t want to climb.  Story is long, drawn out &amp; boring.  The tutorial alone is about 3-4 hours &amp; it drags.
<br>
<br>The best part of the game is the ship battles, but the game is so terribly optimized that you will have freezes or crashes if there are too many ships on screen.  I was in one battle where it was me VS 10 other ships &amp; the game started running at 0 FPS.  I thought it crashed, but nope.  One frame just froze in place while the game kept running.  I was impressed by this as I&apos;ve never had a game run at 0 FPS ever before.
<br>
<br>While this game is called &quot;Assassin&apos;s Creed&quot; you will not need to stealth anywhere in the game other than for &apos;optional&apos; syncs.  The stealth mechanics are so drull &amp; simple.  It&apos;s like they went backwards entirely or they think everyone who plays their Creed games now are idiots (Which they must be if they keep buying this crap).  You can be face first inside a guard&apos;s anus &amp; they still won&apos;t notice you.  It&apos;s pathetic.
<br>
<br>0/10. Don&apos;t buy this unoptimized half-assed port.  Go play AC2 instead.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=4971417">Expand</a></span>

This unsurprisingly led to some disappointment (yes, sadly going against the trend in most other reviews). But once I recalibrated my expectations to &#x201C;standard AssCreed fare&#x201D;, it was not too bad.
<br>
<br>The story is messy and silly. It has some good parts but most of it is mediocre - overall not as good as AssCreed3 in my opinion. I have the suspicion casual or younger gamers may like it more. It sorely lacks atmosphere when compared to games like Dishonored or The Witcher or films like &apos;Pirates of the Caribbean&apos;. The script is full of plot holes (even more than usual). Half of the game is fairly serious and makes some sense, but the other half is silly and does not make any sense. This inconsistency harms immersion. The main character is decent, but does not quite have the charisma of Ezio or Haytham from previous games.
<br>
<br>The missions and gameplay built on the story are very bland and repetitive. Almost any potentially interesting story scenario is reduced to a handful of copy-paste follow/sneak/kill/eavesdrop gameplay designs. It seems like the devs were slightly lazier than usual - AssCreed3 missions were far from perfect, but still seemed slightly more varied and hand-crafted.
<br>
<br>The difficulty balance of the gameplay is poor. AI detection feels arcade and inconsistent. Stealth areas are severely overpopulated with guards, meaning you are forced to look at the minimap all the time to have any chance of avoiding detection. If you don&apos;t reload checkpoints often, open combat is nearly inevitable, which in turn is far too easy. This makes trying to play stealth frustrating, because the odds feel unfairly stacked against you, and it is always so much easier to just fight and kill everyone. But fighting gets boring quickly - you just spam attacks, then counter when prompted, and repeat that indefinitely.
<br>
<br>The sandbox gameplay has been brought to the fore, but like the main missions, it is very arcade, bland, and repetitive. The open world is large, but most places all look the same. Compared to AC3, there seems to be slightly less content overall, though still more than enough. The problem is a lack of quality, not quantity. Still things like naval battles and boarding enemy ships are novel for a while and work fairly reliably, which is more than can be said of naval battles in a Total War game (Shogun II etc). The sea shanties (songs) are a nice touch, and possibly the single best feature in this game.
<br>
<br>Graphics are the best yet for an AssCreed game, and the first in my opinion to just about match those of Crysis 1 (released 6 years earlier). The water out at sea looks particularly good. The visual quality does not hold up everywhere though - quite a few ugly meshes and textures here and there. The default settings are poorly optimised - you need to manually tweak the settings to get the best visuals while keeping the FPS high. Ship physics are decent and must feel amazing to the average console peasant, but if you have an eye for realism and have been on a real ship, it still leaves much to be desired. Your 150-ton brig behaves like it has the mass and manoeuvrability of a modern olympic racing yacht combined with the stability of a modern river ferry (complete with bow thrusters). You can sail straight into the wind with no speed loss. Enemy ships also handle like powerboats. In some ways the sailing physics were more realistic in AC3 - you could not sail into the wind, and it felt slightly more natural, though admittedly less reliable (momentarily flying ships etc).
<br>
<br>PC controls are as bad as usual. They are not game-breaking, but they do work against you - I messed up a lot of missions because my character would do the wrong thing like randomly climbing a wall. A few times just before successfully capturing a huge enemy ship, I would fall from a mast to my death due to glitched controls. The checkpoint system has its usual annoyances and reloads sometimes caused technical problems like missing quest items (requiring quiting to desktop and reloading). I encountered more bugs and glitches and generally rushed content here than in any previous AssCreed game.
<br>
<br>Overall, for me, AC4 is a mediocre AssCreed game that wasted a lot of potential. It is not a &#x201C;bad&#x201D; game, but it does not deserve any of the hyped reviews. I can only recommend it at the steam sale price.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=5907598">Expand</a></span>

<br>I enjoyed the entire story line and the awesome graphic; I have appreciate a lot the crew&apos;s songs too (it could sounds stupid, but yep, i enjoyed them sailing the sea).. Maybe to easy</span>

First of all, the setting is great (nice open world and places just look beautiful) and I really like the way the story is told. The storyline itself is different compared with the other Assassin&apos;s Creed games and this makes this game so special (the story which is placed in the background (in the &quot;reality&quot;) follows on the events of the third part, but it&apos;s as bad as before and occupies only a small part in the whole game)  The gameplay is solid and sometimes it seems to be too easy. And now for the problems: The graphics are great but I just don&apos;t get it why Ubisoft isn&apos;t able to develop a game, since Assassin&apos;s Creed 3, which runs smooth on good hardware  GTX 680, Intel Xeon E3 1230v3 (30 FPS and worse on max settings)). I&apos;m able to run Battlefield 4 and Crysis 3 on max settings without any issues, but this is a joke. Another joke is the recycling of older games. Almost the whole movement of Edward Kenway is copied from Connor in Assassin&apos;s Creed 3. I can believe that they don&apos;t have much ideas left, but this is ridiculous. Next thing: Optional objectives. I really like the idea of optional objectives, but sometimes I don&apos;t know if the developers even tested them (and don&apos;t tell me I&apos;m just a bad gamer).
<br>At large it&apos;s a really good game, but it definitely doesn&apos;t deserve 10/10, because it&apos;s nothing new, they just changed the setting.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3905545">Expand</a></span>

<br>The story is okay if not really good, but I&apos;d prefer a story that&apos;s a bit humdrum but doesn&apos;t make me wince with its many po-faced howlers (looking at you, AC:Revelations and ACIII). AC:Brotherhood took some knocks for its silly villains, but I&apos;ll take that camp theatrical scene-chewing over a story that thinks too much of itself any day. AC:R&apos;s writer does a much better job this time, supplying a story that carries you along well enough, with many nice little touches in the dialogue and some touches of daft WTF-ery. There&apos;s not enough there to make you really invested, and you&apos;ll see certain twists a mile away, but as games go it&apos;s decent.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=4366904">Expand</a></span>

Me so Clever Boi. They plunder millions of poor fools and kids every year; AND apparently they&apos;ve been to every bay in the seven seas, OR so it seems... BUT YET, They have NOT.... they missed one very important bay. One that makes them cringe, and their skinny feet tremble with fear. The one that makes them yell for their momma. The one that makes Electronic Arts seem like little babies crying for a penny. The one that makes the RIAA and the MPAA cower in fear. The one that makes them wonder why their share price tumbled last week.

I liked Edward more then any of the past assassins creed character but  Ubisoft should of just made a stand alone pirate game with the main character then making it as an Assassins creed game. I personally had fun in this game but if you dont care about the story too much, its a blast but I do hate getting out of the Animus part. I just hope they just make a good Pirate game and just forget about the Assassins Creed series altogether.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3916862">Expand</a></span>

Visually stunning with smooth, familiar game mechanics and a decent enough story, Black Flag provides an open world that allows you to do what you want, when you want. Follow the storyline, or don&apos;t  there&apos;s plenty to do and see. Those who miss the big city and big climbing aspects of AC and AC II, etc. may still be left wanting, but AC IV brings a different dynamic to the table and does it well. The singular disappointment (for me) is the deep sea dives. What should have been a chance to explore shipwrecks in a gorgeously rendered environment ends up a clunky and confusing race from scores of sharks and eels which give you no time to enjoy the hard work that went into these moments.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3894250">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Graphics are great, the towns look very nice, the landscape of both missions and islands is amazing, the sea looks nice enough and the waves behave very smoothly.
<br>The character movement is very good, definitely an improvement, you can connect most of the movement you want to make, rarely you will start to jump and grab places you didn&apos;t meant too.
<br>The missions are mostly well made and fun, and while some might say they are too easy, I think they are just fine because I like to go through the story, I hate bottlenecks of repetitive tries due to chance or difficulty, for the sake of being hard. Sea combat is fun. Boarding ships is fun if you roleplay them, don&apos;t go immediately to the goals and you will be immersed into nice visuals and combat.
<br>
<br>But this game has a lot of downsizes. Very easy naval combat, too easy, specially when attacking naval fortress&apos;s, the repercussions of pirating are basically none. Land combat is also extremely easy, its all about knowing what type of enemies you are facing and hit the according button, but, its fun, very fun, still way too easy. The map size is extremely small (caribbean islands packed into a 20km per 20km give or take) and the view ranges of enemy ships is ridiculous low, we are talking about having an enemy ship 50 meters away from you and they can&apos;t see you!! This game design choice obliterates the immersion of being at sea, the feeling of being alone, of spotting enemies on the horizon, storms are well made but they come and go in a minute, rogue waves and water tornados are just too easy to avoid. Due to the map being so filled with islands and ships, immersion is completely crushed.
<br>
<br>All in all, its a fun game to play, but once you play it the replay value is null, this means that for a open world game something went wrong when they designed it, kinda remembers me of Sleeping Dogs, making an open world that serves no purpose since only the missions have any value.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3833106">Expand</a></span>

<br>+ Naval battles can be fun, even more so than in AC III
<br>+ They did great with the pirate-history. Not as cliche as usual, no parrots on shoulders, no wooden leg and stuff on every pirate. I am rather certain I know the books they based this on, as a lot of the story-points of that subplot are rather correct, historically, and I liked that a lot.
<br>
<br>Now, the cons:
<br>- The story. This really sucks. So basically, you have the main character kill an Assassin he gets marooned with, kill him EASILY, and simply put on a bit of his outfit, becoming an assassin that way. So, this guy easily kills an assassin and kinda becomes one by putting out the clothes. Yes, he also has eagle vision, and I am sure there is an explanation that he secretly has the &quot;assassin gene&quot; or is the grandson of one, but before that was explained, I lost interest, it just feels weird and is rather sad, considering the previous games.
<br>- The main character. No personality, apart from him apparently being some kind of Jack Sparrow-type cool guy. I really liked Ezio, Altair, even Connor and Arno, but this guy, I couldn&apos;t care less about.
<br>- The missions. SOME tailing/eavesdrop/chase-missions can be fun. TOO many of them get frustrating and dull. Sail to a town. Talk to someone. Tail someone and listen to his conversation without being caught. Try again. Try again. Yay, checkpoint. Now sneak in and kill him. Rinse and repeat.
<br>- The &quot;big story twist&quot; about a certain person in game. This was so incredibly obvious from the start. I mean, how the heck am I supposed to believe no one noticed this (not spoiling it here) about a pirate, in a tightly-knit crew, on a ship, travelling, fighting, eating together for months? First time I saw him and heard him speak, it was so obvious, it was sad.
<br>- Diving. Nice change, maybe, but I never much liked diving in games, whether it was TR or this one. And here, it&apos;s mandatory - not only for a story quest where you first learn it, but also to PROGRESS. No, it&apos;s not optional.
<br>This &quot;open world game&quot; REQUIRED me to dive several times. Why? Because at some point, the game says &quot;Stop. You can&apos;t do the next story-quest until you upgrade your ship&quot;. And to do that, you need to find blueprints, in some chest underwater. You can use the web to find out where. If you hate the diving (with overly aggressive sharks which attack you on sight and kill you quickly, while you don&apos;t have much breath in the first place), it sucks, because you won&apos;t be able to get those blueprints, upgrade your ship enough (thanks for giving me a choice there to try the blocked mission at least) in order to progress the story.
<br>- Your stronghold feels pointless and more like a money-sink
<br>- I don&apos;t think the game is well optimized. It works ok on my PC (W7, 16 gigs of RAM, i7, with a GTX 960 with 4 gigs of ram), but on the same system with an Nvidia GT 730, there were problems.
<br>- Still has some wonky controls, which sucks for jumping puzzles and chases.
<br>
<br>I am happy for those that truly think this is one of the best ACs, but I simply lost interest both times I tried to get into the game. The first time, it happened 3 hrs in (same repetitive side content, yawn, and another chase with no room for error there...one missstep, back to the checkpoint), the second time I played 6-7 hrs and then didnt wanna continue (see above, didn&apos;t wanna dive over and over to upgrade my ship just to continue the story).
<br>
<br>If this was a standalone pirate game with no AC added to it, like, I dunno &quot;Davy Jones&apos; Amazin Adventures&quot; or &quot;Swashbucklers of the Carribean&quot;, it&apos;d be really nice, but as an AC game, it just isn&apos;t fun, and didn&apos;t grab  me at all, sorry</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=6096937">Expand</a></span>

<br>But what do you find at the game? Silly screenplay, as usual, 1-dimensional characters, as usual, a lot of extremely stupid mini-games, as usual. But the most annoying things  are the missions, i suppose it&apos;s the worst game design in the series. After a couple hours it seems that you play replays  type 1: shadowing and chase, type 2: annoying naval battles (the fun leaves after 3-4 battle), type 3: the robbery that appears to massacre.
<br>
<br>I hoped AC4 to be at least open-world game, but it fails, of course  just a dead cities (like an exact copy past from AC3), with number of treasures and other &quot;pirate&quot; stuff...
<br>
<br>Music and sound are usual, quite ok, sounds like a lot of money wasted to something similar to &quot;historical&quot; or &quot;original&quot;...Actors are ok, but the dialogues, no doubt, was writen by the children and for the children...
<br>
<br>Controls in PC version are still headache since AC1, the alter-ego tries to irritate you at least 1 time per 2 minutes, especially when you&apos;re doing &quot;cool parkour stuff&quot;...
<br>
<br>It&apos;s the same situation again on PC, the series still have failed since AC2, which was a real step forward, so what can i say  &quot;use your assassin&apos;s abilities&quot; and don&apos;t waste your time and money as &quot;a fake pirate&quot; in AC3,5.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3816654">Expand</a></span>

Well yes for some bits and sadly...no for the most</span><span class="blurb blurb_expanded">Being a fan of AC2 and brotherhood I&apos;d been rather let down with anything that followed and even with the over-hyped AC3 I got seriously burnt. I then waited...cautiously...for the Black Flag reviews and in general it all seemed to point out that they&apos;d corrected their flaws and gone back a little to their roots. Is it true you ask?
<br>&#xA0;
<br>&#xA0;
<br>Well yes for some bits and sadly...no for the most part. AC2 had you really involved and it made sure that you had to do a little more than just &quot;point and shoot&quot; so to speak. Black Flag comes along and introduces us to some more intensive ship control and ship battles that really do feel pretty good to take part in initially. Soon though you do feel that this &quot;pirate-battle-ship-thing&quot; is a bit flat and it starts to get quite boring pretty quickly so it&apos;s sad that it has such a huge focus in the game because it really stops being fun after the first two hours or so.
<br>&#xA0;
<br>&#xA0;
<br>Platforming  it&apos;s just gone I&apos;m sad to say. Every bit of navigation required now is only made more difficult by figuring out which bit of the map it is that you have to navigate around  everything in-between that is just pointing and holding down the shift key to get there (and then sometimes you just can&apos;t &quot;disconnect&quot; because you&apos;ve become a sticky monkey to anything that is not at ground level). It&apos;s fun right in the beginning but then you soon start to realise that there is actually no challenge to doing any of it.
<br>&#xA0;
<br>&#xA0;
<br>Combat: Pretty much nothing new here  boring and as easy as ever (in fact it felt even easier this time around). Sure, you&apos;ll have to dodge a few grenades, counter (feels very much like Batmans counter-moves) and break defenses by using a key press...rather un-rewarding in the end especially when you know that a monkey could pull off the same moves.
<br>&#xA0;
<br>&#xA0;
<br>Once again I&apos;m left rather disappointed (and I haven&apos;t even touched on the &quot;future&quot; bits that feel about as fun to play as just watching a clip of someone else play the game...hell even that would have been more fun!) and after having played through the somewhat long and fairly boring story I just didn&apos;t feel anything special about this game (I actually had to force myself to keep playing through it and all the time I kept thinking &quot;maybe I should just re-install and play through AC2 or AC:Brotherhood again instead). With promises of an upgrade system similar to Far Cry 3 (sure, it&apos;s mostly true but pretty much damn boring and not very much required) and the usual &quot;hunt&quot; for collectables being slapped in there I eventually stopped because the game just become sooo long in the tooth.
<br>&#xA0;
<br>&#xA0;
<br>Ah well I guess I should have realised this after revelations that the game has just been effectively dumbed down to a more simplistic experience that what we were introduced to before in the previous titles...maybe I&apos;m just getting old or maybe I&apos;m just trying to expect too much when consoles dominate so heavily. My conclusion: if you loved AC2/Brotherhood and despised AC3/Revelations then give this one a skip. In the end this one looks pretty and plays fairly nicely with my PC hardware yet in the end it just feels overly simplified and too heavily story-focused without really giving too much of a damn about game-play.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3838080">Expand</a></span>

But Ubi managed to get it backward. Even if resulting game is still somewhat decent, it&apos;s still step backward in almost all areas.
<br>
<br>Even flag feature of this game  sea combat, got wrose than in AC3. Even if combat system got expanded, it&apos;s irrelevant since sea fights are so easy now, and storms no longer cause waves big enough to matter(which was best part of sea combat in AC3, in my opinion). Yes, combat is enjoyable, but less so than it was in previous game. Also, &quot;travel speed&quot; at sea despite being &quot;Animus-side speed to make travel fast&quot;  still maes most travels between points few minutes of boring screen staring.
<br>
<br>You remember hunting or crafting from AC3? Well, now hunting got reduced to &quot;hunt 2 of each kind of animals, craft one thing per animal, forget about it&quot;. Harpooning is new minigame, I&apos;m not so sure if it&apos;s good minigame, so in that case it might be good that you only need to do it few times per animal.
<br>
<br>Hideout present since AC2 is here too, it&apos;s big, but upgrading it is pretty much irrelevant, only serving as money sink. What&apos;s more, none of vanity collectibles actually affect any part of the world. You can upgrade your ship, sure, but it&apos;s like buying upgrades to yourself. Whole economy system present since AC2 is gone.
<br>Brotherhood gave us &quot;your people&quot;, and here fleet takes this role, but it&apos;s bloody SimCity all again, play with &quot;friends&quot; or anything will take ages to do. Because Ubi couln&apos;t find good reason for their piracy-detergent of online requirement, they just turned part of game into &quot;social&quot; game.
<br>
<br>When you think difficulty hit rock bottom, here comes out another AC game to prove you wrong and define new bottom. In some cases, enemies will even ignore you murdering one of them right in front of them. Killing enemies with gun rarely makes anyone react at all. Only good change in that department is whistling  now you have to whistle for a while before guard decides to og investigate, making picking them off one by one less reliable.
<br>
<br>Older games used to have optional missions that were one big jumping puzzle. If you strain youself, you might find one or at most two of those in this game. Historical places? Not in this setting. Beuitifull cities? Not in this setting. Huge buildings to climb? Not in this setting. Collectibles? Well, some are hidden. Most of them are at sea and main challenge is to not say &quot;screw it&quot; and not spend hours sailing from point to point to jump ship, swim to island, pick it up from ground, get back to sihp and repeat.
<br>
<br>Characters? Hmph. Your out-of-Animus character is nobody, he does not speak, has no motivation, could not find any mirror so not sure if he even has actual body. He&apos;s just getting used by everyone around him, like a tool. As for in-Animus... Ezio started as a rash youth, and grew. Connor started as kid, and grew a lot. Edward starts as badass without clear motivation or character, and remains as such pretty much whole game.
<br>
<br>Story  there is no story. There is some pirating &quot;do what we want&quot; story, small Assassin substory, but overall, it&apos;s just &quot;do random things and maybe you stumble across something relevant to this or that plot&quot;.
<br>
<br>It&apos;s PC version, ported from console, so optimization is terrible, and graphic settings are lacking. There is no gamma correction, so everything is so freaking bright that you just can&apos;t see some things during the day. But, at least they enabled mouse control so you can actually select tings on map with mouse, instead of moving map around to center relevant icon and select it.
<br>
<br>Overall, it&apos;s not bad game, if it was not part of AC series but standalone pirate game, it could be decent 8 or even 9, depending how &quot;assassiny&quot; elements of game would be substituted. But as part of series, it&apos;s worst Creed ever released.

Instead of one more installment of basically the same game it takes quite a different approach while still providing links to previous versions.

<br>The mix between the classic rooftop hopping from the early days and the nature parkour we know from AC3 gives the game a nice variety. You&apos;ll always have something fun to do and in my experience the most enjoyable thing in AC4 is leaving the main story behind every now and then and just go explore, hunt and sail the open seas. It is extremely nice to pull up next to a huge british ship and blasting it to smithereens. And while I really miss some mechanics from earlier games (like calling assassins to your aid), if you look at it as a pirate game it is completely awesome.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3827596">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Ubisoft went ahead and did the obvious. They took, the best part of Assassin&apos;s Creed 3, really the only really good part, and made a game out of it. Literally, they retrofitted the game engine used in the previous title into this a new game, while barely adding or changing anything. This whole game felt like an AC 3.1, rather than a new title.. which, I wouldn&apos;t have had a problem with, if they would have fixed the problems that plagued AC3, or actually gave us a good, satisfying story, like AC2,  but they didn&apos;t.
<br>
<br>Assassin&apos;s Creed wasn&apos;t particularly good when it came to game mechanics, AC1 and 2 were kind of bad actually, instead, it was built by it&apos;s amazing storytelling, beautiful setting, and wonderful soundtrack. I still listen to Ezio&apos;s Family by Jesper Kyd from AC2. That song brings back a kind of emotions that I rarely feel with games. AC4, however delivers only one of these, the setting.  I&apos;m going to start by criticizing the story itself. It&apos;s terrible. First off, it has nothing to do with Assassins, they barely make a cameo appearance, both inside and outside the Animus. The whole game revolves around pirates, and that wouldn&apos;t be a problem, if it was a good story. And it starts out good, but then it gets riddled with plot holes, poor writing, scenes that don&apos;t make sense, and although they stayed away from the obvious parrot cliches, they added a bunch of them story-wise. The story does make a few twists, but most of them you&apos;ll see coming a mily away, and most of them don&apos;t make sense. There is no main enemy in the game, and most of the things that happen in the game make no sense. And if you were expecting a great ending.. don&apos;t.. it is terrible. The only plot-twist you won&apos;t see coming in this game is the ending.. they drop it on you out of nowhere, just when you were expecting the game would truly begin, and then they hit you in the face with a poorly done cutscene, and leave you confused.
<br>
<br>Here&apos;s a tip, dear Ubisoft. A story, every story, follows 5 basic steps, not necessarily in this order: Exposition, Rising Action, Progression, Climax, Ending. The 4th is completely missing, and the fifth leaves you confused, when it should leave you satisfied.
<br>
<br>Then there are the actual missions in the story. Boring, repetitive and most of them don&apos;t make sense. All you do is follow this guy, eavesdrop on that guy. And on rare occasions you kill someone. Missions involving ships can be interesting, but at times they are the same boring &quot;follow that ship&quot; nonsense. In comparison with GTA 5, or Red Dead Redemption, where every mission was unique and intriguing, here they are boring, unimaginative and repetitive. The same goes for side missions. Assassinations, Naval Missions and Templar Hunts. All of them are basically the same. If you did one then you did all, there&apos;s no point in continuing. You play through it once, but you won&apos;t want to play through it a second time.
<br>
<br>What saves the game is the beautiful and huge open world game, the side activities(not missions) and the naval combat. The setting is really amazing, although some fans of the series will find it irritating that you won&apos;t visit cities that much, only a couple times, and they are small with not a lot of things to do, the setting just didn&apos;t allow for that. Most of the time you will do what the game is all about: pirating. Naval combat is really fun, and it&apos;s been expanded upon a lot.: you can board ships, capture them, steal their cargo and send them to your fleet, you can attack naval forts and capture them.  You can use those resources to upgrade your ship and so on. There are also underwater places you can explore, but there are limited, and in comparison with GTAV, where there was an entire open-world you could explore, here there are only ten locations, but it still looks great, and avoiding sharks and medusas is great fun. You can also raid plantations, which are a ton of fun... basically the side activities are really great, and make this game enjoyable, even though the story brings it down.
<br>
<br>In summary, it looks like this game was made just so Ubisoft can make more money off of the ship mechanics in AC3. Combat and land based mechanics are basically the same as the previous game, although they did need changing and improving. The game engine is the same as it was in the third title, with very little improvement, or change, when it, again needed it. And all of this would not be a problem if the game offered a good story, but it doesn&apos;t. The story seems like an excuse to sell an adapted version of AC3, and the story is driven by the game mechanics, and not vice versa. Luckily the beautiful setting, graphics and excellent pirate game save the game and prop up the rating to a 6/10. You can&apos;t help but feel, if they only spent a little bit more time, and wouldn&apos;t pump out a game every year, it could&apos;ve been an amazing game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3823149">Expand</a></span>

I really enjoy first person shooters and I never cared for 3rd person games.  However, I have to say that this game really blew me away.  The graphics are absolutely top notch and I really enjoy the story.  In fact, they have put such a great effort into even the most minute details that I am shocked.  For example, I speak Spanish as I have lived in Spain and the people in Havana speak with the Spanish dialect as you would expect within the historical context.  The sea battles are brilliant and the game is just damn fun to play.  I haven&apos;t finished it yet, but wow am I enjoying it.  It has been a huge surprise and I highly recommend it to everyone, even FPS players.  It does contain some similar elements to Far Cry 3, but it is a much better game.  I can&apos;t tell you the last time, I just enjoyed a game for the scenery; which I often do when sailing in AC4.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3838921">Expand</a></span>

First off, the gameplay  AC 4 has a very similar gameplay like AC 3. Some things have been changed (like ship combat), but don&apos;t expect something new when it comes to ground combat, in which you are left with three options  attack, counter other attacks or break enemies&apos; defences. Sometimes it&apos;s really not that fun when you have to kill 20 men while boarding an enemy ship, forcing you to start spamming your left mouse button to deliver as many hits as possible. Next thing that this game needs to improve is performance. With a pretty good computer like mine, you can hardly run the game on the best graphics setting with no lags. And when it starts to rain on the sea while you are against three enemy ships  lots of smoke effects and all these pieces of wood flying everywhere, god, that is frustrating. Now, to the main point of this game  storyline and missions. Story is pretty good at some point, but only like a quarter of it has something to do with Assassins. This game is not a true &quot;Assassin&quot; game. Also, I hate that missions in AC4 are so repetitive. In every second mission you have to tail someone, and that thing annoyed me quite a lot while playing this game. So, AC4 has quite a lot of bad things that Ubisoft should improve in the next sequel (if they ever make one), but it is still a pretty good game with some nice features. But i don&apos;t recommend buying it until the prize comes down a bit.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3878417">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span>I love the AC series and I would love to play the game. But hard lock ups keeps keeping me away. This game is no where near out of alpha stage, in the short minutes I&apos;ve gotten to play the game has been a pain, it suffers from some really hard screen tearing even with VSYNC or adaptive VSYNC on. 0/10 unplayable.</span>

They added underwater sections that are completely ruined by constant shark attacks so you can&apos;t really enjoy them. Chests have no purpose anymore since they give so little money compared to pirating that I have to wonder why are they in the game. No secret crumbling Mayan ruins requiring some nice platforming or something, no puzzles requiring you to think (at least a little), nope nothing at all. Compared to AC Brotherhood which was the best in the series this is crap. Oh and did I mention it is poorly optimized and you will experience FPS drops constantly even on good machine that is above recommended and no it is not fine nor expected what is expected is a finished and polished game with no bugs that require 4-5 patches or more before it works as its supposed to. And I thought it couldn&apos;t get any worse after AC3, YOU ARE NOT EVEN AN ASSASSIN ANYMORE IN THESES GAMES *sigh*.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3846169">Expand</a></span>

In some aspects Black Flag is an utter failure but in others it&apos;s amazingly well done and outshine the previous games in the series by far.
<br>The bad thing: Modern Abstergo plot
<br>I&apos;m a fan of Assassin&apos;s Creed series and I think what they did with the plot is total BS. I&apos;m talking about the modern-day plot  not getting into spoilers here, it was absolutely terrible, both the idea and the execution of it. This was the most disappointing part.
<br>Another bad thing: GLITCHES, ARMY OF THEM
<br>Every part of the game is filled with minor glitches, patches fix a lot of them but it&apos;s super-common for camera to go crazy or the character having problems with scalling a 0,5 meters tall fence, or character falling to the ground in combat for no reason, or weapons clipping and animations desyncing...you get the idea I hope. It&apos;s just very rough on the edges.
<br>Last but not least: Controls
<br>It&apos;s obvious they are meant for consoles and they suck on PC. It&apos;s very hard to control character when free running or in combat. No target lock. Weird aiming (at least we finally have it implemented).
<br>
<br>Now to the good part: The World
<br>The world is HUUUGE. There are some reused assets but it&apos;s still a pleasure to explore new places and gather those little collectibles that I never cared about before.
<br>
<br>Also good: The visuals
<br>This game is beautiful and there is no denying of it, and it&apos;s pretty well optimized aside from some FPS issues, but I was able to almost max it out on GTX 570. Surprisingly good job Ubisoft.
<br>
<br>I&apos;m not really going into details because you can google them...I don&apos;t care.
<br>Mixed feelings, best get it on sale.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3881188">Expand</a></span>

No doubt Ubisoft seems to have done a very good job in fulfilling customer&apos;s request for features in game that was first unveiled in AC3 but was not polished well which was naval warfare. Honestly, when AC3 came out, the naval warfare was one key feature that really attracts me the most but I was a bit disappointed because it only appears as side missions and players don&apos;t have much choice to sail to other places and uses it as a mean of transports for exploring. However, AC4 really revamped that whole concept and brought my wish to real. For me, the open sea free-for-exploration with a ship is the best selling point for AC4. Never in my entire life have I seen a game that managed to handle naval warfare very well. It is too awesome. The ability to sail across the sea, stop by islands and explore them seamlessly without any boundaries, engage in epic naval battle and board the ships are the best key features for me. Playing the game somehow kind of reminds me a bit of Pirates of the Caribbean especially during the naval battle. Plus the new engine in the game which allows for spontaneous storms and huge waves to occur really added to the realism and epicness of the game. Seriously I wouldn&apos;t mind if the next AC5 continues on the sea exploration concept. In fact, I really hope they would retain naval exploration in the next installment. For anyone that has not played any Assassin&apos;s Creed series before, I think this installment is the best way to start with. It&apos;s like GTA but in a pirate settings in the caribbeans.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3804594">Expand</a></span>

When Assassin&apos;s Creed gets pushed out. My thoughts are &quot;Oh awesome new story, historical views, new characters yay!&quot;. Waiting for a good game. Assassin&apos;s creed: black Flag is not bad game by any standard. It&apos;s just not ground breaking and awesome like the old ones. The story line is different and will play out to be nice, but side quests...Really? I liked to collect optional stuff from each zone, yet it netted me nothing (I don&apos;t really like that i only get 1% when i complete a zone). Outside story mode this game has nothing to offer in terms of gamplay. Pirating is fun for a while, but since you blunder basically same resources (Women, new ships, slaves, art, gold yarrr???) all over...You are not feeling like a pirate.
<br>
<br>Quick fire round to pro&#xB4;s and con&#xB4;s.
<br>
<br>Pro&#xB4;s:
<br>- Setting is not limited to cities only like older releases
<br>- Pirate setting is done nicely, you are spending time on a vessel
<br>- Crafting got useful again and ship customization looks awesome
<br>- Sneaking, fighting got updated amongst other things.
<br>
<br>Cons:
<br>- The &quot;Real life&quot; story is left out for good part of the game
<br>- You don&apos;t really have a clue about the grand schemes, so you are not pursuing a goal.
<br>- Little to no graphical improvements (Well they don&apos;t even need to those, but added them anyway. Game looks awesome!)
<br>- Characters are uninteresting
<br>- Optional stuff is optional...And useless. Why collect 15 fragments that will not grant you anything expect 0,5 progress sync story.
<br>- I&#xB4;m pretty sure i have seen some character models in AC 1  3 as major storyline...
<br>- You need to wait a long time until story kicks in. Don&apos;t get bored until then.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3828650">Expand</a></span>

The only downside is tailing and eavesdropping missions, and even those include the new style of stealth Ubisoft has incorporated into the game. I love the stealth system in Dishonored and Farcry 3, and Assassin&apos;s Creed IV comes close to the same level of quality. Now for the rest of the game. You will find yourself swinging from ropes and boarding ships with explosions around you, dual swords in hand, slicing up British to your heart&apos;s content. The combat has been made noticeably smoother and the same with the naval combat. There is so very little wrong with this game; it amazes me how critics take those small errors and take 20 points off of a game&apos;s score.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3821673">Expand</a></span>

<br>Yes, in general this is &apos;another&apos; Assassins Creed but the pirating stuff in this game is so massive that you sometimes have the feeling the game doesn&apos;t feel like a &apos;true&apos; Assassins Creed game at all. This game is for 80% all about pirating which makes you simply forget all the Assassins stuff. Even the Abstergo intermezzo&apos;s are minimal and that says enough...
<br>The way Ubi set up the massive sea, the beautifull Carribean islands and scenery, the great sea battles, the huge amount of upgades to both Edward and his ship is just very well done, no doubt about it.
<br>This whole pirating adds loads of new stuff to the game and when looking back at the history of Assassins Creed, that is just what this game needs. Altough i don&apos;t like the fact they are overusing some old stuff from previous versions, this whole new pirating system makes me simply forget all of it.
<br>Another big plus is that this game is well balanced. As i said before, you need upgrades but the amount of resources it takes (money, wood, metal, etc) forces you to battle, hunt, kill, explore, fight and enter ships alot, causing loads of gameplay. I have been playing this game for loads of hours this past 1,5 week. My ship is still not fully upgraded and i&apos;m still at 50% progression.
<br>I remember i threw away my AC3: Revelations CD as the game was simply rubbish but Black Flag is simply awsome. I love it and Ubi, well done.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3832303">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>Ubisoft should just completely drop the Assasins stuff and make game full Naval/Pirate game    Cause thats awesome and i fully recommend to buy the game it at a lower price just for that.
<br>
<br>Optimization isn&apos;t optimal but it runs very well on my PC on basically maxed details with some glitches here and there.

<br>Overall this game is fun and you will find yourself spending much more time in it than you probably expected. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3844486">Expand</a></span>

The seas and every place in this game is beauty. The gameplay has a lot of improvements and it is more expanded and you really enjoy playing the game. New weapons, having a crew and a ship and plundering other ships, upgrading the ship and face stronger enemies, exploring and finding new places and  are the beauties of this massive world. The world in Assassin&apos;s Creed IV is the biggest in the franchise and there are a lot of other side activities to do in the game. The story is a little far from the origin of the game but it is cool too, being a pirate in the high seas and have adventures in a lot of places...
<br>at all, Assassin&apos;s Creed IV Black Flag is one of the best games in the franchise and one of the best games of 2013.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3894406">Expand</a></span>

You would think the world is huge, but there is so much rehashing of content, it is nowhere as big as AC1 and pointless to explore. The characters are rather bland and the killing of Desmond in AC3 made story about the ancestors lose its connection. Whats positive is the sandbox that the developers created. Also they got rid of QTEs, its not as  as AC3,  but still lacking big storywise. When AC2 was a 10, then I am giving this a 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3891836">Expand</a></span>

As much as I enjoyed the Black Flag experience, I cannot ignore that. Ubisoft definitely needs to shift some focus towards making their games more enjoyable across a broader range of machines.
<br>Looking beyond the obvious optimization flaws for PC, everything else was phenomenal!
<br>
<br>AC4 carries over all the things that made the past titles a success, but it was the story of this installment that absolutely blew me away!
<br>However, I can&apos;t help but realize that if I did not have a prior knowledge of the Golden Age of Piracy, that I would not have been able to understand, or enjoy, the story as much as I did. For instance, several scenes seem to expect you to know what will happen next to someone considering the tone, even though the game never touches on it itself. I would have never known what happened to Stede Bonnet if it was not for my history class, and it added a lot of impact and drama to an otherwise uneventful moment.
<br>If you were already familiar with popular figures from the Golden Age of Piracy, like Teach, Rackham, Bonnet, Vane, Black Bart, and Anne Bonny, your going to be blown away by this re-imagining of their stories.
<br>
<br>Despite the enormous amount of entertainment I got out of this game, I definitely want to critique a few key points for the sake of future improvement; The Island that you consider home and can invest resources in to improve, Inagua, is just as useless and unrewarding as the Homestead feature from AC3. They need to do more with these places of interest; Spending 90% of the game on the high seas, it was extremely disappointing that the ship Haythem took at the beginning of AC3 was still more detailed than the Jackdaw. You cannot enter the inside of the ship, and the only recognizable and unique person in your crew is Ad&#xE9;wale from the upcoming DLC himself. It would have added much more depth to be able to have familiar faces on the ship to feel more connected to and protective of; And also, Kenway&apos;s Fleet. This trade/revenue system was similiar to the old ones, but tedious and boring compared to the trade system and assassins guild from AC3.
<br>Those were the 3 things I had really wanted more from in Black Flag; A more rewarding and innovative homestead feature; A better detailed crew and ship to sail with; And a less tedious Kenway&apos;s Fleet feature.
<br>
<br>ALSO: Multiplayer is still amazing to play in this installment. AC Multiplayer is an incredible and unique experience that too many AC players overlook.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3820809">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>When I was younger I played Sid meiers pirates and this has all the features of that wonderful title that I spend days off from work to play.  Ship upgradeability, a fleet, simple trade, in addition to more management features from previous AC games but this time for ships in your fleet.  Its pretty cool I wish there was tutorial however for these menus.  I have been finding features by accident.
<br>
<br>As they did with Farcry3, ubisoft has created an enormous, atmospheric expanse to sandbox around in while taking bites off the main linear storyline.  The ships are wonderfully portrayed, the emerald seas are rolling and unforgiving at times and the ship to ship battles, including boarding and harpooning are well done and intense.  I spend most of my time at sea in this game.  Knowing the ground based AC game is still always there is really a lot of game for your dollar.
<br>
<br>I give this game a 9 out of 10 it deserves it.  Its addictive and fun.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3889529">Expand</a></span>

There is no way this game is a 10. The premise of the game is interesting and the game is ambitions. I enjoy the graphics. However, the controls are absolutely terrible. Its even worse than I remember from brotherhood. Its very difficult to do anything without the game thinking your trying to do something else. I have found the game to be extremely frustrating due to the poor control design. Unfortunately, since the story is not that great the only thing that could save this game is the game play, but you need intuitive controls for that. If this had been the first attempt of a company at a game maybe I could be a bit more forgiving. However, this is another game in a long series of games and apparently the company could not be bothered to fix problems that have existed in their prior games. Bottom line is that it was a game with potential, but poor game design has really taken the fun out of it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3821311">Expand</a></span>

<br>
<br>The only reason I&apos;m not given 10/10 is because of the multiplayer mode. It&apos;s just some generic arena crap PvP/Co-Op. I was hoping for the same open-world style, where you can play with friends in a co-op fleet (or even PvP, for those that care about this  I DON&apos;T). As it is the 10 minutes I spent in multiplayer will be it. I&apos;ll just player it Single-Player, which is fine with me.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3834107">Expand</a></span>

It&apos;s a Ubisoft game, so 99% of the gameplay is just unlocking towers and collecting random items to unlock clothes. The other 1% is just maddeningly repetitive and frustrating. For a game that seems confident that you can play to your style, I&apos;ve never had to restart, reload and repeat so many missions because one tiny little detail sent the entire situation out of control, and almost 99% of that was because of the game&apos;s ridiculously irritating control system which is equally likely to send you in the wrong direction as the right one.

Large beautiful world to explore, variety in the gameplay with land sea and underwater and a seamless transition between these modes, lots to do and find. Missions are less linear gameplay wise and stealth is improved. Multiplayer game lab is an excellent addition.</span>

Well it appears that ubisoft lied once more. My I5 2500k so call recommended processor peg at 100% on 1 core and 5-15% on the rest, 2013 game running single core how awesome is that.After all optimizing game on the pc are not ubisoft priority anyway as stated them self. Good thing is naval combat is nothing short of amazing and revolutionary, a major improvement on AC3 which i do like if it isn&apos;t crippled by performance issue. Theme and setting are done very well, lush vegetation in stunning detail. They said the game would perform well even on low end machine, an overclocked 560Ti is apparently getting 40 fps on lowest setting and 800x600 resolution with vysyn turn off. Ashame really this could have been the best AC game yet after AC2 if it is actually enjoyable.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3823183">Expand</a></span>

NO downtime, quick action, mission to mission to sidequest in no time at all. It&apos;s the very best bits of all the past AC games made better, and rolled into one. Absolutely one of the best game&apos;s i&apos;ve ever played. Well polished and awesome fun!</span>

From annoying control issues to lack of variety, they seemed to fall short of the ambition.
<br>
<br>This game, however, is brilliant. Brilliant as in a brilliant work  it has faults  many of the same that plagued the earlier games; Running to chase someone? Let me start climbing a wall you don&apos;t want to. Trying a stealth mission? Allow me to make your character do stuff you don&apos;t want him to just so you are discovered. The side plot outside the &quot;dream&quot; is hackneyed and uninspiring.
<br>
<br>But.
<br>
<br>The main game is the &quot;pirate&quot; game I have been waiting for since excitedly unpacking my ZX81 33 years ago. Sure, the sailing isn&apos;t realistic  but neither are the land based parts. There are &quot;mini games&quot; that would have constituted a full game 8 years ago  from the ship fleet management to the whale/shark hunting.
<br>
<br>Naval combat is a joy to play and the missions, varied.
<br>
<br>Some missions are too difficult  I find the stealth/following simply too hard, but the game has so much else going for it that it doesn&apos;t annoy me in the same way as, say, GTA IV did.
<br>
<br>So, despite its flaws, I feel it would be churlish to give this game anything less than 10/10.
<br>
<br>I bought BF4 shortly before this. The game I keep coming back to is this and I *love* the BF series.
<br>
<br>I am enjoying the plot and the acting is, in the main, of a high standard.
<br>
<br>I alt tabbed out of the game to write this review so I&apos;m off back now. It does this perfectly too and so far (touch wood) hasn&apos;t crashed once.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3881501">Expand</a></span>

On the contrary, this game incorporates much more than just running around a city, climbing walls, and performing assassinations.  Unlike it&apos;s predecessors, the game is actually very open and allows  for the player to explore a vast world unseen in the franchise up to this point.  To be honest, I had lost much of my faith in the Assassin&apos;s Creed franchise due to it&apos;s previous lackluster titles, but AC4&apos;s Edward Kenway has restored hope for this series.  The story itself draws you in and takes for a ride you would never expect.  All in all, I would highly recommend this game to a friend, especially if you ever played and liked &quot;Sid Meier&apos;s Pirates! 2&quot;.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3883166">Expand</a></span>

I would have liked a variable difficulty setting though, even though I do not play 3rd person fighting games often and lack experience in them the combat is far to easy. Eddy can fight off whole packs of enemy soldiers with little difficulty, the same applies to the sea combat. At first taking on the larger ships like Frigates and Man&apos;o&apos;wars is challenging but once you get a firm of the combat and upgrade your ship you can single handily take on several Man&apos;o&apos;wars and their escorts. Only the four non respawning &quot;legendary&quot; ships provide a challenge after that.
<br>
<br>I would have liked some crew management options too, having to take care of the Jackdaws crew and their morale is strangely missing. Criticisms aside though the game is a lot of fun with varied missions and some really thematic set pieces like trying to slowly stealthily sail your ship down a narrow and foggy bayou avoiding watchtowers or fighting running battles through Havana and trying to escape back to your ship through a burning town as the Royal Navy bombard the port you are hiding at. There are loads of side activities to do like the naval assassination missions where you do everything from sinking ships to boarding a ship to kill its captain or escorting another ship past its enemies. There are various land assassination side missions too, some are in cities and others you have to sail to a lonely cove or hidden smuggling den.
<br>
<br>You can go hunting to collect items for crafting to improve Kenways equipment or make new outfits and hunt on both land at sea, there is a large multi part quest to collect items to unlock a unique piece of armour as well as many other collectibles with unique rewards. The highest end ship upgrades for instance need you to collect the plans and blueprints, you even need to use a diving bell and dive to ship wrecks for some of them. You can capture some of the ships you take and add them to your fleet, your fleet is a strategic mini game where you can send ships on trade or diplomatic missions and take part in turn based fleet battles. The fleet missions also earn you cash, collectibles and upgrade items. There is a huge amount of content in this game as well as the main storyline and I have got nearly 40 hours of gameplay out of it so far, even though I am only 50% or so through the main story so far so good. There are some interesting and iconic characters and the writing and voice acting is good.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/user-reviews?user_review_id=3875318">Expand</a></span>
