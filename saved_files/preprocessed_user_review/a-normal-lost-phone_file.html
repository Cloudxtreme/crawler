I also found the concept of unravelling a story through the use of looking through someone&apos;s phone to be an interesting one. If this also sounds like you, then go ahead and buy it. Now, onto the real part of the review.
<br>
<br>SPOILERS AHEAD
<br>
<br>I was really not expecting the story to take the turn it did. If you&apos;re observant, which I wasn&apos;t, you&apos;ll see the warning at the bottom about homophobic themes. When reading through everything, I expected the worst. I thought maybe Sam had been kidnapped or had genuinely gone missing. It&apos;s not until you start digging that you realise that Sam is actually a trans-woman. Maybe I&apos;m exaggerating but I think the way the game reveals this is perfect and once you figure out what&apos;s going on, everything fits together really well. The game does a brilliant job of making you feel like a detective.
<br>
<br>I know a lot of people will be turned away from the themes of this game, but **** &apos;em. Yeah sure, &quot;SJW&quot; themes are somewhat overdone in games these days, but I couldn&apos;t care less. This game does a brilliant job of highlighting the problems that trans people, or even just the LGBT community, go through and also the issue of coming out to a family that might not accept you for who you are.
<br>
<br>That said, I have a few issues with the game that stop it from being perfect. The first issue is that the music player doesn&apos;t really serve a purpose and is honestly more distracting than anything. Trying to read large walls of text with music getting progressively louder in the background is really difficult for me. It also served no purpose when it comes to puzzle solving. The second issue is that, while I appreciate it, a lot of the posts on the &quot;Be You&quot; forum seemed repetitive and not worth reading. Most of the posts there had nothing to do with the story, and while I do find it interesting to read about the LGBT community, a lot of the stuff there could&apos;ve easily been compressed down. My third issue was the puzzles, some of them are a tad too cryptic. I feel like most people will need a walkthrough. And finally the ending. I&apos;m not a fan of it. Maybe I&apos;m bad for sympathising for Sam&apos;s parents... but I do. For all they know, their son/now daughter is completely missing. Possibly dead. But no. Sam just ran away from home without telling anyone. I know they are bigoted scumbags, but I feel like everyone should be treated with respect. Even bigoted scumbags. They have a right to know what happened to their child. In my eyes, Sam should&apos;ve come out to them. The worst that could&apos;ve happened would be them disowning her. Which, at the end of the day, is what she supposedly wanted anyway, because she ran away. I&apos;m not sure how I feel about the ending. I&apos;m usually a fan of bad endings, but this ending just makes the main character (Sam) unlikeable.
<br>
<br>But honestly overall, I enjoyed this experience. While it has its shortcomings in polish and storytelling, I feel as though it does a great job of telling a story in an interesting way. Well worth the &#xA3;2, heck I almost spent 3 solid hours playing this.
