Maps are very plain. GUI is very raw and unfinished. I have not tried PvE aspect, so can&apos;t comment on that. Oh and of course HiRez is following the latest trend of releasing a game without basic features like friend list, voice comms test, private matches, character upgrades, channel and guild management, but with &quot;innovative&quot; subscription model. On that note: having tried AvA in beta I am totally underwhelmed and can&apos;t really see why would anyone pay 15$/months for it. Overall it is not terrible, but kinda pale and unexciting all around. I guess I expected a sci-fi version of GuildWars, and instead got MW2 without adrenaline filled combat.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=745219">Expand</a></span>

I saw its potential, but the game has yet to deliver on any level. The Long: This game is a 3rd-person shooter, not an MMO RPG--do not let the advertisements mislead you. There are essentially only 5 maps for PVP, about 6 for PVE, and 3 for AVA. All of these maps are terribly constructed, redundant, look horrible, and run even worse unless you have a decent computer. Voice communication is unreliable in the game; you&apos;ll experience random crashes for no reason; and the user interface is shoddy and unfriendly. At the time I&apos;m writing this, classes are horribly imbalanced--groups of medics can stay alive almost indefinitely. Additionally, the class skill trees are very poorly constructed and mostly offer lackluster boosts to your abilities. These ingredients result in very little customization, and the game has already adopted cookie cutter builds that seem to work better than others. Also, personal heroics mean very little in this game, so individuals who like to run into groups and try to gun them all down are going to be sorely disappointed. And what&apos;s more, the most destructive tactics in the game take nearly no skill to execute--sentries, extremely high damage AoE poison, grenades, and robo drones come to mind. The monthly fee content consists of 3 maps that are laid out exactly the same that you will be playing indefinitely. These are constructed just as poorly as the rest of the game. Couple this redundancy with the fact that you need a large Alliance in order to hold a presence on the PVP maps, and that the game presently favors &apos;zerg&apos; rushing over player skill (including personal skill) and you have a very unrewarding game to play that is most definitely not worth your $10-15 a month.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=745421">Expand</a></span>

The pvp pve base of this game is also a great feature to hold upon. Although it says that it is an MMORPG, but it is MUCH different from any other &quot;mmo&quot; i have ever played. Much like diablo 2, the players are put into seperate games hosted by the company, no hosting required. This game is a must have for any players who like leveling up as well as skill based games. I&apos;ve been waiting for an MMOFPS for a long time and it was finally delivered.

PvE (Player versus environment) has the most repetitive gameplay in GA and has the most poorly designed AI I have ever seen in a PC game. Fight against some enemies, fight the occasional mini-boss, fight the main boss which has the intelligence of a yoghurt pot. I&apos;m not over exaggerating, the AI is completely f****** dumb and barely challenging. The only challenge is staying alive as the boss shoots the floor and wonders around aimlessly. PvP is also very repetitive. There are 4 game-modes, 3 of which require either standing on a point to capture it or pushing the cart (Like in TF2) to the point. This game fails to include the bare basics of any FPS - Capture the flag (Not CTR), Death Match, team death match and so on. Classes are poorly designed. Medic, Robotics (Think of the engineer from Tf2), Assault (Heavy from TF2), and Recon (A Spy - Sniper from TF2). Medics rely on assaults, assaults rely on medics, medics rely on robotics and robotics rely on Assaults. Recon is literally useless unless you sacrifice the sniper abilities for some bombs which are pitiful at destroying robotic emplacements. AvA, or, conquest as it&apos;s called is purely exclusive PvP. It is solely take and hold with some maps that aren&apos;t available in regular PvP. Hi-Rez are going to charge monthly JUST for this. Yeah, as if I&apos;m going to pay 20 USD a month to play on 3 maps with the same game mode over and over. After level 19, the useful unlocks have been unlocked; after that there&apos;s nothing to look forward to other than the next skill point or some new armour / helmet. Oh by the way, the armour and helmets don&apos;t affect you in any way other than changing what you look like. I hate how underdeveloped this game is, over half of the in-game shops are closed as the ideas were scrapped and the content removed. Don&apos;t listen to the other reviews! This game is only fun for the first 20 levels of each of the 4 classes, after that it WILL get boring and will seem to be a waste of money and time. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=745448">Expand</a></span>

As someone said above, its a fps with a small 3D lobby with a few shops (that doesnt really sell anything of value). Played this game for 1 week, got bored after 3 days because the extreme lack of content. The pve part is very shallow and you runt through those maps in perhaps 10 min. The pvp part is fun for the first few days as you level up and gain new abilities but after about half the levels you stop getting new abilities and &quot;talent points&quot;. Overall the game feels very unfinished, far from a full price game and more like a budget 50% off game. And on top of that , they want you to pay a subscription f&#xF6;r &#xA3;10 a month to play the main parts (where even paying the initial cost seems to much for what you get). Anyway, lets hope they release some patches with more maps/game modes (atleast something) or this game will crash n burn soon.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=745807">Expand</a></span>

The concept is ok, and the game is fun for a few hours but rapidly becomes fairly repetetive. It has a fairly low skill ceiling as an FPS and being completely unrewarding as a MMO. Plus do not be fooled by any tags on Steam or elsewhere suggesting it is an RPG. It is not in any traditional sense.Even the level progression and loot unlocking is fairly weak as you can max out quickly and there is no content reward for doing so. The nearest comparison would be an FPS like Counter Strike with the RPG mod. And to make matters worse the standard PvP game only lets you form teams of 4 even though its 10v10. So unless you want to become fairly devoted and do AvA you are left with a fairly forgetable experience that just feels half done. In the end, it just lost any &quot;fun&quot; factor after a few hours. Its a stocking filler. A 10 dollar pickup game. If this game is remembered in 5 years, it will be for all the wrong reasons.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=745970">Expand</a></span>

The gameplay alone is enough to buy GA, although the MMO atmosphere gives the matches worth beyond &quot;Oh, I won.&quot; 4 classes, Assault, Robotics, Recon, and Medic. Each class has 2 or more skill trees. Medic, for example, can be combat oriented - lol battle medic - although surprisingly they&apos;re not at all useless. A great arsenal of poisons and different grenades make sure he is never defenseless. The standard heal gun works like that of TF2, although it can be swapped out for one that group heals (but obviously less at a time). Heal grenades are great for a big cluster team boost. Assault, I haven&apos;t played much of yet. Works alot in the way a heavy does in TF2, but is not limited to a minigun. Alot of explosives with this class as well. Robotics I spent most of my time on. You can throw down bots for quick helpers when taking a point, or build a turret for defense. One of the more useful specs is his shields, which only your team can shoot through, for excellent cover. Recon, I did not spend much time on either, although it can be described as a &quot;ninja&quot; class. Very fast, and can cloak for a period of time. The two main specs are sniper and melee. Both are equally useful and effective. Alliance vs Alliance mechanics are great for large scale wars. Territories start out as Commonwealth (the NPC faction) controlled, and can be attacked by other alliances only during a certain time of day. Territories reset at their own times, and you have to retake them from the commonwealth if you&apos;ve dominated them unchallenged for a month or so. Defenses among other things are customizable for strategic defensive advantages. Coop is -very- fun. It&apos;s like those instances in WoW, except you rely on your skill, instead of a level 80 escort. Various bosses and mini bosses, mobs that take thinking to beat, give the coop feature more substance beyond grinding for economic benefits. Agency (guild) headquarters, I haven&apos;t seen yet, although one can assume the obvious advantage of having your own place to hang out. Dome cities and social areas are all but functional for their purpose, though they can get slightly laggy with a lot of people. Luckily, these are instanced to keep the population down. That&apos;s about as much as I can say, this being an early review and all. I was in closed beta, although I didn&apos;t end up playing much more than one or two testing periods (buggy). Hope someone out there finds this useful since there are hardly any other reviews out there for GA on the net just yet. WORTH THE 50$.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=745152">Expand</a></span>

HiRez has focused on delivering a genuinely fun, thoughtful, and addictive game. Most MMOs out there rely on boring gameplay with obsessive reward cycles to make the game worthwhile. -- I can honestly say that with Global Agenda, the reverse is true. The game is fun on its own merits. Though somewhat shy in content, what is here is polished to a mirror shine. The graphics are stylish without being overbearing, and the animation is top quality. The reason why I am willing to give this game a ten, however, is because of the commitment I&apos;ve seen on the part of HiRez. They are not a publishing company, they are not run by businessmen. They are an independent studio that loves their game, and has had an excellent dialog with their playerbase throughout all phases of beta. HiRez has already promised many additions to the gameplay- and I do not see those as empty promises.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=745229">Expand</a></span>

Sure there are plenty of 3rd person shooters out there but innovative additions such as the jet pack, moveable turrets, cloaking devices and nukes add a refreshing element to a generally stale genre. The graphics are fresh and gameplay speed is quick and generally lagless. This game truly optimizes the Unreal engine. Good work Hi-Rez!</span>

Were working as a team instead of a lone wolf gives you the full experience this game was ment to give. When you first play Global agenda you will be drawn into the fresh colors, Detailed character&apos;s and the fun of the game. As you progress you will hopefully join a agency, this adds a new level to the game play. Agencys are like guilds, However each agency can choose to battle on the Hex maps. AvA is the bright point of GA, Highly competitive and each action you take could crush another faction, or assist. Alot of people complain about limited content, Hi-Rez has made the AvA &quot;free&quot; till the 1st of April and might extend it. They have large content patches already slated for release over the next few weeks, new maps, new AvA toys, and alot more. Give this game a chance and I think you will be very surprised how good it can be.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=745925">Expand</a></span>

After years of playing planetside, i can not remember doing a single quest, chasing down one random piece of loot, or feeling that i must reach the &quot;End Game&quot; before i can really enjoy or flaunt my achievements. GA is terrifying for investors. Not a single tried and true fantasy element anywhere. GA is new. It forces the player to gain skill, not skill up. yes, after level 30 (written 2/28/2010) your only gaining new armor looks and paint. To compare this to planetside, leveling gave you access to more equipment and abilities at once, and new armor looks that changes its paint patterns. The 4 man dungeons are kind of bland after the 20ith or so romp through. But, when was the last time you had to actively dodge and aim at what you wanted to kill in an mmo setting? The over all feeling i get from GA is that it does not want to make large errors in development, or system shock players that do not play FPS or action games. Baby steps are what the developers are taking. They listen to the player base and are watching how the sales are doing at the moment. Announcements have already been made telling of new changes and added content. Also, the subscription is optional. A game that will update and change with an optional subscription is a good investment.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=746098">Expand</a></span>

I absolutly do not understand why someone is giving here a zero or 2 points. That&apos;s absolutly unworthy. MMO: Ok true to say, it is more a shooter than a MMO so the MMO part has not much to show of atm. But there will be a lot of quests out of dome city and more MMO to come. Balance: Well what to say about it? Just perfectly balanced. I must confess, i have never seen a pvp game so dramatically based on teamplay which is so balanced like Global Agenda. Just every class is able to be the masterclass in one specific situation but to win the map you have to work together, solosnipering one person is absolutly ineffectivly etc. Story: Ok, the story is not that good, but what do you want to expect from a game in this genre where nerlay everything was used somewhere else? PvE: It&apos;s ok, It&apos;s not the mainfeature, it&apos;s not that boring but not really interessting, but as it is not the mainpart of the game that&apos;s absolutly ok. And yes, it&apos;s hard, even when you hit lvl 30/50. AvA: Just awesome. 10 vs 10 is maybe not what you expect to be an MMO, but it is really challenging and you have to think about: Do I take a recon for the last slot or better a medic? It is all tacticle choice. Tactics and strategies are also very important in the battles, you truly see which team has the better one. Nevertheless you can learn out of these matches and so it is easy to learn but hard to master. Agency/Guild: The management has been improved after release of patch 1.1 and all in all it could be bether but is functionally as it should be. Future Updates: Well I must say, that I have never seen a publisher working so close together with the community. nearly everything what was done by 1.1 was brought up by the community and the talk about these things is still present. Also when you say, ok content now is not worth 40 </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=746272">Expand</a></span>

Ataching different armours that you can only obtain in different levels only to the visual of the player, sounds a little restrictive and not that useful. After all you don&apos;t need an armour at all to play it. I do like to costumize my characters but the different armours and helmets should bring something more with it. The game is very interesting and chalenging and prepares you to expect great things. Stores yet to open in dome Cities makes you wonder what will they allow us to buy to gain a little advantage or a little small difference in combat skills. I know this game will become absolutelly awsome thought is not there yet. I really hope the developers continue adding caracteristics and chalenging objectives after listening to the users. More skills are needed after level 30 and maybe different weapons should be allowed to purchase even if you needed to spend some addicional Dollars just to make a little but significant difference. Costumizing your character cannot be only based on your &quot;looks&quot; and high levels must be allowed to purchase or obtain something &quot;more&quot; even if it costs a few extra dollars and not only give you prestige. However the game is awsome and highly entretaining. The maps are huge and some of them are really beautiful. Some details deserve to be noticed and are really master pieces of design and inteligence. The discussion about if this is a FPS or MMO becomest totally irrelevant given the fact that this shows a very interesting compromise between types although I understand that some hard core adepts may find it disapointing. What is important is that this game is already very good and entretaining and is yet to achieve its highest point. I foresee that in less than 3 month most of the users, including me will rate this game like 10. We shall see.

The only game you&apos;ll ever need. They have thought of everything, and in a way that no one has before. Not to mention that they have created a software system that allows for worldwide play, seemlessly, with massive content updates continually shaping this from the awesome pvp style third person shooter &quot;though it plays just like a FPS without wondering where you are actually standing&quot; more in to the MMO format that MMORPG players are looking for. As a shooter alone, this game is TF2 on highly addictive crack supplements. Add in the fact that Hi-Rez is adding new MMO style content bi-monthly, the game that Global Agenda shapes up in to is going to be the one everyone else is looking for too.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=747266">Expand</a></span>

First of and for most, add more world maps like Sonoran Desert Zone, a lot more, at the very least, 25 more, 55 if you really want to make the game worth wild.<br>2. Raise the level cap to 80 to 120, adding more skills.<br>3. More armors, more weapons, more well, every thing.<br>4. NPC that actual speak, instead of having to read, Live played this and haven&apos;t read on mission&apos;s info just clicked accept and followed to the area marked on the map, I&apos;d stay and listen to what the NPC said if the spoke.<br>5. until above is added, lower the price from $20 to $10 and more then cut the prices of bonus packs or triple the length of they last.<br>6. More crafting.<br>7. more missions then just shoot your way to the last room and kill some bid dud, some boss.<br>8. Add more missions to Sonoran Desert, at the very least, 15 more, though 25 is a better number.<br>9. The ability to earn agent points with out having to spend real money.<br><br>What would make the game better but is not completely needed,<br>1. more classes.<br>2. vehicles or a whole new level of jetpacks.<br>3. more color choices, more shades of colors in the creation of your charr.<br>4. More hair choices.<br>5. Base creating that you only have to worry about NPCs attacking.<br>6. Zombies, that&apos;s nearly a requirement these days for games and I&apos;d love to shoot me some zombies in GA.<br><br><br>I haven&apos;t read to much into it but it sounds like this game is not even near done, though if it is, then you might as well stop now and throw it away and start over and only release it after you&apos;ve added what I&apos;ve said above.<br><br>I say, its worth playing for those first two weeks, after that, your just hanging on, hoping they release a HUGE patch, that&apos;s what I&apos;ll be doing, the game has enough potential to keep me waiting for something more but I&apos;ll wait to spend any money on this game until the nearly double the content this game currently has.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=1673122">Expand</a></span>

Everything about this game is at best average. Athough they advertise it as a MMO, everything is super instanced including the single hub town making it feel more like TF2 in space with a visual lobby. PvE content consists of tutorial zones, timed instances where higher difficulties yield better rewards for completion, and hourly raids which were survival against waves and then a boss. PvP matchmaking was really terrible and the gameplay was basically TF2 with less hats. No updates for over a year and then the devs sent out a survey email about a GA2, effectively killing the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=2828398">Expand</a></span>

Everything about the game being skill oriented is now a lie, its all about the weapons which require zero skill. They upgraded every weapon that had zero skill to use to being the best weapons. All of the previous, skill oriented, weapons in the game now no longer have meaning. In other words they made the weapons that require you to aim to be worthless (except the snipers) and the ones that do not require you to aim to be deadly. I hate to say this but they defined it as a &quot;player skill&quot; oriented game, this is no longer the case after the game went free to play.<br><br>Less than 100 players in any given channel at any given time does not make this an mmorpg/tps. The term MMORPG is defined by Richard Garriott (e.g. the terms creator) for ultima online as &quot;Allowing hundreds to thousands of players to connect in a single, persistent, world.&quot; Hi-rez defines it by storing stats/characters on their server. What other game, which was one of the first to do so, but didn&apos;t have hundreds of players in a channel? Any guesses? No? Well its Diablo 2, which is not defined as an mmog. In other words hi-rez lied about this genre, no more than 20 players at a time in any given instance can be in the same mission, and up to 99 in a single city/free roam channel, this is not hundreds, or thousands, it means it is put into a false genre.<br><br>There are better free games on the market, I paid 20 dollars for this game before it was free to play, there was almost no end game, just pvp end game, the same goes for now with one added end game raid zone and a new free roam/quest area. Big deal, its all broken gameplay mechanics developed by developers who have no idea how to fix it nor give a darn trying to. They are too focused on tribes ascend.<br><br>My advise, do not waste the money, do not waste the hard drive space, do not try, it ended up in failure. I can relate global agenda to another game people know, another game that failed miserably due to lack of developer support. This game was known as Hellgate: London. Hi-rez would have gone bankrupt a long time ago if they were not receiving funding from the state of Georgia just to sit around screwing up their own products. But hey its their call on what they want to destroy since it is their Intellectual Property.<br><br>I give this game a 1 out of 10 simply cause the graphics, albeit outdated, are still somewhat decent, everything else (including the company that made it) is garbage.<br><br>Note: This is coming from a high level player with several characters max level who has given the game a year and a half to shape up, it has barely progressed at all, and when it did progress it was in the wrong direction.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=1440281">Expand</a></span>

                                        <span> This game isn&apos;t an MMORPG, it is an FPS with a 3D lobby. For FPS alone I might give it a 6 or 7, but it cost me $50 when looking for a new MMO and really made me mad. Calling this game a MMO is just pure marketing misdirection and sites need to stop repeating it.</span>

I started playing when it went Free to play on steam as many people did and I ended up buying the &quot;elite&quot; version just a few days later. Its great because you get a unlimited and (mostly) unrestricted trial basically, the only restrictions are you cant trade (to prevent gold / item farming). The game is awesome, the graphics are great, the mechanics of flying with a jet pack in combat is great. Some people dont like the only other freely travel zone besides the &quot;Dome&quot; is the desert with mish that bring you from lvl 5-18 (out of 50). Honestly the things it has you do in the desert is really just the most elaborate tutorial ever! It makes you learn how to play your class solo before you go jump into PVP where it really matters. After the desert you can still do PVE mish in instances with 4 other people you go through the lvl and kill a boss and get rewards. Free players get no loot but get tokens, coins, and exp. Elite players (a one time $14 fee) get a item, double xp, double coins, and double tokens. So it speeds it up alot but you are never really required to get it. I got it because it is inexpensive and it makes the lvling go much faster and that to me is enjoyable. But what makes this game different is it has PVP starting at lvl 10 which, if your good at it (or score well), will level you faster than PVE matches. So while your enjoying the end game reward of PVP you are also leveling up to the max lvl 50. The only difference between a lvl 30 and 50 player is the kind of equipment you can equip. between level 1 and 30 you get 13 skill points and once you hit 30 your player is as &quot;buffed&quot; as it can be besides from armor. Overall its a great game that holds my interest since its basically all PVP. The PVP is almost EXACTLY that same as TF2 except it is much deeper. TF2 was very easy and shallow, this game is deeper, it has 100% more strategy, and for me more incentive to play. Think of TF2, better looking, with harder PVP, more maps and options, and that in between matches you get to walk around, talk to other ppl, buy and sell items (from NPC or other players if your elite) dye your armor, and just customize your play style.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=1685380">Expand</a></span>

You&apos;re either forced to sit in a dome world with nothing to do or you&apos;re in an instance doing pvp...there is nothing else to do. Apparently the developers wanted to hurry up and get the game out and then start working on the stuff that will hopefully keep people playing. It was a poor strategy because this game needs a lot more than just a &apos;few tweeks&apos; here and there...it needs a major overhaul if it expects people to play this game for months and not get extremely bored with it...and that&apos;s with the content they want you to pay for monthly. I&apos;m really disappointed, especially with all the hype that surrounded the game.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=746674">Expand</a></span>

You will find all of the things you expect to be standard in an MMO; stats, skills, equipment, armour and helmets (Which do nothing but make you look good in GA) etc, however there are a few different and awkward things to get used to, such as the mailing system (Used for trading as there is currently no trading system.) PvP is rather bland, PvE is boring. PvP with an astounding 10 versus 10 combat featuring game-modes that require you to capture / defend a point, or play game-modes that are rip-offs straight from team-fortress 2, &apos;push the cart&apos; being one of them and the player class system being the other. PvE is the worst of the lot. The AI is stupid and does not provide a challenge to your 4-man team. The bosses at the end are also VERY stupid and easily destroyed. There are no Story missions or free-roam or anything alike. You&apos;re confined to the Dome city, re-doing PvP missions and PvE missions for the sake of spending time. AvA (WHICH YOU NOW HAVE TO PAY FOR!) is just like PvP. 10 versus 10 but with around 4 extra maps and no extra game-modes. Yup, you&apos;re going to be capturing a point again, much like in PvP. The graphics use the Unreal engine, and they are pretty good, still lagging behind a few years but it&apos;s not exactly bad nor ground-breaking, but they&apos;re &apos;nice&apos;. I can play with 50 - 60 average fps with a 2.8 Ghz Intel 2 duo core and an Nvidia 9600 GT. Controls and such are fluid, high pings have no effect on the gameplay which is quite surprising and a nice &apos;feature&apos;. This game was released with barely anything finished for 35 pounds, a complete rip off; only now are they starting to pull their socks up and add some of the things that should be standard to an MMO. All in all, 6/10. Thanks for reading.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=747494">Expand</a></span>

Hi-Rez Studios is extremely dedicated to making a great game that will not only make them money, but that will satisfy us customers, a rare trait today. At first GA was supposed to be subscription based to unlock the entire game. Hi-Rez didn&apos;t charge the subscription until the big update (Sandstorm) was available. Hi-Rez felt it unfair to charge extra for GA in its current state because the game didn&apos;t have the content that players expected (A bold move for Hi-Rez). Then Hi-Rez, being dedicated to their fans, released a survey asking what payment plan people prefer. Pay to play? Micro transactions? Buy once and then pay for expansions? Turns out people, myself included, voted for the buy once option. Hi-Rez listened and made the adjustments. So far Hi-Rez has a made a solid game, produced many patches, released big updates (other than just Sandstorm), and has never charged anymore than the original price. Hi-Rez is attempting to make this method work much like Guild Wars. The consumer buys the game and plays it. There are also options to buy &quot;boosts&quot; that will boost the amount of rewards you earn after battle (xp, money, tokens).<br><br>I&apos;ve said so much about the developer, but it should be understood that the game itself is also very good. The shooting mechanics aren&apos;t what you&apos;ll find in other shooters simply because Hi-Rez wanted a balance between the skill of a player and the rpg, number crunching aspect of the player&apos;s character. Amazing reload animations aren&apos;t extremely important because it&apos;s third person and not a part of the action (ammo is reliant on energy not rounds of bullets). However, movement animations are great and everything is smooth and natural feeling.<br><br>Whether the game is a true persistent mmo or not doesn&apos;t matter. You can trade with people, play with people, and talk with people. It has all the social aspects of a traditional mmo. There is crafting, pve coop missions, a pve story (included with Sandstorm update), pvp, and Agency vs Agency pvp. The game seems limiting in it&apos;s gameplay modes, but once explored there is a lot to do. Hi-Rez also released more variety with each update which seems to come every couple of months.<br><br>The critics where too hard on this game. Seems some of them where a little butt hurt that a brand new developer could stand in the ranks of legends. But I will say that Global Agenda is so much more than when it first arrived. Elements that where shallow have now been expanded. Elements that were missing have now been implemented. Some elements have even been removed and reinserted with a whole new working. It seems Hi-Rez is accomplishing everything they set out to do with Global Agenda no matter how much effort and time it takes. Some developers understand this. Most don&apos;t.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=1402737">Expand</a></span>

However, the $15 dollar sub. is in no way worth the money, so I would only play it as any other FPS. Sad I was really looking forward to this game. Now I am angry I payed full retail price for this crap.</span>

This is not an RPG this is not an MMO this is not a FPS, it is a little bit of all those.  If you&apos;d stop trying to define what the game is and how it doesn&apos;t fit those categories you&apos;d probably have more fun with the game.<br><br>And Third...  Go try it if you like team based FPS games with some light RPG/Adventure/Customization elements.  It&apos;s FREE!!!!!<br><br>The main focus of this game seems to be team based combat.  There are more than enough variation of team vs all and team vs team combat that it doesn&apos;t matter what you like, you should be able to find something here.  The match making is easy and painless.  You can venture around while waiting for your game to queue, which I&apos;ve never had to wait more than a few minutes.<br><br>There are light RPG elements.  You can do some basic customizations with &quot;skill points&quot;, kind of like how WOW does it.  You can reassign these points at any time in the normal world, but in missions you can&apos;t at all.  This is nice because unlike other games, if you feel you&apos;d rather take back a point or reassign it other places, you can without penalty.  This allows you to always be playing a character you don&apos;t regret.<br><br>There is armor, weapons, customizations, etc.  There is enough stuff so that you aren&apos;t the same as everyone else, but it&apos;s just like all the other MMO type games out there, you will look like most people.  The nice thing I like here is that your armor and how you look is completely seperate.  So if you really like one &quot;outfit/suite/Helmet&quot; you don&apos;t have to give it up to have better armor.  I always hated that in other games when I had to give up a look I liked so that I could survive.<br><br>Jetpacks make it easy to travel.  Which is nice that you don&apos;t have to buy the pack<br><br>Adventure.  This isn&apos;t WOW or anything else like that.  The adventure is pretty linear, and you don&apos;t have to do it.  It&apos;s really only there for people that care about storylines and adventuring.  Again, you don&apos;t have to do this part, but if you do you&apos;ll get &quot;free&quot; armor/weapons/items.<br><br>Combat is nothing really new, which ISN&apos;T A BAD THING.  It takes most of what everyone (including the developers previous games &quot;Tribes&quot;) did that worked and used it again.  It&apos;s fun to play if you like team based FPS action.<br><br>There isn&apos;t anything wrong with this game.  Everything they do, they do it well.  It&apos;s really more about whether or not you like this type of game.  And since it&apos;s FREE you don&apos;t have any reason to not go and try it.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=1600291">Expand</a></span>

The developers&apos; motto is, apparantly, &quot;a minute to learn, a lifetime to master&quot;, and they&apos;ve gone a long way to achieving this in Global Agenda; if you enjoyed Tribes, TF2 or Planetside, I think you&apos;re likely to enjoy this.</span>

When I play online games, it&apos;s nice to be able to see what servers are available to join, what the average ping is and the ability to choose what pvp mission I want to do. Even though global agenda used to seperate their pvp, it was based by level, so it sucked then, and it still sucks now with not being able to choose what mission you would like to play. TL;DR The gameplay is amazing, but there is lack of content and the pvp is lacking.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=745227">Expand</a></span>

It suffers and identity crisis ecause the game markets itself and an MMOFPS, but it&apos;s neither on in particular. An MMO relies on consistent content to keep the players occupied, Global Agenda doesn&apos;t have very much content and the stuff that&apos;s there is very lacking. Now an FPS doesn&apos;t rely as much on content, but rather on the mechanics and dynamis of a map, Global Agenda delivers with the mechanics, but nto with the dynamics of the maps. It&apos;s a very solid platform for the game, but overall this game is not worth shelling out 49.99 for and 12 bucks a month after early March for access to the AvA because AvA is also very incomplete. It&apos;s not that the game is buggy, but there&apos;s hardly any content and this game isn&apos;t an MMO or even a good game to justify paying for it. I predict this game will have a diehard, small player base in 3-6 months and nothing else. Expect this game to turn into a F2P within a year if Hi-rez doesn&apos;t get their act together.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=745586">Expand</a></span>

Its a plus for me, I might pay if they have larger battles. -Well over +40 hours of gameplay and worth the 50 dollars if this is the type of game you like, fast paced, FPS, over the top weapons.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=745722">Expand</a></span>

If you have been running around in the dome city, you have probably seen a lot of stores that haven&apos;t opened yet. Once these are open, more content is revealed. Secondly, the game itself might not yet be worth all the 50 $/</span>

ALthough pvp mayh be some what enjoyable at times, it lacks a good pvp user interface, maps are unchoosable in pvp, and game types either. Armor buying is level based, and is only bought for looks and nothing else. The upgrades are pretty much useless, and will not help in combat, and the main control over how well you play this game is based of how high level you are (leveling tree bonuses) and time spent playing which is just like any ordinary game. The content is severely lacking, and the only rpg elements that i can see off is grinding for &quot;better&quot; looking armor, and walking around in an uninteresting dome, which is useless overall. The classes are very similar to that of team fortress with a few classes fused into one. The best aspect of the game, and the majority of the content lies within the Pvp which i enjoyed and still play occasionally. A v A is boring, overpriced, and a dumb version of clan matches for which you have to pay about as much as world of warcraft. The only way the score will go up is if major content patches are going to be released within next 1-2 months. Otherwise very overpriced 50$ is way to much and a teamfortress 19.99 would suffice this games actual gameplay. I believe Hi rez did a pretty well job, but nothing new other then a mediocre third person shooter) and the msot i can even consider giving this is a 6.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=745736">Expand</a></span>

This game isn&apos;t nearly as big-budget as triple-A titles, but it makes up for it by being, GASP, fun! Everything about this game is just plain fun. It is combines good old-fashioned shooter mechanics with a dose of RPG love and the result is simply incredible. BUY IT.</span>

The game is hardly finished, with a lot of the content still missing. It has no long term appeal, apart from the Conquest mode, which in itself really isn&apos;t worth &#xA3;10 / month. It also has no repetitiveness appeal, you do the same thing over and over, until you finally grind your way up to 50, upon doing so, you are left with nothing to do but AvA (Alliance v Alliance) or PvP, which loses its appeal after a while as well. Hi-Rez have taken a chance, and if they don&apos;t pull their act together within the next couple of months, I think the game could have the same fate, like some of the other games that have tried to mix genres. I do believe if Hi-Rez pulls their act together, and releases the other 50% of the content before everyone gets bored of the long and painful grind, there could be a lot more to do, and my rating would improve. But given the circumstances, I think 5/10 is sufficient. Mostly due to the fact that they should have pushed the games launch back, and finished it before releasing. Another big downside is that it is on Steam, and a lot of the gaming community, that don&apos;t have &quot;awesome&quot; computers, will not be-able to run steam in the background, and play GA at the same time. There is also the fact that the game is very unstable and crashes all the time, for nearly 70% of the people who play it. All in all, not a bad try, but finish the game! 5/10</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=745751">Expand</a></span>

Global Agenda (GA) has tried something very much different in attempting to call itself a &apos;MMO&apos;. As most people have said, as will I, there is still quite a good amount of content missing, and the game can get a bit repetitive. The 4 classes (Robotics, Medics, Recons &amp; Assualts) all have talent tree which have a nice appearence, but depending on your class can prove to be...not as important.. The base idea for the game is unique in its designs for each PvE map, with varying map bosses and random enemy placement on the maps, but at the moment, GA shines quite nicely in its PvP. Its a bit shoddy that you can&apos;t choose which type of gametype you want to play, but you get into it and have fun. Right now, the whole Conquest deal is something that really is not worth the money, given that Hirez will hopefully give a patch to fix everything up. I enjoy the game to play occasionally and it gets fun when your in a agency and you have others to play with. You will find many hours dedicated to this game if you find the right agencies and people, but there is definatly room for improvement. I hope my review has given a small insight to this game if you are wondering on buying it. I personally think it is worth the buy, but its your money, and if you feel like gambiling it in a game that will either go north or south, I think its worth it. </span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=745872">Expand</a></span>

AvA is a little slow but that doesn&apos;t mean its no good. Even tho the subscription is for AvA I want to give them money because I know they will create something Ive been longing for! I recommend it.</span>

It&apos;s got some nifty gear and a skill tree you level. It&apos;s massively multiplayer. It&apos;s not bad at any of them, but I found I got bored with attacking the same bunch of rather generic robot factories over and over. Save your money.</span>

The foundation of the game is rock solid: classes are balanced, gameplay is practically bug-free, hackers and exploiters are dealt with quickly, and the game can be a lot of fun to play. That being said, the existing content is fatally anemic. There just isn&apos;t that much to see and do that you don&apos;t get out of Team Fortress 2 at 1/3rd the price. Calling it an &quot;MMO&quot; is misleading -- it has elements of an MMO like persistent characters, leveling, and a basic item system, but that&apos;s pretty much where the MMO begins and ends. This game has the potential to grow into something amazing, but it isn&apos;t there yet.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=746194">Expand</a></span>

Buying the game at full retail price without subscription gives you a fairly decent team based shooter with several typical game types (and pretty obviously pulled right from TF2), but probably not something worth playing for a long time when there are so many alternatives out there. The subscription fee buys you a persistent strategic world, clan based game. Unfortunately, this aspect of the game is lacking to the point that many gamers are not going to see it as worthwhile, again in light of the alternatives available in the MMO market. At this point, the subscription fee actually looks like it would simply grant me access to more of the traditional MMO grind without really making the core game any more fun to play. So, the game ends up providing a fair PvP without subscription, but a poor, unfinished MMO experience with subscription. As an avid gamer, I appreciate the efforts that HiRez have made to get customer feedback and &quot;earn the subscription&quot; of their customers, but I am afraid that this execution of their planned business model has fallen short, and I don&apos;t think the game will get a second chance to succeed. In the end, they will likely need to concede that the game does not provide the type of value that justifies a monthly subscription, and change their payment model.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=746400">Expand</a></span>

Hell, only recently they patched in city wide chat.... which is something that usually seen first in a mmo. The game is fun at the begginning but gets boring after a few hours. Very repetative. The only thing going for it is that it&apos;s fairly balanced when it comes to combat. Devs are promising more weapons and gadgets, etc just like Planetside did for years to make sure that a few suckers out there keep subscribing while waiting. Carrot on a stick if you will. This game will be ready in a few years. Then it will be worth the subscription cost.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=747226">Expand</a></span>

I have been playing since beta and they have made so many great changes. For those who say that it lacks material, they better get ready to eat their words. HiRez is constantly pushing themselves to get what the COMMUNITY wants, and boy are they dedicated. It has been almost two months since the game came out and they were generous enough to let us play the full game without the subscription. I think that is a real sign that they care about their customers. They&apos;re not going to pick at your wallets like Activision, who is seriously constantly wasting people&apos;s time with their ridiculously priced map packs. Global Agenda is simply fun. It&apos;s balanced and extremely addicting. Give this game a few months, and can guarantee that this game will filled with content. Just show them that you support what they&apos;re trying to do and buy the game. You won&apos;t be disappointed.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=747241">Expand</a></span>

The majority of the players knew this before the game was officially released, unfinished. The &quot;PvP&quot; gameplay is incredibly compelling, extremely fast and rather simplified. &quot;PvE&quot; content is attractive too. I _could_ be on it more than I should but I always feel disappointed by the game. While their is room to alter your character&apos;s performance and appearance - personalization - this always suspects balance issues. The balancing in Global Agenda is probably right in it&apos;s own _design_ but personally I think it&apos;s wrong in it&apos;s own design because it&apos;s own &quot;liquid balance&quot; (Skill Tree + Upgrades) is wrong. It is, to me, the Skill Tree causing alot of flaws in the game. I still do allow for personalization and specialization but the super-buffs of the Skill Tree effectively chang the game from competative gameplay to competative failplay: You can fight hard, extremely hard, and lose hard and you may think &quot;Why?&quot;. I dispise the Skill Tree because I know at the beginning without them the game was more enjoyable for me. 5/10 - It&apos;s good but not GREAT, yet, and if Hi-Rez were to change things from wrong to right or wrong to more wrong; this could determine Hi-Rez&apos;s fate for the game. Patch 1.3 is due. There&apos;s alot of new stuff, though maybe excessive and unnecessary additions.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=747243">Expand</a></span>

First thoughts: The detail is amazing, that being said don&apos;t cut me short. The game has good graphics much better then other mmos or equivalent shooters and with that I was incredibly surprised by the lack of lag. This game is fast paced and addictive. I&apos;ve seen several posts stating this is not an rpg at all because its not traditional. You&apos;re right, there&apos;s no elves or dwarves. That being said there are classes which are very specialized in the fact that they all have interesting skills and GAME-CHANGING elements. Team-work is key and the unique combination of skills, weapon load outs, and player chosen talents is what really makes play dynamic. Customization in this game may just be the most custom I have seen while still retaining both gameplay and the concept of gear through upgrades. This game is addictive, my guess is the people with 0-3s are those that just got too butt-hurt from getting ganked by recons like a scrub.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=747306">Expand</a></span>

On the flip side if you&apos;re someone who steers more towards the slower paced nature of MMOs this my not be for you. This is a game about skill, grinding will not net you any victories over anyone, not even people half your level. This is a game that very much rewards your ability over time spent in-game, while having the higher level Agent will net you advantages, it&apos;s not going to stop someone half your level from taking you out. I haven&apos;t even touched the AvA stuff yet and I&apos;m already in love with this beast, best $40 I&apos;ve spent in a looooong time.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=747527">Expand</a></span>

What it sets out to do, it does well. The graphics are solid, controls are seamless with the integration of a jetpack, and the gameplay is addicting. What this game does so well is reward you for your skill at your class. Gear and Levels, while important, are not as crucial to your success as your reactions, aiming and use of skills in real time combat. For those WoW and mmorpg players looking for a change of pace from the Gear &gt; Skill, I can speak from experience that this game is it.
<br>
<br>The game does have its flaws. Most of the content is instanced, with cities and other hubs being areas where you find a group to PvP, PvE and AvA (Think PlanetSide in that you are fighting for territory with other &quot;Guilds&quot;). You will enjoy this game far more if you have a few friends to run &quot;dungeons&quot; and quest. GA does have a nice Team finder in the veins of WoW&apos;s random dungeon and random battleground finder.
<br>
<br>If you are looking for a change of pace game this is it. The content has been vastly updated in recent months and the game no longer requires a monthly subscription to enjoy all content. At just $39 (cheaper if you can get a steam deal or promotion code) this game will provide plenty of enterainment, especially if you play it with some friends.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=1365399">Expand</a></span>

This game genre is a very new with several contenders falling from the race such as All points bulletin. Global Agenda attempts and succeeds where others fail, by combining elements of FPS games and RPG&apos;s. This is where it comes into conflict with many players, as FPS players think that it is going and should be faster pace, with things like headshots implemented. On the other hand RPG players may find the features in this game to random, relying more on the players skill than mastering the abilities. If you get into the dramatically different (and refreshing) gameplay, you will find that it is a very immersive game, perhaps the only problem is the clear lack of a story, but this is slowly being implemented with the new expansions. The first one Sandstorm introduced a open world area, with missions and a background story to boot. Missions can be divided into two types PvE (player vs AI opponents, similar to dungeons or wave based defenses) or the classic shooter PvP (player vs player). PvE, while playing a large part, tends to take a backseat to the amazing PvP. For the first 29 levels the game, slowly intorduces you into each type of mission, but once you hit level 30, the game takes a change. AvA (agency vs agency) is another addition to the PvP world, similar to other MMO&apos;s guild vs guild. Agencies fight over control of territories on a board (the territories are called hexes) and at the end of the session of the AvA whichever agency has the most points win. There is much more depth to the game, but that would make this review too long.<br>	The classes in this game consist of four types, Assault, Robotics, Medic, and Recon. When the game first came out there was and definite imbalance in the number of classes. Each class has the option to spec out several different ways. Assault for example, can focus on, AoE&apos;s, tanking, or ranged damage. This game many times has been likened to TF2 in the role of the classes, and this is true to some extent. Assaults are the, heavies, soldiers and demomen. Medics act as more of the original team fortress medic, being able to poison opponents, and heal friends. Robotics fills the role of engineer. Recons take the spy, sniper and scout role. Now that time has past for the most part there is a reasonable balance of classes.<br>	In the end Global Agenda is a new game type that people should try before buying, luckily there is a free trial that lets you play to level fifteen. If you find it to your liking, then buy the full game as you will fall in love with it. This game remains one of my favourite and is by far one of the most innovative.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=1462096">Expand</a></span>

But I would be happy w/ this purchase if I would have paid the full $29.99.  It&apos;s an intense shooter w/ various classes that are all extremely important to the game.  The action is great.  It has a variety of things you can do and is deep.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=1481643">Expand</a></span>

Many lag and bug issues have been resolved since beta and sub versions, and though many remain, the dev team hirez is pretty well dedicated to resolving them on a regular basis.  They just opened the micro pay system which isn&apos;t very elaborate yet, but they are clearly trying to figure out a lean model by which to start seeing profits for further dev of this and the studio&apos;s tribes reboot.  Most importantly, it is not pay to win.  Cash can be spent to speed up leveling a bit, or for visual flair.  The game has a lot of options, though not a lot of visual variety (or rare flair yet, but give them time to cycle new stuff in) and a few different builds for each class which one can experiment with.  Aside from co op pve and pvp modes, most often overlook the SOLO PVE mode, which is hugely challenging in the upper levels.  Don&apos;t listen to any of the straight negative reviews on here, all the red ones are trolls and people who gave the game 20 minutes and gave up cuz they are f2p &apos;gurus&apos; or something.  Expect bugs, it&apos;s still being updated.  Expect a real challenge, and a co-op that requires your teammates to play well.  Ignore the random parties, and make some friends, it will make all the difference.  If you all play your roles as teammates correctly the payoff is a much faster, efficient and less deadly mission series ripe with diverse mob spawns and industrial crushing devices.  Honestly give this game a try, the total tally is 241 positive to 36 negative user reviews.  Trust the ones who put in 200 hours and love it.  This game is the business.</span><span class="blurb_etc">&#x2026;</span> <a rel="nofollow" class="toggle_expand_collapse toggle_expand" href="/game/pc/global-agenda/user-reviews?user_review_id=1664121">Expand</a></span>
